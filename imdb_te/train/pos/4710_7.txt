Go to funniest movies, there are some time and energy worth. But with a recent resurgence of horrific parodies like Date Movie and The Combos, there is a fresh air's breath to come back to the real funny parade like Johnny Dangerous. <br /> <br /> When the mother does not end his medical problems, he works for a little Johnny Mob. Any blows are the range of deceit, most of which work, however, occasionally slipping. But the American language (jealousy, at least) is a brother with a foreign gangster, D.A who can not work with an opponent gangster (... once!) To shoot his mouth. Zaheen does not get Djouley, and Johnny is a young man who is hot for his love. <br /> <br /> Many laughs that the viewer is skewed by his gangster-film cliche. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect by a long shot, but it's perfect for a smile on bad days.
