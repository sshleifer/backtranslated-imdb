<br /> <br /> Good story (s): The procedure for murder is a mysterious castle to get some mysteries. Charles's latest production performance, horror novelist Charles Hillier, (Denham Eliot) and his wife Alice, (Jonah Dunnham) is thrilled by the story, centered around a serial stranger called Dominic, after a series of strange accidents and experiences at home, that Charles has come into my life and is chasing him and his wife, which is probably one of the best entries in the movie. The scenes with the fictional character are virtually gorgeous The secret around him is the classic creep out, the classic moment is the psychiatrist killing in the office, which is all the time for the spirit of all time. <br /> <br /> The relaxation, flares, lightning, lightning, A lightning-friendly technique, compatible with both, a new home and wife, John Reid, (Christopher Lee) Jane are my daughter (Chloe Franks) and a former school teacher, Anne Norton, (neri Don Porter) is hired, he is away from the business. John gradually begins to loosen a dark mystery from Jane's past, which John has seriously rejected. When she learned the true nature of what happened, it was so bad that she thought it was her achievement. With the biggest twist of the tight storyline and the stories, this is a very pleasant entry. The mystery of the family is amazing, with small amounts clue up here and there, and the final revelation is well nerve-friction. <br /> The Bad Story (s): The memories of his lost love, Philip Grayson, (Peter Cushing) and his girlfriend Neville Rogers (Jaws Auckland) both have a woman statue in a wax museum, As they take on their lives, they find a surprising mystery about the haunting museum. Here is a chic enclosure, and it offers no need to spend time in the wax museum, which are always creepy. This is no exception, and it is very helpful with the help of fluorescent lighting on the sculptors. A dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense, but ultimately it is killed with slow pace. The events take a long time to get out, and spend more time expressing. It can also be seen coming from a mile and increases until the end of a shock. That's really a bit less of this. <br /> <br /> The soft flute horror film actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwy) is disturbed by the lack of realism on the set. Go on his new image, buy a new vampire dress from a special store. The costume is soon to be vampire, and the crazy goes with actor Carla (Ingrid Pitt) and other vampire acts at home. Cause the elusive clock, he does everything he can to prove it's just his imagination. This is a very good place, and there is plenty of opportunity for some good fears, but many of the reasons are drowning. First, it's very goofy for own good. At the end of the story is the perfect example of the twist, it's not really a shock, and it's just overdone so just plain comes across the silly. There are some scenes that scares or scares that are just sitting on a bore. <br /> <br /> Final Verdict: There are some minor issues scattered through the story of a very good picture of the movie, a story that offers less than a definite but still viewable image. <br /> <br /> Rate-PG-13: Violence
