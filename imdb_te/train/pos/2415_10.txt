I'm totally addicted to this show. I can not wait for a week to watch the next show. It is a great story and it has the best actors and actresses in the show. Even though I'm not home, I'll tune it every week, I've always set my VCR for my Table Emperor's wish. Best Actor at Simon Rex Show. It's breathtaking and wonderful. I believe this performance should be in the air and I believe everyone should tune in to see. I saw the first episode and in reality I was not going to see it but I was watching one day and this was because I decided to watch it and I loved it and this is my favorite show right now. I really mean.
