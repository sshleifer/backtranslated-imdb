<br /> It is not an ideal film, it shows the life of life or life, or the main story takes place in the 60s and 70s. The letters are good but there are some "dark" sides that you believe are real people. The greatest film life with great stars is not funny all the time, but you can get pleasure with "fire and passion" as you say the main character tenacity.
