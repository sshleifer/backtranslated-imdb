I had to give this picture a 10 because it's thrown at a lot of black audiences to make it wrong. The film is damaged by all video satire clips and has left gangsters, rappers and foul language. It examines many relationships with doctors, African Americans and African American male / female romantic relationships at a completely new and refreshing level. I was very impressed with the pictures of lighthead comedy carefully combined with pretty tough and heavy issues. The film will be happy and happy at the same time. I also saw at the Boston Film Festival. It's AMC Loews is aired on Boston and I will make this film a bigger audience. <br /> <br /> If two people (and everyone) prefer this movie - where there is enough SMART to keep the industry there. <br /> <br /> Your doctor, resident, and a medical student is an old student , A doctor sibling, a family member or a great doctor - they love this movie too. The movie was praised by doctors, residents and medical students who viewed the film, and it has played a residency and practice in a realistic way of life. Dennis Cooper is fully immunized in her home - so he definitely applied his knowledge / experience to the film and was very clear.
