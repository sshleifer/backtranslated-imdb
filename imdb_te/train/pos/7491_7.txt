Years ago, I found a "bargain bin" copy of this movie for a buck or two. In many ways, when it was redesigned in 1933, this was really a "poverty line" studio, a cheaply built movie by Majestic. <br /> <br /> Though it is derivative of the film, it is still good to watch and provides some surprising facts. <br /> While this story is in a very German town, recent deaths seem to be the work of vampires! Adding this contact is Dwight Frey. He portrayed Renfield in Dracula, where he is quite similar - though he still plays a more unhappy act. In this case, he was engaged with his pet bats and began to blame him for his death. The film makes a good job of providing some "red herring" (i.e., false leads), and Frey is not responsible, but an intellectual figure that does not take a genius to figure out WHO and why he is waking up. Furthermore, while the product has little money, it is still good actors of the day - Lionel Atvil and Melvin Douglas - and Universal Studios Sits at Night (when they filmed for the day). As a result, the image was pretty good, but I thought I'd usually be fiery - it was not mistaken for the movie. I have seen more movies in IMDb and I have come to see that her characters are not deep - she's always acted as "hard lady" and given a little new in each picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic and valuable price for fans of all the old horror movies. People who are not fans of the genre, it's probably pretty skip-able.
