This film is very strange and very funny. All of the actors are real and very odd. <br /> <br /> The entire "look" of the film is different, dreamy and bleached, which is the space of all the elements, I mean, you called "main" but I liked it. This is something I've seen before. . . Unexpected, unusual places with unnatural rhythm and punched lines. The kids are hearty goofy (and small), they can not help you but they seem to be. In other words, they are far from younger "Hollywood" versions. <br /> This is good for me.
