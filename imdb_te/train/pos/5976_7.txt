Trick or Treat, Quicky Review revolves around the culture of heavy-metal and horror films of this embodied romance of 80's - I love two things. So, as you guess, this film appealed to me pretty easily. Os Osbourne plays the role of a preacher. <br /> <br /> The film is about an unpopular high school youth, like all the losses, "bad" heavy metal in the world. His favorite stepped dead will die and, moreover, was miraculously resurrected - playing his latest unreleased album. <br /> <br /> The evening was pretty cheese, but did you know? It has got a surprising number of good features. Good acting (including Jean Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very short nudity, good atmosphere ... It's a really good horror film. But it's really good music. Ionic, huh? Well, this "Uber-bad" metal guy is one of the worst, high pitches, wailing, Motley crew rejects the planet - and "metal" putrid 80's slightly more than the pop / hair metal. He's hitting all the clich√©s here, looking like pointless, from scratch around like a gay fairy, "Rock and Roll !!!" King Diamond is in a high pitch enough to make the rach. From that outrageous musical representation, it's really good. <br /> <br />
