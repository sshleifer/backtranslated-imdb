Atlantis is better than I expected. This is a good story than some of the other high-profile films in some ways. The film has demanded a solid focus at times. It's a great image for all ages. I saw that some of the young players imagined comedy but an adventure came. I'm tired of everyone's extreme ridiculous endless procession. Many of these children seemed unusually ridiculous. Shortly after, everyone looked at Atlantis.
