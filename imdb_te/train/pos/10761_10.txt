My roommate bought this documentary and invited me to see it. She had heard a lot about China and about 9/11 and wanted to know the cold truth and wanted to tell her more after her documentary. <br /> <br /> On September 11th, I am very grateful to see this documentary. We are where we are and what we are doing when we hear what we all remember, we all think of some questions: "Why?", "How?", "What's up?" "Oh, my god!" Almost all Americans are grateful to the brave and police who risk their lives to save others. But I do not think we really think what they really did. In fact it can not be a documentary about 9/11, the cameraman is just shooting a normal day job and having a couple blocks from global merchant centers and everything, outside and tape. <br /> I thought on September 11th "This is okay, police and firefighters get the survivors". To be honest, I thought I was in an accident, was shifted from my junior high school and gym and ready to go to my science class. Someone came to the locker room when someone called "some of the bombs in New York," we were all dressed quickly and we went to our classes when we were burning on TV in the first class. Only 15 seconds later, we know that other World Trade Center is directly involved in the Second World Flight crash and it is no accident. A few minutes later, we heard about the Pentagon and the plane that went to Chicago remained there but was shot. Many thoughts walked through our heads and "what are you doing to fire and police?" I'm thinking. <br /> <br /> The first tower collapses, we know, many lives are now gone, the second tower collapses, things will never last forever. The firewall in this documentary showed courage, chaos and strength, real raw human emotions. They do not know what to do, they just have spots like other people in the dome. They heard things fallen on the floor from the windows jumping on the windows. And here is a classroom that I've seen all of the things to happen on TV. I was amazed at the film and went to New York and tell how grateful all Americans are for their help. They feel I'm doing their job, but they do more, they're the leader. On September 11th, every weekday, they dug to find out what they did not exist and they were praying and praying. <br /> <br /> She crying for my room and agreed to her for the first time at these attacks. She came to see the truth about what happened on that tragic day. She "why?" Asked. I do not know what I say, it will remove my heart. One of the fighter's said in the documentary that "it sounds in click", but it's a normal day. "In addition, World Trade Centers or Pentagon or hijacked planes, they're doing their job, staying there or even for second passing. They were not just murdered, they were slaughtered, and the hijackers made a song in their heart. <br /> <br /> They thank you for this documentary, and why do people do it? You really think about firefighters, police and troopers and are good people in this world Identified retain your hope. Thank you to everyone, you are our heroes. <br /> <br /> 10/10
