You can remember seeing this when I was nine years old. I want to be one of the "barbarian brothers". This film is still great. One of the facts is that the fight scenes are very small. They were successful in the "barbarian brothers", where the enemies quickly run! Plus, chase you, a cage fight, a dragon, and yes even a bar clash! <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is good, so it's not ten, and the criticism of the story has got a lot of criticism. I think it's very original. In its style many movies do not have the same original story lines or colorful dialogues. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this film.
