Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and intelligent action movie. Story: One businessman threatened some 3 criminals. Roy Sheeder makes a great job to go to John Glover to play the leading role and special credit a naughty psychological sort. I have to say that the villains who are rarely in action films are very critical and interesting. There are also some beautiful and sexy women - Kelly Preston as the youngest duty for the role of the most famous Schieder. Vanity offers a good show and presentation as the hooker connected to the three blackellers. I'm glad to say that On-Margaret is still missing - this woman is a real babe. Do not look at the rate of this image. I do not know what the public and some critics are on this film but my advice is to ignore them and watch the really persevering and under-rated movie. It is promised, you will enjoy it. Recommended A +.
