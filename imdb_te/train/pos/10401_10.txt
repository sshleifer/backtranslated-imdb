Words rarely describe it, so I'll be brief. "Baghdad's Thief" is my favorite movie as a child, and it is not surprisingly or mesmerizing. I saw this movie from the very first moment, when the boy was a boy I started reading "Arabian Knights". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the middle of the battle of Sabu, we went into the TV room and stood up with a big spider, <br /> <br /> Sometimes the most beautiful, magic, and astonishing picture. Sabu and John Justin dashing are great as heroes, Conrad Weidt is a bad villain of Jaffer and a pleasure to see Rex Ingram as a laughing janitor. Georges Perinel's photography is the best use of technicolor. The producer, Michael Powell, was correctly praised by critics, but "A Matter of Life and Death" ("A Steward to Heaven") and "A Matter of Life and Death" The Red Shoes. <br /> <br /> He is in the real masters of the camera, with David Lean, Akira Kurosawa and Orson Wells. <br /> <br /> For all great works, "The Baaded of the Baghdad" The frame has its own magical appeal, and the characters and their actions are always involved, and the old film never goes up forever.
