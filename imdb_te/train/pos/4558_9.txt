My Left Fat, in my opinion, is a great biopic about the world's most talented writers and painters. The shows were smashing, the soundtrack was great, and the casting was accurate. I thought Christie (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man, yet he could not understand much of the time. In addition, when he threw an irritant, I got a little scared. Moreover, he is suffering from cerebral palsy. At the end, as you die Daniel Day-Lewis's die hard hard or biographies, I highly recommend this great biography about one of the most talented authors and painters in the world. You're in for a real treat and have a good time, so do not miss this one.
