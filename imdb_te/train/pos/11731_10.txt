I think this film is very fun and horror. I love the livres and I love this movie. The second part of this wonderful film is very difficult to succeed because it is very funny like the first part. I'm also concerned that I did not see Cassandra Pietersen in other movies as well as this film. I think she is an amazing performer ... the probability. In the third part of Elvera's adventures I'll see her in the future. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses. Cassandra, if you read it, you are the best, and my heart is with you. You can trust me. What else can I add? It's cool and traditional image!
