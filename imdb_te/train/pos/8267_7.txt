Harvard Brown is a hard movie to pin down. Remember that we have a lot of expectations from our movies these days, so it's a little naive for 20km audiences. William Hines is flawed by pain and shame to succeed and is also beautiful as the fame Rogue. Relationships in the movie are all Billy and Jack Pixford, the town feel nicely stilted for the homomorphic tie. The film is everything, love, tears, love, death and sports ... It's great education in what society has changed in the 20th century.
