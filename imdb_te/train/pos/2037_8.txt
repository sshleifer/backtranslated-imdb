Christopher Smith is a clear horror fan, which is evident in his first horror film 'Creep'. Although 'creep' is a little loose on the information, it proves to be worthy of true cryptic classic. This dark and gruesome story is a little less glossy Kate (Franca Potente) who flew to a murderer than a recent US horror (Amityville Horror Remake, House of Wax Remake) through the labyrinth and untouched railways of underground tunnels, and others along the way. Although some bad reviews are related to this movie, I strongly believe in the budget and the first time the director Smith is 'creep' really is the UK production of its name. This is rare in some places, but the exact location and the best character-reaction-I've seen it at the end of this very fast since Gary's performance is much faster, while 'Crypipe' some scenes definitely have nightmares.
