It's not a good movie but I still like it. Cat Clovis gold is in the pot as well as in the cats' premises - inherently against the bad sleepwalkers. I feel that there are more people in this movie, mainly because it's very hard, but this brookness might be nice sometimes. It can find serious lines, sudden end and humorous element. Finally, the film is casual and randomly ruthless, it's very effective, I compare with Psycho - to change the relationships between the mother and the son. <br /> <br /> I think I will do a sudden work, it's not a movie you want to extend them, but it's small, but it works. <br /> <br /> We do not know if Stephen King has the ability to do this, even if the director is not in depth, but I did not read his books and saw only some of his movies. <br /> Anyway, I liked it. If you want rough tuned movies with over 80's of over tones, you should see it. But do not expect too much. It really looks great.
