<br /> <br /> I was surprised that the tough criticism (acting, dating conversation, vague storyline) was incomplete. The great Belabonte is a great, such as a broochous, intimidating, and uproar, earning his wings but virtually ill from his past life. He learns how late he is, without his love of spaces and materialism. Mozel was also a painful man with his dying wife, Fanny. Despite his prayers for a miracle, his bitter will prevent him from accepting (or believing). Two social worlds alternately collide with each other, and the result is hilarious and heartfelt sad. <br /> <br /> This confrontation is quite stable with the rest of the movie. After looking everywhere for Belaphante, Montel sees the falling feathers, and he frantically feels he likes to believe in angels and miracles. But Belaponte did not allow her to end the miracle (to restore the fitness of the health or the trust of Monel), so he did not get his wings. Mozel's disillusionment rises to the east, both of which are a metaphor for men's live: it's too late and you can not get a second chance. Like "It's wonderful life," this film is magical, wonderful, funny, but terrible tragic.
