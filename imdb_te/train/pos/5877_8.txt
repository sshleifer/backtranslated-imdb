Okay, as I said, this picture is good but you must watch it as a watch. It starts with a laughing time when many friends and fashion photographers and Mac (Akshay Kumar) begin dating their 3-year-old friends at the same time to be suspicious. Sam gets good and forgets his friend completely but not completely. But Mac is so confident that he starts dating with the air hostess. At every stage of the garam masala film, the songs are stone but not quite a bit too little. Comedy is not up to the mark and deserves an award. It's nice but not amazing. Some people laughed at their stomachs but many were not laughing. But everybody's opinion is different. So if you want to watch the movie, you would like to do that.
