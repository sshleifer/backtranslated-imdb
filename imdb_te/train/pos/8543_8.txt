One of these films I have never selected a shelf, but it came on IFC a day and I said - Eric Stolz, William Forsythought ... Why not? If I change the channel, I will actually lose the treasure. <br /> <br /> This issue is discouraging - the young writer who accidentally encounters the lesser author's rehabilitation center. It was very simple and exciting, making it a flip-jerker. But it did not happen because it was written by Neil Jimenez, who was accidentally satisfied. No Hollywood joy here. All the patients in the ward have come from different backgrounds, but they are depressed by others. Stollz is very good as a "lone wolf" type, forced to insult on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is good as a former ladies man, whose family is different; <br /> <br /> William Forshytee takes the cake as a tough guy who decides to pay for his freedom.
