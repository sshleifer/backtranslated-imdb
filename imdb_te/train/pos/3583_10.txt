This is a great movie but I think I've seen so far is the worst ended !!! The actors are great and have demonstrated great talent. The whole story is derived and unexpected, it's fun. As good as the film, the whole picture is terrible ending, is judging by! Perhaps this sequel can remove this bad end.
