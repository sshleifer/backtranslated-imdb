Well, it is a movie that is playing with your sentiments yet you come out all soft against a stone film. But I have sucked them because I gave them a good score ... Acting is very good and it is a lot of feeling. The violence has been lowered, which makes the change. At the end of the salute did not give it a 9! <br /> <br /> All good cinemas with very good actors <br /> <br />
