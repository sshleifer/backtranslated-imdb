This is another example of the genius of Jean Wilder. He wrote and acted on this wonderful mystery. No one can do it better. There is a touch of suspense. I'm going to be with Mr. Wilder another of these. Everything I ever watched Mr. Wilder see I enjoyed it but I did not know how to really master it until I saw "Murder in Small Town," and this follow-on. He's really gripping what the audience wants and what he's doing in his work and how awesome it is. His subtle wit comes through spades. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who likes the work of the secrets and / or Jean Wilder films. His star is just brighter and brighter.
