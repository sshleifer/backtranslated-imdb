This film is amazing. <br /> <br /> I was amazed by the performance of Guards and Hyde, after the unrestricted actors in the American world and the non-performing singers. <br /> <br /> In this film, the young shoe (gauge) comes across a vampire, Kai (Hyde). Over time, they form a friendly friendship. <br /> <br /> It is Kai who is responsible for how it has been forced to live with others. <br /> This is a tragedy. This plot is very unique and contrary to your distinctive vampire films. <br /> If it is not happy, the only mistake I have to say about the film is that it is peaceful, it's multi-languages. <br /> <br /> "I'm fortunate that I've rescued some people in the cantons", so I would recommend doing something with subtitles. <br /> <br /> More than anything, the film is just awesome.
