<br /> <br /> When I look at Woody Harrelson, he may not be in many parts of the film, but when he looks or acquaintances, Will Smith and I was surprised by Woody Harrelson's "message", until the end of the whole plot was really understood <br /> I am not a very sensitive person, I believe that a good deed is not a repentance or a pity. But there is not a law to liberate, there are not many films in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I agree that "suicide" acts with a person who commented on the film, although the movie "message" is trying to send, but "sacrifice". <br /> <br /> The film has the potential to play. Acting is worth every penny, the script is unbelievable. From a man who does not really like the drama movies ... this should go a watch if you like drama.
