One of the best movies ever! This is just a mystery of just 7.6. This film is a window in the world with black experience in America. All whites of all whites must have a mandatory age of 10 years of age. I would like to see a companion piece with "The Long Walk Home". If you think of Hooper Goldberg's work "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares", think again. Do not miss the Oscar winning film. (And even read the book!)
