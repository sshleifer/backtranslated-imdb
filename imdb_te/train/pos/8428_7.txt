This may be the best if it happened in the Zatochi series. It's very good, it's great, but the plot and characters are very complicated for the series at this time. The situation is extraordinarily witty: farmers have two winners, a gift boss (for once) and a philosopher-samurai who initiates a sort of grandiose; Typical local gangsters are running two runs in the race, and crops need to fail because their gambling earns and their opportunities to snap a little bit of land; Their main or powerful friend is a puritan who drinks and gambles, but secretly has his own extreme appetite. (He later resembles Dracula, and later the villains in Zatochi films). These characters have a meaningful meaning, but now he has lost many of his talents, and the time is better to give the film so that the story seems choppy, as some changes to the characters and some changes to the characters, such as a man Zatoichi's angry sister There is no need. Besides this, the film shows the sins of others in the series: good acting, sometimes lyrical photography, a clear, reliable and uniquely recognizable landscape (suddenly the director misguided it in the episode) and its nature's characteristic disguise disguises: different use of limited sets , So their limits exist No. And of course the famous actor, whose presence, for his performance, it all works. The film should be one of the best-ever series in history.
