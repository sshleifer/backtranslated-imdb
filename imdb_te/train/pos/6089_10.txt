Well, I've done a little overwriting to fill at least one of those stupid reviews. But I enjoyed it. I did not laugh out loud, but it pulled me out of my interest and at any time. The story is built. Yes, you know that you have a happy ending - this genre always does. At this time, you are quirky because you see that you can not miss it, so be careful when you look. Stiller and Black again deftly distributed. Good team. They should work more together. It does not know that it is a cult classic, but it is definitely a fun ride. What's not good about BOB, or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS It is worth to get this picture and go out your way a little bit to watch.
