A pledge to Cherish is a fantastic picture. It is based on a novel of the same title, even though it is different from the movie, is equally good. Really have to think about how you'd like to respond if you're in the shoes of the characters. <br /> <br /> Production is not much Hollywood quality - no big special effects - yet, values ​​and ideals are more than made for it. And the cast has done an amazing job of capturing emotional connections between family members and the disaster that occurs when one of them is unwell. <br /> You should not miss it!
