Unborn is a very different picture. James Karen & Brooke Adams are in the film and they have performed very well. This film leads to a solid structure and keeps you going. Although I think the scenes and the plot should be a horror fan because of this. There is a naked pornographic scene that is out of sight and some people dishearten the scene in the movie and feel that it is good for the subject. Adams' character is in the scene where goats go and kill a cat but you are not true of it. Music is different but very good. In my opinion is a really creepy movie that is unprecedented unbearable and is very strange! I recommend the horror fans of this film!
