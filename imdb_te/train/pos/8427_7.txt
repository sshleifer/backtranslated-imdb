This is one of the most difficult films in the Zatoiche series, because it is a very extraordinary phenomenon and Ichi played the role of the film. Interestingly, this is the first Jatoichi film by Shinto Katsu's new production company. Now, instead of the Blind Swordsman's role, Kutsu is responsible for making films. This is why it can easily explain why the movie is very different for the last 15 films. In the role of Ichy, the film is very different, because he is not normal in the film. He's also fool and actually, for a while, makes a lot of harm to help instead of helping people! <br /> <br /> In this scene, Ecci says he is blind from a baby, but in the previous movie He tells his blindness at the age of 8. This is a minor mistake, and a crazed fan like it. You can see the odd thing that I have observed - many movies in this series take place in a few days or weeks, and Ichi is coming to town with a bass (Assoro) who is trying hard to know Ischi. There is a surprise and a complete evil man At the same time, he meets another boss (Shushu) - a teacher for the poor, and Shushu warns people to give up all the violence and Ichi also falls in his teaching - he left his blade for several months, while Shushu's teachings are very similar to China's Daoist teachings - Acceptance of life (for good or for bad). <br /> <br /> The months and thoughts of leaving this town are good, as soon as he arrives, Assarro finds his real colors - torturers, oppressing the poor, and surrounding them all. In a way, Eichi was responsible for him, because he helped Assorro and counted him as a friend. Now Assassorro Shushui has been captured and many innocent people have been killed by the evil owner's actions. <br /> When he returns, Ascorso is a good man or a scoundrel, he tests wisely. This bit of inspiration and ultimately leads to a scarecrow, nothing else, Echi kills the bad guys and leaves Shushu. The ending is good and the rain has occurred. <br /> <br /> The final scene with Assoro and Stone is great, but the helmet is tad cheesy by today's Special Effects Standards. <br /> <br /> Although the film is poorly displayed, it is different and not wrong in the previous 15 (which is very similar). In addition, it ends well. Minos (besides putting it) will not seem too embarrassing and other blind men included comic relief with Ichi and other blind people are very flat too ... too. They are frivolous and unfunny ... it's sort of flat.
