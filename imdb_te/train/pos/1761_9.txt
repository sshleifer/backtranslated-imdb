Only once will we get an R-rated comedy that attracts all time and attention. This is rare when critics like it. I am back from the 40 year old Virgin and honestly say that it is one of the biggest laughs in my life. I went to a 10:35 and each row was filled. In addition, everyone laughed their donkey from the whole time. It's two-hour non stop stop laughing. <br /> I'm laughing at this movie. A man is at the age of forty years and he is a virgin. And yet, behind this simple, five-second joke, you always give a close, complicated story, which you'll ever be witnessing but there are real lessons behind it. Andy Stitzer, the 40 year old-Old Virgin, starred Steve Carell. We know Steve Karel, in my opinion, one of the best sequences of all time. Steve Karel finally got a long way, given his moment to be shattered as a star, stealing delightful scenes from Bruce Almighty and especially Anchorman. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty 100% stupid. Judd Apatow and Steve Carell's masterpiece is originally intended and is not just a hell of the story to say it. An important lesson for learning the film's intolerance and obscene non-stop ride. Even if it is not as good as possible, the film will give you more than the enjoyable time. Your gut-busting attitude will laugh all the time when we see real life struggles like Andy and his fellow colleagues simultaneously. The end is not good. It's not just a promise, it's one of the most memorable full-blown numbers ever seen in a comedy. <br /> <br /> When Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson came there, but now you can not win everything, now you can. <br /> Finally, as Roger Ebert says, Catherine Keener performs an extraordinary performance like the trish, a woman Andy really has her heart. Even if she was not laughing at us, she was crazy to find any kind of rainbow. <br /> <br /> With Canada ratings, once again with the Ontario 14A, British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba beat the 40-year-old Virgin with 18A. In my opinion, the fourth best movie of the same year, along with the fourth Brothers, and I can honestly say I love Anthr√≠ria. There are all you fellow teenagers out there in the States: Sneaking in Good Luck! <br /> <br /> In total, Steve Carell is one of the funniest performances I've ever seen and distributed to non-stop laughter in the cast. Everyone loves this 40-year-old Virgin during the summer and I encourage everyone to see it as fast as possible. It's the best comedy of the year, hands down. The Longest Yard, The Wedding Crashers, and Apollo and Karel's last memorable comedy, Anchorman dismisses all. <br /> <br /> It is worthy of praise from a comic art and critics. Love it. Everyone of my favorite critics loved it and soon IMDb got a place in the top 250. Steve Karel is a huge star. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Obviously ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> </
