This amazing little picture about a lonely man lonely. Like the Notre Heroes, Phillippe Harrel is a type of cameras of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver, Inspector Clouseau (in his Stoicism) and Chounsie Gardiner (Peter Sellers). <br /> <br /> He does not have a clue how he can yet attract the opposite sex to the same person - in fact he really does not make any effort! <br /> <br /> He's always serious - his friend Jose Garcia Tisserand still makes a brave attempt to overcome his extended virginhood (he is 28 and he never accepts sex). <br /> <br /> Paris's good outdoor shots and roung, two software people travel in business. They tried different nightclubs and places, but did not get all the benefits. My theory is that they are trying to find faulty places - they go more or less 'youth' nightclubs; <br /> <br /> The harel becomes lonely and tries a little deeper in the taxi driver, who is a tyrant who pulls a nice-looking girl in a nightclub, going to his friend / colleague. <br /> Worth watching.
