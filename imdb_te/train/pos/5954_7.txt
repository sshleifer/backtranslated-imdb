I realized the different levels of chaos and personal taste in reactions in the film. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, here are the scientific stereotypes. Also martial arts stereotypes. All is well and good, and sure, not all perfectly completed. However, one important thing about this film is that I feel neglected ... its cultural significance. The film is set in Pensacola, Florida and attempts to stay unreachable. It is today a bold move in the film world, and a rare tradition for indie films fans. In fact, it's not the last one. Pensacola is a Navy town, an air town, a timber town and sometimes a major center of political controversy. It is rarely seen as a growing urban film. But now all are changing. More movie companies are coming to shoot. And Swadeshi Pensacians discover the power of movies. The film is part of the growing trend of Pensacola-based indie films, and more on the way. Pensacola makes a big noise in the world film community, and by and through the world is taking more notice. Watch and listen, the world. Pensacolians are coming. Like a virus.
