This is a very light-headed comedy for a wonderful son named Pecker, who used pek in his diet. Baltimore, Md. Pecker prefers all kinds of people in a small suburb of the city and has a group of photographers in New York City to attract the attention. Pecker has a nice sister, he just goes to the SUGAR and actually takes a spoonful of sugar from a bag, a person. The grinding moves and gals are pretty much the same as the scenes of men showing off the lumps of their jockey doing the same. It is difficult to remove your mind from the glitter with this picture, but who cares, a simple picture made in 1998 is only a few laughs.
