This is exactly the horror movie TV program available. There is no connection to the series on Friday 13th. Poligastist legacy: I'm not sure. It may be connected to movies. <br /> <br /> It is frustrating that it shows Freddy Elm Street Parents (I believe in 1 Story) and burned through the amount of parents. With all the children that he has targeted in the 1st 3rd films, you want to have more parents. <br /> <br /> Freddie is the protagonist of the story basically. He sometimes visits and observes people's actions in the real world. <br /> Other works appear like tales from the stories, in which there is a supernatural or a surprise unfolding twist. <br /> Not acting, but believe or not: violence sometimes surpasses the film. The show lasted two seasons and was built on the 4th film. I heard that it was canceled due to protest parents. I saw a lot of things R was rated as a kid, so parents had to destroy everyone. After the series 4 films have come, so this is not a total loss.
