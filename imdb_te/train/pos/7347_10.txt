<br /> <br /> "It is cheesy, but who cares? It retained the test of time and it was similar to modern fantasy myths like LOTR <br /> <br /> The battle between Fire and Ice is a king's daughter Jaros (Eyes) mocking creatures She was the only survivor in the village where she was kidnapped <br /> <br /> Yes, Nurse Betty, but that's not the point.Fire and Ice: It has become an interesting idea of ​​the world of two enemies. <br /> <br /> Acting and conversation: The contestant is really not nominated for an Oscar, but they are correct And you can not get on your nerves. <br /> <br /> The animation is very good 3D and rotoscoped shot (I think), it looks great.The backgrounds are really really detailed and well drawn and the character forms are slightly 1-dimensional, They are right. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a much less neglected little gem, than anything superficial "entertainment". 10/10
