<br /> <br /> The main characters are: Rex the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Elsa the Petodactyl, Dweb the Pararallopus, oi The Triotops, a boy named Louis, a girl Cecilia and Captain New-Eyes. ? <br /> What happens: Four dinosaurs live (see above). "Cereal grain cereals" and now cuddly, friendly dinosaurs that are good as kids. <br /> My thoughts: It is a beautiful animated film. The dinosaur's animation is a bit floppy and not-so-good, but they look so pleasant when they go cuddly and friendly. Dinosaurs like when they are cuddly and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good. I have (almost) all the characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I like others as well. Overall, I like this film too! <br /> <br /> An animated film for good children, people like dinosaurs, John Goodman and Circus are people who love to see what they're missing? Have fun! :-)
