When I was a child, this film made me a heck. It's not "Citizen Kane", but its moments. The scene is not good enough. The plot is good even though there are no characters - they have something to act. Keep some of the characters in high ranges and see what you are receiving. It's one of those shoots, editing (smallest) and distributed in a few months-type films. This classic low-budget science fiction and just deserves due. I have rated it for 9 other films of this genre and age.
