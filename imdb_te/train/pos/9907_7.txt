"Slater Hai", perhaps, the least underestimated Slasher movie in the 1980s. This is one of the few genres in the genre. It is said that this is largely dependent on the standard slashing principle: the men and women of youth are killed each other until the final showdown. <br /> <br /> "Slaughter High" is so high that the movies in its genre goes further over the top. Marty, the killer, has a good reason to hold revenge against his former colleagues. <br /> <br /> When he was naked in a girl's locker room shower and dropped at his punch with a javelin, his scientific lab experimented with the top spot, and the victims could not see you get it. They return back years later - Marty himself on high school reunion - you realize they are not all too mature. <br /> The mind-buzzing is why one can not think why they need to be only part of the rehearsal, by which, in a school that has been repaired after that. And who have a good idea to drink beer and alcohol that appears in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers - as well as Marty's - in the show? The viewer has a lot of confidence to enjoy this movie. The end is less or no sense. <br /> <br /> The screenwriters have a peculiar understanding of how April Fools' Day works: the afternoon after the pranks are no longer allowed. <br /> <br /> In all films, this film is one of the best examples of the dark genre, despite all of its flaws. And while others are decorated with other run-of-the-mill slasher flicks special editions, it is difficult to understand why the DVD is not found its way.
