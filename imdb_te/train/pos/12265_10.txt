"Tintin and I" originally portrayed me as an excellent documentary. Photography and editing are really breathing (almost anti-dogma). <br /> <br /> We have followed Tintin Drawer Herme's life through the Open-Heart Interview since 1971. Great ideological struggles of the twentieth century in the face of the Tintin series. This is his own demons to fight in the center of Hertz, and his drawing seems to try to escape most of the activities and to escape the world of perfection. <br /> <br /> Herbie is not told by story interviews and archive equipment and never reconstructions. <br /> <br /> The life of Hegge is a real, painful artist. But the fantastic world from his imagination is again surprising readers again.
