An absolutely brilliant performance. The second season of the first time ended. Suspense everywhere, all episodes and mystery are not everywhere. Thinking and thinking again. It's really amazing how the author can combine all the concepts to get out with all the connections and mix all the scenes with the characters and to understand the lives of characters in the show. If not excited, I'm looking forward to a new season. Hopefully more secrets will be revealed and at the same time, more confidentiality can be solved. Most cast option for this presentation, perfectly suited for the characters. We can not wait to get to the end secretly. Hopefully not to spoil the end of all the hype.
