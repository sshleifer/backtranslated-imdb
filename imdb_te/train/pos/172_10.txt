I have seen this film a few times in Comedy Central. This image is pretty good. This is an exciting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, who was set up to marry the King of Ohtar, and could get the US Army base to balance the power of the US Middle East. Some good jokes, including "Sannygate" And I also loved the ultimate background. That gave me a great political spirit. My rating for this movie in ten ten.
