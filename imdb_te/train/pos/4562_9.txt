The film is on DVD yesterday and is gob-smoked and flabbited. The DDL's non-impact work has dropped my mind, I was amazed by the whole cast and its amazing performance. The character is all too standard for me, I really took the DDL for Christie Burns and Brenda Fricker for his mother. Look at it and see! You call your heart, but you can experience a wonderful Katharis! Moreover, it teaches you an important lesson: the decision is everything. You may be inert in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but you have no problems when you are raised. If you can only stop your left foot, it's good that you're still an artist or writer. What you can do when you are mentally challenged is sore and self-pitying. It's up to you and you're the only one who is puzzled.
