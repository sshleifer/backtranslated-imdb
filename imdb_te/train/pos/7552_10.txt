CAT SOUP is a small element based on the legendary manga neocoure. It won the award "Best Short Film" award at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and won the "Excellence Prize" at Japan's Media Arts Festival. <br /> <br /> When the soul of the little cat Nyaako is stolen by death, she and her brother Nutata begin a hideous journey to get back. In the surreal dreamscapes of the other side, they face many amazing characters and remarkable, often upsetting adventure. <br /> <br /> Cat Saree is an anime as you've ever seen. It's Am That Hello Kitty! It's very original, beautifully beautiful and has a great feeling and is a song. CAT SOUP is very surreal (no conversations) and sometimes cruel and crypt. So it's a lot more mature than children (they did not understand!). A great journey for those who have the opportunity to see this perfect masterpiece. Must see!
