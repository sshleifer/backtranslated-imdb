"How to Lose Friends & Alien People" is not based on Tiger Woods's infidelity. This is a medieval romantic comedy based on his experiences as a leading journalist based on Toby Young's books. Sinny Young, a Cinney British journalist, has appeared in a popular celebrity magazine in New York. Young is a break to get caught up in all of the shenanigans to surround him all around, hence the title of the movie. He is tired, courageous, and morally. However, for some strange reasons he is a less likely character. Sydney is a fellow journalist, ally with Alison Olsen, composed by Kirsten Dunst. However, the Sydney sex actress Sophie Musc is mainly angry with the Fantastic Mrs. Megan Fox. The performance of this foxtrot is minimal for professionalism, but in the case of "eye candy". Sydney magazine's colleague gets all kinds of tumbles to move up the ladder. The film's peak funny movements. However, director Robert Weidd and screenwriter Peter Straughan lose a few viewers and feel that the original ROM-com object could be dropped by developing an intimidating romance story between Sydney & Alison; Team Wheatstringon also created an entertaining story. Pegg reduced his role to Sydney Yang with his lively performance to the wire. Jeff Bridges again "The Dude" bridges built into her troubled helper Clayton Harding, Magazine's delightful prides. But the rest of the movie is not worth the money to be played. "How Friends & How To Lose & Eliot People" should not be completely aloof, but if you make this film a romantic joke, you may lose some movie friends. *** average
