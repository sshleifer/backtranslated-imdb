Very few of the so-called "rebuilds" are real. This one will fly with the border colors. A remake, I do not think so! At the age of nine I saw Theatrical, and was well appreciated in this film. <br /> This image invites comparisons to the 1963 counter. The previous film was also enjoyable and entertaining, but it was more like a documentary rather than a movie. This update is more epic and cinematic. However, I would recommend two images completely. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely an animal lover. The clever old Golden Retriever for us is Shadow; Sharp, satirical Himalayan cat, sassy; And the young, amusing American bulldog, Chance. <br /> <br /> In this film, Don Am√®che, Sally Field and Michael J. There is a bit of scathological humor, but nothing serious. <br /> <br /> Hearty, horrifying, moving, and above all true, which amazed me, the film did not win any awards, not one. However, I have correctly given some of the best picture nominations today.
