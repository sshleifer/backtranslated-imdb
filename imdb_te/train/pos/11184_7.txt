Chicago's Dr. Louis Creed goes to a big house near a small town because he starts giving classes at the University of Maine. In addition to him, his wife Rachel and their two children, Ellie and Gage, as well as Ellis Cat, are the church. Soon, they met their new neighbors, and the old man named Jad Crandal. Jude does not warn Looid and Rachel on their way to their home (which is constantly being used by big trucks) family is a pet graveyard near their home. <br /> <br /> Because she has suffered from the death of her sister Zelda, Rachel is against her children to talk about death and spirituality. Louis had to face the deaths of two men: Victor Pesso, a student who was injured in an automobile accident, despite his two strangers, personally referred to his dying words to Louis. On the night of Pasco's death, Louise feels he is the most daring dream he met in the PC, who drives the pet cemetery and warns Luis "to go out and think how much you need." Lewis wakes up on the bed the next morning, it only feels like in a dream, he finds his feet covered with dust and pine needles. Anytime, he breaks the dream. Very strange things start to happen, and the Church, Elli Cat, dies while driving on the highway. Luis Ellie fears that he will be talking about the Church's death, but with the sympathetic Jud, Jude Church, he takes Louis to the cemetery and buries the Church. Instead of standing there, Loth has long been leading Lloyd on a frightening journey of "real cemetery": once used the ancient burial ground, Miquamak ('Indians'). Where Lewis kills the cat on the orders of Judi, where Judd tells the story that the animals are buried there. The real horror story starts ... <br /> <br /> I personally found this movie very good. It's not too horrible, but one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. As Gaz dying, it's almost impossible to stay in your memory, especially being a toddler. <br /> In fact, there are a few script errors: how great a doctor with two young children lives in the area where it is located? A dangerous road near his house? How does gauge make any grooves or anything after a truck is hit? Louis finds out why he continues to resurrect each member of his family, all of them as monsters. <br /> <br /> This kind of things do not make sense, but I can understand that some of the horror works I need surreal ideas. <br /> <br /> The story of the good thing I have seen in this film is the death of children, your religion, or you are an atheist, avoiding important things. All nightmare began, saying that she had never returned to her for fear of being honest with Louis Ellie.
