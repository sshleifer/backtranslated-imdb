My Evaluation: 8/10 <br /> <br /> This film is very fond of this movie. <br /> <br /> With the current buzz film (nothing new about ideas and actions), "Soyland Green" surprises the day of eating the "cookie" of the human body. This kind of future is possible to see what is happening on this planet, and what people are different. <br /> <br /> The movie takes some time, but the idea behind this movie is the same again. Rich at the heaven, the other hell. Best of luck today They are inertia like TV and "reality show". <br /> <br /> The TV is a good wash brain. It is pity to see that there is no progress like human knowledge technologies. <br /> If you want a reality show, this movie is not for you. You believe in all the political leaders. If you do not like to ask questions about yourself and the future now, you can not see this movie.
