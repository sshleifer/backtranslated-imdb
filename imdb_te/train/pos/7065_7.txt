A beautiful picture (the mother is still carrying the fire for the father) in Switzerland, where they want to get their parents back, so they go to New York to stop their father from marrying. He calls a golden digger with a golden digger. Dad did not see his daughters in his ten years, they (uncommonly fit) did not appear in mind and he could not be considered a wonderful man, and at the same time his prince (Alice Brady) married her daughter to a great man. Two golden mining women consume two golden women as one of the richest men in Europe. But in a wrong case, the girls think that Ray is a good looking guy, and he has a love for sister K. <br /> <br /> This film is enjoyable, light fare. Sweet and Beautifully Barbara Reed, Ray Miland Oh looks good and beautiful here (unfortunately, given very little to do), Alice Brady's caring mother is very good - but it is like a button to play Penny Penny, which is a real sister pretty picnic sniper Attractive and beautiful. With absolutely beautiful voice, she will spoil a lot of songs across the film, yet I feel like I have more of her in this regard. The plot in this film is a bit crazy, though, I found the movie being fun and fun.
