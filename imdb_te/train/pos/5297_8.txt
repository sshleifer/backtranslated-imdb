I went to see this film as my brother and his girlfriend. The place is pretty packed and laughed so hard we all miss easy to miss all the lines. I thought it would be good, but it's more ridiculous than I think. I liked both Edward Frolung and Cristina Ricky, who seemed unrealistic like the usual people. I'm sick of movies that show young people such as "jok" or "geek" or "cheerleader" cookies. The two characters are unique but still quite human and relatively simple in relation to them. I recommend this movie to all my friends and it's very eager to stay on DVD, let's see this movie with your friends who can laugh in the funniest parts of your life! I'm planning to go back to the theater and I see things more than once.
