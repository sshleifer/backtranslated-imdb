When you are a part of the country in some of the countries in the film industry industry you're working with (and some crazy artist), you can make fully understandable movies. <br /> You will see the lowest level of Austria's community, dirty, disturbed, strange, and hateful. But they still have enough money, so they can buy tuned cars and big houses. And they're definitely doing a lot of strange things here, it's for them 'normal' because they're doing their whole life. <br /> <br /> From a simple human perspective you can follow this movie easily, hated or fascinated, and see a nice part of Austria's art films. <br /> <br /> You live here and hang out like a tumor of society. A society that is more madly from day to day, can not understand their own terms, and cavers the social system from within. And you will see people. Sitting in the park, standing in the street corner opposite, queuing in the same line. You can join 'em in a bar or disco. You can work with them in your job or live next to your home. You hates them without knowing exactly. You try to stay away - but you can not. Perhaps you look like them. <br /> You are not as bright as your lifetime, but Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. It's cute people ... but some are also ugly. Many of those who are working hard are trying ... But some of the rarits behind the others and the folk of Austria are destroying everything that has been built so far. <br /> <br /> Very pessimistic picture.
