This is another "bad language" people who accused the Mexican film of ultra violence. They're right, but we call this film a great way to get a better understanding. The worst truth hurts or bills hurts when you already accept an example of a third world's possible goal. One of the most important things of "Cero y van cuatro" is an in-depth reflection open invitation on our current identity. What are we all We all want to be I'm abroad and I realized how Mexico was corrupted when the Talakuk event came to light. I still can not understand the viewers who saw mass murders. I saw some pictures. It was not a small village near Iraq or Rwanda, Mexico City, which was devastated by media and government satisfaction. The excitement of the same situation in the film made me very surprised. Other stories have played a good role in other situations such as corruption, fraud, betrayal and violence, but I think "Tamales de Chios" is the best. <br /> <br /> The film screams "Cabran" and "Pendezo". These are meaningless compared to people's actions. With some exceptions they are all perfect examples of human trash. In the real life of truth, we have become more exemplary than in our country. In addition, honesty is only rewarded.
