Never been the best martial arts film ever. This is a movie that Bruce Lee has ever done. An entertaining and ruthless climax classic. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts films and the real king of kung fu. When Bruce Lee was overrated, it took Jackie Chan permanently to gain popularity in Europe and America. Jockey rules !!!!
