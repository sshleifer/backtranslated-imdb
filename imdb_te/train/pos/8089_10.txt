With the release of Peter Jackson's renowned "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated Lord of the Rings is also easy to remove the film. Jackson's trilogy is a significant feature of Tolkien's writing that I agree with a majority, but it does not prevent me from taking the prestigious pioneering effort of Bakshi. <br /> <br /> Jackson accepts that Bakshi has been inspired by the film and has some clear similarities between their applications. <br /> <br /> The colorful scenery of the film is fantastic and the score is memorable. For the most part I have been satisfied with drawings of characters. Phippin and Merry and Evaine and Gouldry's couples are not unique to each other, the Ballroom and Triberts are unsatisfactory, but these points do not bother me. However, Nazgul has been aptly drawn and strange enough. Sam's represent the sole role I suffer; <br /> <br /> This film is the novel for animation techniques. In addition to hand-drawn characters, live actors are included in animation by rotoscoping. It is very clear that the characters are hand-drawn and rotoscoped, but I can not recognize the style of the film as a novelty. The use of rotoscop live live casters for war scenes is a good decision and these scenes have changed well. <br /> <br /> Voice acting is usually of high quality. Specially good John Hurt, who gave an official voice for Aragón. Not mine's favorite character from the stories of Aragon, but supported by John Hurt's voice, he is my favorite character in this application. My other favorite is Willy's Squire, whose voice is suitable for Gandhi. Michael Scholes, the only actor who appeared to be inappropriate, played Sam, and his voice acting was added to the frustration and unfortunately silly film of Sam. The other awkward part of voice acting is the misunderstanding of character and space names. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bakshi is believed to be capable of producing two films for the film's production. Hence, the film has a half story following the end of the war in Hell's Deep "The Two Towers" since the film "The Fellowship of the Ring". Its clear formula is the most frozen version of this movie story. I enjoyed the original stories and more complete adaptations, but the freedoms that I had taken to suppress the story did not bother me, and there was a chance to go out of Arné's story. The main elements of the story are in this film for me to be involved in this period and there is also a newness in the breeze by half the Lord in the Rings Story of 132 minutes. <br /> <br /> The version of Ralph Bakshi's version of "The Lord of the Rings" is not accurate and no doubt cuts the story of the Lord's number The Rings Readers. Anyway, I have seen the flaws of this film half the potential adaptation of a great trio, compared to the thrill. My only strong tragedy is that I can not see the second part of this "first great story" of Lord of the Rings since the budget did not create a sequel to Buick.
