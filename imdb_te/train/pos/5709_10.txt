Made in 1931, this foreign film can be seen and enjoyed very often. <br /> <br /> We open a small French village in a silent area by scanning the roofs of silent citizens. Then we hear something that looks like a party. The story of the two men, the story of the two men, and the friends who choose two numbers for the lottery. <br /> <br /> Our star in the movie is his number and his friend. When he asks his friend, he shares the dough half, his ticket has to be no winning, his friend immediately says. In fact, H.E. Double hockey shouts! <br /> When our man learns he has a winning ticket and loses it, without his own fault, he is insane. Everyone came out of it, looking for this ticket, as a precursor to "The Great Race". Despite all of this past, I'm in the all-time knots and I was disappointed with every little thing in this all-me-show-me-the-money-cash-the-film film. Watch Le Million Today!
