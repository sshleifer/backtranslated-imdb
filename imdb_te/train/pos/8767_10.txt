I saw this movie lucky because I was newly appreciated to Bill Pullman and wanted to see his recent movies and I thank God! Since then this film has been with me and is one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls who leave a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene are trying to get a holiday together before going to college, but their trip ended with a very complicated story. They were arrested in Thailand and became prisoners and they are very moving and intense as they go. Acting is awesome, the pictures are exceptional, the soundtrack is fantastic and good for the movie and the message is definitely powerful. I can not find the right words to explain how I see this film every time I see it. I know that I do not appreciate myself with some ratings, but I would have to look at this standard !!! I promise to keep you away!
