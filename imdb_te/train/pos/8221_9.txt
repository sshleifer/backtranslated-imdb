The 4th sensation impact of Dirty Harry's films and one of the best traits of these films is that they are not really good at quality from one movie to another. Thus, Sudden Impact brings another thrill ride through the life of Dirty Harry Kalahan. Harry tries to solve a series of murders while on vacation. Harry is always in a job that looks like. Clint Eastwood plays Harry, who plays slowly, intentionally, and fearlessly all his men's actions. In the 80s, the first of the dirty Harry films, the Sapun Impact does not have 70 episodes of the first three films. It does not mean that quality is any less. Bottom Line: Brink is another value for the Dirty Harry series, with intensity and action.
