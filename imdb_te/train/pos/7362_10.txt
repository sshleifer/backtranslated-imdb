A fun filled, sexy movie! They definitely do not make them like this. 4 sexy couples will arrive in London and have all kinds of sexual misconceptions. The part of the characters is tone, unusual naive as evident from the stock-farcical circumstances, than any open sexual desire. Actresses are not only accidentally lose their clothes to become prevalent in female characters. Richard O'Sullivan literally gets 'randy' (sic). The source of the Soft Soft Feature certainly ensures that old school's nudie cuties and naturism movies lie. My special interest in 'Au Pair Girls' is a fan of Gabrielle Drake. Any actress always looks good naked (she is slim or wonderfully curved), or if it comes to outfit (I love her from the original run of UFO - someone takes a purple wing!) My hat.
