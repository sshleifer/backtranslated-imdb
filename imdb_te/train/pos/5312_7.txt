<br /> The film is a special "alternative" or indie film. Suddenly changes the situation. Very important. <br /> <br /> Peaker is a boy in an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic inhabitants of a small town in which he lives. Suddenly, the alternative artist is going to make Peger's main inspiration for the urban people viciously, such as the fucker and fame. <br /> <br /> Now she does not care enough "for her" because her sexy girlfriend gets even mad. <br /> <br /> This indie film is not just for everyone but for everyone. It may seem boring or proud for some people, but I'd like to offer something "different" than Hollywood's distinctive standards. Ricky and John Waters movie. <br /> <br /> Oh and I forgot to say that nearly "Grace" lines are really annoying. Geez.
