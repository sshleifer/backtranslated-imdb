This film is so small, it's lovely !!! With Ron Libman (Major Vaughan), which provides the most entertaining on-screen diary of movie history. I have 2 copies of this movie in the video ... One of them, Ralph Macchiono was actually broken in the background at Major Wagon when he was in "Hash". In fact they forgot to fix this mistake, but the actors show how much fun it is when they can not keep a simple face!
