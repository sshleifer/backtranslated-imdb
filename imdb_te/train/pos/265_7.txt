Miss Lehmann has a lot of concern with a random, seemingly infringed robbery at her sister Boarding House. A ring, light bulb, a racksack, a lightweight, a stethoscope, a shoe ?? There's no rhyme or no reason. Miss Leman asks her owner, great Belgian detective, Hercule Porot, to examine this matter. Porotte is far worse than anything else than Miss Leman. If one of the students living in the boarding house was murdered, the feuds of the chariot were confirmed. <br /> <br /> <br /> Hickory Dickery Dock is one of the longest poetry series ever made, but not spectacular. I appreciate how confident it is written to Augusta Christie's original story. I realized that some liberties would be taken, yet I appreciate the work. What are the main elements of mystery? Smaller thefts, boarding house, students, peeled racks, and, of course, the ability of Porot to see something bad happen before something happens. With some exceptions, the cast of the students is almost as if I had painted it. The band includes Damien Lewis and Jessica Lloyd Standout. When I always enjoy David Suchet's Poirot, I'll get a real kick from the episodes with Philip Jackson's Inspector Japp and Pauline Moran's Miss Leman. The real treat is like this episode misses longer screen time than Miss Lemon Normal. Finally, I've always used a mouse as an observer of events in the host. <br /> <br /> I realized when looking back at Hickory Deckery Dock. Agatha Christie's work is one of the most sophisticated mystery mystery films, or Gialy 60s and 70s. Take the example of Ms. Nicolates as an example. If you close the graphic nature of the scene, you have something directly from the early 70s Giovanni. In fact, the entire plot of Hickory Decree Dock is used in Giollo. It is just curious and interesting enough to work with.
