Midnight cowboy is not for everyone. It's raw, painful, and realistic but fun. Leading actors Jon Woyt and Dustin Hoffman have made spectacular performances to become an Oscar-winning actors. Texas hustler Woite, Joe Buck migrates from the small town of Texas to New York City. He does not apologize to the chosen work but it's not easy. New York City Women, such as George Johnson and Richard, who have been nominated for Oscar, Sylvia Miles, are different from Texas women. Sadly, Buck is trying to escape from his past life in Texas. His grandmother, Sally Buck, was raised by Ruth White, who died of cancer in 1969. The relationship between Hofmann and Buck's roles plays a role in moving male into friendship. Men are struggling to survive New York City's life by playing the rules as to get a real job. When the film evolves, Buck's last surface comes up and it is not clear but clear. The film is not for children but the Midnight Cowboy may be more attractive compared to today's movies and television shows. I can not forget a young brenda and you are an unforgettable party. It's also a tearjerker of an image, so get your hankies too.
