The film has an overall size and greatness of many great biblical myths in the 1950s and 60s. But Bible characters are the first to discover themselves for mankind. The best thing about it is that it does not reduce the viewer's view. <br /> <br /> It is a unique and compelling balance to learn that even great people like David are erroneous to those who find their faith and greatness facing their shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Actors Gilbert Barnett has Susan Hayward as Beausheba as David's second son Absolam. Hayward is the best of the film. She is a lot at home where she is honest but bigger than acting life style. <br /> <br /> She is doing great work as a prophet Massa Nathan. As a child when watching the movie, Massie really spoke to the Lord himself and looked like a spectacular scene. Perhaps no other source of great music was composed by the other Albright Newman, as well as other biblical myths, such as "The Robb" and "The Greatest Story Ever Told" in other noble stories. Cinematography is done well by Leon Shamroi and adds volume, but there is also the intimacy of the film. Henry King, a really low-rated filmmaker who likes William Wear, does not retain himself in any genre, never lost the love story of David and Bathsheba and David's own struggle with his faith in God. The walk in this movie may be way too hokey, but the King keeps all the way true and interesting. Plus we never lose the mystery about trying to understand God's will, just as David himself is struggling with the same. In the first scene, a soldier tries to save the ship from death. Nathan's reply (paraphrase) was not satisfied that David could not understand the will of God. <br /> Finally, the film belongs to the magnificent Gregory Peck as King David. His David is a man who believes that you believe in a nation but one of the psalms is a loyal singer. This is one of his best performances. <br /> I can not see this movie on television, but when can I see it? I think it's still very well today.
