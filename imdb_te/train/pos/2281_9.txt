The Mother Knight is the most distinctive feature: The American Howard Campbell (Nolte), who lives in Berlin, is a CIA agent Major Wirenane (more specifically, to accept the role of a spy on a German, hell noth (lei): Goodman) Napier campaigner Campbell to enter the highest levels of the Hitler regime Appointed. However, the deal does not recognize the role of Campbell in the battle for the sake of national security reasons, so Campbell has become a reputable figure throughout the US. After the war, he tries to hide his identity, but he has come back to the past and haunts him. His only "friend" Wirtanen, but also can not make much for the sudden disaster of events that he will come upon the poor Campbell <br /> <br /> When we look at Campbell's tragedy, a great patriot who is deeply touched by the story surrounds him with everyone around them. It is not, but he also has their own secrets, even those who are very close to him. With Vannegat's moving environment, Campbell's frustration builds up and breathes almost the audience. <br /> Nolt plays my role in my life; He is even better than "suffering", although the two characters play tragedies that he intended for self-destruction. <br /> <br /> I read the book, so I can not guess how this film is appropriate. In any case, there is no significance here: my criticism is on everything else, and the film deserves a whole 9/10 cheerful.
