Chris and Andre both average, normal teens. Others misunderstood and selected by others. But together they pay all that stand out. They form "The Army of Two". They plan and plan "Zero Day". On that day they decide to suppress their high school and inevitably kill 14 people in cold blood. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is said to have been made by tapes, this is a fictional fantasy in the Columbine tragedy. </ P> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of those films. Two major actors (Calvin Robertson and Andrey Kick) all play a good role. Their performances are very believable, you're very fond of and this is scary. "Zero Day", which has almost a video shot from teen attitudes, feels very real and authentic. These kids try to rationalize their actions to the viewer and sell you to actors. But be warned that it will follow the tragedy from beginning to end and make some shocking and uncomfortable for the end.
