This is a very funny picture! I do not know if it has been translated into other languages. Ωστόσο, I think men around the world may find it to be "frank" and somehow with his thoughts! <br /> <br /> This cast is very fun and I enjoy the film too! <br /> <br /> All cast members have done well, and if the film is made in England, it might be a glorious hit around the world or US. <br /> <br /> If you are fortunate enough to understand the Swedish language, you're in for a treat.
