Warning !!! Dying toys !!! If you do not see this series do not read it! <br /> They say a few words and one coming out to explain a movie that they say last; Liars, cheats, and even some words can not do. But Elm Street 6: Freddie Dead shows everyone who feels this series is older and wants him to be seen, or the people who wish their hero (or il) to stop him for his last breath. <br /> The film starts with the simulator of the Wizard of Oz, then you will see the little boy named John Do, who is the last boy in Springwood, Ohio, and leaves the Freddie territory. A woman living in a hospital / place meets this boy to kill their feet, and at the same time, a man, a turret, and the secret promise of her in her mind goes back to Springwood to recognize this frightening sight, and she immediately learns that she is a child of Freddy And if his daughter had a sort of host for him We will soon find out vidicipedatamani eddi Springwood. And worse, fearing. <br /> <br /> The film features Rossne Bar and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp, and comedians and comedies. Playing a young Stoner who looks at the cyclist's vision of the flowers and the Iron Butterfly's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" mayor is the younger breeze, then trapped in a Super Mario parody. If you hate this movie or hate it like Kruger. Best.
