One of the best films of all time. <br /> <br /> The plot is very intuitive, the whole film is overwhelmed by all human emotions, even though it is a war film, it does not discriminate. I had to see this film more than any other time, and I can not always tire. This is a picture of your own death and beliefs that question what will happen after our death.
