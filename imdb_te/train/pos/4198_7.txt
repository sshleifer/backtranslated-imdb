Seeing a pickup in South Street, it is enchanting with a scene from a woman's treasury (JN Peders), a scene of a rude pick-up (Richard WIDMARK) work. Since acting from the whole cast is uniformly strong, B & W photography is crisp and adds the perspective of story and characters and is directed by Samuel Fuller John (ASPHALT Jungle) Huston. <br /> <br /> In fact, it has the same necessity as a hustle for a hysterical mistake - but the payment is not very strong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The hard-edge girl describing Widemark "knocked around a lot". She gives a lot of raw power and sex appeal to her role as the very bright woman carrying micro-film in her purse for her boyfriend (Richard Kyle), something FBI already about. <br /> <br /> The Thelma Ritter adds realistic to his realism to the so-called "mo" that sells and sells anything to earn a profit. Life. <br /> <br /> With Kille, she touched herself in the final scene. <br /> <br /> You can guarantee your attention to catch your attention within an hour and twenty minutes. Fox has been good for Nair and Widmark, Peters and Ritter's performances.
