For all Hoopla, honor and recognition This film comes from historians of Kung Fu, which still does not glow at some critical places: Action and struggle scenes. But I have to say that the plot is probably the best and most original I have ever seen in a martial arts film. Without a doubt, five deadly flutes need to be looked at, which is a movie that will see it again. But I should also think that you could have been better after looking at it. It leaves you wanting something, you want more. Producer Chang Chai presents the heroine's beautiful looks, but does not follow us by giving us more of what we want. The fighting styles in this film really capture the viewer (centipede, snake, scorpion, lizard, toad) and show up, but the wars are noticeable. Todd and Snake styles are particularly secretive and should be performed very well, in fact the toad will die in the middle of the film. Interestingly, the lack of continuous action or fight with the film leads to great plot development, which is one of the few Kung Fu films you may be interested in to care for the story and the outcome. The movie has a dark and toxic tone and you are pulled into the wibe. Evil weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the film and feel to movies. It takes us to a horrible prisoner to launch the film and introduce poison clan producer Chang Chen. The end fighting sequences are definitely good but look mild and something more you might expect. However, the film is the best and most enjoyable of Shah Shah Brothers. I end up with my complete impression of the film: The powers used are not shown and detailed in detail, the sad thing is that the director has objects for an unusual item at his fingerprint and does not spread over it. Let's see what I can do with this picture. 8 to 8 levels.
