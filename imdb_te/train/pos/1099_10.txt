The best image treatment of home-built difficulties in the country (or purchased) is your features, not the first or not the last. In 1940, Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were George S. The comedy starring Kauffman and Mass Hart played the lead roles in George Washington Slapt. Fifteen years ago she played a major role in Shelley Long and Tom Hanks the Monet Pit. The former is about going into a 18th-century country house ... wrong, need to work. Your Dream House was built in the following 1980s. <br /> <br /> Although Jim Blondings and his wife Muriel (Carrie Grant and Myna Loy) both have their movements, both are not as good as the blondes based on the autobiographical novel of the same name. Their two daughters, Jon and Betsy (Sherin Moffett and Connie Marshall), have seen the strong corners of their apartment. Although Blondings had a good income as an advertising executive (he earned $ 15,000.00 a year in 1948, it looks like today's $ 90,000.00) and lives in a luxury apartment - he was rented in New York City on that day! - He feels he must seek something better. He and Murali (Connecticut) take a drive and will soon find the old fall that they imagine are two dreams. <br /> They both lead to land and construction to buy the economic worm hole. For one thing, they are failing to challenge the warning given by Gangou Hoo as they intend to build such a house, a cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, in a well-forgiving role). For example, Jim bought a Connecticut dealer (Ian Wolfe, quietly sucking his chops) with a check before double checking the correct price in that area in Connecticut. He pointed out that he paid about five or six thousand dollars for land than it was worth. There are issues about water supply that Blandings do not just think about hard and soft water, just two - Zis - Zis can lead to water softening machine. They do not work together with their own designs and their architect (Reginald Denny), and they can not fall cheap by the decision of Murray's momentum to build a small cut that no one has planned. <br /> <br /> "The spam" of World War II has become a popular result, in which the meat of the people is substituted Jim is unable to catch up on this (he is not alone - one or two officers are stuck before him). <br /> "This little piggy ma Ketki went, <br /> <br /> He was pink and pretty ham. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "You know what he's going to do?" "<br /> <br />" Bill is flawless. But he's always around (obviously ignoring Bill Jim and Mariele without making mistakes). They have three illnesses, the best when locked in a room in a half-constructed house, as men have left the day. They can not open the doors, and the tube that makes the jim (panic) tries to break the door through the ram. He breaks a window and the door opens. <br /> <br /> The film is very satisfying, all actors are enjoyable. It's not really an age (despite changing price levels and salary levels). Most Americans have the time to own their own home. <br /> <br /> Many years ago, Pearl Company made a delightful scene with the paint company Marna Lai and Emory Parnell. To make different rooms. She carefully shows the shades of red, blue, etc. - a courtesan for a right shade of blue gives a single thread. The paint company indicated ads that have a variety of colors to choose from for your paint job. They proudly laughed the "Smita Blonds" advertisements in the campaign. When Lawn leaves him with his paint crew, incomplete parnell, you can imagine how the situation is handled.
