This is a small movie, some of which are theatrical. And yet you can not find elsewhere around Ireland. This film is Irland. All thanks to it, it's sad, it's self-stupidity. Boys, Master Doyle, SP O'One, The Cannon, Senator Duggan's daughter, Gary and all on Mudgee. I know them. I'm in the pub with them or kneeling to pray with them. They are our sad history and they are our present.
