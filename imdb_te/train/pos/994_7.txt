I have seen this movie once and can see it again, but I think if Jamie Fox is good in the film, they could use the lesser role as Alvin Sanders. Foxx's scenes were fun in the jail faced by Edgar Klerten (David Morse). David Morse again played an outstanding role in a police role. His tough and more quiet qualities are appropriate for his role. Once again, Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater. Morse, Hutchinson struggles. This is perfect for everyone in the film. I personally love that movie in a movie, where the actors end up in the same situation as the previous film, both of these scored in Green Mile. Overall is a good picture.
