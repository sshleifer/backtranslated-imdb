Using Buster Keaton in his career's twilight is an interesting option. He may be the most talented comedian at the age of silence. It gives him a chance to showcase the talent for a short time travel. He gets hooked up with a guy living in modern times, and we become clear that Keaton has been left with the best in our own times that can well be his focus gags. I've heard his voice before. I believe that I've done some of those beach party movies, and some are playing vacant characters to earn some bucks. Serling respected him and painted it. This is not a bad story. It shows what a reaction will be when we want something to do.
