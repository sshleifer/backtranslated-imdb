<br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I watched it. But I was forced to defend this gem against those who forbade this gem. <br /> <br /> Here are some interesting and unusual to observe different views. It's what I think is humorous. This is a subjective. It's 60,000 volts through your funny bone or cooler, why you wonder why you gave up. <br /> <br /> Some of the best comic actors in the event are irrelevant and the result is happy. The dialogue and visual comedy is beautifully delivered and the two leads (Cleves and Low) are fantastic. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do. In the world you are not discouraged and delicate humorous, it's a classic discomfort and dangerous piece of humor.
