I love playing football and I think this film is great because I am so great. This is a good Hollywood / Bollywood film and I have won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are good and Archie Punjabi. Jonathan Reeves is the greatest of the Mayors coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves to play football but her parents want to know how to get married. While Jazz plays secretly for a football team, she joins her coach Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Joe (Jonathan Rice Myers). When her parents get into trouble, her father allows her to play a big role in her Pinky (Archie Punjabi) wedding. At the end of her parents learn how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play.
