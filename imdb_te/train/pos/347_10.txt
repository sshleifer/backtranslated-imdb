Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films. Death scenes are extensive and acting are very good. Marley Shelton was great as a female leader ("I'm No ..." is better than Jennifer Love Hewitt). David Bournez, the main reason I saw this film, had a pretty little role, but he played well. Denise Richards is the exception to a good actor list. She is terrible in this regard. I'm happy to see her * Spoiler * Her death scene. All in all, it is a good image to watch. You must see it before you see "Scream" or "I Know You ..."
