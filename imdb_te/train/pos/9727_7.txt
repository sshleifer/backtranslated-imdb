Simone Peg is often associated with a barrage from a well-known reporter who brought from England to work for a big American magazine. His triumph of course creates all kinds of problems. Entertaining facts based comedy, such as Kristen Dunst (looking rather risky), Danny Huston, and Jeff Bridges. Although Simon Pegg is his bad behavior, we mainly work. We fully understand why Kristen Sundt speaks to him despite his often screws. I liked the movie. It's not all and everything is all but a nice way to an evening-off hat sitting on the couch looking at it all the movies. <br /> <br />
