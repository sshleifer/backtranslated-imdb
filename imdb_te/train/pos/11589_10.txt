Man, I loved this movie! It really takes me back when I was a child. The days when teachers are still showing movies in real-to-reil and you'll see that if you're good, they slowly take back the movie. I still remember one of the early lines ... "Thatagima is his name, and he is an orphan, and he lived with his sister in the village." This is a great movie for kids and tolerance like a red balloon. Finally, other Indian boys in the village attach feathers to the turtmzima and he is a hawk. He gets to live as he always wants. He gets to fly in the sky.
