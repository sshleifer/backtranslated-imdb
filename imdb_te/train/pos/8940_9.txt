The autobiography based on this film is one of the most heartfelt books I've ever read. It tells the fairy tale of two sisters, who earned 70 years of devotion and dignity as their teacher and dentist, and lived for another 30 years. The rebellious "black" Bessie steals the film with a full-blown performance by Ruby Dee as a dentist. She expresses her anger, anger, and wisdom; They will tell you where they came from using the term economics. Diann Carroll's sister, the teacher, has full feelings, but I'm afraid she believes that she is over 100 years old. Anyways - stories are worth the say. Amy Madigan is a bit too intense and intrusive overwhelmed and insecure acting in the first half of the movie as the Caucasian NY Times Reporter. It's also very subtle. While stories, all the facts, the attraction and the slightest damage in two or three translations, most of them are made up of fine. What books. I'm not in the rare air of this TV movie, but it definitely captures the most expensive of its own right.
