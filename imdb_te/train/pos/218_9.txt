Jack Albertson and Sam Levine Broadway starring Walter Mattu and George Burns are playing a band in a couple of vintage instrumental Willyville Comics, Joe Smith and Charles Dale, who appear to have a different perspective on life. /> <br /> Walter Matthau can not stop working, the man did not learn to relax, take some time and smell the roses. He is a crotchety old-fashioned cousin whose best days behind and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin finds him less and less work. <br /> <br /> 15 years ago, his partner George Burns decided to rest with his family. <br /> <br /> Benjamin hits a brain storm, the guys return and do it on a national television special. What happens here is pretty fun. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys are a sad, bitter story. Matta is on the screen for a lot of film, but it was exemplified by Oscar at the age of 79. <br /> <br /> Burns brought a piece of the movie. Well. We all know Barnes & Allen's amazing comedy team, which is very borrowed from the Punton troops from the Mandy. In 1958, Gracie Allen retired for health reasons and George stayed for about 100 years. Or at least pretty close to an active actress. <br /> <br /> Sunshine relies on the boys team. If Smith & Dale and you like Sunshine Boys I strongly recommend you see two Tickets on Broadway for a look at a pair of boys who have made fun of the American people at the turn of the last century. Dr. Sketch, who is Matthew and Barnes, is directly from their point of view. <br /> <br /> I think you like the Sunshine Boys.
