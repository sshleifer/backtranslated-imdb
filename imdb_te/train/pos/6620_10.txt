If the answer to this question is yes, then you should enjoy this wonderful movie. I watched here a few hours ago in Paris (where the film is going) and the massive trauma I received behind my eyes could still experience ... no visual shock! I have never seen such a beautiful black & white photo and such a drastic change in animated films. I have seen in the past and after "revival" as I've seen with the Penaar movies or Akira and Ghost InTheShell experiences in the past and it is a true success in the animated films world and I am a French French studio ...) I hope it will win and recognize that it deserves I. Viv la France!
