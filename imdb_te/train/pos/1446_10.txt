Al Pacino is always in bad film His name is a revenge for top lyricist. It's a good show as he's always given. Pacino is an American Oliver. And a good political thriller they get. There are no good boys and bad guys. But the system has its unpredictable effect on the people they think they are running. Pacino's performance is troublesome --- is immensely powerful at the funeral of a dead child --- improves the best performances without accelerating the film gimmicks, which has fast, naive reality. This outstanding film in big city politics also contributes to a two-hour splendid image by looking at overly aggressive, over-the-counter sex or gutter language. Is murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. This film has revived my frustrated faith in Hollywood. I do not give a lot of tens. This one deserves great!
