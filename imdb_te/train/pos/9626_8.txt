Warning! <br /> I saw the film in German, so I lost some credentials. </ P> <p> In the plot, this is a picture from me. I especially liked the performance of Lexus Dog. Sometimes I got to stamp, she * called * Camille *. But I'm wondered what happened to Bob, Cassie and the baby's end. After I first put it on Bob, she loved him and forced him to sleep with him, worrying what had happened with her brother. Otherwise it's a bit strange to take her baby and love it. It determines until viewer - and I do not like such conclusions. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain as good as ever, Eric Roberts .. Well, I saw him well but still worse. <br /> <br /> This film is an analysis of human relationships and unexpected situations. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, I liked it very much.
