DEVIL'S PLAYING is my second attempt to produce Joseph Sarno - and although I say painfully dull and unerotic Swedish is much more enjoyable than WilddCats, it is still a little slow and un obvious for my taste. <br /> <br /> These centers, surrounded by a group of vampire girls living in a castle, are seeking to resurrect their previously murdered "leader". To do so, the girls have to dance around the naked and kiss each other and hymn weird stuff - and of course also drink some blood. When a doctor and her brother's car break up and they want to stay in the castle for their stay - they offer the ideal blood for horns and vampires ... but they may not be as helpless as they are ... <devil's playing A good example of contributing to exploitation. The nudity of the nakedness - including some full frontals, some serious experiments - are both spontaneous and of course, including Lesbose-blood skiing ... But these scenes are still beautiful by today's standards. Some pretty hot women in these beautiful, some will get a more explicit sexual gain, but I guess I have it all. Because it is a vampire movie, it has benefited from some heavy violence / lamb, but the purpose of the devil is not blood, the skin is more to show. Still a bit slow - and most of the acting is completely woody - but in this era and expecting something from this budget. One way to exploit the fans is valuable - others find it very dull to like it. 7/10
