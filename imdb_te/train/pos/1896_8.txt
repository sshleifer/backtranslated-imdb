For two reasons, Arthur has always been a personal picture for me. A good friend who worked in the film and helped with horses in a recent live scene. If you look fast, you can see Frank Graham in the restaurant scene in the background, Dudley Moore and Jill Auckberry. <br /> <br /> <br /> Frank is a champion hunter and he misses all who know him. <br /> <br /> Even though I'm the second one, I really know the real Arthur Bach. He was not very wealthy as Arthur, but lived his life in the life of a child, primarily as a child of 47 years. His parents strictly controlled his purse strings, but his rent and benefits were paid in the basement of Greenwich Village. As in the case of Deadly Moore, he made himself public on the drugs in his soul and made himself public. <br /> <br /> Are you stunned with Arthur? But the remaining half of that equation. My friend is a lovely guy to know him. In fact it's almost as good as it is. He could not afford a newspaper or a magazines without trying to create some level of association with the seller. He spent his life a perfect party guest. <br /> <br /> In the 19th century, the word in common usage applies to him. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is a flame. Unlike my friend Moore, John Geelgood was not willing to clean him up. It is a full-time job if it is proven in Arthur. My friend was also actually Liza Minnelli, actually found a male Liza Minnelly because he was gay. <br /> <br /> Moore's description of Arthur Bach is terrible and accurate to me. <br /> <br /> Arthur, a 20th century waste, was forced to marry another Trust Fund baby at Jill Aikenberry. Because he does not work for a lifestyle, the fear of the cut is very true of him. He portrays his Butler Hobson by John Geelgood and has only a driver bitter man managed by Ted Post to lose his problems. <br /> <br /> In his nearly century, John Geelgood certainly worked better than Arthur in the film, and in fact Gielgood was very popular for his stage performances. Also in the 1981 Oscars sentiment year. The Academy provided Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn for Oscars on Golden Pand and Gilgad's best supporting actor for lifetime work. <br /> <br /> I dedicated this review to Frank Graham, who worked in the film, to Jackie Wees, the real reality artist.
