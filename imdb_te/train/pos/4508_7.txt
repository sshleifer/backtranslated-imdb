I was impressed by the beautiful photography of this movie, which was filmed in the city of Alaska. Although technically a play, we see that Eskimos are engaged in hunting, dancing, igloo, etc. and their rituals and their wives and visitors. Hunting range ranges sometimes come from stock footage, because some of the animal's rear projection scenes are easy to spot, but they are also lovely. Spear fishing for Salmon, Wallace, Curabou and a polar bear and hunting for whaling can sometimes appear as a documentary. There is no cast to strengthen the documentary taste. Motion picture producers tried to make it look more authentic with locals speaking only in an Eskimo language that was translated by the screen or the Internet. Unlike White traders and Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there are no actors in the film, but this is not true. Eskimos was born to both Mala and Lotus Long, but earlier actors were professional actors with credits and you could sometimes see in the decoration. But they are fantastic in their roles and they have Hollywood career. In all, the image is definitely worth a look.
