'Nude Kelly' is an amazing film to honor as an amazing Australian hero. <br /> <br /> "Whoever gives you all the aesthetic shows will bring life to the film. (Great Job, Heath!) Orlando has played a wonderful, quiet, lucrative female role as Bloom Joe. I was wiped out in the moment. <br /> <br /> Some of the elements in the film are fictional, as an avid Ned Kelly fan (and supporter), a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> To make life more enjoyable for Kelly Gong's / Ned's life, this film may have gone a long time - I thought it would not be adequately covered. <br /> Regardless of some disadvantages, this moving picture, all kinds of emotions. (And hey, I'd assume this film is better to watch than Mick Jagger rather than trying to portray Ned ...)
