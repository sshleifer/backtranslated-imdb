"War Inc." For ridiculous ridiculous ludicrous sensation or sensational humor for news fans. <br /> <br /> You know, the political points of the filmmakers are already known to all the people who know the truth of the fairytale random stories, stock characters (John Cusack, Jon Cusack, Marisa Tommy and Hilary Duff) . Yes, battles are profitable, corrupt pigs, politicians are more barbaric bubbles, and American imperialism has never been seen as more cholesterol and more surviving than now. <br /> <br /> Here, all the noise of that noise is that Leupon - sometimes intellectual paths - John Cusack's character (hits), attempts to change his life, who he (Tommy) and his marriage (Duff) Who leads the uninformed young Middle East who wants to call him. Cusack's sister, Joan, plays almost all of his assistant with cartoonish enthusiastic quality. Ben Kingsley seemed to waste me in his small part of the cruel CIA boss. <br /> That's it, it works. It's fun, but if you can not see reality and that the war is going well and it's a good job for everyone involved and there's no corruption in the Middle East and our Western culture wants to replace them <br /> All of us, it's a political edge Light is comedy.
