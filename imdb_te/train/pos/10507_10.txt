This game is amazing. If you do not, it really should. It's old when it comes out but it's wonderful. I believe that this game is always classic. It's as good as a Super Mario World. When I was young, I would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat my friend and I finally did. It is not nearly as super mario as the Galaxy, but it is necessary if you're a fellow Mario fan. It's fun entertaining and challenging. Everything that you want to come out of the Fantasy game except good graphics (which came in 1996.) 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI ON ROCK !!! Nintendo is the best!
