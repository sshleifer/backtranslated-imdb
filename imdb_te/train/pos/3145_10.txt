That 70 show is the best TV show ever. It is in Andy Griffen Show, Saturday Night Live, and The Simpsons in my book. The 70s lasted for 8 seasons, all of which separated from their parents, and a group of young adults separated from their parents / adolescents and their entire futures. <br /> <br /> The two main characters, Eric and Donna, are two young men gearing across the door. They live on the door next door to each other and feel the feeling of each other at the beginning of the first season. <br /> <br /> Two other characters, Red and Kitty, Eric's parents. He is in red service, so he turns around Eric. Kitty is just the opposite. Although she drinks too much, she takes care of Eric and his friends very carefully. Bob, their neighbors, is clearly the father of Donna. Bob is tied to many women across the coarse of Bob's story. <br /> <br /> The rest of the character, Hyde, Kelso, Faz and Jackie, Eric are friends. <br /> They were great for the first season. This is when the characters start to feel new things for each other. The first season is original, funny and fun. <br /> <br /> The second season is good, but the first one is not as good. It is the basic continuation of the first. Eric and Donna are together, and everything works great. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. It went back and seized the first season feel and humor. I also think that the role of the chemistry is a better, more fun to see that show. <br /> <br /> The fourth season is not good. Eric and Donna both participated in the show, the show was less fun. <br /> <br /> For the fifth season my last season I enjoyed all the way. It's the gang's senior year, so really helps the story. The fifth season ended in all seasons. <br /> The sixth season is pretty good. It does not capture the feel of a lot of funny and other seasons. The gang is out of high school, so I believe that the previous seasons did not touch the teen feel. <br /> <br /> The Seventh Season has the same feel of having something in the fifth season but it is not all the way. <br /> <br /> "Eric is not it, it has destroyed it." Kelso was not in much of it, it did not help <br /> <br /> If you have enjoyed the whole comedy, try these 70s once they've stopped making new episodes but still have a bunch on TV. Even if you are advised to buy it Hours. If you want to buy a season 8, which is for you.
