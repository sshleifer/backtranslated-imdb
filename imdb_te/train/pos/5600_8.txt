This is my kind of cinema. I was fascinated with strange mental nightmares and this is that movie. But it's also a dark comedy. When I see it as a horror / thriller, there are others who see it as a black dramatic comedy. <br /> <br /> But, anyway, it's an attractive descendant of madness. The end caught me off guard, but one end! <br /> <br /> A powerful script with powerful shows, complex and detailed storyline, dances of horror and humor, and extreme atmosphere, makes it worth watching the movie. /> <br /> Personally, I think I need to look at this several times to pick up and understand all the subtleties inside. But it is a pleasure that is a pleasure and not a fate.
