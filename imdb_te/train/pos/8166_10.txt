This image is so great! The acting was the best, Corbin Bernsen's best performers dramatized as a dentist perfect for those who tortured him and his patients. Initially he sees his wife Pulaiman, and then he goes crazy. He gets revenge on his wife and Pulman, and he is a victim of sickness. There are also some special losses, but some are actually fake (outside outside night, and in the morning are still red). But torture scenes are well done. Despite the weak point this picture is very slow; Sometimes just extremiously boring episodes between heavy parts. But this must be true for a real horror / thriller fan!
