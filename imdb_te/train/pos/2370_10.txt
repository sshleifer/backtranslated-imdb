It is a great American martial arts film. The action scenes were pretty impressive for the American film created in the 90s. In fact, the scenes of action are not as good as in Hank Kang movies, and in fact some American films are also faring scenes in Hank Kang films. When you look at the images of American martial arts, you look forward to looking at some of the most intuitive fighting scenes, but have some nice moves, sometimes it's surprisingly good or at least I look forward to these pictures. This film impressed me. Some of the action scenes are really attractive, acting, directing, and plot are good, so it's a really good movie if you like 90s American Martial Arts films.
