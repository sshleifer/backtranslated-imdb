I remember this movie many years ago. Definitely the best film on the subject in my experience. After a long time I was very clear in the film that the evidence of its effect. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment on the level of demonstrations due to language barrier. <br /> <br /> These subjects have passed a long time. <br /> <br /> It is the most effective place in the correct ratio of historical perspective and skepticism. <br /> <br /> I would like to show at least once on TV. Or at least tape or on DVD. Or is it? Some art film archives
