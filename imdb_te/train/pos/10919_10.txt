Five deadly flutes are not bloody and violent, but it has some of the best hand-held scenes in Hong Kong's history. Director Chang Chuh creates what many people think of his work. The film opened five men's career. Another bad donkey plays Meng. He went to stay in super ninjas. Philip goes to Kuki Chui Ricky and hard-boiled story, quacked. No chop socky fan can apperciate this. But I still think it's not as good as super ninja (also made by Chang Chen). But all the chop socky is good and this is one of the very best.
