People forget that there are many King Kong ripoffs- Kongo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), they all blame each other, but YETI is on its own. It takes only one element from King Kong and is the attraction of the animal's animal. <br /> <br /> Yetti relies on myth of Bigfoot (not like King Kong) and archaeologists are once attracted to it <br /> <br /> The film is hard to come by, but it is worth watching. For the first time in the early 1980s I saw "Elvis's Mistress of the Dark Shows". It was a baby boy and sent my spine cold, especially YETI madly. I saw again at about 1:00 pm ABC 2 to 3 years ago. Looking again I appreciate it, it will have some good effects (its time) and the story is a mute boy and his dog, and a nasty businessman who wants to kill YETI for his own purposes. The music is pretty cool, its very much like YETI. <br /> <br /> Gianfranco created a great monster like Parrolini and Atier's atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Vote.
