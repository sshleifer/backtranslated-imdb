Well, I think it's emotionally from the first film I went to see in more than 10 times in the film ... helping me through my master thesis or keeping me from doing it! <br /> <br /> After looking back for many years (and several movies) - this is a well-designed mini gem! I did not see Gwyneth Paltrow in a more intimate presentation, and did Jeremy North perfect Mr Knightley - a guy? Ms. Tony Colette brings Muriel a lot to her Harriet, and convinced by Ivan McGregor is lovely - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson is the perfect "impossible" as Sophie Thompson's turn is as disappointing as any of the casting and cast of the cast's best (oh, napkins, sorry!) "Couple! <br /> <br /> However, most of the cinematography and art decorations go hand in hand with scenes and clothing, and beautiful soundtrack, the atmosphere of the movie almost like a hobbit - but it is almost the case in visual overload. Very beautiful, but a little more hard times can give a better feel. <br /> <br /> "The distinctive favorite ball scene - here are some beautiful acting and directing, and the ending dance is just pretty The relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightley is the final proposal scenario going to just a couple of shots (I can think about them!) Just a little longer, and it has a lot to keep with the rest of the picture. (I read the imdb lists) - he seems to be going to him as an actor, just a gentleman English heartbeat! Hmm, I need to pay my video store visit <br /> <br /> Lovely image of my favorite Jane Austen adaptation so far - perhaps Ang Lee's sense and sensibility Liti, strictly speaking, the better the image, the one closest to my heart - and I'm sure you've seen it so many times! <br /> <br /> You can see it - it more difficult for small errors. <br /> <br />
