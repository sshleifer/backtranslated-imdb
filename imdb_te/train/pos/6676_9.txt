<br/> <br /> <br /> Who is this "Mystery Men"? Simply put, Mystery Men is trying to drive their adolescent fantasy lives while pushing both sub-heroes, their original identities and their super identities. Shoveller (Bill Macy) will do construction work during the day, leaving his wife and children at home in the night, and he will do the cruise on the street looking for crimes to overcome his extraordinary and unique transparent style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azari) sells fresh silver to the day and eats the carpets at night at Crackpot Villains, if his mother does not keep him busy with the latest Snoop. Mr. Furious works in a junk yard to earn his salary, then threatens his frustration over his friends, who is really angry at him by repelling a leaner who hears at night with a friend and foe?). Ben Stiller is breathing that life in this role, you can not love him, but he can not love him. <br /> <br /> These three nights tried to capture their nights 'glory moment'. Super heroes. Obviously, it can happen. Champion City Amazing, after all ... Super police fighting with a flying, an extra bullet or two with enough corporate logos on his clothes to stop. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear turns into a stellar performance as a middle-aged seller trying to get back his fans' attention. <br /> <br /> In order to bring back additional extra magic that can restore these contracts, Casanova abandoned Frankenstein, the WAAAAAY over-the-top top has been continually shaken by the Garry Rush. This lunatic created a 'manofrakulter' to create a genius champion City as a reflection of his own pianists ... and C.A. Within hours of release from jail. It remains the Mystery Men only to stop Frankenstein's nasty plan, but with the help of the disco boys Frankenstein, the trio needs little help. <br /> <br /> The appointment begins and after the painful recruitment party, the team has settled with The Bowler (Janeine Garofo), the only real talent in the team, and her secret bowling ball will not disappear with her father's revenge inspiration; The invisible boy (Kell Mitchell), who says that he is invisible when he does not see him; The cartilage (Paul Rubens) granted the mysterious powerful fatty acoustic gypsy; And the lesser-used snicks (Wesstoodi) show that with his mind the ability to cut guns in half, the rest of the movie spends most intrinsically and more acting. <br /> <br /> This image is really a cross-genre romp. Anyone interested in pigeon-hole movies in small groups is fighting a losing battle. This is a spoof / parody of the superhero style - the comic-book genre is pretty cool for fake-burton sets unlikely recycled (occasionally decorated with more spoof materials) But at the same time, it is a serious superhero film, as well. Both at once. It does not have a particular idea (for example, reflecting the short-term Inferior Five work of D.C. Comics, which is in some ways), it is very innovative for the big screen. It requires the suspension of disbelief to accept anyway comic book world, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if the superheroes are true, these guys will be real. If Big Guy flies around New York City, you can see half a dozen news reports about idiots in underwear who kicked their baskets daily. Sure, Schoelyller is fighting pretty well, and Blue Raja leads all parts of the world with great accuracy. But what makes them real super heroes? <br /> <br /> This movie is a dark though humor. When showing up the inevitable, super-heroine's patented funniest nature. A leaner will fly as the comic manages off to dismiss several bits to play off the stage. Especially in the janene garrofo with bowling ball / father. However, it is not comedy in the sense of dividing laughter or ever-memorable jokes on the sides. <br /> <br /> It makes a good movie for Mystery Men, and in the end it is very good. The weaker / lame good guys are ultimately justified and, for a shining moment, really become superheroes; Justice; And the movie ends with a scene of realism (as realistic as possible in a world where the bowling balls fly and make the glasses the perfect disguise). Even if the viewer tries to label this image, the film might be a great act. <br /> <br /> No movie is accurate. Although Claire Forlany has played a key role in his conscience, Mr. Furious is frustrated and ignorant of love. Tom Wates is confused by Dr. Heller who gets confused by his own songs, but in his early scenes, retirement ladies in nursing home are worth watching alone. And villians are never more than gun-toting beetles (the image of an image). Cinematography is chaotic and confusing (in the average comic book, so it is fun), the music sometimes increases the scene and the special effects are not well integrated into the rest. <br /> <br /> And, overall, this film is fantastic. <br /> You're probably a comic fan and superhero genre to really appreciate the movie, but it's a nice way to kill a fun story and a few hours and let your brain relax. <br /> <br /> In my opinion 8/10.
