Despite the gorgeous and breathtaking animation, it's one of the most bold Disney films I've ever seen, and I can not slam Disney movies too often. Spirit is a ruthless prowess, who is captured by cavalry or Indians, both trying to "break" him. Spirit creates a bond with the Indian, and briefly, this is the story. Except the beautiful animation of horses, I am very excited by my or five year olds or happy with this film. It's ridiculous, named "Spirit", the film is a bit more used. An extraordinary point was given to the soundtrack of songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And if this movie is rated G, you probably will probably end up explaining your five year old meaning "breaking your horse". <br /> <br />
