I enjoyed it in the film. I am confident that Matt Stone and Trey Parker is the company that is our time comic manius. They have an extraordinary ability to add this level to absurdity to pop culture, and this makes it a non-reconstructive realistic way ... if there is any sense. This is mainly because South Park makes soooo funny. The fact that you are ever a very unpleasant and unpredictable cartoon is that once you see the message being reported in each episode. It is obvious in BASEketball. Despite the complete rebuilding of David Zucker, it has the honest message about corporate America and the league of major league games. Since I am a fan of this sport, I realize that the film is happy at times because of the love that people hated to hate. The initial number one is brilliant ... every time tears from the smile form I see that footballers start Riverdance! Some may not like this movie because it's not everyone's tea cup ... But, like South Park, once you see before absurdity ... there is a real message that has been revealed by the literary comic genius. I gave the film 8 out of 10 stars.
