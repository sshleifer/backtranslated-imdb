The movie is good to see the entire family together. Jos√© Bisset and Rob Estes (who were married in real life) had to play a married couple in a wedlock in Las Vegas, then their children were forced to break the news, but then their families (two boys and two girls) joined a complex family unit. If there is a real pleasure for Kari and Jims, what happens when a group of four teenagers, two ancestors and two young children join for the first time. The struggles between children (and a small love affair between them) can be astonishing if everyone can ever get together. More interesting than Brady Bunch, it's a totally joyful way to spend a couple hours. Recommended for all ages to feel good.
