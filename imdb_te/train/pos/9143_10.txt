Although it was 1984, it seemed like an Orwellian nightmare like George Orwell's science fiction novel! 1984 has become one of the happiest times in American history !! The growth of the economy, and the ideology of renewed renewed innocence in basic American values, which saw the American people with a very sacred attitude! There have been many seasons of classic movies in the past, but it is considered the best of the original! "Purple rain" in this category of the movie !! Made in 1984, "Purple Rain" provided eighty-day doggreel, happy-go-lucky quality music, which merged into this amazing film production! The specific artifacts of the eighties are actually classic !! Screwball comedians, neon extreme dresses, and of course, the music !! Eighties Music is considered by the best decade experts in American history! "Purple Rain", set in Minneapolis, uses innocent entertainment with the changing times of the city. I lived in Minneapolis for eight months when I was a little boy, and then the non-white population was less than 3%! By 1984, African Americans made some roads in Minneapolis, so they established a strong embedded culture of theirs! The "Purple Rain" film inspired eighty-year-old dress and music band, which attracted viewers to film audiences !! I loved music as "Purple Rain", which leads to a clash of success in the innovative manner, in fact, intelligent !! Watch this movie if you have not already seen !! Prince became the Eighties Icon with this work !! For a short time, he's dating Kim Bissenzar, he must work correctly! Put the Prince on the map of "Purple Rain" !! This film is my strongest assertion of Thumbs UP !!!!
