The film is released by Roger Corman, so you know that filmmakers do not have enough money to work. <br /> <br /> Some viewers of the movie will lose the thumbnails because it is the most common "killer" type marketing approach, with special distinctions about the film. <br /> <br /> Amanda, who is clearly a talented Justine Priest, is a difficult character. Some people, such as these films, certainly look at violence at random, but here is the last abuse (dealing with a realistic but tasteless manner) How Amanda's Psychosis Forms is Created. Surprisingly, Amanda will eventually change herself with an action in love, all of which are distinct, fighting with death, and the evil character finally ultimately dies badly. <br /> <br /> These are some tough edges in the film, but I have to give it 10 out of 10 based on originality and yes, originality compared to the original - especially budget.
