This is definitely the most impressive, amazingly fun children's film with absolutely the most attractive novice novel witch. Unlike many modern stories found in dark witchcraft, it's just a beautiful, light and beautiful Hachetz Poacas magic story. <br /> <br /> The story began in the English village of Peppering Eye, Charlie, Carrie, & Paul Rawlins, three cocky children, and second world war, from the threat of city air strikes. They were wrongly sent to live with Egententine Price, studying the course of correspondence to become an apprentice witch. Eglantine and children's trilogy use a magic bed bulb to go to London on their bed. Here they face Emilia Brown, the fraudulent mastermind of Miss Perry's witchcraft training faraway school. Miss Pryce works on charms designed to bring in lifeless items to life. Meanwhile, they also must deal with the shadow character named Bookman and his colleague, Swinburne. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury's Excellent training of the extraordinary witch, of course, is as lovely as the cost. David Tomlinson now plays the role of Mr. Brown, the headmaster of Witchcraft School that does not work on street magician. The actor had previously acted as Father's Child in Mary Papins. In fact, the film was originally a memorable of the memories of Mary Papins, fantastic fantasy stories for children. Probably not like the chim-chim-cheery, the film does not have a lot of surprise music, but it looks a little more attractive to the small voices. Some are complicated, but the film has amazing special effects. For all, the story is a family fun. If modern children are very advanced to this lovely & lovely story, it should appeal to all of us.
