I saw the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on the Strauss Cable TV network. This is one of my most joyful viewing experiences, without my message! It portrays the creative talent responsible for the San Francisco Bay Area artists and some of the best films ever made. Along with well-known artists, Irwin Kershner also has a section on Caleb Deschannel and Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on DVD-it is essential for any collection of movie history and excellent film making. If you are interested in movies and the ones who create them, you will not be disappointed.
