Om Puri, Smita Patil, Sadashiva Amraparar and Total Chemistry are the best of the story and direction of the novel by Govind Nihalani. The conversations made by Vijay Tendulkar are great. <br /> I do not see another movie like this. It has a whole, each piece is so nicely suited to the plot. You will not be impressed by this film. <br /> <br /> Amrul Puri came as Ori Puri's 'Bap' as Ori's husband. Om Puri is a young man who holds his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sathasiva as Ramana Shetty gave her a smile and a soft spoken villain with proper touch. The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Ram Phettu at the site of Sadashiv is incomplete. Smita Patil did not play the lead role, but her part did not even distract attention from the main storyline. <br /> <br /> In addition, the Coffee Enamader system plays a police role dealing with its performance. Saying the right things in the right places and knowing how to get away from the trouble. <br /> <br /> He is also a 'mum' teacher and helps him when he gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> The film does not only focus on the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also on the side of brutality in police custody. Om Puri Ardhi captures the desires of despair and breakdown in this extraordinary performance of Satyagraha. <br /> A treat for all avid fans of Indian films.
