Who is such an obscure little picture who is very haunting and touching? I was really impressed. This is a shame that most people can not see. As always, I liked Hans Zimmer's score. And the role played by Bernard Ross! I still want to call this horror movie. It can easily argue that it is a fantasy or play. Well, regardless, I have the potential love of commenting. Annie (played by Charlotte Burke) everyone and everyone can refer to a real confrontation in her life ... house, tree, marc, lighthouse etc. This image is very good for recurring views. Some people will soon count on another small picture loaded with this emotion and psychological meaning.
