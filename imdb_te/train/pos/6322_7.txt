This image is recommended to a friend. I did not see an ad or trailer, so I do not know I was in Clooney and I was not really worried that her character was too short. I thought the whole cast was ideal, and the film was pretty good. I immediately caught my attention when standing on the road, opening the scene, kicking and ignoring the bandits with little crew. It's a way to say, "Do not go away, it's not boring", and it's not really. It turned out to be an interesting, lightweight humor with enough twists and turns to keep you in your seat at the very end, but when the end came, I felt a little cheating .... just a little. These events have been built so you expect them to be constructed, but I can not define it at a time, which is somewhat disappointing. I guess a big bang of a climax, but it's sort of low key. If you look at the picture with the picture and you can live without George Clooney's high doses, the film is very entertaining and good looking. Now I want to see the original (Big Deal in Madonna Street), but it's probably rare in the United States.
