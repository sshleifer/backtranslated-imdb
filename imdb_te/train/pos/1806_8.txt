I wish children movies were still made this way; Dark and deep. The character development (and the essence of the dynamic character of Charlie) is plot development, amazing animation, emotional involvement, and a rational, relatable, and consistent theme. Otherwise for song and dance routines, you would never have thought of it as a children's film, and that's why I give such a high rating. This film is a wonderful movie, let alone for a child's film. My second point brings me to: This was the film I had seen in quite some time dark "kids'" film, coming from a 22 year old. I was surprised to see no baby under 8 years old. Many are afraid of the amount of the second half and some are not afraid of the first half of the film, and it's all you can ever see (Alla "Jurassic Berak", "Futurama" fans for you), and that's what makes this film so much better. The film promotes emotions around the world because we do not think and do not usually feel unexpected, the film does not do badly; In fact, this has succeeded. Good funny films make us laugh; Good horror movies need to scare us; Good lamentable movies make us sad. My point is, good movies are supposed to move you, not just fun; <br /> Also, the film is very violent by today's standards for a children's film and, according to today's standards, is not suitable for some children. Parents, I'll see first. I'm not saying anything about this kind of thing, but I've seen this yesterday and I'm also surprised.
