I've seen movies for a country, getting good enough to distribute them ... putting things that are not cut. I'm not saying that I know more than anyone else on this basis, how come I see "Lou Gospel" ... anyway ... very bad movies on my desk and I actually sit through them all. I normally do "watch" when the scan works, and I usually see on TV at times when the product value, performance, and good article is being presented. If somebody is holding my eye, I'll take the time to see it. "Lou" caught me in the first few minutes of shutting my laptop and sat on my chair wheels for the TV, so I was able to tune it completely. I do not need to say that I got caught up in the whole movie. The story is well said, the characters are lovely or repulsive (depending on the intent of the actor and the directors) and all played well. Sometimes I work on camera and editing occasionally attracting amateur errors, but the emotional nature of the story makes it easy to remove these mistakes. I heard other people's comments brought tears to their eyes, at other times a lot of pleasure ... I laugh for a minute and hit the next one and much by the film. Unfortunately I did not get it because - going on saying - a week late and a dollar short. It's the way it sometimes goes ... but at least I have the pleasure of seeing this one and I can not wait to see what kind of response it gets. Good luck and great wealth Brett Car (if you read), you have a talent to see.
