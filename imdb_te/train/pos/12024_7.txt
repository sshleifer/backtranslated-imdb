The good thing about this film is that it stands alone - you do not see the original. Unfortunately this is also the biggest drawback. It adds some original characters in the new story, and it's good to see how they developed their lives. Sinclair is original and provides good comic moments to the films making efforts to deal with difficult and difficult situations, but the supporting cast is not as strong as in the original. Forsyth is greeted with a brave attempt to move the role and create an original sequel, but the film is ultimately faulty and does not have the warmth of the original
