The film is finally on DVD in Italy (completely renewed). I have seen this movie many times and I actually found it when these days (2003) were actually suffering from Italy's sort of dictatorship (or US for that matter). I'm open to the role played by Maestro in this movie from a tune; <br /> <br /> Back to the cinema: Most people already mentioned acting are awesome but audio is fantastic in the background. If you do not understand the Italian language, I must assume that I've lost something unfortunately. But I can assure you that the appearance of the massacre is really distorting the reality in radio-history from which Hitler visits Rome. <br /> <br /> "
