One of the most interesting films to be classified as "BlocksLoatation", Bakshi's "Concanskin" is a great compilation of amazing insight. He co-wrote with Scott Man Crater and Barry White, who also appear in the film. <br /> <br /> Racist films are often upset, but the message of the film is very powerful, but the NAACP has given it an approval (but only humble). The race tries to eradicate the test of extreme weather. Excellent stuff.
