First, the film is so bad, I saw it the first time I saw the first time. It's like a bad dream.A cosmic birch.But I gave a second chance, then another and the other ... The concert autumn light made of actor / singer / songwriter's 70s progressive rock and perfectly delicate folk songs and especially musical score I finally got accustomed to the film because of the amazing clear set of skinnies and wonderful combinations Derek Lamb (The Troubadour) .You can watch the song that hazel wood, silver trout and a lady in him ... in the middle and near the end of the movie. There are some carnal scenes initially, let us greet Elizabeth Suzuki's natural attractions. If some "Repertoire" directors like Bergman, Lars von Terrier, or Jean-Luc Goddard are filmed by critics, the critics are on the floor, a cosmic masterpiece. I think this film is a million times more than Felicity's Cinematic Shel # Â¤ @T! Not sure.
