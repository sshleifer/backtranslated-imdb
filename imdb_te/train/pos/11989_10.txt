Thanks to Zink Magan for creating Disney's best cartoons. This performance has improved over the years. As a kid, I did not like it because I thought it was a rip-off of the ducts, my favorite Disney stuff at that time (like Grand Mofoffrero). Even though it's not good but good then. But after reading reviews here, I decided to give you another chance & seeing the DVD set & seeing the whole pilot I saw the first day, & was very pleasantly surprised. This is still my favorite episode, but it's live to this series. And by the end of Disc 1, I know this is going to be the top tenner. <br /> The characters are very complex & beautiful. I got my favorite wildcat. He is absolutely hilarious and boots sweet. My next favorite is the best pilot of the show, the show. I can see why Oh Zimmann built the demonstration around him. Then the kit is Cloudkicker. He & Balu had the best relationship in the series. After that, Louie. Jim Cummings made a complete job as an original voice. After him, Rebecca. She laughs at me very hard, and I believe that she and the baby will eventually get married. Finally (to the leaders), Molly. Although she is my favorite, I still love her. I think she is the most beautiful character (better than the web from Ducktalas). And the villains are very real. <br /> <br /> Don Carnage & his Air Pirates always pull me up, Kahn is cold and cruel, and Thembryans are at least fun. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, Bear, Romance of the Red Chimp) is nothing short (The Old Man & the Sedak, Paradise Lost), fun, funny and exciting adventures (search of ancient blunders & my favorite for hoam The Bell Clanges). These are only some of my favorite episodes. However, what is the reason for Talespin Disney's best, Gummi Bears? GB has a good amount of my favorite character (Cubbi), but not enough for the TS wildcat. But in the end Talespan is a classic. BOTTOM LINE- 10/10 6th Best Cartoon ever.
