The film revolves around a man who believes that all kinds of media are in use. The idea behind his art project is to overwhelm the ludicrous culture of bathing. Obviously, the film is in Los Angeles / Orange County. He blocks the attack on comics (ka, ka, ka), rock bands, modals, blockbuster Hollywood films and many other media. In the end, he sees the scenes of the motion weapon. The movie is five years and every day the rings are more truth. It's the best description of the post-punk anger I've seen. This is one of my top 10 favorite movies.
