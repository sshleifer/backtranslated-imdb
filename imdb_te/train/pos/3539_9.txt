Good: Cinematic Fire Fights, great performance, vehicles are really fun, beautifully attractive, reliable, and list goes on. <br /> <br /> Bad: The main missions are slightly lower. /> <br /> This game defines what a "good" third person shooter (does not need a spy game). Great firefights carry the story and make you want to complete every single mission through it, and unlock all the real bonuses that the game offers. Hype has this game, lived up to, and I personally think you should buy, and huddle with friends and play this one. Loads of fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this game the sound, playing a broken break from some previous Bond games, and shooting a weapon, feels like you're shooting a weapon. This is what you say is a deadly and cruel spy. <br /> <br /> For all, this game takes you through its enthusiasm and satisfaction, and crafty James Bond "Nightfire" game for some multiplayer gamecube.
