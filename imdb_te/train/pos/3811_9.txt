For a long time I have not seen the most beautiful animated feature. Having a healthy respect for Pixar, I should not compare this to any other film made by Ratatouille or 'em. Animators have created a wonderful world here. Graphics are excellent, background surroundings are awesome, almost every object in each field is perfect. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I add my spine. Many people liked what I saw. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely romantic. Animated movie story may be romantic. The characters are lovable, especially Hector, blue rabbit, he has, pawns, rocks and rules! Other charts are good. <br /> <br /> The creators generally seemed to have not done much in this regard. I thought that I did not take a break from Pixar & DreamWorks people who tried hard every time I thought about it. I am very glad that the production of the European Animation Studio was very great. They made a candy for a wonderful, touching film, eye and hearts. <br /> <br /> It's just a minus stupid start and it's not 10/10 91010
