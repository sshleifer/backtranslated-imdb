"The Grove Tube" was first shown in the video in the first "video theaters" in Boston. In a room, there are small groups of monitors, old movie theater seats, and high level TV monitors. There are old refrigerators with peppers and baskets of yorker peppermit patties. In the second, small room, only the big pillows are the only seats. It's a 'smoking' room, that is, people have come there more people. <br /> I'm a 'frequent viewer'. I remember the scenes that I liked most and remember: Coco The Clown, The Cranf Family Kitchen (Cramp Easy-Lube Cutting), Same Sam / VD PSA, Chevy Chase Hitchhiker W / Nude Woods, Finger Ballet On The End Of A Woman's Nude Body As well. The last item is reminiscent of the late, unbelievable Ernie Kovacs. <br /> <br /> "Who am Ernie Covax?" I lost many readers in 48 years, but believe me, that's funny. <br /> <br /> When I was a 'frequent viewer' I and my friends looked at other "grove tube" virgins. With "SAM Sam" playing PSA we sit and look at the faces of virgins. While the camera slowly becomes "zam" in "sam", "ohh!" The 'face of the virgin' has been recognized. Each time it's more than happy. Then we took a friend to see the 'virgin' performance and repeat what we did. To get this joke, you must watch the video. <br /> Yes, some of them have dates, but there are so many plays, movies, television and videos now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> "Chevy Chase" is the first "Saturday Night Live" program, instantly "from that guy" <br /> <br /> A precursor to the ear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The parlous times of 70: "The Grove Tube" is fresh, fresh, and really humorous at times. 'Hip generation', which gave comedy, is not available in any other format / medium.
