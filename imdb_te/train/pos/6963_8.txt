A big surprise, perhaps because I was thinking of sucking. Although the reviews are golden, the reviews are pretty disappointing: a man finds his new girlfriend a superhero, who wants to break up with her, when she wants to break up with Psycho. I thought I should be depressed, but this has not really done. Certainly, it's not overwhelming of its amazing album, and it chooses to be smaller when the image is better to expand the universe. But I can not blame it. Uma Thurman is the Bipolar superhero, the greatest gi-girl. And I've found that many years after I disliked him, it was absolutely accurate when Luke Wilson appeared as a publisher. He has given two of the best comic performances of 2006 (other in the pretty much unreleased Idiocracy). When he and Thurman were the first sex I cracked completely at the expressions on his face. This is one of the most ridiculous romantic scenes ever. My only real complaint is that G-Girl is making quite a bit of a psycho as they almost have a belief. Perhaps with some background I agree well. However, I can forgive its flaws, because I'm good looking. Accurate, accurate.
