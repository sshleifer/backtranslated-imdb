I really like this movie. I can see it daily and not its tire. I think it's one of my standards for a great movie. <br /> The story is very interesting. It introduced us to 6 characters; Everyone has a unique Kung Fu style, which is very secretive and very bad. Each of these characters is trained by the same master, but their identities are kept secret. <br /> <br /> "What is the worst of them? <br /> <br /> <br /> We are fighting each other in each combination. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to start if you like kung fu movies.
