The feel of the film is amazing. Adam Sandler's performance was very exciting. When he played a very daring and fragile character, he took up his ability to the edge and really played the role. His role was really interesting. I can see the script for this movie and the sandler is not half the way I'm interested in making me. For the person who mainly plays the comedy roles, he has removed a serious role with what appears to be his own quirks and input. I especially loved the scene in which Adam and Dawn's roles drove motor scooter around the city. At that moment I was acquainted with, because Dan was seen as a witness to stay away from Adam. His video games, music, and many other things seemed like to escape from his thoughts riding his scooter on his headphones, to keep him from thinking about the past. This image is definitely worth watch.
