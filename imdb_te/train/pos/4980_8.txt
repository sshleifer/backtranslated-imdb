While browsing the internet for the previous selling prices, I ran across these comments. Why are they so serious? It's just cinematic and it's not porn. I earned this short film from my parents 30 years ago and this is always very happy. I showed a lot to my friends and they all liked it very much. I think this shirley's original 1932 8mm black and white silent film before she is famous or famous. After reading other comments, I agree that the movie is "pus." Big deal! I'm only a long time. I think I should be the only person involved in this reality, at least for sale, so wondering how valuable it is?
