Some people "The Aristocats" and others liked it, often coming out in the middle. Responses to Eddie Izzard are not serious - if you can handle a particle trade comedian (he says he is a girl of love) and have a vocabulary, enough use of the "f" term is a long beep if its program is presented on network television. Many of Iszard fans have seen no fault of his performance. On the other hand, I felt this show occasionally shining over the chest of the ezard but not more often funny and the spots were definitely happy. He has had his initial routines at the beginning of the show, which he has shown in the beginning of routine. He is not a storyteller. He is not a joke maker. He is not a frenetic fantasy like Robin Williams. His ideas, some work and some of it - the circuit with the San Francisco cable car and Alcatraz, are completely incomplete. He has a way of, however, stretching them gracefully flapped routines past and connecting. I gave this function 7 and can be convinced to increase it to an 8. But a 10? There is no chance.
