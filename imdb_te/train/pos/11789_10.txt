This short film is particularly interesting for an artist, filmmaker or music creator or a visual artist: <br /> <br /> David's tactile / simplicity. <br /> You can see the rhythm spinning of shots, pans and sound elements. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " For example, at some points supporting some shots, some shots support a few points (some sounds noisy, some noisy) at support. <br /> <br /> Some may see several pans: some can go up and down smoothly. There is diagonal pan. <br /> <br /> The lightning and composition / displacement of elements in space, simple and clear, works as a painter / artist. This crappy room can also be felt. It says: Already a delicate art can be made by placing a look / view and composing the scene. Then comes the extensions of visuals: Diganges, Parallels, etc. Although the degradation and color of light, textures in large structures are much better, even without much research. <br /> <br /> All of this is not counted, but done with the inner feeling, this feeling gives David the touch / feel as any true artist.
