I suppose this film can get rap as anti-rape Vietnam, when I see that I do not have public support for a young man in this film case .... It's their fear, their frustration, their drive ... It's all open, naked. As a soldier soldier, I am telling you my experience in military development - especially the boot camp. Overall, although the film is filmed in a very small budget, it is very cool, very well and has excellent acting and direction. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for this amazing another Kolin Farrell film. 10/10
