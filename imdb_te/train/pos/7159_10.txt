Lewis Sachar's compelling children's classic Disney is Freddy Krueger. It is murder, racism, facial failure and killer lizards. <br /> <br /> The multi-layer, interlinking story that spreads history to reveal the secrets behind Stanley's own legacy and pores. <br /> <br /> Disney's first success is very impressive for the novel's composition - the design of the set is from the lush green jungle of Latvia to the bet-mark Camp Green Lake (race: no lake and green lake). Excellent and without description. The other plus is in casting. Rising star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Project Green Light) is not the fat boy of the book, but his attitude is correct and he is away from the simple clean-cut hero. The rest of the cast was similar to Stanley's father, Henry Winkler, from the Patricia Arquette as Frontier School Murder-Turn-Bank theft. The downside is the Peace Soundtrack - the Pure Marketing Department - and the sentiment eventually switched to the full volume.
