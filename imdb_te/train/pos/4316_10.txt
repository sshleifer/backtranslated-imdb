Grand Canyon is one of the most influential films I've ever seen. I have seen so many times now and I'm still feeling the first time; The film can make a whole curriculum of post-graduate course for filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Long ago, movie trailers were used to promise, "This makes you laugh, you cry." It is a very smooth and short script method explaining what the Grand Canyon is. It takes you to the best places in human experience, and the next moment you take the hell to the gates. <br /> <br /> Many people are close to happiness and are back and forth between people who are close to horror. This is always a small step, too. Just kind of conducting the swing and directing the intellectual intellectual or misusing it. <br /> Spoiler is coming. After using the audience to come back and forth through the emotional spectrum, the film throws a curve in a sequence that is not good and backwards, but there is no need for piercing or stitching an earthquake containing characters that are at home by a dangerous self-damaged knife. During their relief, the argument was forgotten, the trumpet forgot, the earthquake was extinguished, and a neighboring woman called her elderly husband collapsed. This couple goes to her aid. I saw in this order. Every time I saw it. I'm crying now. This is not a problem for me. This is not a special regret. This tiny minutes of the film will give me tears of what's perfect. Perfect for it! Astounding. (The end of the spoiler) <br /> <br /> There is a lot to say about Grand Canyon. It is a relatively simple people who play Epiphanyes, and this allows the viewer to experience exclusively. They are not showy or overblown and there is no long break to carefully examine the moment. The film moves with the speed of life. There are also uncertainty about what originates from their experiences, even when trying to understand what happened. <br /> <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon is very human image.
