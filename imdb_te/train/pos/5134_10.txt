This small nomination was nominated for the Academy Award and I won! The jam session, usually filmed among some talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, is great for music! Hollywood too often adopted jazz (specifically animation, which is not believed or not), but the film is a rare form of advanced jam. It is included in the film preservation list and is appropriate. TCM runs periodically and it runs to its "31 Days of Oscar" tribute every March. From downtown at Buzzer, the yellow, the net and the smooth of the shot, the net just moved. Very solid and highly recommended !!!
