I saw this film for the second time on television. It is lovely, warm, sentimental, very romantic. I rarely see actors better by revealing their movements and gestures as another Kebel Shepherd, Ryan O'Neil, Robert Downey, Jr. And most importantly Mary Stuart Masters just overtook themselves. Masterson is probably the most difficult character and is simply adored. <br /> <br /> The film is the "High Gimmick" Peggy Sue Gott married two romantic movies, You Wear Sleeping, Wen Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and Big, Back to the Future. The cast is good and I can not change anything, but the box office appeal of these films is not just great, because I do not think I'm successful in the above mentioned films. <br /> This is not a wonderfully written - eg, the lines of characters are not particularly memorable. It has been implemented for perfection. <br /> <br /> Sexual adolescents are really touching, the "feeling" of people falling in love with the timelessness of love, the timelessness of love and the sweeping of all around, the feeling of loss and the desire to get that connection back. Again, you will find yourself shaken. Actually, Made in a comparable film Heaven - same romantic anxiety. <br /> See this - It is lovely.
