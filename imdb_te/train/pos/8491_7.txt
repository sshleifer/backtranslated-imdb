I saw this film when it was new. Later I have been renting in Japan for three years, and I'm scared when I look at the hard light of my expanded international experience. Surprise me exactly how the film depicts a collision between culture and culture between Japan and Pennsylvania (from where I live). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am in Japan several years later, and the film is in the story for handmade treatment on both sides. Interestingly, Japanese American actors spoke original Japanese, while the duo explicitly covered the second language delivery issues in the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> It's a classmate Japanese class. I would like to find out more about what I expect from an encounter with Japan (many of which are written in the 80s and economically promoted by Japanese companies) by looking at the film rather than reading "serious" books on this subject. br> <br> Among other things, do not be dragged on the average rating by a stellar reviewer who is unlikely to build cars in Japanese US. (However, the Japanese hold many factories, such as being close to consumers and preventing business conflicts). It is a very warm and funny movie. It's not much for 80s clicks, cheesy electronic disco music. Michael Keaton is never funny.
