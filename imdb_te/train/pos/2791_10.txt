All of this is one of my favorite time movies and I would recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> In my list of My Favorites (Mind list, Mind), there are films like Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home. The main character is Jesse. At the beginning of the film is a shy girl with a little odd background for many friends who are boys than her girls. She really sucks you in her life. I'm definitely not acting in the lead role or someone else can mislead others. <br /> <br /> Soccer is also interesting to anyone who does not know the rules without me knowing it. The film is not always boring. Romance is really cute and didoooo hard to me! This is a matter of fact even though it is an Indian subject. There are many colorful Indian traditions throughout the film that Jess's parents provide Indians and a very interesting cultural insight and everything else. Indian people are also happy! This is an age film about choosing the path that you want and choose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " They are funny, they refresh and they make you feel better! ^ _ ~
