When it comes out Savage, this film looks beautiful and sounds great. A feast of intellectual acting from Geelgood, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Wabbrock, and moving central show from the beautiful and very young Jean Seborg. Primer does not jump around and show up - his long slowly encourages you to listen and reflect, and Graham Greene's script fills the shock without sacrificing the complexity. The movie has the look of a TV movie made and the studio is perfectly committed for that. Most contemporary films on 'historic' themes can not resist dumbing down. How did Mel Gibson make a maid? Perhaps most of her rack shots in the rake, then blakes the BBQ after holding Blakes. Primer did nothing in this regard. The burning is mainly shown by guilty-traumatic exposure. There are some weak performances, but it is not enough to make enough loss. I caught this movie on TV and I was looking forward to seeing it, but I caught it. At the age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, the story of the zone has an unexpected resonance.
