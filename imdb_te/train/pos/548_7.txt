The film is as good as other Western films such as Anthony Mann and James Stewart Winchester '73 and The Naked Spar and better than Thunder Bay and River Bend. This film begins as a Western run, but it's more complicated, it goes on. It entered Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan Seattle, and Stewart was murdered. He is innocent, but the cattle are being stolen by a corrupt judge. Stewart then agrees to lead something but I forgot what happened but Stewart only cares about getting his livestock back. As the movie goes along, Stewart sees himself only in Naked Spur about his character. They were better at half a time after joining Alaska. This Stewart is one of the better in Westerns.
