At first this Audi couple looked like boring comedy, but when I got into it turned out to be a really funny movie. A major comic duo, and their hospital sketch for a TV show, was mainly the forgery of former comedians, Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Walter Mathau) and All Lewis (Oscar winning, and Golden Glove nominated George Burns). Willie's nephew, Ben Clark (Richard Benjamin's Golden Globe winning) does not have any feelings for each other, believing he is wrong. They can not get at all times, especially if they forget the conversation, they will eventually do it. Lei Meredith is Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Council Doris Green, All's Daughter, Rosetta Linoire, Odessa, Willie Nurse and Muppets from Spacefrom as Caroly Deuce. I was the best line of the film, Barnes, and Matthew named him "Bitch Bastard's Son". It was nominated for Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, a screenplay received from other material, which was nominated for BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and Golden Globe wins Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy and is nominated for Best Screenplay. Very nice!
