I enjoyed this film completely because acting was genuine honest. The writing is top-notch. James Arnes is a great actor and he has shown here. <br /> <br /> In this action, Raoul Julia, who gave another great actor Santa Anna, was in vain and complicated. Some people suspected that the film was slow, A few hours after the terrible terror. <br /> I am very impressed with this film, saying it's about a reason and some people believe they love to die for it. I feel like today and nobody else has been refreshed when I die for the freedom of the people and think of how you feel about the politics of time.
