Judy Davis is why we see one of the most honorable and beloved actors in Australia - the first-rate for her role as a lone, guided walker. Claudia Caravan is one of our most prominent actors in this country, the Big Bang, Heart BREAK Kid, Eight, Risk and the Life of the Secret TV in the coming years. (Incidentally, a young girl who has been stolen by toy doll panda with Tracey Man in the 1983 drama Going Down), make sure you look at the movies! Rating: 79/100.
