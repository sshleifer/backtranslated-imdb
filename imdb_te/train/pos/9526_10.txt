After heating from home and heating in the theater, I could not find it happier. The Road to Person, directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), is one of the best films of all time. Maybe I'm getting older; Maybe I saw the same themes for recycling time and again. <br /> <br /> The story of the young young Michael Sullivan looked at the junior sea and thought about the duality of his father's legacy - very nasty. The bipolar snakes are its way across the movie. The story revolves around crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) and Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), who Rooney once worked as a teenager and his personal "Angel of Death". Rooney is associated with his own son's blood, but Michael is associated with love and loyalty. Young Michael Jr. is jeered by the stories he read, stole a night in his father's car, and heir to the "family" with Canar Rooney. Connor's situation is out of hand and a warning becomes a murder - by Michael Jr. After the discovery of the young Michael who he is missing, the plot motion is set to break up the conflicts of confrontation. <br /> <br /> Soon, Michael Sr. signed with his younger son, Harlene by "The Reporter" Mague (Jude Law). <br /> <br /> I do not reveal any details to avoid any potential spoilers. . Nevertheless, I strongly urge you to examine many of the bilateralities in the movie "House" around the world, sons and fathers (Michael Sr & Jr., John Rooney & Son Connor). Between good and evil, between God's men and those who really pretend between "clean" money and "dirty", among the townspeople and the town of destruction. And along the way, cinematographer Conrad L. Enjoy the visual illumination of the hall (9 nominations, 2 oscars for best cinematography): shots, pouring off shadows off the shadows (swinging doors) from shadows, tommy-gun flashes from shadows, no sound. <br /> <br /> 75-year-old Hall gives the best film production of his career, while 77-year-old Paul Newman offers one of his best performances. Get old But I've seen a lot ... it's fresh and stimulating. In the highway dark dark comic book darkness, villains and heroes, generally for American films, gangster style, and 40th films, provide a lasting and beloved tribute. Let's see!
