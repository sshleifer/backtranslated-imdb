If you play "Spider-Man" in the PS version, then you can see it. You need to get the DC version to really experience. It's a very graphical high game; Textures are sharp, easy to navigate the levels, and it is the PS cousin then better sound. In the last game 00s I bought this game and still has it to this day. Well, Marvel: The Ultimate Alliance is a very high and tactical game but if you're a fan of 'ol webhead then you can pick this up for your gaming library and get it yourself money. Spidey has never looked on this good and dead in a video game swinging around the city like. If you have a Dreamcast, snag this up for cheap. The DC version is just amazing.
