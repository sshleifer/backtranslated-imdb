I love this episode a little, Ruth Gordon is not good, it's not small if she's never been there. As mentioned, the music is great, and it has a mood that is not in all episodes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] The light does not work in the treasury. Did you think that all the clever Colombo or police would check if the light bulb worked? You'd think the bulb was unscrewed and so think of the pretty short order of note found. This is the TV hoodwint fiction, and various holes are always visible, but it looks very nice. <br /> <br /> When it did not work light, Colombo was not a hidden intellectual. But the evidence of "death bed" has evidently gone through days.
