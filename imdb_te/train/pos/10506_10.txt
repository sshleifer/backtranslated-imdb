<br /> <br /> I've never really owned Nintendo 64 but I played it several times. In my opinion, the Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the 64 Nintendo 64 system .I have played this game plenty of times and its good every time you have a N64 and you do not have this game you should try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games is a 3D mario in a nice 3D environment that has scrolling video games but Super Mario 64. The game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game. You play Super Mario and once again you must protect the Princess and 120 energy stars from the Bouncer. Now you can do it in a 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good N64 game and I recommend it. <br /> <br
