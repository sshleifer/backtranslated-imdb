Kramer vs. Jek's Closet Kramer's emotional power is combined with the imagination of Pan's Labyrinth. Initially the special effect gives consent to the lab's labyrinth. But this is not a war that sixty years ago, but a modern story. In this way it still has more resonance. Jake's closet is a boy, a single child, practically alone in summer vacation, dealing with the falling away from his family. This is a horror film, The Others and The Sixth Sense, a horror film for the man who thought. If you are looking for a slasher image, this is not your tea cup but if you're looking for a story that is both touched and excited with good acting, it's a picture for you. At the screening I saw, I swear there was a moment where the whole audience shouted. I highly recommend catching this movie.
