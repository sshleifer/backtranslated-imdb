"Moon Struck" is one of the best films ever. I own that movie on DVD! The film deals with the New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend (Danny Io) in the bakery, angry brother (Nicholas Cage). Cher won an Oscar for the film. Nicholas Cage and Danny Isle are also great. Direction from Norman Jusson (directed by "Fidelar on the Roof") is excellent. "Moon Struck" is an amazing image for everyone to watch and laugh. Must see! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
