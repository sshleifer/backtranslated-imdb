I saw this carton for the first time and recognized the characters of prominent black entertainers ... Cobbloove, Bessie Smith, (whitespace Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker), Thomas "Favors" Waller, Bill "Bomilis" Robinson, Stenin Fetchit (though) Armstrong and Chorus Girls are not in the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. True ... there are stereotypes, but this is the way ... and these cartoons are considered adult entertainment before the main feature of your local cinema. <br /> <br /> Harman & Icing Cartoons Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox More than just the standard animated shortcuts (after all ... we're talking about MGM) more "cutesy", RKO or Low Columbia. <br /> <br /> Disney's early Mickey Mouse also had loads of Benny's humor before being able to clean him up before Uncle Walt went to "Technicolor". <br /> <br /> In Disney, some cartoons are also by block entertainers ... For example, 1937's Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But remember that these films are part of time and space. 50 years from now ... The Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park's clips are analyzed, analyzed ... and future viewers have been criticized.
