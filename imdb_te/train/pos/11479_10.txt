This picture is a bit scary, exciting, but that's amazing. You know about Columbine and you know about the stories you know, give an idea of ​​what they have done and why they did it. You know that behind your mind you will feel people about this matter, but you can not understand how bad it is. It's very good. This will make you think twice before you'll definitely be happy with someone. I've read a book on Columbine's assassination and it's worrying me, the film worries me and kills me. It's like killing someone else's guide for killers. I have recently received a threat, I have not heard anything about it, but after this film I want you to take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you really do not know who they are, so take it seriously and do not under anyone to guess.
