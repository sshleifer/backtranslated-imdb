Kudos to the director and cast for a realistic film. The lack of grin, glamor and disappointment brought me into the picture and put me there. I was really impressed by the dates and information that the film was broadcasting; Such as newspapers, letters, and so forth. It takes the movie forward at a faster pace. Personally, I thought that all the principles had done a tremendous job ... It was great to see Boseworth and Dudo in such complex characters. It's all I need to cry at times. Wal-kimmer did not surprise me ... the performances of this nature are usually awe-inspiring. Overall, it's a fantastic picture not to miss!
