I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this very attentive distribution play, due to its rather unimpressive 6.6 rating, I almost missed; I rarely give the movie a day less than 7/10. I said, I'm so happy, I saw Stone Angel very good. <br /> <br /> "There is a lot of praise for" Notebook "by Stone Angel, as its themes, execution, style, product etc. I repeatedly fall across this image I am surprised not to choose other commentators on other similarities, so I can only think that the notebook I have not seen yet has not been seen yet, they can not share the theme of Alzheimer's, If you enjoyed a lot of "notebook" you can certainly say that you will find a lot of fruitfully engaging with your time with "Stone Angel" But even if you do not see a notebook or read the book (which, incidentally, I will not) Catch fast speed action thrillers as long as your favorite genres - will find much more to capture   వద్దు. ఇది ఆలోచనాపరులకు మరియు కాలం గడిచేకొద్ది జ్ఞాపకం ఉంచుకోవాలనుకునేవారికి, సంవత్సరాలు గడిచే జీవితపు మార్పులు ఎలా మారుతున్నాయి మరియు సంవత్సరాలు గడిపిన ఒక గజేస్గా జీవితంలో ఏమి జరిగి ఉండవచ్చు? <br /> ఈ విచిత్రంగా తక్కువగా అంచనా వేయబడిన ఇంకా గొప్ప చిత్రం నిజంగా సుమారు 8/10 యొక్క రేటింగ్ను అర్హుడు. The current lowest rating of 11% of the IDIs I gave is only 6.6 / 10. Moreover, less than 300 votes were attracted when writing this comment. However, why do not they see why the cars are haunting and exploding if it's 11% less than the ranking? In a few moments in the premise and promotional lines of the film? Oh dear ... no matter what the world is coming, do not miss the least unexpected gem in this movie - * if you have the brain * means Transformers, Fight Club or Terminator in your Top Ten).
