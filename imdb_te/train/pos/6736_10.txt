Riding Giants is a wonderful documentary, which enters the world of lesser-acclaimed games and the surface brings more human and raw emotions to capture the director Stacy Perraulta. From the construction, to the players, the fantastic stock footage, and the style it painted has strengthened the beauty and power behind the surfing sport. It was the most consistent and relative in all the surfing movies I've seen (Endless Summer, Billabong Odyssey, and step into Liquid). Riding up to the Lord's Infamous Ride The start of the Giants began with the early age of surfing (short history lesson), as it opened the spirit of the sport, rather than the mind, heart and other self-reliance of the soul. How does it work? <br /> <br /> This story is originally sound as sound. In other movies I've seen about surfing, you do not know what to do with the new person, the wave, the event, the unknown, and the unknown? In Riding Giants, we have very little veterans and newbies. This allows you to really go deeper into each one mind. Also, instead of just waving travels, we provide more history and more personal insight than the world. This film really impressed me. Instead of showing these huge waves (because it's a big wave), I hear stories and these surfers have seen the first hand what to do to overcome those waves. I loved information about "beach booms" or father of surfing. I'm still carrying through the fairy tales of Greg Nol and his early adventures into tough deep blue. Then, to see him personally, talking about what's going on in his mind, only added more fuel to the fire. The direct structure followed by Pearl has allowed me to run and walk with more knowledge of the sport than in previous films. <br /> <br /> Parata You do not know what the brave people did and that can not help you where the sport is going. <br /> <br /> A pure structure add some serious and creative cinematography, and you darn close to the perfect image. Finally, using the techniques I found in The Kid Stace in the Picture, Riding Giants created some scenes that seem to have jumped from the screen. When it's not 3D, it's a flat dimensional concept you get when you place two images on top. In this movie, it worked. It created more depth of scenes, and really just not worth the shock (man these waves are huge), but these guys are at risk of being constantly faced. If it breaks apart or if they make a mistake, these waves will kill them. Some were dead, but it did not stop the game. It just created more passion for more excitement and more. <br /> <br /> This is the love of the ocean and sport that leads to my final point. <br /> The human element. My pre-adventure in the world of surfing documentaries left me with very beautiful waves, but very little about people. People know that people are looking for waves, so it turns out from the wave and is probably the second one about another. This film is a direct opposite. Peralta has still created this masterpiece by giving us waves, but they are dedicated to more attention in the surfers and why the immortal question is why they are on this daily basis. Anyway, their minds are revolving, taking them further and bonds formed when the forest is blue. I felt more about surfing the big wave after seeing this movie only, but about the emotional side of the sport. It pushes an element that does not develop in other movies and rides the giants to the new personal level. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is pretty awesome. I have never seen a lot of love, devotion and love surrounded by a constructive sound film. From the beginning to the end I was impressed. This film won the Oscar this year for the best documentary and I would be very happy if I see a new reincarnation in the surfing world and open more doors to these landscapes <br /> Grade: ****** out *****
