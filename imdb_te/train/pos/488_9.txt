John Torturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to watch), the long piece and the chess involved are from the fact that I enjoy taking nothing out of this movie. Everything that came before me was completely unexpected. So I'm not too far away. Tarturo is an extraordinary, obsessive and deeply felt chess intellectual and em takes the step of becoming the strongest-lady woman to attract him. It's about the love and siege, rather than the respectable board game and gradually become compelling, after gradually drawing me in the first half hour. I ended up with anyone.
