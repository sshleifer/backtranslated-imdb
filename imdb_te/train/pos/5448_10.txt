This movie is probably my favorite movie. Miriam Flynn is like the Bunny Packard. Jen Bujbe comic genius in the role of Delarus. The rest of the cast is amazing, and the film is really very funny. The exact sarcasm of horror movies, with a fickle twist. If you are filled with a fun, funny evening, then go and rent this classic. You'll laugh through all the way!
