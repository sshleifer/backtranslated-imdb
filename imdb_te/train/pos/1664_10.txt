<br /> <br /> I thought that the film was fantastic with the great performances of Verestina Serve (Artemisia Gentischi). <br /> <br /> Serve Artemia is very beautiful, temporarily and intimate habits, her hands are her place. <br /> <br /> Even though each character is not as beautiful as the cover, the cover and texture of the film is more appropriate at the time, making the film even more original. <br /> <br /> In total, I thought the film was fantastic.
