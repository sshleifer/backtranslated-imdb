I have rented this film in my interest in American history, and especially the somewhat strange story of Mormons. The film Joseph Smith demonstrates some sense of how his "vision" changes a major world religion. This first focuses on the problems of Mormons in their home in Nouveau, Illinois. It portrays Joseph Smith's inquiry. During that trial, Brigham Young Mormonism stood up to say about his conversion, and his belief in Smith's spiritual message. Smith was murdered, and Young would have to face his own doubts about what he chose to lead Mormons into a new territory. Despite his grave doubts, he is persevering, and finally a scene that gives faith in his right to the right (Utah is the place for his colony). Later, when the crops were destroyed by cricket, he again doubted that he was really elected - but a miracle occurs, indicating his position in history. <br /> I'm performing, the story is exciting and interesting. I would like to know if Mormons believe that this is a perfect film. Polygamy is a part of the story, but there is no reason why this is the LDS center. This is not emphasized. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p>
