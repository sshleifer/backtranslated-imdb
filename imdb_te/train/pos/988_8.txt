I liked this movie. When he killed a man who was a bank robbery in gold for 40 million dollars, his companion was used as a "bait" to lead him to a high-tech silly killer partner (through a monitoring device placed in his jaw without his knowledge). This is an action, sphere type movie. It reminds me of State Enemy. Well acting and good enough plot.
