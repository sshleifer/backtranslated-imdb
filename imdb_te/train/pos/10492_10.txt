When I came into the video, I saved Grace. Since then it has become my favorite one! The plot is not particularly complicated, but it does not get away from entertainment. It's a full chuck of funny moments and it has a very lovely quality. These characters are very good. Each of them has their ridiculous features, two elderly men who played Linda Kerr Scott and Philadelphia. Fantastic acting is done by everyone, especially Brenda Blight. She and Craig Ferguson have been dragging some funny moments. If you're looking for good comedy, I will definitely recommend this movie!
