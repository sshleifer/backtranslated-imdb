This image is just perfect. It really made me think. During the whole film I was confused with hell. I loved everything about it ... It's just confusing and so distorted and weird, it's hard not to love it. All actors phenomenon, and nobody had done a good job ... this year is one of my favorites ... it deserves an Oscar.
