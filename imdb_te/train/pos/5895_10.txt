Before reading this film, I read an article about Don Jansen's Olympic and personal journey. <br /> <br /> I have always worried about exceeding the expected narrative and life changes, this is no exception. <br /> <br /> The background of the characters you provided affects the family and the lives of others. I can not speak of certain details in this movie, it is customary to take some creative license when performing the script. However, the spirit of Don and his family is here. <br /> <br /> The story is worth its picture. I felt empathy for the characters and cheered at the end.
