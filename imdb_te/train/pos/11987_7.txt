<br /> <br /> I have decided to go back and review a few years since reviewing this classic, but the first few notes from the film critic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Talespan or Lifting Helmet is a great animated series known in Denmark, which is a lot of chip and dale, ducks and old ones, the unnatural concept around it <br /> <br /> Remember, I need to remember this message. <br /> <br /> But I do not want to make any old or any noise, but I think it is time to fall into my hands with these cartoons, Ed Ed dd and Eddie or anything else like that, we have these new or almost new shows in Hannah Montana or something like this, yet I think we are cartoons or real We feel that there is the same spirit of the early days of the program. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe I'm wrong, but I'm surprised that this series, like Tilespin, will be released again on the screen, give them my childhood cartoons, give me some children and give it again ...
