Nina Foch offers a surprisingly strong performance in the title role in this fun little gothic nail-bitter. She accepts her as a London Society Honor (starring Dame May Witty) and her creepy daughter (embarrassing and awkward George Mamrer) as her secretary. Before she knew, she found her in the seaside castle she had never seen before, and Witty and Magrid called her Marian and sought to convince her servants and nearby towns that she was Magrid's mad man. In fact, the couple could plan for Dostardly's work, and finding that Julia finally escaped her trap, director Joseph Lewis replied to the question of how she would handle her. <br /> <br /> "My name is Julia Ross" has a style that keeps separate from many of the same pictures, but its shoe-string budget and B-film pedigree. There are just a few moments that are on the edge of your seat, and I found myself lying on her scheme that really rooked for Julia and started to outsmart her captors. In any other Gothic thriller, the heroine shouts at her, shouts and tired, waiting for her hero to come and save her. <br /> <br /> In this film, I can not tell you how to refresh how the heroine can use his brain and how to protect him. <br /> Grade: B +
