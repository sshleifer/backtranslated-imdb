12 years ago I saw this film on TNT. It was Susanna York's birthday and they showed this film as a double feature with Tom Jones (1963). I did not see this movie on TV. I saw this movie because the stars are very funny and talented Jim Dale, the Lost Sailor. Dell now believes that the story of Harry Potter books is about the story, but he is very fun anyway. This is a fast comedy. It is not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures should go through their film collection, and consider the DVD to be restored and released. Christopher Plummer is happy as Lord Flemington, and Ian Bennen is also very ridiculous as the Robble sailor. It is a comedy comedy, which looks at the film architecture and looks at a larger product value. **** from 1/2 stars
