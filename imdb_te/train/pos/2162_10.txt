I was surprised when I expected this film to be very low ... I understand why some of you do not like this movie. Its speed is slow, characteristic of Japanese paintings. However, if you are absorbed in the picture like me it is not a problem for you. <br /> <br /> I think it's the best comedy I have ever seen. "Shaw we are right?" Often regarded as Japanese humorous masterpieces. This is different from Hollywood, e.g. Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which a gag is guaranteed every two minutes. <br /> <br /> I love the movie because it feels like it is "real". The plot is straightforward and beautiful. I am very glad that Sujiyama (the main character) has found the meaning of life in the dance. Before I read it was a little disappointing because of heavy school performance. I missed it. However, this film has made me think of the bright side of life. I believe in Sugiyama same boat; If he finds himself in his hobby, why can not I? <br /> <br /> "It's about exploring my own future" and reminding me of finding happiness in my everyday life. <br /> <br /> It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. You can not see dance scenes as long as you can expect, but I think the characters are really "alive", learning to dance when the film walks. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is encouraging and heart-warming. As comedy, its job will definitely work. This is definitely worth 10 stars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
