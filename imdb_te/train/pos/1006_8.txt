Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers in recent years, confused everything for Paul Vohaughne's 1997 TV movie, many games. But none of these words really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are generally unrelated, the TV series is more spin-off, and less about Verhoeven's film, better said. However, in Japan, many know that animated adaptation has already been completed, the year of Heinlein's death was released. And despite its differences, the 6-part animated series plan-wise, the most reliable adaptation of Heinlein's classic. <br /> <br /> We lost some of the most obvious plus energy armor of the series, Exoskeleton, Veroeven. As with the book, this array focuses more on characters and their relationships than the action and space travel, although we see the fair amount of each. As the events in this book are different, there is the concept of the book story. Rico and Carmen have a romantic mix, but it touches little more than in the book. While some believe that some people are a little bit of talk and character interaction (it gets slightly in anime treatment, but what did you expect?), It is superior to the film. Heinlein's political views are only inspired, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. But the climate war in Clandham between the big pay of the series, the forces and the bugs / aliens, is the action from the shielding armor that he liked in a movie version. Overall, I enjoyed this series because I want to see a close look at Heinlein. And I think it's pretty well with this. If you find this series, check it out.
