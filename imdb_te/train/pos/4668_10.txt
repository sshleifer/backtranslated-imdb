This film is at least once in a month on TV tv, and I have seen a dozen or more times that will delight me. If it's tomorrow, I'll see it again. Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, both great magicians of the acting profession can not help any little by way of an excellent assisted trio of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Do not forget others in small roles. <br /> <br /> It is a former-con, a lovely embezzler, just bored, then "New Age Technology" means computers, affection in the process. This is not a tad (the tongue in the cheek), even the unbelievable, unbelievable characters. Violence, sex, no bad language, and all the terrible method is best acting today It is rampant. The true lesson for modern performers is that it does not have anything to do with how to make a great presentation, and excluding realistic expertise.
