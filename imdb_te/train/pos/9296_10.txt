I love this movie. It's ridiculous, funny, violent, surreal, played on the head of the madman, is not exactly your simple comedy. <br /> If you do not see amusing pictures, it's not for your tastes, so it's a tough one for this review. <br /> <br /> For reference, Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride, and Julander (who came only a second time around me) are some of my hilarious ones. There are others, but my taste is perfect for extraordinary, and I'm willing to accept that most people just do not like that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> The scenes and characters in this special film are well-sounded, verbal and funny, the acting is very good (as you expect it), acting demands by actors by the script are not unique. The whole package makes for fun, funny, watchable and violent entertainment.
