This is a perfect series for family viewing. We are surrounded by TV to see this in BBC America. This is an up-to-date version of Robin Hood and is alert for children and adults. Sitting with our mother and father both adolescent and middle aged, we are happy to see Robin's next adventures. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe has a place of current fashion, we do not have to wait to air each week. Every story is ethical. It's fun. Violence is not over-the-top or unnecessary. The soundtrack it's totally amazing in the feel of John William. <br /> <br /> "Reality" TV is the worst of television from an unintended violent brain. It does not update "Robin Hood" compared to Erich Flynn's film exploits. This is a gem experience. Many of the violence was seen by parents about their children lost their passion for war and bloodshed. He is Robin Hood, who tries to get out of this disagreement than fighting. Maid Marian is also an attractive role model for little girls. Besides standing and doing nothing, he plays his role in helping the poor as "Night Watchman". Sheriff has to be and like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Currie, Nottingham Sheriff is on the best of the bad. Guy Gisborne is a very beautiful actress and many women want to play the role of a "guile" character. <br /> <br /> We only have the question "Where is the fireside tuck?"
