Paulie is beautiful, cool, enjoyable and very fulfilled. I went to the film that I was expecting to see a typical "family" movie, in moments of unconsciousness and motion on the floor. My mind was immediately changed when I was not immediately attracted by the intolerance of the film. It is rare to get a completely complete family image and "perfect". <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Paulie has a plot. It tells the story of a young girl (Mary) and her best friend Paulie Parrot, who speaks loyally and can often communicate with her. Mary's Dirk Jerk's father finds this unbelievable and hopes that Paulie is hurt by his 4-year-old daughter's mental health and kills them quickly. He follows Polly's adventures (and misfortunes), who tries to reunite with his beloved owner, and meets many memorable characters. Oh, Polly really has a talk (smart) and Swift New Jersey accent. Cool. The plot was thick and entertaining, kept me attracted. Paulie enjoyed the best family image and cheerful I found. Ever. Seriously. Pick a copy and sit back and enjoy the whole family and the true family picture. Do not sleep. I swear.
