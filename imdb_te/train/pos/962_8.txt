I finished watching this movie and I said I was very impressed. Everything related to this is good. Acting characters, story. A boldly trusted child is always willing to help others. His mum must be proud. I can not get my eyes out of this film because of something missing. It is a fictional story / story with heartfelt folk, even though it is morality, beautiful and horror sprites and 'monsters'. A child reads and threatens in school as a leader. The local village festival and a rider at Goblin Mountain, where he finds Yoko, who are proud of Brian Fowd's brilliant creative creations. And bad kato and his cider definitely needed hug. These evils capture Yoko and dispose of unwanted objects, motorbikes and other mechanical objects in the red pit, killing these deadly violent robotic monsters. Takashi is one of the young men to become their savior, red man / dragon a turtle man and a river princess as well as a beautiful little creature, in all good toy stores, even if they're in a cuddly toy if it's in America. Do not try this in the kids and other gems of the house to bring a smile to your lips exclusively on lines. Suspend the trust, enjoy a kid or your own and enjoy! I finally agreed that there was an end bit sad. And surely not. Cheers Fudrion
