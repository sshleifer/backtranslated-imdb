I really enjoyed watching this movie. Like many people who have seen it. I'm not sure when I get it. Vupi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and has done a lot of her funny movies; That is sister law. <br /> But it's not really humorous. It is a play with funny moves. <br /> <br /> In this film a black family moved from the nice neighborhood of the city to the upper middle class neighborhood. I say more but I think it will damage the film. The film is not just a racial tune between blacks and blacks, but also about relationships in black community. I think it's a worth it. This film is not for you if you are not really interested in seeing another movie about race relations
