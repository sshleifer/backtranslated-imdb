Rosen Strauss is one of the most closely related films of epic proportions, which can carry many movie guides for the pianist's similar theme. Fortunately, Van Trota, a well-known storyteller, explained in its colorful exterior for a feminist pepe, but with little intimacy and from the general Aryan German perspective of the Jewish perspective. Rosintrassy found its strength to the inexorable burden of trapped people in historical circumstances that emerge as these victims. The pace insight of the film is intuitive, slow and meditative. Furthermore, the generation of transcripts between the generations and the time of time passes are very clear. Rogensstress is not a good work, and some descriptive errors are well known. There is a rare cinematography that can not capture the intensity of the internal drama that lived through another faulty character. However, this movie is worth seeing. Finally, Rosenstrasse is part of the last trend in German films, which includes the spectacular images of a nightmare in past nightmares, nowhere in Africa, and more recently, the controversial fall. I would recommend this film to those who want to go beyond the pictures.
