I do not know why people think this is a bad movie. There's a nice good plot, some good actions, and the location that changed to Harry does not change. It's definitely not a single image, but some of its objectionable and inappropriate. Eastwood was a good dirty harry and I liked Pat Hing in the film as a small town cop. If you liked Dirty Harry, then you should look its far better than this one, Dead POOL. 4/5
