I saw this movie at the age of 13 and I really liked Dana Plato who played in various strokes as Connelly Drummond. I do not think it's bad. This is not a continuation of the documentary. Its just a cute kids movie 3 kids who go after trying to find the trash creek monster. Men hurt and protect them with the help of the creature of the child .Shocking shots of the scene and the scenes are fine. A good picture for these kids, real violence is some lightweight fears but young kids are good fun.
