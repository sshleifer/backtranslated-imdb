Conversation in each conversation becomes "favorite movies". I do not mention Titanic, at least a couple of people snicker. I know five years ago, because the same people moved to tears in the film. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I returned to Titanic. I am surprised that the film has not lost its power in these five years, hoping to enjoy the story again. I cried again and again ... in one place. No film is going to be thought of, but it's always the most popular film ever. I recall that the movie which inspired public consciousness is like any other movie (yes, more than Star Wars). Today, many people do not agree with it. Folks, let me know something - you're good at this movie Badmouth. <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect and there are some errors in this regard. Some conversations are flat, and some of the plots surrounding the two lovers are very well integrated. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the best actors of his generation. Wait for him to see you in the gangs of New York, and do not call him more than a beautiful boy. Kate Winslet is very strong in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film was really good for her, and she was beautiful. <br /> <br /> James Cameron has done what he believes by a fully trusted Titanic rebuild. The sinking scenes that night are terrible. Anyone who says bad things can be said to me. <br /> <br /> The film is a memorable one after another. Port to Titanic Southampton. Rose and Jack in the bow, "flying". "Iceberg, right forward!" Unbelievably executed rolls from the sea. Sad after her death. He also brought a burrist in the theater in the theater. <br/> <br/> The music of the victim's success is also crucial. James Horner's score is correct. And the theme of love is beautiful and tragic. Most bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy great music. <br /> I agree, I'm a titanic buff. Therefore, I enjoyed the opportunity to see the ship that we do not want to see - in its beauty. Because of my interest in the ship in my life, it affects me a little more. Nevertheless, I saw many Titanic fans crying. Cameron applaud for bringing this story to the mass that I can never disrupt the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said he was better: Titanic opened your hearts and was disappointed.
