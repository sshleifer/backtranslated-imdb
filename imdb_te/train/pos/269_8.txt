I'm usually a fan of TV movies and it's one of the better ones. Cast shows throughout the show are pretty great and there are no turns I have seen before every business. <br /> <br /> In some lights, do you think the daughter is like a young Nicole Kidman? What kind of relationship do they have? <br /> <br /> If you have entered the TV Mystery films, check it if you have the opportunity.
