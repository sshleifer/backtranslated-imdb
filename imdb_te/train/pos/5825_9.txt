Most Stoogephiles think this is the best stooges little bar none, and they're right. Curly is pulled into "Senorita Kukaracha", and Mo and Lorry are "Senor Macho" and "Senor Gasto" respectively. Christine McIntyre's beautiful operatic voice was given full spectacles - she was actually a trained opera singer - and it was wonderful. The great Gino Corrado is a luxurious Italian singer who feared by Stooges in a community party. Some really funny costumes, good direction and very tight edits increase the productivity of Stoge to the top. While Curly has serious health problems, and in many of the stories he has made during this period, you can see that he is clearly ill; His time is off the way, he speaks very slowly and haltingly, and the trouble is to get around. Fortunately, he gets up his health when he makes this film, and it shows up. Classic Stoogie Comedy, and non-Stozie fans also enjoyed (I've had a girlfriend who did not retain stooges, but she also laughed at her). Must see.
