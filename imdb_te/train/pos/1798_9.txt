This Saturday night saw at the Provinntown Film Festival, and it was a stick to your U-year's theater movie - it really was with me. Perhaps a brilliant novel was adapted very cleverly from what's been, it's totally rounded characters, clever rationing on life choices, and a back and forth-of-drama I was not exaggerated. The best of the movie making in 100+ years. Wonderful work from everyone else, who died under a glowing Vanessa Redgrave, Newport Metron, and Claire Danes at her younger age. Meryl Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, as Mama, is a real deal; Patrick Wilson appears as Paul Newman Circa 1958 and does not overdo the charm; And the delightful, descriptive characters to see the amazing theater dances, such as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins. Hog Dancy, from the stage, does not bring much edge to a somewhat clich√© character of a delightful rich waste, and family issues can be resolved more clearly than real life. But it's deliberate, visually beautiful meditations on real life issues, and you can cry it out and you think you're recklessly manipulating. Also, any luxury parade of the 1940s / 50s automobiles.
