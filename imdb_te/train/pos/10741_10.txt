None of the French Noudes brothers had a video camera on the day of the tragedy. <br /> In Building # 2, when you see that the documents are stuck, you can beat the land from jumping from such height. <br /> <br /> When two buildings collapsed, the camera was still running and white dirt shattered them, they found a shop door and came inside, but this footage was real and I feel like a fantastic work for us. <br /> <br /> The stars are going to the NOWOUT BROTHERS I can never forget this country because I saw every 9/11 of this extraordinary film. I remember it correctly, it shows the previous death of the firefighter, who takes him to the church and his respectable funeral.
