For the third time, I saw my mother who never saw my mother this time for Frank Looser's Guys and Dolls. She was amazed by Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando's singing voices. And the havana sequences to her Simons and Brandy dancing feel a storm amazing. That's pretty cool to me and is usually the headlines of the film. Joseph L. The film is directed by Mankiewicz, and the story begins by Damon Runon, which takes some time to slow down non-musical scenes, but after a while you pull it out. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine is not forcing me, especially with the "Sue Me" number of their attractions. Also liked Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat" number and Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully's performances. With all the theatrical look, Guys and Dolls are a great movie music but definitely not good.
