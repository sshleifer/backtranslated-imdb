Be careful. The film is okay. Goldie Han and Chris Sarandon are among the best. Okay, goofy overseas guy (spoiler here) is funny with the biker for his clothes. This person is good at the owner. But the film really belongs to Sarandon and Han. These two should have more time on the screen together. They're great for chemistry. Bathroom scene-wow! Romantic, sweet, delicious. <br /> <br /> Han is a spy cocktail waitress, who rescues a foreign man and ends at the White House in the middle of the plot due to the greed of politicians. It is a long way to talk about Sarandon. Spoilers is a very unusual romantic / political comedy, and some are satisfied-the political side that is longer than the romance. <br /> When it touches on political issues, just skims on romantic areas. <br /> <br />
