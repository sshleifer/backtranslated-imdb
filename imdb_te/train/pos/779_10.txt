In Brazil's North East, the father of illiterate Maria (Fernando Carvalho), twelve years old, sold her daughter to a middle-aged man who hired herself (Chico Diaz), working as a housewife and a better life. However, this girl is relieved to the farmer Laurence (Ottoo Augusto), who abandons herself and misused her younger son to have her first sexual experience. Then she was sent to a brothel in a gold mine in Amazonas and her owner explored the unfortunate Sarahu (Antonio colony). <br /> When Maria Rio de Janeiro is facing a good life, she is explored by Kathine Vera (Darlene Gloria). <br /> <br /> "Anjos Do Soul" exposes the sad and insulting reality of child prostitution in Brazil. The girl is the duty of Maria. Last year I saw "Lilja 4-Ever", the same story in the former Soviet Union; So this problem exists in third world countries. The director and writer Rudi Lagman demonstrated great performances by revealing the reality, but did not show nudity or clear sexual scenes. This assured Fernando Carvalho, who had a stunning performance in the children's frightening battle for survival. Most prostitutes of prostitutes, and many plastic surgeries, she can not distinguish Darlene Gloria very differently. The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also quite realistic. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Anzos do soul" ("Angels of the Sun")
