"Gandhi is a husband and father?" People in India have always been discussed. 'Gandhi ... my dad' Some stories are just such details. An understanding of Gandhi's personal life. <br /> <br /> Overall, I like cinema and cinematography. As a gesture, Akshay Khanna and Shefli Shah are doing all the good jobs. Many of the scenes in this film are good desktop wallpapers ... a fond job. <br /> <br /> The traditional Indian folk music gives a good feel to the background of certain parts of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not like my story style. <br /> <br /> Overall, Anil Kapoor produces good work by productions. I will recommend "I see-once". 8/10
