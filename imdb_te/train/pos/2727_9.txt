This is one of the true crime movies for Truman Capote's true book hero. Hanking Quincy Jones' musical score and Scott Wilson and Robert Blake's amazing performance Dick and Perry, the murderers. <br /> <br /> The black and white cinematography and editing are top notch. Re-murders are frightening and after the real murders to your imagination, they are more scary than they have shown shotgun. The film was filmed at the original Clatter House, which was sold to another man after the murders. The film has a lot of documentary feelings-other scenes in the original Clutter house are also shot in gas stations and killers actually go. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is also in the film. Gere has a great turn as a prosecutor in small trial scenes that are not filmed in the original courtroom, but there are a lot of real mess killing lawyers who paint themselves as a jury for the film. <br /> <br /> It's a solid picture of scary every time you've seen it.
