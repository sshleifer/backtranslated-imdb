Compared with a spin tap, they lose both crazy and R & R groups. In fact, the similarity ends here because the Still Crazy is mostly written and behaved, but the Spinel TapApp script makes it a little better than the first 10 minutes from Beavis and Buthehead to look better. It's still a crazy formula but the characters' favorite and an unexpectedly high-quality offset of an unexpected high quality film of some music numbers for me. The spin tap on a satire is a disappointment with the film's mild temperament, but I'll take Stile Crazy's self-contained story in a typical but failed shot on a spunial tap satire.
