<br /> <br /> It's not true, I'm lying, it's not the best film of all time, but it's a really enjoyable movie I've ever seen. It's Jay Leon and Pat Morita (Mr Miyagi) is a missing car engine design or some fluff story about something, but it does not matter. Because the film is fun, because of the interaction between the two heroes, they initially disliked each other and were in unbelief but became friends in a controversial twist. The whole culture difference thing is very well done, it's fun to watch, it's totally ridiculous but in a cheesy and enjoyable way. The soundtrack is good, once again on a cheeky 80's, it's fit for the film, I'm trying to find songs for the ages, but I'm working from memory. <br /> Another thing for the movie , But I will not give it away, oh! At the end I will take this film for 48 hours of Edy Marfee's output, including Beverly Hills Cop, and Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence are named after their names. Give this shot if you're looking for a buddy cop movie and bored with "White White Cop Street Black Black Cop". <br /> <br /> You may be pleasantly surprised when "I'm going to the whole formula upside down with Japanese Captain meets a Japanese Cop that meets a white cop". <br /> I'm giving this 7 to be honest I'd be more than that. I gave it 8 instead. But I'm in some ways of insanity making me in this film.
