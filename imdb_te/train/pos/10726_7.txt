To my surprise, I enjoyed 'SpaceCamp', and I saw it 13 years ago, and I recently hired it. I am very impressed. Special effects in today's space films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are very high for special camps. However, the film has a story-this is a very simple eighty story, you can read almost the next line of conversation after hearing it. But what I like about it - they can not make such images, so it's a refreshing change. It is interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lee Thompson in the early roles, to add substance to light and fluffy plot with Tom Schckert and Kate Kapsa. Definitely loved the robot named Jinx, it is very beautiful, but unfortunately there is more emotion than some of the main characters. The film is inspired by its own style, and it is interesting to note that it was shot in NASA SpaceKam (I think) in Alabama.
