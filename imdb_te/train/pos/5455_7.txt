Infamous pre-coded film, indeed a film that insisted on Hayes code was executed. Barbara Stanwick has acted as a young girl, and the father who sells alcohol does not have a problem with his customers. When he died in an accident, she was out of the world with the knowledge that she could get her to the Chinese body. She goes to New York and goes to a corporate ladder at a time, climbing a bed. Although not explicitly showing original sex, the film is very scarce. Unfortunately, early shock value fades (since Stanwick oversees a train car inspector again freely), the film is repetitive and stubborn. Stanwyck is something she only keeps the image worth sitting by. As always, she is wonderful.
