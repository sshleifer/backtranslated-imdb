I finished watching this movie in my GCSE history class. This is a wonderful insight into what actually happened to Steve Biko during the thrilling and abusive law. I can say that this film is very boring or dull 2 ​​and I do not know for half an hour in their lives because it has been tied to me from start to finish. Denzel Washington painted him and showed how he was fighting the apartheid legislation and how the rights of blacks got equal rights. In one episode, Steve Biko is a policeman, we are weak and human being, showing them that all blacks in South Africa are not different from whites. Donald Woods encouraged me because he could not fully believe in the castle and opaque. He and Steve Biko created a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and went to wake up the world. I enjoyed this movie very much and strongly recommend this to the public. I know that racism is not correct, everyone is equal and that their fate should not be determined by the color of the skin. n
