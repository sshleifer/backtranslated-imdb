Ella is superb, Francont is surely over the top (but he has acted in other films like "Eiffel Tower on Man") and Alan is almost certainly not "thrilled". <Br /> <br /> * Lightweight spoiler forward *: How many times I am wondering how Elisha Cook is in his films but I remember many other examples. <br /> <br /> Very nice but dated film Nair (for example: smile and police like everyone else) <br /> <br /> The deadlines of the period have not been done in tableclicks format . <br /> 10 to 8.
