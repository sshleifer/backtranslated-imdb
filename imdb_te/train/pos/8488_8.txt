I want to throw my two cents, relax, it's a comedy. Yes, the majority of the characters are widespread and written. They are not many funny ideas I can not. It's not a new release, which airs video and air in the cables almost every week. Do I watch in the theater? When it first came, I did. It's funny ... it should be enough. <br /> <br /> I would like to see on the cable for Michael Keaton. He is a lesser and acclaimed actor. I can not think of another person who is capable in every genre. I can not even think of a non-successful person. A comedian is also an action star (short lived but still), also a romantic lead, who is also a dramatic actor; A villain and a hero. I can not think of anything in Hollywood. Nobody definitely succeeded in those categories. I mean Tom Cruise, but it's better to be Tom Cruise than I'm a character. But this is not about Michael Keaton vs. Tom Cruise. I'm going to <br /> <br /> Gung Ho is worth taking a rent. Wal-Mart. It is worth watching on the cable (if you have a cable or satellite). It's one of those fun to watch movies. <br /> You are more shining, with my honest opinion, asking for more.
