NOTHING (3+ outta 5 stars) Another strange premise from the movie "Cube" director. The two main characters who find themselves at this time transport a mysterious white vacuum. Nothing outside their small two-story house is literal. To be sure, I felt like creating a humorous tone for the film. There should definitely be some humor ... and I finally got rid of the humor from the status of our two heroes (their last "showdown" is certainly a hoot) ... but I really think the movie would have been much better if it was initially rooted in reality. After watching the film, I saw the "Making Of" feature on the DVD and in the small trailer, which is almost entirely on the "Sillar" comic elements ... it looks like a completely different (and slightly better) image. The last half an hour of the film begins to really come together ... The recent movie "Primer." The actors were good when they did not exceed the comedy shit. They are really reliable in their "normal" moments. I'm ready to write this film as a failed experiment at midway point ... but finally won me. (And let's look at the credits for the last scene ... do not ask me to explain it.)
