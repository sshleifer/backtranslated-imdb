As far as I know, the main actor has seen his performance and I know it's a fantastic character and I agree with him. This is a fantastic picture about a very amazing boy / man who is part of a particular body for him. Oscar and BAFTA winner, and Golden Globe nominee Daniel Day Lewis Christie Brona spent a few weeks at his wheelchair in the life cycle with a cerebral palsy. He has a special left foot, he can write with it, paint and stuff with it. He learns to speak later in this film, which is good for a person who resembles him. Home Alone nominated Brenda Flicker to win 2 Oscars and the Golden Globe Mr. Brown and Mr. Brown, who won the BAFTA. It was nominated for Best Actor Oscar for Best Screenplay based on Screenplay on Jim Sheridan, Best Writing, Medium and Best Picture, which nominated BAFTA for Best Picture, Best Up Artist and Best Adaptive Screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewes is ranked 85th in The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the 20th highest grossing British Greatest Actress, the 9th in Britain's Best Actor, and the 15th in The World's Greatest Actor, and the film The 50 Greatest In British Films. Fabulous!
