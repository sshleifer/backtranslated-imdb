Without doubt, John Lee Curie's novels are the best and most wonderfully transformed into a classic film. Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' Teacher), Peter Egan (Magnus Pim, The Perfect Spy), And British controller), along with the remaining characters, are perfect and natural, awarded to those responsible for laying them Photos should be given. The smaller parts, such as the Major Membership, are also perfected. Despite the fake of Magnus, Jack Broderhead and US Intelligence's Slim Grande Lederer are more closely to Magnus and Axel than the characters in the novel and the characters in the novel. I've read the book at least a dozen times, and have seen that film almost a lot of times, and both continue mesmerizing. If I had a book on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be more selective than others.
