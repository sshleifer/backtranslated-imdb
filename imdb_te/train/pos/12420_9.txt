It was a hit at the time but was now classified as an Australian cult film. Humor is widespread, unsubtle and, in a BBC studio fire it is raw, in the late sequence of urination by urination. Every cliche about the traditional Australian Pilgrimage to the 'Old Country', and every clich√© about the exploits, Strike Up, Wigging, Tory Brits. The strong cast of well-known actors and the Australians of that generation is acceptable for the British, they can get rid of humor. Americans - forget it. Language and jokes are in the English Australian dialect and are unclear.
