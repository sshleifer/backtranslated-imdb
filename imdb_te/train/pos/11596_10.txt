When I was 7 years old I saw this film - this was done 33 years ago - and I never forgot the film! I touched deep and moved by the brave little boy and cute eagle. <br /> <br /> My sister is in the picture with me and I have recently asked her. She remembered that we saw the boy and Eagle and remembered that she had just seen her yesterday. <br /> <br /> You can never forget - my sister and me ...
