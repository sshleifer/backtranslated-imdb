Life Begins - and Closes - We have a typical 1930's maternity / Dorothy Tree, and Gloria Shia, who see 48 hours of life with high risk pregnant women, such as Lauretta Young, Glenda Farell, Clara Blanlick (Aunt Mum), Vivienne Osborne, Looking forward to giving birth. Maternity wards were much more restrictive and were limited to the day when it was restricted, giving birth to a regular city hospital in 1932 for our grandmothers and great grandmothers. <br /> <br /> The most extraordinary performance of the film is the male cast member, young Eric Lynden, Zed Sutton, and Grace's (Loretta Young) husband. No actor! For the first time, Dad suffers from the Zed Hospital staff and brushes his concerns about his wife, who will cut the pieces from a cafeteria table. I felt intense all his concerns. I want to see more of this actor's work. He has a lot of emotional tones, which is used for an unforgettable influence on Gone with the Wind. Eric was a young soldier whose leg was removed without anesthesia, "Do not cut! Do not cut!" Scarlett fled the hospital in horror. Chilling! Another great performance is played by Miss Bowers, nurse from Alyn MacMahon. Her character is the kind of salt, nurse type of land type we hope to get for our hospital time to break down hospital rules continuously in order to show more humanity of the hospital. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Loretta Young also performed another amazing acting job here, very authentic and deeply felt performance like Grace. My, she's pretty good in these pedophiles, and I have really grown up to appreciate her as a performer for the past actress. <br /> <br /> My taste (who does not know that the brandy circulating in the hot water bottle in 1932 is notorious for the health of the unborn child) but her character eventually re-sells her. <br /> <br /> Gilbert Roland is a silent film actor who is a discouraged Italian husband. <br /> <br /> Life Begins is the perfect place to watch, and it tries to capture some time in TCM, but remember to bring some hankies to shout. 9 out of 10
