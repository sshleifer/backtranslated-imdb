I agree with a big fan of South Park and think basketball is funny and I think it's as good as ever. I feel like what happens when I combine David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Tray Parkers. The film has a replay value and does not care to take it seriously at any time. Slapstick style comedy combined with Stone and Parker works without any errors. The kind of comedy in basketball has not gained popularity over the time it was released and has succeeded today. Do not worry to be complicated, leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs coming. Recommended for those who have a good sense of humor.
