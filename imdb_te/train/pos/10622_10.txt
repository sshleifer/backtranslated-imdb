"Minute's Hate" is a comedy beautiful movie. A mental thriller takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is a serial killer life, the Eric Sea. Strong performances and superb cinematography in the movie "Must See" for the student or horror fan. This film is different from the reality of the story and other psychological killer films of Eric's human side. A shock to the film, "The Evil Dead", along with the film's producer, Bruce Campbell.
