Many of Richard Attenborough's films as the director's biographies of major historical figures - "Young Winston", "Gandhi", "Chaplin". "Gray Owl" is also a historic man's biography, but the subject of Attenborough is very unclear. <br /> <br /> Gray Owl is a Canadian author in the 1920s and 1930s. These are the reasons for environmentalism and nature preservation. He was widely believed to be an American Indian; He was born in Mexico to a Scottish father and Apache mother and immigrated to Canada, where he became a member of the Ozibway tribe. He lived in the cabin through a lake in a remote area of ​​the Canadian wilderness, where he lived as a treper. In the years 1935 and 1937 he traveled to the British, to promote his books and give lectures on conservation theories, and introduced the Royal Family. (These tours were once in Attenborough, then the young man appeared in the London Palladium Theater, where Gray Owlubu appeared). However, after his death in 1938, it was revealed that he did not say who he was; His real name was Archibald Belani, and was born in the English seaside town of Hastings. <br /> <br /> The film takes some of the facts in Gray Owl's life. In the scene set in 1934, he says he is 41 years old. In fact, he was born in 1888, 46 people in that year. (46 Pierce Brosnan was old, I do not know why this film was made). Many events have been shortened in the last four years of Gray Owl's life (1934-1938). In the film he married Gertrude Bernard as Anaphon, and he married and marries; In fact, he met and married Gertrude in 1925. The film also discarded that they had divorced in 1936 and that Gray Owl was recurring shortly before his death. <br /> The real recognition of the Gray Owl has adversely affected his posthumous reputation, and he was dismissed as "fraud". His emotionally fraudulent causes were used to disturb the causes he had taken. Richard Attenborough, however, takes a more sympathetic view of his achievements. An item explored by the image is related to race recognition. Although Archibald Belley was not a Canadian Indian who was already born, there was no doubt that he had deep knowledge of Ojibway culture and knowledge and that he spoke fluently in their language. He was accepted by Ojibway as their race member. It is unfair to describe his claim to the identity of his native North America as a fraudulent person, not because of his identity than a person he was born. <br /> <br /> Gertrude, the grandson of Gray Owl, is from Indian origin, but comes from a family that is collectively in white Canadian culture. Her marriage is considered a renewal of her family's original cultural heritage. She was clearly influenced by her husband, but she influenced him, persuading him to leave his work as a furry trapper because she had moral objections to preserving her fur. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan is a critique of the hero as "sneaky", a critic of the preface that Brosnan would only play the role of Action Heroes in the James Bond mold. However, I took a touchdown backwoodman Grace Good Oll, to address this role, to avoid journalists, to avoid journalists, to retrieve the play, and take from the best agent bond. He was nominated for various roles when he starred in the original Bond, Sean Connery, "The Hill" or "The Molly Magieres". <br /> <br /> I agreed with those who found weak Assisi Galiph Gutra. <br /> <br /> Another film that I can not accept is "Boring". Certainly, this is not an action film like Bonds, or a great epic biopic like "Mahatma Gandhi", and it may seem boring for those who have assumed it would be one or the other. However, in the early days of the conservation movement or the philosophical consequences of national and ethnic identity, there is the possibility of anyone interested. Canadian forest scenes were also beautifully taken. Richard Attenborough has made us a service by helping us to restore interest as half forgotten but attractive. 7/10
