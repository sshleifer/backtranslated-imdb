It's too small. I think every voice is made by Jason Steel. <br /> <br /> If you hear his simple voice, do not just worry about them. The spatula is fighting war against the spoons and he meets some impatient people. Of course, he knows everyone is familiar to everyone. <br /> "Edward!" "General Peterson, we must reach the medical department!" "No, I did not do it Edward." "I do not speak like that, I'm sure you'll be fine" "I'm a Gunner Edward, and you know, before I go-" "Yes?" "Do I have a kiss?" "Um, no." "Peak on the lips, small, each one will fall?" <br /> <br /> You will soon be cinematic. That date is in September, but it goes backwards.
