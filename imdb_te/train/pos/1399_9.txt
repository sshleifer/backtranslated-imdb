This is one of the shallow episodes that seem to have a need to really enjoy the plot. However, I admire this lightweight approach and it is one of the best episodes to watch it at full play. Think about it - Team Horde from Wonderland means that the white hare and Alice, the Bengal tiger, the samurai warrior, the horse on horseback and other seemingly extreme events on the horse that killed McCoy would be far from the end. Despite all the danger, you can not simply take everything very seriously - it's just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. So, in a completely non-aesthetic level, it's great.
