Eddie Murphy Deliras is undoubtedly the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life. I first saw 2 years ago, and a few weeks later I was in the stitches. Today I have seen 17 times and I'm still smiling every time my donkey. Those who dont know he knows Eddie Murphy's comedian before a Hollywood superstar is an excellent stand. Unlike Eddie Murphy, released in 1987, this theme lacks a frustrating area, it is flat in the middle. If you're not a person who does not stand the procession, you can hear the procession in every form every 5-10 seconds. I've given 10 of these 10 people, because they show great comical intelligence.
