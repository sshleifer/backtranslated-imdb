As we all know, the sex comedy sub-generation is very beautiful. Just too rarely is not enough. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] <br /> <br /> When I arrived at the 40 year old Old Virgin, I saw commercials after all; "If you do not use it, is it losing it?" I can not recognize a heart and honest efforts in the development of the character. We have the most weird "off-the-wall" characters in Adam Sandler movies and the language that is not incompatible with the arc of Nova's but some image is worth a love story and yes also the message. <br /> The main character Andy (unfortunately for me) is the person I can say. In the very first shot he also shares my love for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the film on his wall) and we look forward to seeing him be the oldest throughout the film. Andy also has plenty of video games and knowledge of the work of movies and technologies. Andy likes his bike and does not like to buy a car. Most importantly; Andy is a good guy, he does not swear and he will avoid them because he respected many women. Combining all of these things, he thinks he is a serial killer. It sounds like my life story. <br /> <br /> The other characters have funny little stories for everyone, they work at a certain level, but not as Andy, along with their little exaggeration people. <br /> <br /> I thought that Andy and his girlfriend Trish really had some kind of attention because it was only real human characters in the whole film. <br /> <br /> When I mention a mistake, it is noticeable in light. The story is as intelligent but very predictable and very love stories; It's easy. It has long been associated with Andy's relationship with Trish and we finally know what happened. Certainly its final sidewalk is a bit different than what we expected, but you know what's going on in the end, and I'm assured to you. <br /> <br /> There are definitely small strains in this movie, but there are so many good here that I can easily ignore some mistakes. <br /> When I say "good", "bad" is this sex comedy and wants to be bad. For the most part I think it will succeed. Attempts like Andy are very pleasurable after refusing to have sexual relations with Trish. Or Andy ended up asking for more than any questions to the scene that goes to sex school with his trish daughter. Ah and we do not forget the waking sequence of classic chest soon "Oh! Kamo Sea Lama!" An interesting little note about that scene; Actor Steve Karell actually made the wax his belly and the pain shown is true. <br /> <br /> When we start talking about Steve Karel, he now wants to say that he has grown up. I also have my list of respectable comedies which is oddly sorted from who do not know who he is before seeing this movie. I am impressed by his writing, acting and time, and I now want to really see his future roles. <br /> <br /> I have expressed doubts about this film to be honest but the first word is positive and I know what I will see in the end. It seems to be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and I'm very happy that it's doubling as you can see. It's not just sitting together with sexually ugly rows, it's a very fine role and a series of sexual garments linked to true touching romance. I will remove my disrespect. <br /> My review from Fried Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
