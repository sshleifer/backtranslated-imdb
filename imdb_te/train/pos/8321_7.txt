Although this pilgrimage is silly, it is a fun movie. It's sort of a guilty pleasure to see. Meg Ryan can remove characters in this film (another example Joe vs. The Volcano). She is a star, she will be part of it. Walter Mottau, in fact, has the ability, and he really puts himself in the role, a fun, good-hearted Einstein. I do not think they are good at playing the characters in love, as compared to the characters I love in different ways (loving karmadagin).
