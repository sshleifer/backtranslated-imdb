I recently saw this in the Sundance channel. The idea for the film is that many filmmakers, especially the smallest films in their own country, and eleven of them, to take care of only one thing in the same motion picture: September 11 <br /> The film is from Iran It starts with the picture. Teacher tries to teach students in this film. <br /> <br /> The second film from France is not known from France, she is deaf women who write a letter to her girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The next film from Egypt is about the bombs Speaking of a dead soldier about the events that happened. <br /> <br /> After coming to Bolivia, a girl finds out about the events of September 11 and believes that they should change for them. <br /> <br /> A group of boys who are believed to be Bin Ladin belongs to a country in Africa. <br /> The next day comes from Mexico. <br /> <br /> The bomb scene that is trying to get a report is often said about the attacks of two Israeli Israeli pilgrims from Israel. <br /> <br /> "You must remember now, but all of them are powerful. <br /> <br /> It will bring back your emotions from day one. <br /> <br />
