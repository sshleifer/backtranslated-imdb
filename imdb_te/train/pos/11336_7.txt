Answer: This film is a creepier, nastier, and more irrational than any zombie that lurched your ex-land, even though a woman wrote and directed. <br /> <br /> Acting in this independent movie is actually very good, despite a less sublime script. It takes a better actor to deliver Overwrite, Clutch Line, and this is unclear. <br /> <br /> <br /> Young Anthony Day Marco, like Jake, has performed a particularly good performance. <br /> Fortunately, the dialogue of this film is better than the dialogue. Try to be special if you're not a monster fan. This is not a horror movie. Although all adult girls are pretty clumsy, and if their brains are eaten on some earlier zombie film, "Jake's Closet" fits only adults. <br /> <br /> The whole, at this point, is much better than the sum of its parts.
