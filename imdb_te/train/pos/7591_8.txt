The styles are not mess but it depends mainly on Stephen Chow's style mash-ups for inspiration. Magic kung-fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and some crying drama. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty awesome. <br /> <br /> In this film a baby will be abandoned next to the court basket court. A homeless man is in the middle of a man who reads a kung fu man manual and reads something to the homeless man. The old monk teaches a boy but ends up trying to learn the special technique in the manual. This school was taken by a fraudulent Kung Fu Master who is helping four absurd monks. The master of a 20-year-old boy is now a mad master and is thrown into the night by the master of weak punches wounded. The boy found garbage throwing in a basket from a magnificent distance by a man to take him to a gangster club playing darts. It's a big fight, boycotting a boy in a monastery and man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation. <br /> This is what happens in the first 20 minutes. The first 10 minutes. The first film in the rather acute short story is how little we know the main character until the way. The boy who uses the boy spends more time in the first third. The plot will follow any new ground except for the insane climax of the film. I'm sure you can imagine how to look at the end of the absurd monks. All of the effects, photography and stunt work are made for top-lyrical and uninspired plots. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has a better command of plot and comic strips, and the film resides in its shadow but is not a good reason to ignore it. It's also fun with a scatter-shot finish. Recommended.
