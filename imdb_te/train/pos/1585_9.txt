Born in 1942, Berlin-born Margarez von Trotta is an actress and is now a very important director and writer. As director, her artistic ability to bring her a woman's sense of suspicion, perhaps even unfairly depicted. Mixed and Strange Reviews (New York Times article is not a perfect image for "Rosenstrasse," which has received one of the most negative aggressive reviews that I ever read in that paper). <br /> <br /> All genres displayed in Berlin Street are a fine picture and provision for all of the people of Jarosius, a successful opposition to the jockeys' Nazi regime. <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> "And surprisingly, Ruth" Shiva "(not only a Jewish weekly) is a surprise to a long and uninterruptedly unhealthy Jewish lifestyle, but she insisted that she should follow the precise conversations of her faith, and her apartment in New York City showed her the wealth of her deceased husband's work She is pitching the idea of ​​her American-born daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrder) and a bit of the concept of traditional Jewish practices that control her brother's mother, Hannah's fiancée, Fudja von Hueet.) When Ruth warned her that she would refuse Hannah if she did not give up her heartfelt laughs The domestic crisis is well over <br /> <br /> Hannah is in love with a cousin who is interested in a battle about my childhood childhood in Berlin and Hannah is curious - she questions her mother who refuses to discuss that part of her life. It's very real. I grew up with Nazi Germany's parents who had fled and I knew many children, from the whole family, but usually in part, the Holocaust escaped. <br /> <br /> Hunaa, the German slave, realized that Ruth had saved her life, going to Berlin, and the defender was still trying to breathe. She was not, it was a very small film. But Ruth is a historian, and now a 90-year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), a widow. Scenarios between Berlin and the war capital of the past may change. <br /> <br /> The young Lena Katja Rieman of 1943) was a pianist married to a Jewish violin, Fabian Fischer (Martin Fefel). When the Nazi regime came to power, he needed to use "Israel" as a middle name, because Jewish women had to add "Sarah" to their names (incidentally the IMDb did not list Fabian's name with its lying "<br /> <br /> Many German Jews are concentrated While camping, the "Aryans" marriages were excluded until some time. <br /> <br /> All she and many other women are aware that they are confined to a building in Rosenstrasse, who are forced by the audience of anxious women, Some people from German authorities refuse to help and they ("Jewish-loving  ేశ్య" ఒక పునరావాసంగా) దుర్వినియోగం చేస్తారు. ఒక subplot లేనా ఎక్కువ లేదా తక్కువ ఆమె తల్లి స్వాధీనం ఉన్నప్పుడు దాచిపెట్టిన ఎనిమిది సంవత్సరాల రూత్ స్వీకరించి (గుర్తు, రూత్ ఇప్పుడు మాన్హాటన్ లో శివ కూర్చొని ఉంది). బాల రూత్ స్వెవా లాహెడ్ చేత చిత్రీకరించబడింది. <br /> <br /> Women have finally succeeded by increasing protests. Men and some women were released. One of the rare and almost unprecedented periods of the Nazis is that when the madmen recognize the defeat in their homicidal agenda (the other ending the campaign to eliminate the recess of mental disorders and long-term discomfort, another story increases the voiced troy tension and each woman's story is personal and Hannah is slowly, one gathers, elderly and elderly She began to suspect that she did not deal with a common historian, but she was aware of her mother who had been killed by her surviving girl. A bustling, rebuilding, discrepancy between the 1943 Rosenstrasse, a set, and a street in unified Berlin To provide a recurring background factor today's Berlin Heritage <br /> <br /> The main actors are uniformly impressive, and Lena's husband is helpless to avoid being forced into captivity (all the characters, including local police and the army) Clearly understood - this is a one-way trip to Oblivion). Old Ruth is enthusiastically furiously forced to put down his demons in the life of New York. Hannah was very young as a teenager, and her father's death triggered the need for her family's past. These things happen (though the critic of Times does not know). <br /> <br /> The hand of Von Trotta is perfect but not accurate. A scene with Goebbels at a soiree enjoying playing Lena's violin is unnecessary and distracting. To protect her husband, the promoter suggested to bed with a high-profile Hitler admirer, escaped from the marvelous accomplishment of her husbands and relatives. Many German officials came from central casting, and Eric van Stroehm used to "copy and paste" the Teutonic loss. <br /> <br /> The Rosenstrasse story is an example of books and essays and argues that most Jews are protesting by most Germans. Unfortunately the argument is nonsense. German women occupying Rogenstress have a deep and meaningful self-interest. Most Germans are in a line between passive and dangerous anti-Semitism. Why Rosenstrasse is almost singular of protest. If many Germans have taken possession or denial of real-world freedom fighters, it is not denied that thirty anti-Semitism leading to anti-Nazi resistance from 1933. <br /> <br /> The elderly women have been achieved by women in a bad time as "light ray". Most men and women who came from the death tour recently escaped from the war. So "Ray of Light" and it is said that Van Trota's film is a beacon of brilliance, some suggesting that it is more commonly saved by ordinary women's courage and that a context for each organ is saved. <br /> <br />
