I have seen these dozen times in years. <br /> When I first saw at PBS station at P B & W I was fifteen years old. <br /> <br /> I have purchased a DVD set to see the children and see them. They do not teach history in school, and it describes the most complicated event of the 20th century. It expands their critical thinking. <br /> Obviously, the participants explain the details of what they did in their own words and why, the war and the actual war. <br /> Alistair Cook Buy it for your children along with America. See with them, and understand them. You're so glad you did.
