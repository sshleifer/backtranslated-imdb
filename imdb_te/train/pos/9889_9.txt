Read Eric's review again. He best described my own concept for the film. <br /> I've seen television years ago. This is a special image I do not hesitate to make comparisons. It was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the relentless wicked country of koihaila / jacatecas / san luis Potosi. It is a sedan-like durgongo, Mexico (not that of John Wayne) but it is a real stark and wild place. The novel now has to be found to check out the original location of the story. Like the location, this film is strange and wild and exciting and unnatural and absolutely not everyone. <br /> <br /> I can not forget this movie, it's even worse. Nevertheless, in some years I have forgotten its existence. I do not know anyone, I never read about it, no sign of it. Erendira such an unusual name, I'd also forgot the title. <br /> <br /> Gabriel Garcia is a big fan of Márquez, and is sorry for what he read before. <br /> Relative to MsMyth comment below; The film was filmed in Mexico but the author did not comment on Colombian and Mexican or Mexican history, but Marquez now lives for "political" reasons in Mexico. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I am still trying to find a copy of this film for my library. Like a movie? You have to read that story and then all Garcia Márquez wrote. And, by the way, the original location in the story is Columbia.
