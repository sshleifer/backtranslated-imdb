A beautiful postcard of New York. The thing I enjoyed was that I could see this with my whole family and was not afraid to wait for a stupid toilet humor joke that looks like. This has never been done. My teenagers liked it very much. My daughter for my son and Michael Wutton for Natasha Hendstridge. My wife and I could not remember the last time if I could sit and work with the kids. This film is told the story is not comfortable but old or full. The end was a twist which we all loved so much. If you're not a dull guy and let's open a story it's for you. When it comes to porn movies as a person it takes a lot to capture my interest and made one. I would recommend it and it is necessary to see these movies.
