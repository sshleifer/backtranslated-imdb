Takashi's conquest of Kiddie landed me almost immediately, because he demonstrated nerves and courage in dealing with fantasy. This is a fairy tale of courage dark. Even though I was a little boy, I thought it was bad about the fantastic stories. Most children's books happen to terrible things for people. Mike understands that these classic stories are slightly spots (and more glitches) than the ones at first glance. The filmmaker presents the child's archetypal story in a fantastic exploration of the preschool class. He shouts the real fears of the world filled with endangered dangerous missions. Westerners want to reduce the intensity behind the exclusively written children's bedtime stories. I'm honest with Mike more than most American filmmakers. He goes for the story of the story but he also shows signs of banning. But self-picked MIAC still stranger than many filmmakers. I thought it was a great movie. Highly recommended.
