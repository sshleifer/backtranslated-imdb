This is a treat when this show is being a new, innovative and original presentation. This makes every presentation I've ever watched to look plain boring. I received praise from the first episode broadcast of the first episode, and I became so easy for all the characters (I always hated some roles because it never happened). This program is not a third season, it's a pity because it should be one of the best performances I have ever seen and it does not exaggerate my feelings for performance at all. Nobody can ever pose daisies, can ABC probably replace this show? This is the best performance on television. <br /> I came for Christine Chennton and I fell in love with the whole show.
