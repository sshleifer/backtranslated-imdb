One of the most outstanding actresses in a movie is serving as a practical invitation to the local movie home, so I immediately responded. <br /> <br /> Vancouver Redgrave is great when he is lying on the bed. She looks very old and I do not think this film is going to be much better. It's a sad thing to go to the movie. I think her old age has got a bit tough in recent years. Claire Danes continues his welcome return to the movies and exudes a perfect warmth. Mamie Gammer's comparison to her mother Merle Streep in both physical performance and acting style is great, and after a few minutes I lost my attention to the film. She is surprisingly good; But such a comparison has a risk of working against her. I agree with a previous comment: Natasha Richardson has some plastic work perfectly made for her face. Her previous movies (such as "Nell" are not exactly what I would like to remember her). Both she and Tony Colett were convinced that they were sisters without sin. Their mutual weakness. Tony Colette is very old for her role. Glenn Close and Meryl Streep had more screen time. Strip's performance is actually slightly more than a guest role. On the other side, her sequences have a greater emotional echo than the other. Eileen Atkins is an imaginative night-time partner for Redgrave's role, especially her second role. For men; Hugh Dancy is very fond of this movie, yet he has acted more than necessary performance. In fact, when he tells the story, it starts to pull. He also gives the kid his credit to create an attractive, half-hearted sense of the viewer. On the other hand, Patrick Wilson was completely empty in the middle of the film. There is also the misfortune that the script is not enough to explain why three people (one of them) why he owns this person. <br /> <br /> The backstory should be further developed. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is as good as expected. But the main summer house set failed to convince me. It does not appear naturally on that rocky hill, especially with its grass patch. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was a classy product, but it was visible-before-before, all of a long time ago and I had failed to make the type of impact I had imagined from a tearjerker. However, it is still time to think about time passes, about the expectations of life and whether or not they are fulfilled. At least on the DVD
