Those comments here before mine, I highly agree with Edyarb's. The story and script are apparently funny, but managing in some places, it has failed in other places. You could see a joke, but no one was laughed at. (Edyarb's opinion on the final credits is also acknowledged: usually leave or cool it, but not what they're doing now.) Okay, I'm actually watching the movie. I enjoyed it; It is fun fun to the night and is not exactly a waste of money to get a ticket. Outstanding jokes are going out and predictable outside of the imagination, Luke Wilson's character Matt Super Chick "P * nis or bed?" Asked. <br /> <br /> When she told her that after a jungle night in her bed, "she fell on the couch, breaks the couch and left the mattress". <br /> <br /> However, I can say the bgs1614 film can earn an 'R' rating - nothing in the justification is perfect. Some sexual acts are yes, but clear, just funny, and no nudity. Superman Returns and Click: I'd like to compare this to two recent films I have yet to see with any expectations. I did not really expect anything from anyone - the big fan of the original Superman movies and the trailer for click showed that it was a powerful chauvinistic (which I do not oppose). Superman was really surprised me and had a good feel for seeing my first heroic deed (goosebumps!). But for the rest of the story I would like to see my super ex-girlfriend, at least some surprises. Once again, it's awesome and much better than the trailer, five minutes away from a really amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the only reason I compare these three films is that I have seen these three films in a very short period of time and I have gone to all these basics with basically no expectations. I click on them, girlfriend, Superman.
