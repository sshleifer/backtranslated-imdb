The Blood Gordon plays the role of an agatha-kristy type murder mystery writer who will keep her nephew safe through marriage. Gordon believes he has murdered his niece and murdered a young man, while Gordon returns to New York. However, he maintains some safe deposit boxes and some clues and scratches on a sophisticated and well-hidden note. Colombo enters the case, doubting herself, and solves mystery using her supernatural spiritual natural powers. Oh, and Marietti Hart, Gordon's secretary and blacksmith. Heart, I believe, is the great daughter of psychologist B. F. Skinner. <br /> <br /> I can not say for sure that she has nothing to do with her attractive belly button, which she performed during her heart meditation. But I always admired Skinner. It's a good plot, and there is no light on the performers or group. But the best number is Ruth Gordon, only five feet long. She has been over 80 years old and has seen it. There are moments when she almost teeters, but she firmly exudes her charm. Her performance is unique. You can not be sure when she is serious or she's putting Colombo and audiences. She gave very good lines. What is the comedy that came from Gordon. <br /> <br /> In Colombo, there are often no funny movements.
