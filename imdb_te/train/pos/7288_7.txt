This film is a perfect classic for the camp. That is why it is the LVV and MST3000 classic. Everyone knows the story. The scientist keeps his girlfriend's head in his basement lasagna pan, where he cruises the town and tries to find her body by checking local chickens. Finally he will find a real hourglass body on top of a scar-face chic head. The severed head makes friends with a failed experiment in the room and the remaining "good" hand of the assistant (not from the previous failure of his scientist), and the whole space is burned. <br /> <br /> When we saw the film, the children were very scared that my friend could not go to his basement. We've been shooting horror movies at all times and it's a number. <br /> <br /> The only threat to the film is the original "The Haunting". <br /> <br /> I gave seven ratings for the immense entertainment value offered by the film. While it is the main thing for laughing objects, talking and laughing, unhealthy things and moral sexual perspectives are murdered by sick children. <br /> <br /> I'm glad you saw this movie tonight. I will go back to the dentist rather than the "Chicago" watch. <br /> <br /> The value of its entertainment is just good luck because I can give seven. The film is a disaster in the film.
