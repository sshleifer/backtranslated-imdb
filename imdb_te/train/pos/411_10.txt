This film is going to be very high, and I am astonished that the score is low (in this work is 5.9 / 10 (576 votes)). The film has amazing special effects, a true epic storyline, complex character, and mutual wars - they must be believed! <br /> I do not understand when I read from different sources: "This is a confusing story Has .... "," I can not follow the story .... "or" The characters have come from somewhere ... ". For the first time I saw this film, I understood it, after that I knew why the characters were, and I totally liked it! I have seen it about 8 times and every time it's a pure experience. Oh, and this is not my opinion, because this film is for many fellow Americans (who have never seen an HK film before). None of those who did not follow the protagonist failed and each person announced their love for the film. Why do not we have things like Oh man, coming out of Hollywood? Lord of the Rings is a good marriage of special effects, character development and storyline. <br /> <br /> It is not from a sweetheart lover of Asia. I have an extensive library of Asian films and I must say that this film is one of my greatest DVDs. When you look at you, you will be able to enjoy the wonderful special effects and epic feel of the film. You are pulled into this fantasy world and you can not leave! I saw both the 1983 version and 2001 (both by Sui Hark) and were much better compared to 2001 IMO. <br /> <br /> In addition to subtitles, I have an extra complaint about this movie: I do not want to end it ... I'm asking you Mr. Hark - Do we like the sequel?
