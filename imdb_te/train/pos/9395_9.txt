This is your movie if you like plot turns. Estimating what will happen at any time is impossible. It will not appear or end up as it seems. All of the characters are sandy and submerged. Cage is his best. Dennis Hopper again shows his cheerful bad side. JT Walsh is perfect in his last appearance. Laura Boyle Dwight Yogam is making a cameo appearance in a guest role. I categorized this film as "I really really, really bad day". The film is slowly missing a minute. The real sleeper. This film is underestimated and, sadly, not overlooked.
