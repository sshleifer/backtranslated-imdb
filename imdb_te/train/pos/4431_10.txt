The film rates in the top 10 movies of all my movies. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why this film is for the first time, and maybe it's probably not about understanding the themes in the movie. Historical details and cultural insights are very wealthy, and some minor anaroconiums are completely forgivable. The story revived the popular hatred between Gonzo Bridge and Monk Bennie and the young Prince Yoshitsun. The epic Yoshitsun bests will be Prince's credible tyrant in the fight against Beneye and Sanyasi. The film will have the story's revision and war, dark gesture and political maneuvering. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is "Mappo", a Buddha's prophecy. 1000 years of his teachings will fail and the world will be in chaos. After the Civil War between Mount Fuji Explosion and Taira (Hei) and Minamoto (Genji), the world was believed to be anarchy and everything collapsed in Hein Japan. This is demonic time. <br /> <br /> The film resolves the problem of the sword training of Yoshitsune by Carama's Tener (Raven Goblins). Defeated clans often escaped in the mountains and disguised themselves as monsters to scare the locals. This is the place where ninja clans are historically starting. <br /> <br /> Then there are many species of Buddhism, including Benny, and Esoteric Buddhism of the Shigon Sector. All of this is very clearly portrayed, and to add a little extra, the film managed to convey the power and power of meditation to make the film more relevant, meaning it uses magic realism to add an extra size <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Rings will be filled. The scenery and costuming are also completely unmissable and very authentic. Soundtrack is great, very uplifting and ominous. I thought the actual acting performances were surprisingly good. Benny is a great breeding anti-hero, Shanoy (Yoshitsun), who is testing his limits and is increasingly drunk on his own power, and tetsukki's knife-knife is an interesting description of the "common man" and why To find out what's good, you dug an old book in Japanese history Narrow View. The story of Robin Hood vs Little John is about how this radyling conspiracy, violence and a cryptic story of infernal ritual turns into almost the gloom.
