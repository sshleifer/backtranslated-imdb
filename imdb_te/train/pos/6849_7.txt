<br /> <br /> You may have small spoilers. <br /> <br /> For the first time, for the first time twist at the end of the plot, despite some amazing scenes, some good performances and a good, clear Hitchcock repo. <br /> <br /> We do not know anyone who wears to face the mystery of a killer who has killed at least two women), and three people search for the killer: a psychiatrist, whose wife is the only one who identifies a victim, a murderer, and a mentally retarded mentor of the patient. Sexual boredom victim Kate Miller performs good things including Nancy Allen, including Nicky Allen, such as Hooker Liz, Angie Dickenson, and Michael Caine as Dr. Rober Elliot, which is hidden more than eye; Whatever the authenticity of anybody is really exceptional. On the other hand, Denis Franz, the next hit show, NYPD Blue is the same great character, is overly exaggerating, cruel, hateful detective, yet he takes a short screen time, so it does not feel bad. <br /> <br /> Keith Gordon, the Brain Child, is fine, but it is almost really smart that is really believable. The scene with a sexually frustrated mother at the museum is vacant and well done, a sequel to her premature death. I also love love at the doctor's office, revealing the killer's identity, which makes the whole movie come together at once. And there was a split screen scene I thought was almost classic. Still there is another situation on Liz's one train, from what may be the killer, it's never taken with orders that almost never have with the strained ethnic stereotypes. This is a time thriller and very often reliable. As a criminal drama, it was ultimately eventually complete, incomplete, incomprehensible. Ultimately, the unnecessary and the path was too long, the dream sequence at the end of which had the courage to shoot anyone's feet for what appeared to be a minute. It's an up and down experience; A scene takes me through the heart and mind, and the next makes me happy and asks why. It was less than 90 years in more than 100 minutes and was a better film. <br /> <br /> Scary movie fans prefer it. It still has a better image than most of today's slasher flicks. Maybe it's a good movie, but just recently seen I can say I enjoy it, and it is worth looking for my three favorite scenes alone.
