<br /> This is a very fun dramatic story, it's also in love. This story is said to be slow but it works well in its construction. The characters are cool and are well portrayed by its actors. Normally I'm not a big fan of Asian acting style, but the acting is just fine. <br /> <br /> Film is very different from its style and other style movies. To the west. <br /> <br /> I want the visual style of the film to be a little better. The movie is not exactly in the scenes where the film is considered to be an art-house film. This is a fairly cheap film to make it clear and it's quite common. <br /> <br /> This is the film that is really different from the genre. <br /> <br /> But oh well, this film is a well-built story and characters. <br /> <br /> This film is not absolutely disappointing. <br /> <br />
