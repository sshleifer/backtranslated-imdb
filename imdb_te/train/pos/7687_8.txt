Like the Jeffersons, Good Times 1970s- I was one of the classic American comedy series that never broadcast in the UK, not to mention that the name I was born has been in for a decade. <br /> <br /> Like most fans of the show, I loved you when I headed to James and Florida-two parents trying to make the ends of Evans family, following some parts of the Tube. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ ref> <p> Who watched and meet, and despite their lack of qualifications, encourage their children, have their own aspirations in their lives and take them to their chances. James Discipline JJ, Michael and Thelma- is a tough but loving father, who did not dare to heed the line they should over the line. In Florida, in contrast to their attitudes from a Afro American perspective, in relation to parenthood and family values, James is a fair, kind-minded and considerate mother and loving wife. <br /> <br /> Parents are just as lively and entertaining as themselves: JJ is a goofy personality and humorous sense of humor, often worn multi-colored outfits, and artist Kanefrage who is seeking its 'DY-NO-worm' is unhealthy and Arnold Jackson 'Watchau Talking' 'Boat Willis? From Differstroke Strokes. Michael Smart-Alek, a dancer who dreams of, sister Telma has his own dreams and hopes. <br /> <br /> "Some of the guest roles he made from Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and the young Gary Coleman! Evan's family preferred over Huxtables, both in terms of a) role) and a) because I prefer over the good times to say Cosby Show, which is a 80 show a) I resonate with many viewers As it is a comedy, it is a social comment that was intended to highlight the lives of the Abro-Americans working class in the US in the 1970s.Chosby Show, such as the Huxtables, easily portrayed as blacks who have come together in a high-class US culture that we associate with White, a 'candy coating 'Thus, the good timing is contrary to trying to cater to the main audience <br /> <br /> In fact, I found out that the Cosplay show was fun to watch at times, with the good times being a 'sympathetic' bit and it was a trend And cool. When John Amos continued to play the role, James died in an unfortunate accident (in fact, he realized that he left Good Times for John Good Times and in the role of his character's death). Without John, the program suffered and alas, it lost a lot of charm. <br /> Furthermore, for a sitcom, Good Times threw all the right boxes. If they show it in the UK in the 80s. It's perfect, JJ put it, 'DY-NO-MITE !!' <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 and a half
