I love Doodlebops. My son is watching them for a year. We went to the Doodlebops concert last year and yesterday a concert (Connecticut). He loves them. Doodlebops does not teach the alphabet or numbers but who cares? Are you serious? Let's teach your children about TV numbers or alphabets. Parents must Get up to it. Doodlebops can actually sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and has nice singing voices you can tell all 3 in concert and do not sing lip. Imagine, they dance, jump around and still sing. They have talent, I enjoy watching the children too. This show is the best show ever for TV for kids. And rock band for children. How amazing Why people say Chad (Rooney) is gay? From wherever you heard he or not, he is awesome! Leave him. He or anyone else does not like our kids homosexual propaganda!
