I began to read the book I read and I enjoyed it ... everything was created and everything had a purpose ... I think Lewis Sachar has written the screenplay so that the film is fine. .And of course is directed by Andrew Davis ... Shia Lebouf gives a great performance for his first film ... The storyline is very cool and interesting ... there is humor, heart and intensity ... It is very similar to the book .. At least find a bit not boring ... I absolutely loved it ... and I encourage anyone to read someone .. All this b Â£ together and carefully crafted ... two thumbs up for me in every way
