This video has been rocked! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. Not only does he have class, he makes some of the funniest observations on the history and culture I've seen. Eddie is the most original and most brilliant comic I have seen in so long. Tell all other stand-ups to get out of the stage and allow this "executive" regime!
