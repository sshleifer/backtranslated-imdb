Because the film is entirely in the Swiss dialect, it is hard for most German speakers to really follow this movie. I was not from Switzerland, but for a few years I worked there, so I had the opportunity to understand this great spoof of the Lord of the Rings. I saw a lot of these films (for example the scary movie, the loads of Scifi spoof) but this is the best thing I have ever seen. I gave it to 9 to 10. The reason I can not give 10 is because there are some small details that can be good and they do not provide any subtitles in any language on the DVD, meaning Swiss.
