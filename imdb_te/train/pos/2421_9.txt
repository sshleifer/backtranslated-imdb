You should not take what I can do to be easy to say. I've seen many many movies and have reviewed them a great deal, in print. So when I told you about a single laughing scene I had ever seen in this movie, you might want to hear me. What makes this irrelevant stupid picture funny is that there is a lot of diversity in the view. And for those who just did not get well, I would not blame them a lot. The scene I say comes at a 30-minute mark and is dead guilty of John Candy. Until that time, I discovered the dumb picture, was confusing and it started to lose me. When this scene arrived, I laughed too hard, and I dismissed my pants. Never before has the film been made. When the project began, "Berzerk Going" was considered to be the SCTV movie. I remember reminding myself. As time passed, the cast moved to John Candy, Joe Flaherty & Eugen Levy. Universal also had a change of regime, which was shown at almost zero ZERO theaters after its release. During this second time, I heard the theme song (in fact, how I could not understand the plot), my logic was nervous and I came to know what would happen. Besides the above mentioned routine, there are many other happy scenes to recommend "Going Bercer". It's almost 3 stupas film, except that it's very ridiculous. Director David Steinberg has a sharp time, and he laughs at it all. For Candy, who's basically in charge here, he is always funnier. When all the plot and detailed sequences throw the window, he walks through the forest. Flaherty and Levi are inexplicably follow him. There are a plot, but the plot like "Animal House" has a plot, and yes, the script is unparalleled and is a little slow to begin with. After you know it, you can well appreciate the full SCTV style craziness runs. It's stupid, but it's deliberately stupid, and you need to remember when you see it. Let's see, it's for you, if it's the most humorous scene at all times.
