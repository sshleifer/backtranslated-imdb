Go out of the rain or outside, you enter the movie house. It's nice to you. (Otherwise, come to the right.) The lights will be lost. You are settled with ice cream bar. Moving pictures play on the screen. You think of content. In the dark, you'll be back in time. Sitting around the campfire ... Looking at the modern version of flames 24 times per second, you share the happiness and twists of unknown twists and turns of the rest of your audience. They are not happy and do not write comments. (Long Live Romantic Comedy ...)
