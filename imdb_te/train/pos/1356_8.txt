I started looking up about apprentice 4 years ago (probably 5) and I really liked it. The first thing that strikes you about is refreshing design, which is still quite entertaining compared to other core programs at its core. Donald Trump is a guest and is also a great judge of the show. Actors' revolt was also appreciated by contenders with good personality. But the best part of the show is New York City. Mark Burnett may have put too much rubbish in his time but his handling of cinematography is amazing as he makes himself a NYC look like a character. <br /> <br /> Apprentice can easily make my top flight reality shows (Amazing Race 1, no matter) at all times. But this exhibition, like an amazing race, is always a good one. If you watch for a while, the reality of the show wears fast (wearing the same TAR) .Star World, has done a bang - up job in providing broadcasts and presentation in this country. The first three seasons were shown in one row, and two years later, the next two seasons were shown, which kept the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> At the end, you love this show, especially in the first 2 seasons. But if you're looking at the show continuously, then it will turn off its charm and speed it up.
