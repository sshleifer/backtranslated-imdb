At that time, "my left foot" is a short film. It is very popular and appreciates the fact that it can be all the way to such small, independent film Oscars. <br /> <br /> Since then, movies such as "My Left Foot" are a dozen, so it's hard for me to understand all the confusion. It is obviously well made and the competition film, but its success is clear that Daniel Day-Lewis, who has immerses himself in the role of Christie Brown, the person who lives with the Cerebral Palsy, stood on the shoulders. David Lewis followed suit by dancing the same day as Dustin Hoffmann's stunt acting featuring Austin the year before to play a man with autism in Day-Lewis "Rain Man". <Br /> <br /> The only thing that is different from the big budget for Hollywood production is its budget. It is the formula for any standard product in every other manner. It's not a good movie, but it's not a great masterpiece. <br /> Grade: A-
