<br /> It ends with another ending, <br /> <br /> It is a sample image noir and style view. The photography and night settings are the first rate (cinematographer Joseph Lassell allows the scene to stand in the scene after the scene), and the scenes on full expressionism on the faces. I can see this kind of visuals only when the cast of the cast and the plot is lost. <br /> <br /> But the first rate of acting is here, and the plot is a crucial, alien, male lead of most Nair movies (many men who have returned to the United States after the war have been lost). In fact, Dana Andrews was really a troublesome, single detective, the youngest but significant talent in the film, the main female (first) husband, a former GI of the past and the wounded. The fact that one person kills someone is a monumental significance, the whole - a normal person struggling through his internal problems to achieve success, a soldier who accidentally dies with a silver plate on his head. Transitions from one woman to another - We feel that the children will have to marry as mentioned in the picture. This is actually a description of the later, we can see a man's path with a mental baggage care in a more moral order through a crisis - turning itself into a minor offense <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Andrews. Kirk Douglas plays a more restrictive and moving genre than in a similar role in William Wyler's Detective Story just a year later, and Andrews is definitely theatrical. To compare textbook and contrast you can easily see two movies for the session. A man named Andrews is morally battling Detective Dixon, and Detective McLeod Douglas, can explain why a man earns his girl and another. Jean Tirne is a very sympathetic, discouraging, ultimately conventional and woman's "beautiful" type - just a cardboard is not needed, but you want to get Dixon really married. <br /> <br /> Criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama, but the types and clocks are suitable for its games. The bit parts are complicated, the smallest details (such as the portable craps table) are nice touches, most character actors or gambling glamor in Casablanca. But Curtis's great film details are also iconic - it does not make the effort to be subtle and genuine and penetrating, but it's cut and memorable and exciting. They face the opposite ends of the war, and advocate oppositional possibilities for their prominent men. Bogart started his active task, Dickson, and the man Dixon was killed, by all means. <br /> <br /> Many of the movie noakers are not so dangerous for what they call "Happy" endings. The man overcomes his adversaries and changes his inner self, and after that and now angrily and understands how good it is to feel.
