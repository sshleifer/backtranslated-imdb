Unusual historical drama, with some amazing scenes. Tobey Muuerre is a fantastic performance, and some are good. The script is literate and beautifully original, and the film is kept without relentless heroes. It's going to drag a bit, and the last reel is a lot like a TV mini series. Still, Frederick Elmes cameras are of interest in the slippery bits (and reminds you once again that you've worked for David Lynch). Visibility.
