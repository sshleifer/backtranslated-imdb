Richard Thomas I have never seen a bad guy. I'm not sure I like him this way. And he's not sure he could pull it out. But this was a surprise to me. He planted my spine and molded me to make a closer look at street people. This film is enjoyable and fast. Bruce Davison is convincing but he's all really a nice guy he can play. The true talent here is Thomas. The end is a little clumsy but maybe that is the way to fight real people ... If you're a Thomas fan you must see him here as being evil being the best!
