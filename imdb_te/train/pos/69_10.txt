I finally got the cable channels flipping overnight and initially entered the film for about 10 minutes - every time I thought I was going to bed, it was going along my way <br /> <br /> The film was another easy slam dunk anti-gun movie Instead they chose to examine post-effects. Even better, the movie is in real life - if you think it's easy and clear to go out, a twist will change the whole perspective of the movie. This image does not follow the formula, shows how often events lead to and / or affect what happens. <br /> <br /> I only wish that filmmakers have explored the problems of anti-depressant drugs - the children have been shot from high-callingbin, and they threatened to see them every time DNA nightmares started. Until recently they did not distribute items like candy and only now they begin to understand any long-term effects of drugs too. It's a little too refreshing to see the story's mental illness aspect of the story is very little, I have a mental illness who has a mental illness and say I am dead nuts in every aspect of mental illness. Bravo made clear their homework for the director and writer. And for those who feel that some things may not happen in the hospital (I have told you any details), you also die in it - I'm there. <br /> <br /> Buy this film and show your teenage children before it's too late. For a while they'll be thankful for it.
