What is this musical style? Humor, talents, love, and action all rolled into one. <br /> <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is wonderful. No need to say anything. Although Marlon Brando was not a singer, he played the role of Sky Masterson, a great job of winning many hearts. The fact is that he can not sing for his role. The ladies are well in the film, but the men in the film certainly stole the program. <br /> At any age it is a true standard. It meets all the audience and you smile and laugh. <br /> We certainly enjoyed watching a movie.
