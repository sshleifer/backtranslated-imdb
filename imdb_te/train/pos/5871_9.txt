I cherish every frame of this beautiful picture. It's about ordinary people, all of us know people who have a little bit of their life and some baggage. Like all of us. Robert Denario, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker have breathed life in their films and all is amazing, but Harris is particularly heartbreaking and so very real. He is a trucker drinking so swear so he does not feel anything. Baker also has some sensitive moments of his son's sister - when Denino gave her flowers in a scene, and she never gave flowers and probably never. Very valuable.
