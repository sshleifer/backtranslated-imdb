It's a very entertaining film to follow Macbeth's NY product's rehearsal process. The film works best if it does not take too seriously, despite the power, jealousy and ambition of our modern world (the themes of Macbeth). Notable actors like John Glover, Gloria Rubens and David Lansbury make good jobs in the lead roles, but I'm happy to see the rehearsal of "murder" of Highlight Banquo (John Elsen). Perhaps the most entertaining film for the participants of the theater, but anyone who likes Shakespeare should enjoy the film.
