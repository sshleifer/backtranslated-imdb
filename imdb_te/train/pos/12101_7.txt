I saw this boy at the West End Theater in Louisville. Dr. Carmus finds the coffin of the gardener and finds a breath of breath in it, a terrible part of the film that only bites the film's gloom. I was amazed at the fact that people were hanging out of the trees, and Blackwood's family name was changed from Black Blood until a piece of the movie was discovered, because the character in the family history was known for many hangings of many people. Sir Thomas Blackwood has seen his kicks out adding deaths due to his family. When Foster first entered the cemetery, I noticed that he was careful to notice the sharpest item of the gate that met his end. I did not hesitate to recommend this film to horror film lovers.
