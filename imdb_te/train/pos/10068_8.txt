This film is amazing. The tragic truth is how to fight culture sex. It's a big warm fuzzy kind of image. If you are a tradition and kind deeper with heart in his own way, doggie is the girl who has won his feelings, you have the top with a beautiful monkey with a thousand facial expressions. It's equal to the big joy film at the end. It's good when showing up how deep the film is in a tradition, so they're ready to die without sharing their secrets. You will see on the side of a culture you have never seen before creating a new drama. Cinematic-photography is amazing, especially with the opening parades of sparrows. The Oscar controversy for the best foreign film.
