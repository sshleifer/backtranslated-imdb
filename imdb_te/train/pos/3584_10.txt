My name is Heather and I have made this story based on this film. I thanked everyone for watching this movie and enjoyed it. As some things are portrayed in this movie like raw and rough, it really does come really close to describe really bad things. I did not say everything about my mother and my younger sister. <br /> <br /> If you have never been, I believe that it has been a long time since the film was made. It's also hard to believe that people are still watching it a year ago. Any one of you or a similar situation has been denied, please be aware that there are people in the cyberspace that you can fully understand. Our thoughts and prayers are with each of you.
