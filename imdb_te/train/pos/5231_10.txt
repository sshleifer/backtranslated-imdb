To communicate the things that are necessary for the image of life - like life, does it mean? - Completely impossible. Possible answers to these questions are presented in each movie (story), but communication requires a direct request for consciousness. If input from sensories replaces "input" from our mind, this is our thoughts. Some directors know how to communicate the things they need. Tarkovsky, one of them. His "Stalker" shows pictures of the show, shows it and tells you life to escape your mind. I do de jee and de gresha do the same.
