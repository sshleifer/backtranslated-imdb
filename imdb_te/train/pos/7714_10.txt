There are a lot of 50 science fiction movies. They are big lines for disc-in theaters. Many of them came back. The film and 'The Day The Earth Stood Still Stand' stand, and both of them are very old in their own way. It has been astonished since its inception, with the score of musicians (which is still unrealistic sound since it's rarely used here). Star Trek said that the film enters as a pilot for the series of Star Trek TOS and contains many materials; Interactive captain / first colleague / doctor, mad scientist, alien beings, babe in short skirt, computer intelligence; It's all de rigier but it's the first of this kind. Moreover, it has a good acting and good artistic work, even today there is an awe in the images. The massive craze machine was successfully shot with some real depth. This was a kid (at a drive-in: 0) when I saw it as a new movie and I was scared. Of course every film that is also even obscure scary returns back but I remember the real upset about the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie that will see the science fiction fan many times and find a new one with every view.
