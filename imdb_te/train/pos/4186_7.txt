I saw this film yesterday and said the best horror film I've ever seen for $ 36,000. (Sorry steakler) If you are definitely a zombie fan, this film will surely meet you. This film reeks the spirit and the atmosphere. Some of these films are committed to films. Most creepy looking dirty webbed corpses are slowly reflexing their screaming victims. Brrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> The Canadian women, who have sexy voices, will be wary before Harrow buries the dead body of its dead body. This movie is entertaining from start to finish. I could not ask more than that. My only complaint is too small.
