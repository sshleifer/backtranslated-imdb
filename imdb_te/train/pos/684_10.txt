I grew up watching this series. When I was seven / eight years old. I still remember the first part called "The New House". It scared me h * ll! I still hear that statue, smile madly. And the end, oh my god! A refugee child comes in the room: Boo! It's classic TV and it's one of a kind series. I found the DVD collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually. My question to any readers: Has anyone bought this set? Its illegal. Two sellers have a very good copy. I've had the scratch and poor DVD of "The New House" episode, and have a bit better episodes yet, although it is very clear if someone knows it is useful for me to buy and share with me kids. A great series, intelligent, scary and brave supernatural. Thank you for any fans who have no less down on this - indeed, I'd like to discuss. Chris Walker
