This film is another horror edition. It's great, but it can use a little more. I compared the "Horror House of Doctor to Terror", though this title fits well. It combines all four stories with a house. The first story writer and his wife meet. He creates a murderer for his latest novel and then the killer sees his house encircling. This is a sort of predictable, but it does not throw a few turns at the end. The next story is a bit more unpredictable, and you really do not know where it's going to be heck. This is my favorite of a Peter Cushing and perhaps the bunch. This person buys a house, but it's not a home-taking center, but a strange wax museum. The third story starts rather good and has Christopher Lee. This man is also a devoted father who does not want to save his daughter. The problem is that you do not know what's going on in the story soon. This drags a bit that leads to a very predictable conclusion. The final story is related to an actor who buys a line from the odd small shop. The actor really gets what he has paid for. There is a short story about an officer who is trying to find out what happened to this actor and there is a description of why these things happen. Although I did not say very thoroughly, it really really illustrated the story of Cushins. I think it needs a bit more back story for that. Though it's an interesting set of stories.
