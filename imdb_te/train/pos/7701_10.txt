This is always one of my favorite films, and will always be. In the last few years I became 50/60's science fiction freak, trying to gather all the good things I have ever made. I loved a lot of things about how hard it was for them to be technically correct. Great colors and sets will move me a lot. It is a pity when they rebuild some of these good old movies; They almost always kept it up - see the recent recurrence of the day that just landed, which is completely worse! Prohibited Planet is one of the benchmark space movies of all time, and now they are trying to make it back and I think what's new! In my mind, some things like fantastic classic movies, to be left alone to be alone, classic examples of great efforts in telling simple stories and thrilling people in this process. After adding all the techno-crops they now have, the film appears to be more dog-meat from the Hollywood sausage factory - nothing special. By the way, I notice that the astronauts' uniforms in the Forbidden Planet are also used for "Outer Space Queen"! It just tells you that budgets are a bit less return, is not it? <br /> <br /> In a great role in this film from Leslie Nielsen, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgekin actors), Earl Holman, and of course Robbie Robot! <br /> <br /> Special effects are excellent, and the storyline is not too far. It's a great science fiction experience!
