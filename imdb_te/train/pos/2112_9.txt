In Budapest, Margaret Salavan (as Clara Novak) gets a job as a clerk at the gift shop; There, co-worker James Stewart (alfred crawl) with her kisses with her. Not everybody has a job because everyone has fallen in love with a pen pal. Ernest Lubitsch is instructive to direct these stars through inevitable is predictable. <br /> <br /> The sub-plot with Fran Morgan (Hugo Matthews), a shop owner suspected of having relationships with his wife, is also good. Hiring a private detective, Mr Morgan confirms that 22 years his wife has a sex with his little employees. <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** *********************************** Shop around Corner (1/12/40) Ernest Lubitz ~ James Stewart, Margaret Salavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schild Crat
