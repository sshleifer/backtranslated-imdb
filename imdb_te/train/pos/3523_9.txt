The director, a talented and talented combination secretary between Robert Seodac and Ella Rhines, is a secretive "phantom" woman as a secretary and attempts to preserve her owner in an electric chair by recognizing Franchot Tone as a crescent and murdered sculptor. There are also some fascinating small parts, such as the Elsa Cook Junior Drugged Trap drummer, as well as other characters that have parts of the plot. If you're used to seeing the rhines in more paws, she is allowed to go in to her scenes, especially in the cook. The franchtone tone also plays a very different person, and although it is not a reliable piece, he works exceptionally. Although the conspiracy is very contrived, the film has a real atmosphere and is very interesting.
