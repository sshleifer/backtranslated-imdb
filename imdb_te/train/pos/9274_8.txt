Another miraculous film in a country, which has suffered from decades of funding from the foundationist governments, has no problems with creating enthusiasm. Panini will take a different mix of contrasting humorous composition at this time and with a lovely, non-professional cast. While still looking at his message that he is inherently wrong to his country, he does so without heavy story. If the Iranian population needs a lot more, it will take advantage of a country and especially its people. The greatest pity it can not be released indigenously. Indria, Iran and the Iranian government claim that this good filmmaker can succeed abroad because he is part of a global conspiracy to disturb them. After seeing the growing and academics between the revolutions, artists and educated people in the last 25 years 'disappearance' show great courage to continue his work there. Realistic achievement by shooting at the original World Cup Qualifier really transports you to the event. The 35mm it shoots as he makes this project using the digital project is actually amazing. It is amazing. His perseverance in the use of non-professional actors also really works in the film. Good shows all rounds. Seeing many images showing Iran's problems, newspapers are scaring people as well as the government. This film is the opposite. It shows us that they still love the same things and laughing at them and that the shocking rules of Sharia law are probably too far away for a change for the better. Panahi is a feminist filmmaker but I think he is fighting for the most depraved population in Iran. Young, independent women.
