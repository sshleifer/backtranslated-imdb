Spaghetti has a lot of exciting and fun things to do in Western: the great music (one of which is just one - Nora Orlandi to work in the genre of Flea composer), Action Sequences (and the day's very vicious ones!), And beautiful scenery and sets Almeria of course, all in Spain). It's a nice story with a nice tragic romance edge. Laurence Dobkin and Rosalba Neryi (Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West"), actors make excellent jobs for a woman in Spain's Westerns. Without any spoiler posting, I let this film have one of the best finishes in any movie I've ever seen!
