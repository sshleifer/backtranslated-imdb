This is a very dramatic and thrilling movie. There are many plots and turns. The story or director opens question marks on death penalty or guilt crimes by blacks. The film is well directed by Arne Glamor and James Newton Howard's awesome sound is amazing. Sean Connery and Ed Harris' strong performance. "TRUE CRIMES" or "The Hurricane" does not miss if you like it. My wife gave me 8/10.
