I think the creator (s) of this movie concept is probably more appreciated than they ever received. This was not an Oscar caliber film of course, but at least I was back in 1984 (theater), because the film was lost forever. <br /> <br /> "The first thoughts on your lips are the first ideas to pop on your head ... We can not say anything or do not do anything, such as unconscious, intelligent or adults, we can not say or do anything, this is only the surface of the film - it does not go much to go. <br /> <br /> Hollywood can try today and cash The remake of the old "classic" is not good for them to remake the old film of modest success, but is it a bit more or a real crew to explore or not to explore 20 years ago? My opinion: o)
