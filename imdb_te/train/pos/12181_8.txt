"Shanghai from Lady" became one of Hollywood's most troublesome productions. Wells' original cut was removed by the producers and cut to ribbons. It made it even more difficult to track the mystery story that was already confusing. Due to the density of the Irish voice they have been posting a good amount of his speech, and dubbing is very clear and poorly. <br /> <br /> The most unfortunate of all, Wells and his real-life veteran Rita Hayworth are separate from their relationship and their chaos chemistry comes to the fore. <br /> Fortunately, excellent Orson Wells is directed. He makes the picture very beautiful and atmosphere - every scene is breath down your back from the screen. Also, the characters and sequences are bordered with dream and surrealism. This feeling increases the spectacle of the scenes appearing in these films, such as the courtroom scenes in the middle class. I normally saw court dramas as a bore, but the direction and agility of Wells would make them as pleasant to the rest. The end at Carnival reminds me of one of David Lynch. <br /> <br /> Acting here is very good. Despite their unsuccessful relationship, Wells and Hawthard both provide good performances - but their mutual criticism is little. Everett Sloane and Glen Anders, especially for everyone, is wonderful and delightful to see. The "Lady from Shanghai" clearly has her own problems, but it's only looking to see one of the film's masters in her best film. (8/10)
