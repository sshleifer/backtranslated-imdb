This film may be a silent film; It's definitely a sense of one. I was very lucky to see a very rare version of this film. Expand, a 'love symphony', and all language versions exceeded. The French is the ultimate romantic language, which is most appropriate for a very sensual and lyrical version. A young Handy Lamarr lights up the screen, which is almost like a sex fantasy; But definitely not too sexy. Tech features may be slightly tied up; But this picture will not be removed from magic spell. Many lovers worshiped the film early in the film.
