Hollywood North is a sarcastic form of Canadian movie history when the Canadian government gave huge tax breaks in Canada. For a long time it was considered the cheapest way to make tax dorm or American films. For example, Porky came out of it. Anyway, Matthew Modine wants to follow the adaptation of a beloved Canadian novelist who plays a new producer. However, to get the money he needs an American star name. He gets a loose cannon and learns to compromise when the film is no longer based on the originally based book. It played well in Canada but could not be understood outside of Great White North. Americans think we are sarcastic, but we lose that we hate them. 8/10 to Canadians 5/10 to the rest of the world.
