My school drama club will show this event in the spring of 2002, and I'll only hope that I'm so good! My character (Rosie Alvarez) recently for "Research" I saw this movie and Vanessa Williams is fine! <br /> Wow! Casting for this image is on the right-top (with an exception). Jason Alexander, Oh my gad, is anything he can not do? The most amazing Albert Pietersen as he ever was. I was "funny a happy face!" I love all of her funny facial expressions and dance at the moment. He is so great! Vanessa Williams, as I have said, is fine. She is a beautiful Rosie, and her conversion from Sedict to Secretary is entirely reliable. Jorge Vendat was quick to be Albert's vicious mother, and Mr. McAfee (finally in the 1963 issue of Paul Lyndy's performance!) Brigitte Dow killed me as a mercule of the urses; She really hammed it! And Marc Kudisch is an amazing Conrad Birdie ... "Safar!" <br /> You will see from previous comments, not understand. Chima Phillips as Kim McAfee - what is it? I am really beautiful and very talented, but ... she looks old to the role. <br /> <br /> Okay, however, I would highly recommend this film. <br /> You'll be smiling! <br /> <br />
