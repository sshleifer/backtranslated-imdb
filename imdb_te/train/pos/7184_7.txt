I absolutely love this show, but I first saw the second part. After seeing the first episode, I was able to see why people first stopped. The first episode is not the best of humor, and they struggle to start the series properly. However, I still like the light and funny attitude of the show. The characters become more developed and really enjoyable characters after the episode. As a first episode, it really does not indicate the rest of the show is really good. This episode is not bad by any means, but it's fine and good when the program progresses, so watch for more episodes before deciding on the quality of the show.
