This was my number one film in 1991, except that it was beaten by the amazing JFK. It's amazing! I liked it. I love stories of how to deal with the lives of different characters and how they deal with their lives. Kevin Klein is good here, but Danny Glover and most importantly, Steve Martin survived. I never saw Martin or his style, but here he is great. I liked the whole speech I gave to Klein at the end of Grand Canyon. The writing is fantastic. Larry Cassdon, IMO, a great dialogue writer, Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here, he has created a number of three dimensional characters and well-thought storylines, and a positive sense of message in our lives. Really amazing picture. 4 in 4 stars
