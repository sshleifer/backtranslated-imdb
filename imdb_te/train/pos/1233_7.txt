Eddie Murphy is a strange character to take on the height of her career. Although "Eddie Murphy's character" is very much, he is really a good man. The rest of the cast is good, especially the lovely Charlotte Lewis. The aesthetics and composure of her character kept the tone of the film from being too gifted.
