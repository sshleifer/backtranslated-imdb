The disappointing and rather amusing sleeper of two different brothers, known as "Fire Starters" (a snar-feroist in a book by Stephen King), but forever a woman is a nasty habit rather than a pyromaniac! The good special effects (in particular) are topped by actors' radiant trilogy trilogy, quirky performances and a truly interesting and whimsical soundtrack, finally "Wilder Naplum" to see a film's unique treat ... On the personal note, I was fortunate enough to hold it (to talk) from the two-dollar bin at my local video rental store. (*** out *****)
