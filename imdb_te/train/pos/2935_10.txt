Eddie Murphy Deliras is a ridiculous thing you see in your life so far. You can compare it with any image, and I guarantee that the guarantor is a funniest movie you never delivers! This movie is about 1 hour. 45 minutes, and at that point, there was just a moment where I did not laugh. Hours are smashed after you finish and punch lines will resume over and over your head. Eddie Murphy had a very funny performance in his career (48 Hrs, trading places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, Coming to America, The Nutty Professor, Shrek etc.), but it was his most glinous moment. I have seen this movie many times, and every time it's ridiculous. It does not lose its edge. From this day forward, every great stand-up performance will be emulated from Deliveries. ***** and two thumbs up!
