Although not a horror film in the traditional sense, this creepy little picture is sent to the objects. Vampires are loose in a small German town that is trapped by the victims of their blood. Police inspector Carl Brettsneider believed that a crazed killer believed that Melvine Douglas was one of his early roles, a vampire running ambulance. The only person who believes in him is Ruth Bertin (Faye Wray), an inspector and laboratory assistant to Dr. Otto von Neumann (Lionel Atvil), although a well-known scientist goes along with Vampire's doctrine. Urban people suspect Verdedo Hermann Glab, whose dude Frewy, which has fun with his character, has its general speed. The humorous humor that helps minimize some intensity in the intensity of all murders involving the film. A funny piece is Gusy Snelpenmann (Mad Eburne), Ruth Bertin's aunt, fond Hermann thinks he's been a bat or dog. Mad Eburne and Dwight Frey make a good comic team. <br /> <br> This budget film brings stuff from Dr. The Nimban "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari". Commands, from "Frankenstein", and "Dracula" murders by using human blood to create life in the laboratory believe that everyone except the inspector and his girl is a work of blood. Director Frank R. Strizzer, with a little comedy thrown up for good measure, combined well. The concision works. The revised version that I see increases the spooky atmosphere. So try to see this version if possible.
