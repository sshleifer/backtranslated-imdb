Zafar Panahi's comedy-drama "Offside" was a woman who tried to enter Teheran's sports field, where women were banned. Official cause: Many of the foul language, and soccer players are showing their legs. But in reality it's really sexism. When men try to ask questions about why women can be banned from the stadium, there is a lot of humorous relief in the film. <br /> <I understand, all of Jafar Panahi's movies (one of which) are banned in Iran. The real tragedy is that the CIA's 1953 Prime Minister's departure and Ayatollah Khomeini in the context of the brutal Shah give Qur'an his narrative commentary to establish a Qur'an version and present George W. Bush's current approach to Iran. <br /> <br /> For all, ways to challenge the system This is good for the people who are experiencing it. A great image, but worth looking at. I'm wondering how Zafar Panahi movies can be banned and how he can make them.
