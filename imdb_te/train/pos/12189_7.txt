Although Rita loved Herather, the film's last few sequences did not appear in the movie and the subtler's "symbolic" elements of the photograph were noticed, and the lady from Shanghai did not work much for me. I have encountered many problems with presentations, script and overall construction. And in most cases people are talking to one another and it's a problem. <br /> <br /> The lady from Shanghai ended up with a very low "c" or a 7. <br /> <br /> The lady from Shanghai is really about Orson Welles' character, Michael O'Hara. In Hara Central Park, Elsa "Rosalie" Bannister (Rita Heawat) is on a carriage ride and hits. Later, he saved her from a mugging and she took him a shine. A Hara is a Seaman from Ireland and Elsa her husband, Arthur (Everett Sloan), owns a boat with a very famous and powerful California defense attorney. They are talking to Hara to work for them, despite his initial reservations - looking for him and the audience to have a relationship with anyone, and O'Hara does not want to take part. <br /> <br /> A little strange to work on his ship, George Grissby (Glenn Anders), who claims to be Arthur's partner, is at the port of the call Ipistadu and stirred up trouble. Finally, Garry asks Harbi to Haura to enter a very unrealistic and dangerous scheme. Obviously, Harra agrees. Naturally, it gets him into trouble, and in the end, many secrets will be revealed. <br /> <br /> My problems with this film are not so true, Orson Welles is a huge fan of, and here, he produces, writes, and directs the screen time. I did not see much of Wells' work, but after a while I was a little more campy and show-artist, I liked his next movies as well. I love for Fake for Fuck (Vérités et mensonges, 1974), and I like his performance in Casino Royale (1967), he allowed bacarrely to do magic tricks at a baccarat table, but Citizen Kane 1941) 3 or 4 chances (a year Including my previous one, my rating is less than 7 - my current score for a lady from Shanghai). <br /> The performance of Wells and the dialogue he wrote for me has been influenced and revenge for me. He's a bit of a motorway, a bit of a bir, and a bit monotane - he sounds like he's reading. The Wells version of Moby Dick (listed in the IMDb as of 1999) but "completed" in 1971, can be seen in Orson Wells: The One Man Band (1995). He believed he had just read the camera and believed he was internally reliable, dramatic. <br /> I did not even complain about the tones, but some Welshs influenced me with his Irish voice and I liked it very much. <br /> For other shows, Hayworth did a fantastic job. Of course she is gorgeous, it does not hurt. There is plenty of eye candy here. Welles, Sloane also seemed a bit influential and pretentious to me - I was never too bothered about his character, his disabled and so on, and the Anders was not bizarre enough to seem bizarre. Wells is often hurt by him and Anders always has some exaggeration and manic expression on his face. <br /> <br /> Structurally, Lady from Shanghai is very uneven. The first 50 minutes or so thin and soap opera, although the soap opera ministries were active slopes. Once Grissby introduces his plan, things take a bit and in the end we will develop in the near future. But by the time the lady from Shanghai becomes a crime / mystery film, it's too late, and it turns out that it quickly gets out of nowhere and turns out to be too soon for its cousin turns into a courtroom drama. , Less-speech heavy, more varied and exotic settings, and sometimes, as a summary. Welles handles the material combination as a director. With a combination of Lady Crime / Mystery stuff from Shanghai and ending Art, it may have at least one. Final scenes are easily 10s since Wellis will change from a Hitchcockian suspense scene. The San Francisco Chinese Opera House is another suspense scene in the Chinese Amusement Park. Funhouse climax uses experimental cinematography for its time. It is fully integrated with the script when allowing complex resolution and references to fuels. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is interesting, and it is not possible for early problems. Wells displays skillful scenes. There are impressively filmed settings, from Central Park to Acapulco in various San Francisco areas. Wells creates signature backgrounds for his action effectively, for the streets of the Caribbean, such as emphasized heights and acupulco's sharp dots, as well as for the beautifully fabricated and silhouette shots of the San Francisco Aquarium and so on. Romantic material, which works as a backdrop for aquarium, is unpleasant across the cinema, but on the other hand, romance does not love. <br /> <br /> Exactly serious Wells fans will appreciate the lady from Shanghai more than I am, and of course it's worth a watch if you love Rita Hayworth. The lady from Shanghai is not exactly a terrible film, in my view, but not close to dangerous "passing". Proceed with caution.
