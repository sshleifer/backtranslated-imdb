This version of "Samhain" comes by looking at, and even though I still have it, it is not as nothing like the "tough cut" version. If you check the message board, you will see a cut-down version of this cut-down version, 79 minutes, and he said nothing with this R-Rated trimmed down with this completely new screw is up. The Christian really does not need to be distant from him, because the primary gore elements are still standing, though still persistent. It is a disgrace for being one of the best and best gore films these years. It can still be seen at least partially romantic stars, and inbrids, and some serious gore. I'm happy with "tough cut", because for me, it's an ornament for any gorehound library. Christian Well certainly has the expertise and attention to deliver things, and hopefully his next project will be a good product. Idiots have a nearest classic in their hands, and scraped it for everyone. <br /> <br /> "Sohin" is one of the most controversial and outrageous horror films, the director could not see what he intended. <br /> <br /> *********** ********************************* ***** Just so what you missed, this is based on my review of "work print". <br /> <br /> The movie runs less than 90 minutes. There is absolutely NO music soundtrack, and some scenes do not have audio on the dialog because I think they will be looped later. However, most of the film affects the sound, and if the effect or the scenario does not appear, a message appears to be a queue for insertion when the image is completed. It's exactly as "ruff cut", but you can see the uncut version of "Samhain". The reason is, because the gore is too graphic, even more than NC-17 allows. Yes there are some romantic stars, but they're there for killing, and add a little sugar and seasoning. The story is pretty standard, American tourists end up staying in a home in vacation in Ireland and Woods. The ancient Druids and Samhain festivities or folk tales are a huge area of ​​folk tales. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a huge metal hose, because the camping couple will attack one of the local world's mutants. She's a big mountain scene, while the guy hangs from her son, she's crying for help. When his head, hands, and shoulders hang in front of him and when he pulls her up, she is completely cut into two pieces. This is what I call the highest gore, the organs, blood, and organs severed all over the place. We're folks here in the Heredale Gordon Lewis landscape, and the effects are quite realistic. <br /> <br /> As some of your first stooges, I'm going to skip the story. <br /> The next gore scene, (TCM-2 stuff), and a table bond. This geek then cuts off his organs (a camera, a queue to insert a scene), and then we believe that we're slowly flipping on a barbecue pit, watching his torso). <br /> <br /> Later, Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and all, is cut from the neck to the punch, and all of her Embroides retire with graphic pleasure, and she becomes a blood factor. <br /> <br /> But the best wound scene takes place at home, and I have to confess it is one of the best visual scenes I've ever seen. This guy (who does not matter) catch from behind a geek, and open the cut at the donkey hole. Geek then puts his hands and all the guys conspire, the intestines, and hell no-one, he riffs right from his ass. This was never lost because the guy was thrown out and the more intelligent souls stopped all of the bathroom floor. It was very bad, so upwards, I found all the smiles of hell all. <br /> Of course, you can not really see the actual DVD, IMO, and other really serious gore scenes ever in this DVD sequence. <br /> Think about all these things. Well, first, I suspect that the film will be released at any time in this cutting scene, which makes rare jewelry for "rough cut" garhounds. Yes, with the first soundtrack, it's a little bit harder with some scenes inserted and credits without first names. But this particular thing is that I can not trade it for the moment. Extreme gore, yes yes, extreme gore. This makes "Hot Tension" a Disney movie.
