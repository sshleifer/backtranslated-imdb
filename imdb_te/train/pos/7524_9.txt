For an image that is clearly visible about sex and leather, it is not a privilege to be unusually sweet. The story Bimey Page, from South to a good Christian girl, did not allow her date until her marriage, she moved to New York and became a successful pin-up at her age, from the spectacular show Gretchen Mole. She can not imagine the effects of her illness having images of her in the world with images of her (which does not allow anyone, it is fun and dignified) with her pedophiles. <br /> <br /> The page is inspiring for every dying artist because she does not have a single person to die, but in each of the film she is the only one who has invested in an innocent sense of sexually and casual fun. Actually like this film, indeed. Filmed in both black and white and excellent technicolor, it's a lovely way to spend two hours.
