This soft and sandy film is constantly offered. It is one of Frankenhair's best and most highly rated films, and it's up to date Elmer Leonard's adaptation (and if you scratch your head idea "but I'll punch it face"). In my opinion, no one has captured a good "feel" for Leonard's characters and John Glover in 52 picks-up. The restoration of Hollywood (film) story from Detroit (novel) is a tremendous heap of the tale of the story. Have a man, some beers and look at this picture. My favorite Leonard books for reference purposes: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Privell, and 52 Pickup. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for Deadbang and Black Sunday.
