What other critics do not know about the development of the character, I call it less. The film does not have one over the head with overxplanation or unnecessary hero. Yes, we have only one brief story, but it's one day snapshot in a program that primarily changes the lives of characters in the catalyst. A truly fascinating study of the power of acting focused on response to Henry Thomas's acting actions. Good rental.
