I enjoyed this fact to receive the personality of Dick Tracy. Image Film is a good job of using modern technology to create a story story. If you're a fan or have recently seen some of the old dick tracy B & W movies, you're sure to get a kick from this edition. Pastel colors and life have been entertained in an era that has spent more than ever in the past, which is fun. Madonna's music element is a major part of the film - I have heard the music for the music from this movie, which I've heard over the years, which has worked well, musically and tuned to the era. In my mind, Madonna's finest moment is on screen but especially musically. This is sure to bring you out "kid".
