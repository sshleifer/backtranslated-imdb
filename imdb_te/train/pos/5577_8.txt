I spent a lot of time with this film. The worst temple outside Hollywood pulls me up a wall! This one is clearly fresh and witty. If you see population statistics for ratings, only a few women have voted! I do not want to destroy the movie for you but I'm sure every person I see is rated to their computers and poorly scored, why? The film puts men in their place, and that's why. Most women vote on the value of its original humor for the film and not because it hits men ... this can easily be the "7" rated movie!
