The film is the first of torrent and the last for Greta Garbo. In her first American film MGM in the US, she worked in America. <br /> <br /> Torrent is based on the famous Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibanez's work entrepreneur Naranzos. It is related to unfriended lovers, garbo and cartage, many of whom do not, mostly due to the machinations of the cartoon's mother Martha Mattox. <br /> <br /> Mantox is a naughty woman who has some set of ideas for her son to marry. Remember that this is Spain and such weddings are still quite right at those times. Mattox Gertrude Wolstead is a daughter in mind, Mac Swine's offspring, a hog guy. <br /> <br /> Blasco Ibanez had earlier novels, The Apocalypse and Blood and In the previous novels. Rhodolph is portrayed in the lead role with Valentino. This might be interesting if it was made with Valentino Garbo, but when it was completed he could have crossed the film structure. <br /> <br /> One of Valentino Vanabas is filled with a male tail by Riccardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> Valentino may not want this film, because this is not the two works of Gorbo. Matex and her 'adviser' banker Tuli Marshall tell her that after she dirty by Curtez, she goes to Spain and goes to France, where she becomes a great opera. <br /> When she returns to Spain, the Matox is more angry when she attempts to rebuild things. She has a political career for her son. Cortez is now running for the Spanish Parliament, which is called interesting enough cortes. <br /> <br /> The title flood and a dam breaking indicate that this leads to all kinds of degradation in rural areas. Carthage hurts Torrent in a boat that actually attempts to save Garo. When they came together they had a frank frank discussion, the cruelty of the Garo. The shots used in the 2039 Century Fox's The Rains Came are very similar, which came in 1939 and received an Oscar for Special Effects. <br /> If you come across courtesy and garbage you will have to watch the movie. <br /> I'm not going to give any conclusions. At the end. Garo earned the Raw reviews for her performance and quietly in her role, when quietly committed by exaggerated gestures in acting. <br /> <br /> She is a great face for closets, the rest of her career. <br /> <br /> While doing better than the Granta Garbo Torrent, the American is very well for the big screen and today's audience.
