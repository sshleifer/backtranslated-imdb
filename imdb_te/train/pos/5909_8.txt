When I was five years old, my parents remembered that this was a normal cartoon movie, except when the brus and bullets flashed. I would agree that this film will make someone up and everyone upset because everyone and someone set discrimination .... but the truth is as funny as hell as it is. I would recommend this to anyone who likes cult classic. Try Fritz the Cat and Fritz the Cat's Nine Lives. The film is very good if I do Ralph Bashki correctly. It includes a cat that goes through difficult times in family, streets, jobs, etc. I rented these pictures whenever I was old. Conskin became known as the street fighter, because it was a dangerous title in the era. Ralph Bashki also created the Cool World starring Brad Pitt at a very young age. Heavy traffic is another cartoon conducted in the street life of a young man.
