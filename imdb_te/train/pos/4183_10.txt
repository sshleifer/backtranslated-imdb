<br /> <br /> The film has seen a long time ago, but it is awesome and it does not stop me amazing today. <br /> <br /> These commandos were captured in plain-clothes and they are considered by Japanese relatives as spies. <br /> I did not see anything in the Hollywood WW2 film that I had not seen. <br /> A close and friendly bond between the captives and the captives is formed. They begin to respect each other, but the captive Australian soldier's captain became the best man of senior Japanese jail guards. <br /> <br /> One day, two friends are aware that Acee's captain has tried some other captives. In the port of Singapore, the zap was operated to sink the ships. <br /> <br /> When his Japanese friend sinks the ships, he calls his team and the Japanese guard to keep him silent as he leads the whole group. <br /> <br /> The Japanese authorities put them to death in the most honorable manner in accordance with their rules. This is the highest honor given to the warriors captured in Japan. <br /> <br /> Do you believe why his Aussie friend is guilty of accepting the death of the Assisi soldiers waiting for their death and friendly Japanese shepherds? <br /> I'm not going to end here. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not have internationally recognized qualifications, it is very small. Get a copy today and mesmerize.
