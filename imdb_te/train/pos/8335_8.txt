Sparkling chemistry between Ryan and Robbins is an additional plus, including a supporting cast (including Mathieu, Fry, Shaloub, Darning and Jacobi, Saks and Maher's hilarious trilogy). Mitawa is Einstein, Fry as Ryan's clinical fianc√©e is perfect and Shalib's line of Einstein's Gonads is one of the headlines in the film. Robbins gave his first public appearance a speech of sacred poetry. Wisdom is for the writers to perform this foam with wit and agility. I also thought that Keane was as amazing as Curtis Eisenhower. It may be considered something of a chic movie, but I think everyone should leave it out. Eight is very solid points.
