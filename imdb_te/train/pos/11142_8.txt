<br /> <br /> Joe Buck is the youngest cowboy (almost like a wild gump) from Joan Voit Texas, seeking green pastures in New York City. Big Apple does not take long for him to swallow him and his targets totally and aim at both the cooler of New Yorkers and Cons from his street-thugs very quickly Joe. With his pure heart, he takes care of these thugs, Rarto Rizzzo (Dustin Hoffman) and moves with him in his apartment apartment and both are struggling to live literally. <br /> <br /> Midnight comedy is named as a drama, which is described as a tragic comedy or funny tragedy in my opinion. It is a beautifully beautiful picture of the late 1960s with contemporary hippie-wib with its mandatory dizzying warhol-party cinematography and relaxing ultra-urban New York City. The film crows Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in the middle, thereby emphasizing the position in his position. <br /> <br /> Midnight cowboy has brought the tears brought to my eyes, which is also substance and is very heart projects. I want this film to have a forest gump with its sacred and outstretched and somewhat similar comedy Crocodile Dandy films, cowboys and slick New York cosmopolitan. <br /> <br /> <br /> I am a highly compelling and sensational creative film I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
