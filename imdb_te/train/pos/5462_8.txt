First, if you're looking at this, make sure to see the UNCUT version (it's interesting to see the scenes damaged due to censorship, but it makes a big difference). The film was about a young woman played by Barbara Stanwick, who had to adultery her father since she was 14. When her father suddenly goes, she can go to herself in the world. After reading about the philosophies of Nietzsche in her life, she will give her her to give her sex and she will be disappointed in the ruins and her love. The audience was surprised that the film became her materialistic and hobbyist, and she had a sense of morality left by her. Overall, the blatant shots of Baby Face Sexuality are very shocking, and many will not be seen in the black and white film. <br /> <br /> I am very enjoying this film and I believe that many modern audiences will enjoy at least some fun. Especially with the shock value of the images. Looking at the progression, I saw that the move was a bit slow, but I would watch for the first time about most of the movies. Actually, I think that almost all of the films I've made since the early 30s have some minor pacing problems or just the most "flow" right in some parts. It's probably crafted to filmmaking, and not quite comprehensible? It will take a few more years. <br /> <br /> Compare with the image of the 30s from the 1939 film, and I think you will see my point. <br /> Once again I could see the original cut. It really makes a big difference. Also, no John Wayne fans will be surprised to star in the film as an extraordinary character.
