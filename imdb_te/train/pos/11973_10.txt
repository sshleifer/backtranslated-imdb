The Full House is a wonderful sitcom that is about a father, Danny Tanner, whose wife died just in car crash. So Danny asks best friend Joey Gladstone to help her brother Jessie Katsopolis and his three girls, Dona Jo 'DJ' Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michel Tanner. This is my favorite show ever, and I can see it all day. And in the full house something always made me laugh and there are also sad parts. There is always a disappointing moment in the house. The main characters include Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stromos (Jesse Katzopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jody Swimtin (Stephanie Tanner) and Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen Michel Tanner.
