This is one of the most awaited films of Dev Anand, who gave great and unique images to the Hindi film industries like Gove Thief and Guide. The story is shorter (if you ask any story), the plot is simple - a brother wants his beloved sister. Harry was smoked from smoke and noise from Harry Krishna's Harry Krishna. Nevertheless, some of the important events that the film experienced in the 1970s. Hippie culture, drugs, freedom, fleeing, family, and the east (which is new to whites). They are perfectly organized. Zeenat gave her the best of her best and Dave as usual. The songs are best used in the film (not for abuse of songs). They were not spoiled. A good example is 'Deco O davano ... Ram ka Na Badam on Karo'. Each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The ending is tragic but it's not the essence of the movie. Devvy, who believes in building different films, has succeeded in showing what he wanted to do here. A must see to experience the beautiful Nepalese hippie culture and the 70s.
