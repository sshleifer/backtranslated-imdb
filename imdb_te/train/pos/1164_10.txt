When I first saw this film, I saw it. It was officially selected for the Tescula Valley International Film Festival and I voted it the best film. <br /> <br /> Justin Priestley is mentally unhappy, but complicated Amanda. This is not your normal mental image. There are many interesting and original slons on the genre. The order of a "fatal attraction" for the young set of some great blues music, including Amanda's affection, is married to the up-and-coming blues singer who has less time for her husband in her career. <br />
