Last night I saw the film in Turner Classic Movies and flew with Victor McLoglen's performance: in every sense of the word "Tour de Force". The atmosphere of 1922 Dublin was really inspired by the techniques used in the Nairs and the filmmaking of the best film of 40 and 50s. During the awakening of Frankie Macpillip's (Wallace Ford), all the prayers of mourning are Gaelic. Max Steiner's score is unforgettable. As in later films such as GWTW in 1939, he borrowed the folk heroes the local color and sense of space and time. John Ford: A movie giant already in 1935!
