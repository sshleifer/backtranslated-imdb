<br /> <br /> In total, Red Eye is better than anticipated thriller. It starts slowly, and builds slowly. But after the end of time, it is a thumper! <br /> <br /> This is a thriller about what I think about this thriller. Except, just keep, the director did a fine job of pulling you into any action of a run-of-the-mill plot otherwise. I can not forget watching a movie. <br /> <br /> I think other reasons, "intimacy" to the victim and the evil person ... and over time, you are really concerned with the victim. A small 8 out of 10, more like a 7.5 ... but it looks great!
