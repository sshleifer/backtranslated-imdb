I saw this last night on TV (HBO). I have to admit that the tension in the film is so great that it is very much through other FN era films. I loved the way the chip was a moment of all the calm and then damaged the very next moment. It's classic. Yes yes. Dams, villains, cigars and false cops! It has everything. The film has distributed all the things for me. I love this composition of Composition Composition, the film is very common for this age. Blacklisting popularized in those days is very daring. I would rate this movie as the best I have seen in the FN style!
