This is my favorite of old Tom & Jerry cartoons since the early 40s. The Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2 sets off, the disc one, and the spectacular detailed animations of early cartoons. Deception on this is not all madcap Avery style, but it's aimed at anyone looking more scary and ever scary movies (or radio programs)! Tom listens to a creepy radio program, and Jerry decides to play many tricks to confuse him. Nine people's fun are here, and I'm a vacuum and I do not know how many times I tried to do a horror sheet when I was a child. When Tom's owner is awakened by ruckus- mommy is not a maid, it's her house- she gets a heck of a surprise, with a big smile. Your break button is ready, it's worth it!
