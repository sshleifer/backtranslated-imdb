I loved this show from the first broadcast, and I always watched every episode every week to watch. Storyline, characters, writing, special effects are good! The Science Fiction Channel then forgot and canceled a very entertaining, well-written show. I'll get it back, I know all the actors come back. I suggested buying a DVD, I did. I hope that the executives of science fiction channels get the words of this comment and feel that they have to participate more with their audience. I can now see a presentation on that channel (Ghost Hunters), but I'm sure they will soon be canceled.
