In the 90s I saw this film a few times and every time I laugh at my side. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand is a different thing. He's very funny. Also P.C. The brigade finds this hilarious. It should be one you've got boys or girls for a drink, and even be good. It looks like Michael Jackson's take-off, and if you close your eyes, I believe it will sing. The things that he describes is that life is truth and you have to badly bypass humor if you thought this is not funny. My local video stores do not store this video anymore, but I'd like to give my hands to show when my age and age are enough to recognize my humor. Anyway, highly recommended, hope you enjoy it.
