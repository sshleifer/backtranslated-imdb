In the near future, Arnold was cast as Ben Richards, a man who was found guilty of misinformation, 'The Running Man', a deadly TV game show force, where people were killed by brutal 'stalkers'. <br /> I did not read Stephen King's book, but it was a great film, Arnold's best. He does what is best in the action man role, delivering death with a leaner unforgettable. Classic is probably the 'real pain in the neck' barbe wire after a man strangled, and 'he had to break up!', He just suggests that the chain sawed someone vertically. Dawson is perfectly upset as TV presenter, and all the 'Stalkers' aptly camp. This action is violent but its action movie. That's something. The film is fast, and its welcome is not over 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> In the lead, under the leadership of Starkey and Hatch's Paul Michael Glaser, and the Terminator success, the film probably looked like another mindless action vehicle for Arnold and was too far away. But today, most people who watch TV will see how close the movie is to reality. <br /> <br /> In that daunting direction, I should not be surprised that I recommend 'The Running Man', for anyone who likes 80s, Arnold, comedy or violence or a good action movie. 9. 5/10
