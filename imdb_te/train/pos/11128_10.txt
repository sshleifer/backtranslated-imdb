How greatly I was at first. It's incredible and sometimes surprising. And at least 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely make a boring image stand, but this is anything but boring. It is like a journey through humanity. This amazing reality is displayed by this souvenir work. It is a story that moves the two down and the overseas (oat and hoffhman) heart that increases a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (Voit) is a rude Texan stud makes rich in New York by entertainment ladies. Soon he meets Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who can not pay a poor man rent. Retso becomes Joe's 'manager', but soon the two can not find a job in stealing men. They try on the streets of New York and find out how hard we are in surviving. They can not get a girl until they meet a woman at a party. Zoe earns some money and soon takes Rathore in a night-time dream spot, Florida. The final five minutes have broken the heart and heart of the film. From afternoon we get a full-scale and sometimes disturbing urban scene in life.
