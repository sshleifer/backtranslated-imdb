Director Sam Fuller specifically holds something in a culture in Europe. However, most of his paintings are unforgettable. However, he made a really awesome film on "South Street, Pickup". <br /> <br /> From the first frame to the last frame, "pickup" works at all levels. It was filmed with flawless fitness, all rounds were fine performances. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter are the best record players of top notch performances, at their summit. With the main intentions, the villager VidMark, the villain, makes his character so appealing, as well as the role of Jean Peters makes him all credible. <br /> <p> Fuller has no punches in this true pure image. There is a scene where Jean Peters VidMark is a rowdy. It's really awesome in its reality. It is not a carefully choreographed photography case. <br /> <br /> A little self-consciousness than the many filmmakers in this film is a great example of the genre.
