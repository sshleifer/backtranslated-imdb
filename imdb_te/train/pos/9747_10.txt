When I first came out in 1982, I remember it. About 4 years later, I was reminded of that movie ending at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York (I saw Louis Pavarotti singing). What do you like about this movie? The music is good and Pavarotti (Finny) is his best and still great. The story parts are very funny & 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest I've ever seen. The hot air balloon flight on Napa Valley was beautiful and sang the song "If We're in Love" (sometimes pavaratti sang in English). And listened to the duet of Santa Lucia. Get true folks, a movie about an opera singer Giorgio Finni who is going to be pavarotti. <br /> <br /> I'm still glad I'm wearing the VHS tape of this film, but I'm going to release it on this DVD especially because I have a nice presentation of Neeson Doorma that I still sang today.
