It's great from Hull Roach. <br /> <br /> For two main reasons: young children are always in the movie and the story has a very funny and well written work. <br /> <br /> Litlest Little Rascals, I do not think I am a pretty boy than Spanky at four age honestly. Despite being a chubby and unattractive boy in the later years, he was just worth it. <br /> <br /> Young children are not just funny to punish young children, but it is once again a beautiful factor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Older children can break loose all kinds of this miserable baby funny turbulence. The gags are pretty efficient and well done for the time - spanky with an accident and an accidental crank call involving a last scene is finally the most memorable being the little ones regulated. I have not seen these shorts in decades and I'm glad I gave this a chance.
