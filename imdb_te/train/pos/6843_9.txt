Author-director Brian De Palma is best known for his string of films, known as "Hitchcock Simulations". Contrary to popular belief, De Palma does not hit Hitchcock; He is seen in the film of Hitchcock and owes much to the story or character elements that are spreading in a more violent, modern way. <br /> <br /> Like Hitchcock, De Palma is famous for the death of blood-soaked death. <br /> <br /> "Killed to Dress" in 1980, probably, is D'Palma's most well-known Hitchcakian film, and it is probably his best. The story features a cross-dressing serial killer, a glowing-out housewife (starring Anji Dickinson) and street-wise hooker (starring Nancy Alan). <br /> <br /> Yes, "Psycho," but De Palma's film is simply technically ingenious and dark creative. The museum sequence is particularly well-scored and modified; Elevator Stab Scene is one of the most exclusive baked murders placed on the film. The "Killed Wear" may not be the original, but it's definitely worth your time. Rated 105 minutes. 9 out of 10
