<br /> <br /> The film does not need to take their clothes to see their movie. The film brings the memories of classic movies of the old movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film's main plus point is Shahid and Amrita, a fantastic chemistry. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have seen the comments of sweet and excessive discouraging of the film. In response, I think this is an accurate analysis, but I think it is significantly reduced when compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH. <br /> <br /> In this film, when sentimental moments arrive, you laugh and hope that the breeze is the best and nothing is bad. <br /> <br /> Shahid and Amrita are another major plus point for performance. Both have worked well, especially in Shahid's film. <br /> <br /> Amita is a very spectacular sight and should be considered seriously as a future lead actor. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the whole picture, I think it's too long. Wiping out some of the middle class, and it was more effective. I also think of music, but when you see the film fit, the scenes are a bit too old and the movie's advantage is that if the most up-to-date soundtrack is available. <br /> <br /> In all, I would definitely recommend this film, its romantic, exciting and dramatic banner (I will not) <br /> <br /> Are you crying a tissue?
