I kind of consider Hide Frontier's # 1 fan, as I've really seen most of these guys in the middle of a small group of fans - well, of course, of course. I've been looking for Hidden Frontier since 2001, and I'm impressed with what these little girls have attracted. Hidden Frontier Rob Caves and his self-made studio, Aracot Pictures, runs from the back of his home. Some of the actors / writers from the TOS-based Series New Voyages (sometimes like Walter Koenig, Ester Chekhov), rob and cast and crew and crew from the crew and staff of the FF and "Fancy" manage to create a valuable row in place of the worst experiment that we call "enterprise" . The most controversial and successful story was the first publicly gay character of Ark Star Trek Corey Astor (introduced in the second season) and his exploration to find his soul search. Somewhere in the next series, he meets the exorcisers trail helm officer Zorian Jen. In recent story lines with these two characters (Caution: Do not read if you do not see the series for this stage!), Jane joined the excluded coexistence, much change and some of his conflicts with Aster. Although the future is uncertain - the recent episode, as seen on the "Beach Head", was shown to HF fans last night in the chat room - I think this relationship can tolerate, but time is limited. <br /> <br /> Gene Rodden Berry has created a Star Trek, the story is designed with more intention than its characters, not elegant space wars. Rob caves created the Hidden Frontier for the same reason - and thus the series became popular. As mentioned in the previous commentary, I gave a rating of more than 10, but it will be enough. The Season Season Seasons, which opened the next season's Star Trek, put the last in the tradition: Next Generation - we are ready to wager that we can hear a lot about the Hidden Frontier after the last part.
