Ernest Lubitz's collaboration with American cinema is enormous. His legacy is an outstanding group of permanently living images, like "the store around the corner". <br /> <br /> The film is rebuilt into other lesser-specific films and musical plays without the glamor or elegance of Mr. Lubits own and the perfect version. <br /> <br /> Margaret Salmon and James Stewart co-starred in several films. The film is an example of how a film can be played without appearing in the role of their characters in the film. Two stars were as pleasantly as pen pals, but worked together in the same shop in Budapest. <br /> <br /> These classic films work well because of the excellent supporting film in the studio film. Here, we have excellent Frank Morgan, play shop owner. Also, we have seen Joseph Schilde Kraut, Felix Braceert, William Tracy and Charles Smith, yes, we believe they are in Budapest. <br /> <br /> These films are permanent!
