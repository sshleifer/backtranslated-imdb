Yes, the plot is predictable; Yes, there are some plot holes; Yes, it's made for TV quality; <br /> <br /> Britney Spears wrote a "clear book with self-promotion". <br /> <br /> Forget all of this ... this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> As a mother, Virginia Madsen makes a great job ... so I'm starting to look at her movies. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast reminds me of Diane Lane. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is also a good job. If I'm a casting agent, I will scout some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are higher than normal TV standards and music is great ... much bigger than many big-budget films <br /> If you're in a mood for German noir this picture is not for you . If you want a safe, pleasant and undervalued movie, this is good. It shows you to your 10-year-old daughter but it's enjoyable for you.
