This dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action movie, which is not going to win any awards and its not original but offers you the items you want to see from a dolph lundgren movie. Our man is a former soldier who has taken over the day by a mentor and former militants at a tough interior city high school now Dalbuff. Definitely the script is not going to win any Oscars, its good fun and its affordable sharing is eplosive action. The dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive in action scenes, and the rest is not the best actors cast but they have better. All in captivity is an enjoyable action movie, but youv'e have seen a million times before.
