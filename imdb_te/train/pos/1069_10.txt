I bought a couple of season 1 episodes in Channel 5 and bought Dark Angel Seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago. Nothing was ready for me to see how good the show was. I'm not really enjoying it from Firefly (a wonderful performance too). I admit Season 2 is very good, but there are still some amazing episodes (Bag M, Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation etc.) and Alec is good. I heard some of the plans for Season 3 desirable, and I have to say, I can not believe I was canceled - I will not spoil it for you - but it will be rocked! I also think there is a lot of potential like a movie (at the moment it is quite possible). As for our toughness, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in two weeks I have it, I've had 3 episodes for two seasons without seeing two seasons. It's very good.
