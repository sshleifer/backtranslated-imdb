The film is the first British teen film to actually deal with the reality of violent rock and roll society rather than the great humor of the 1950s. In an attempt to celebrate Liverpool's junior liaison officers, the initial scheme, 92% probable offenders operated under the scheme, did not commit a second offense. Nevertheless, the following is the pretext for teens-drama, but we are told that we are not responsible or condoned until the cinematography, but they can be mixed-up. <br /> <br /> Stanley Bakker plays the role of a tough detective who is reluctant to take on Juvenile Link Officer. This is a characteristic character of the hard-boiled character Baker. Does not taste the present shift and transfer of the transition on the trial of an infamous romanticist called firefly. However, in all good police plays, he was driven to the full circle by his full inquiry, going back to his original investigation. <br /> <br /> His first case was made by two young children Marie and Patrick Murphy (real-life brother and sister duo), a small theft. Here he meets Kathy (who is filmed by Anne Haywood), their older sister, and he is ultimately romantic. <br /> <br /> An elder brother of the Murphy family, Johnny, is a gang of rock and roll. hoodlums. McLollum turns the eye-catching turn of America's mixed-up kid, who owes much to Melanie Brando's favorites than the previous British actor. <br /> <br /> The film 'Johnny' is directed by his gang, as well as the character of Brando's character from 'The Wild One', led by a gang of rebellious bikers. Dearden's crime plays like 'The Blue Lamp' are not so obvious. Instead, we took on the romantic interest between the drama of crime and the well-drawn characters on both sides and Haywood and Baker. <br /> <br /> This plot, will deliver some memorable scenes. The scene of the rocky and rock music scene was shown in the scene, where Johnny left the music, a terrible step towards a police officer. Despite being the most persistent memorable part of the film, terrified school children, including Mary and Patrick, was the scenario of an atmospheric class room held by Johnny Gun. In fact, this scene in real life Dumbaline Massacre is all the horror. Hence the film is rarely broadcast or available to modern audiences.
