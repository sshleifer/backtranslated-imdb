Here's the episode of Friends, we are Freak Monica Geller (Courtney Cox), newly divorced Ross Geller (David Skimmer), Hippie Fiobe Buffy (Lisa Kudrow), Unknown Actor and Ladies Man (Matt Le Blanc and most sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), until we were introduced to the 6th and final friend, Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) <br /> <br /> Many episodes like the new episode, such as the new sitcom, are not always great, it is not great to play in this episode because the cast is unrecognizable and in their new characters (they are shining from Kudrow and Perry). <br /> <br /> Matt Le Blank-Man, his performance is very difficult, because until then, he gets more confident, but   ను ఫన్నీగా ప్రయత్నిస్తాడు కాని చాలా వరకు విఫలమౌతాడు. <br /> <br /> డేవిడ్ స్కిమ్మెర్- ఎందుకు అతను అన్ని పదం పలుకుతారు పైగా చేస్తుంది? అతను సాధారణంగా మాట్లాడలేదు! కానీ అతను హాస్యాస్పదమైనది ఒకటి మారింది తరువాత సీజన్లలో పాత్రలు, కానీ అతను నమ్మకం లేదు. Jennifer Aniston was hot and I did a good job as Rachel Green, but in the first season after the first Rachel, Courtney Cox - this episode is very anorexic, worrying, looking different now (more healthy), she A little sketch of acting but everyone is this 20 minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I'm doing both together because their comic timing and acting quality are fantastic and one of her first roles for Lisa and her very natural is Phoebe (Peabs) and Matthew Perry Matthew Perry. This episode will improve the quality and sizes, in this episode they appear dark and creepy and they seem negative, acting, the characters can give every new scene and this pilot I am proud of! I hope we will see friends again! They will always be for us!
