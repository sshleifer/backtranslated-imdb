The design of the film is alpha and omega (U.S.) of some of the major elements in the country. We look at everything in the university setting for the film. Positive, student v. There is a teacher. But the film adds its value to its other relations: male v.s. Females, white v.s. Black, and personal v.s. Society. But the direct relationship with all other relationships and all other relationships is personal v.s. Himself. <br /> <br /> I am surprised to see how the director of the campus shows a bipartisan view of the campus. Most movies generally show unfairness on one side while showing other films. The film has shown injustice and suffering on both sides. Even though I say that the skin heads showed a lot of brutality and vengeance (which is quite clear in the end), I did not even try to show it to be right. The film also discusses sex and rape. It is unfair that, for a time, brings two species together in two ways. Lawrence Fishburn is a sympathetic professor who makes over the top performance as Pips. He loses the idea of ​​race Fouriotism and instead shows down-treading with the parallelism of laziness and hard and positive. Omar Eps, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Connelly are other stars that make up the film. Michael Rapaport has given a stunning picture of confused teenagers, which is a bad angry looking for acceptance. Tyra Banks will make her film debut and prove that Supermodels can work. <br /> <br /> Higher learning is the name of the college, rather than getting the pieces of paper and receiving paper pieces. In fact, I would say that the film is almost satirical to show mutual interaction with each other, rather than some non-dry books, rather than real school education in a university. This is a life-learning process, not a lesson. I think you have "Higher Learning" a lot of universities and generally life-critical issues. 8/10
