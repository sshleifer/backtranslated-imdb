I first discovered the fantasy of Alexander Korda (1940), in the early 1950s "The Wonder Show of the Century!" Baghdad's Thorp Korda Technicolor films, The Thief of Bagged and Jungle Book, both show a memorable show in the so-called re-issue. Micklos Rosso's music expanded into two pictures. Every Technicolor is very beautiful! Baghdad's Thief is on my list, the best fantasy film ever made. As the years passed, it was more difficult to enjoy the color of the film as originally submitted. True technicolor led the Eastman color scheme in the mid 1950s. Both Kino and Samuel Goldwyn re-released the movie in theaters and video. But Eastman color prints muted the nature of the pastel and original technicolor in nature. The laser disc release of this title also has a pastel appearance - good, but it should not be. Now comes the M-G-M DVD (3 Dec 2002) edition. Baghdad's Thief again looks fantastic technicolor on a DVD, it's not surprising! After watching the DVD again, I saw the second time. Only "Extras" is a Spanish WV version, subtitles in both English & Spanish, and a beautifully made original theater trailer. Thanks to M-G-M for this EXCEPTIONAL DVD release. Now, one of the four fans of a caddy and Korda's Jung Book renewal version (the replacement of poor public domain prints in distribution) can hopefully be followed on DVD.
