Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan) is a successful man. Or "lethal fascist". He is also in the midst of drinking, women, and middle life crisis. In a job in Mexico City, he goes into Danny White (Greg Kinnear), an unsuspecting businessman who feels he's just hanging a recent pitch, but is not sure. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> What sounds like set-up for a number-comedy comedy thriller? But it is not. Instead, The Matador is studying funny and sometimes touching character. The above mentioned summary eliminates each twist pointing to it, sometimes making them happier. <br /> <br /> It is an image that honors the appropriate characters to add to them without feeling the need to lead it to the necessary conspiracy strategies. <br /> <br /> Brosnan's hitman is comparable to his band, but it's unfair for two shows. Bond is a semi-design, product of all that has gone before; Julian is a fully-formed character with his own motivations and flaws. <br /> When he meets Danny in the hotel bar, he sees his opposition: a normal person with a simple job and general problems. He hates Danny; Hitman bore his life, he keeps his inevitable "burn out", he always sees the edge close to him. But when Danny's about his only son's death, Julian tries to change this with a dirty joke. He was in his own words, "running from emotion". Kennyar plays opposite Brassonne's performance and sends Danny White to his alarmed charm. He is the perfect foil for Julian; The subsequent anesthetic dirt and hedonism, danny bend to the ground, with an indication of a tremendous hint. <br /> <br /> He also goes far deeper than his founder, showing us the distance to everybody when experiencing both financial and family loss. <br /> There is a real chemistry between Brosnan and Kinnear. It looks better in three important scenes of the film: the hotel bar; With a bull, Julian tells Danny what he is and takes him by dressing the murder; And the scene of Julian turned Danny's home after six months. This scene introduces us to Danny's wife, Bean (Yes, Bean). Instead of panic in the presence of a rented killer in his home, Bean (Hope Davis) is another example of Madador honoring his roles, forcefully calmly asks, "Will you bring your gun?" The script is not quite as good as it may have been after another runtime. One or two lines seem a little forceful, and jokes need a little more work. But in Julian and Danny (later Bean) speaking, the writing is fantastic. This film is not required for any characters in any extreme situations (except for the hitman, and the hit-man going to his home). This allows them to talk nudging gently towards the platform points they need. <br /> There is action, but it reflects on the characters. An important example is that he puts himself through his rifles scope when Julien is a job in Bodupest. The rest of the movie characters, how they influence, how they affect everything. In the end, it is very friendly and friendly. At one point Julian tells Danny that he is his only friend. He really understood.
