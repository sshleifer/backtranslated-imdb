Probably the best Isabel Alende's book, The House of Spirits explains the alternative Chile's history, magic, mystery mask, plus some sort of sadness. With the script that does not have this movie quality, the film will collect great cast and great art direction. This is unusual for a country like Chile, because it is so little understood that it is less so, that the sin is so great, and therefore a little disappointing people who are illiterate.
