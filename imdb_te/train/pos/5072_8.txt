Pierce Brosnan is perhaps the only known thing in Richard Attenborough's new biopic. The history of Canadian history and First Nations is new: <br /> <br /> "Gray Owl" is a politically correct way to learn how to adopt a man in Ozibe in northern Ontario, learning ecosystem, and for decades. The film is a love story, a moral message and a man who has been tortured by his past. <br /> <br /> It is a film that has a viewless audience. It deeply respects Canada's first countries and provides them with dignity and irrationality. Brosnan's performance was somewhat tough, but I suspect Lord Atenborough wanted him. <br /> <br /> Thank you from the proud Canadian.
