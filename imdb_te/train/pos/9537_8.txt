Some may think that some ratings are a bit apathetic, but the film is that the directors are available to them, and this is a movie that has a purchased flavor! <br /> <br /> My immediate idea is the direct connection to the classic cult film 'The Thing', meaning paracistic aliens from the outdoors, which will end up as much as possible to the human host! <br /> <br /> You can see how this film is respected for the film and the horror / gore style, but wisely manages its own originality, these things continue to fight each other and then eat the fallen opponent! Killing and choosing just a human if a new host is needed! Then pick another fight with another infected host! <br /> <br /> The film also throws in a love story, but I can not tell you anymore. <br /> Great! Do not be surprised if you do not like this movie as I mentioned about the taste I bought. It's a low-budget and yes it is a thirsty weapon, namely, blood thirst with creatures / aliens / objects to turn their movements into moves, blades and odd pistols. <br /> <br /> "Maybe a little bit of love thrown in somewhere, I should recommend this film a must see. I wish you all this before!
