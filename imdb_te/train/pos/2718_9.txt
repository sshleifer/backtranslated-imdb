Last year we worked for two movies in a book about Truman Capote. The book was created by Capote and Infamous. <br /> <br /> In 1967, I can not imagine such images. Terrible play; <br /> <br /> The mastery of the film classics by Richard Brooks (Elmer Crane, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Professional, Blackboard Jungle) <br /> <br /> Robert Blake In this film, he faced many problems related to the role of a killer in the film. <br /> <br /> This is a picture with you after watching it.
