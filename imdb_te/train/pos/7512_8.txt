First of all, I heard and disappointed the great things between lovers and lovers of love in the retro / vintage scene and Betty Page about the film. Attached to the key scenes in a very close black and white color, the film will give a documentary feel to the career of early life and the batery page. <br /> I do not know about the page. First, gang rape was done, and later, her early attempts and glamor images began to develop into the acting career, initially she had not been able to access the camera club, and later, Klaus, Paula and Irving would come as a very pleasant and friendly people, even if they took slavery and fetish photos. If only pornophobic producers are the same, perhaps pornography is a consequence! For the most part, this film is not against pornography. But the attempt to show atmosphere in the 1950s for those producing fetish and nude images. This atmosphere is very oppressive, perhaps in a good way, because when it comes to pornography, we have no "saturated" effect today. It seems to be less tough. The page enjoys her work and it comes across anyone who does not seem to degrade it. <br /> <br /> The page has always been an actress and has been replaced by 'Jesus Christ' and has been used as an actress by a whip with a whip of the most striking "experimental style" girls in her photographs, The pinup became desert when she was in the thirties. When her faith in God and Jesus never goes away, the committed and cut off emphasized that she was still given 'gift' by God to make 'this thing'. When I watch this film, I'm astonished about Page and her humility, beliefs and behavior. Compared to the idiot-klot blondes we have today, she's one of a kind of 'life after romance'.
