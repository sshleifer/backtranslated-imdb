It was a bit bizarre and bad and I enjoyed it very much, the characters in the show were also great, and another was better appreciated. I forgot to cut it off ... I liked to see where it went. You have found that you have a tendency toward Lukas Buck the Sheriff, which has more secrets than yours. Lucas was frightening and impressed. I played a lot of role and how he changed his character. But I enjoy it at that event, it's different on TV. And Paige Tourcoo, who is the cousin of Calib, is a big secret for her and her whereabouts to Lucas. It's a shame still not around .. or never done, I would have loved to see what happened.
