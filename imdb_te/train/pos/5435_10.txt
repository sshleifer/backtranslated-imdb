I saw this movie in $ 1940. 11 And I want to preserve a DVD in 2006, the film is a great entertainer of all time and is still a fun awesome (B & W and all) actors and true relative friendship between Sam Jaffe and Eduardo Sinelli's performances Unusual (can not happen today because of Kipling on Colonel Dusty's Ganga Dean's body The poem was read to the end, "antaranidi" "I mancivadini than Ganga Din" Today, the images of the film has not been made. Today, the only one still alive, cast Joan Fontaine
