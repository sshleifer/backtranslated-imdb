As I said in my opinion about the first episode: These two films are far better than the science fiction fans. <br /> <br /> When the Battlestar Pegasus appeared, the story will again return to the battle of Planet Planets. Okay, there's quite a bit of Mad Max because they're fueling their space ships to find the distant land until they fight, but it works for me. Thrilling science fiction featuring good actors and good special effects (though they themselves repeat themselves :-)). <br /> <br /> I would like to continue with Starbuck and Apollo on board. <br /> <br /> Instead, the second sequel came with the unnamed characters that did not prove to be the predecessor of the story as the character chooses the best of the characters ... <br /> <br /> The thumbs for productions in the 1980s have been thin for two films since 1978.
