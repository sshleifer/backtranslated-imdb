I thought it was one of these films I've seen in a long time. It's a great storyline and people have shown that it's very complicated in different ways. I recommend this to my friends !! I always enjoy a good story line and this movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time. I have a daughter and can see Natalie doing the same things to learn more about her life and love. This has shown how we can live with our families; But we also have parts of our lives that we do not share with them - they may not have the best interest to know all the details that we do not have. <br /> I'm looking forward to another such film, and I keep my eye.
