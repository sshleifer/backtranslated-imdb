David Lynch is usually made of images that make mistakes, such as puzzles. They are interesting to look at and think about but they really do not gel in your mind. <br /> <br /> Straight Story is not a special David Lynch movie. However there is nothing special about them. This is an odyssey through rural America. A real-life journey Alvin Strait took a lawn mower to go to his brothers' home. He went from 300 miles to Lawrence, Iowa to Mt. <br /> <br /> The heart of the film is sweet Richard Farnsworth. He brings us to Alvin Straits Right to us in a simple and honest way. <br /> <br /> This slowly happened slowly when Alvin's slow journey was slow. <br /> <br /> Alvin meets chaos and frightened teenage girl. She was pregnant and decided to run away from her condition. <br /> <br /> After Alvin, the tragic woman killed her deer with her car. She complained that she had killed many people. Aavin feels bad but he was wise enough to cook some beloved meat that night. <br /> <br /> Alvin's lawn mower then loses its brakes and kills him almost. While a good man and his wife were in his yard, he correctly accepted it. They called him a sweet but slow daughter and played well with Sushi Spicek, who had previously hunted her with a terrible tragedy. Alvin has to pay for a call. The man Alvin leads his brothers with joy. <br /> <br /> Alvin is disappointed with hope. <br /> When discussing the hardness of Alvin's war and the price taken on their souls, he goes to a bar with a gracious old man. <br /> <br /> Alvin also meets two frustrating brothers who have repaired his pasture mower. He explains that he has known the prices for their high labor and repairs costs. <br /> The night before Awan, the man leaves his home. The man reveals him and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> This journey will continue and we can not help it to get more involved. We want to see Alvin go to his brothers. We want to make changes to him. <br /> This is Richard Farmsworth's best. It was his last film and his performance was amazing. You can not help him understand his fame, hear his knowledge, and eventually experience his pain. <br /> If there is justice in the afterlife, then Alvin Straits, his brother, and Richard Forthsworth will sit in a bar. I talk about their lives, regrets, hopes, and joys. As Alvin says in the film, "My brother and I used to see the stars." Well, I know they are all with the best view in the house.
