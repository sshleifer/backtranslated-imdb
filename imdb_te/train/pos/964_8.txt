"Yoki Dyscinso" is the children's film of Takashi Miyikay, but as you may have imagined, it is probably the most difficult and scary to the young. <br /> <br /> The story belongs to a young boy, who moved to his mother into the country and after his grandfather and divorce to live. At a village ceremony the boy was chosen as a "Kirin Rider", a great honor, but with great respect and adventure. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, nasty things in a woman's white skirt, go-go boots and beehive hair-do, teams, people's anger, and discarded things. This nasty city looks like a city flying in the form of a monster that leads Rage City in Tokyo. One very funny scenery is the two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city ... one, "Oh, it's only Gamera". "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />" And the crew has taken Yokai movies in many ways in the 70s and has been transformed into a modern action adventure film for children (mixed) with some weird mechanical monsters that are considered "transformers." The look and feel of the film is good, the effects are fun, And some people <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Japanese monsters, there is not much to like here for adults. <br /> <br /> Cool & fun stuff, But perhaps it was Mickey .. and a jungle ride 10 to 8.
