When I saw the film in the 1950s, I wanted to be a scientist too. There is something magical and useful in science. I took a girl friend to see a second time. I do not think I'm as impressed with her! While synthetic fibers are new, the film is more romantic and more intense. Lessons from this film may apply to the subjects of today's GM experiment.
