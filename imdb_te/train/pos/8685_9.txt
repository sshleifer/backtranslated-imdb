It was the first ever filmed Columbian movie episode, but it was aired on the second after Steven Spielberg's "Colombo: Murder by the Book". <br /> <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kowals is a great creative director! They then wanted to direct three films in Colombo. The film has real creative and innovative shot sequences, and the whole picture is clearly made of style, passion and eye details. Each shot meets and the film is good and it is good to see any other average made for TV movie. <br /> <br /> This is a quat original columb entry because of the slightest reasons. The murder is more or less dangerous and is a sudden act. So the killer will have to clean out any traces at any time and afterward to dispose of the body to plan a 'perfect killing' earlier. In this film, the murderer is a criminal and is involved in helping Lieutenant colombo to solve the murder. It makes the character more interesting and layered as well and helps make Colombo the way to solves the whole offense as well as the way it looks more interesting. Course Colombo starts to suspect him pretty early and always comes to the solution by himself he is hurt and of course he's more stupid than reality and by getting the killer's trust. This is clearly not a spoiler way for each columbo image set-up. <br /> <br /> It also helps the cast of the film. Peter Faulk made the Colombo character truly his own at the time of the film and this character was already fully developed. Robert Kulp is the best-looking Brinmer. The funny thing is that he later appeared in three different columbo movies and a "Mrs. Colombo" episode, in completely different roles. He also acted in a couple of those murders. He is not the only actor who made this to the Colombo movies after the route and later. Rich Ray Maaland played the victim's husband. <br /> <br /> All the best movies from the true great Colombo film and the longest movies are <br /> <br /> <br />
