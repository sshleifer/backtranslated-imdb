From time to time my favorite police series turns into a TV-movie. Does it work? Yes. Gee runs for the mayor and gets shot. Homeside turns into "Hall of Fame". Pembleton and almost all cops that have played in this series. Past music most of the TV series does not help you, but it also makes the fans happy. The last five minutes will solve another murder, and in the end even two dead cops will change. And a small performance from Juliana Cox for my favorite earthenware. This is a good movie.
