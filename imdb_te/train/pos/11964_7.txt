I think this scooter will hit the scoop by the scoop. Happily, this film exceeds at least a few expectations. The original Allen is not as good as any of the artworks - it's nothing big and nothing - but it's also full of light and fun comedy. There is something simple and sweet about it. "Beautiful" is the word I hear from the audience as they are walking out after the show. If he thinks that Allen has set up a masterpiece here, he feels that he wants to do some comedy and make fun. Compared to all of Hollywood's build-ups, Allen's content has charm. Even the mushy stuff. Nowadays it's just refreshing to go to a movie made by a genuine human being.
