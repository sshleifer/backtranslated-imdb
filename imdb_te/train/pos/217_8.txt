The Sunshine Boys on the screen had a very painful break in the 1960s about Neil Simon's play featuring Water Mangau and George Burns and asked for a television rendition or something like that. . The problem is that the two still hate each other and do not want to do it with each other. Richard Benjamin, nephew of Matthew, is seen as a theater agent, giving the reunion a memorial to be a reality. This warm and winning comedy is entertaining for entertaining entertainment ... It is mainly a variety of song songs and one of Neil Simon's best works of Methav, Barnes, and Benjamin. Burns won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for the film, but I'm walking with Mattuev as his Willy Clark, playing this flawlessly hilarious movie. Matthew was nominated for Best Actor, but Nicholson did not get a chance; However, another year, it's an Oscar-worthy show. Matthau commands the screen and does not have a false note in this beautifully finished display. The scene classic that he does not receive the name and product of the audition for a potato chip trade. SUNSHINE BOYS won a warm and Neil Simon comedy, thanks to an unmatched chemistry between Matthew and Barnes.
