I prohibited this movie about every film. People of Japan (?) Who has acted, or we are just friends. <br /> The scoop here: <br /> The three thugs tortured the hell out of a helpless woman, they eventually used all kinds of things to kill her, burning her, leaving her in a chair!), they use sound violence She's forced to hear a fixed sound over 20 hours! It's not that bad noise at all, but you can go nuts). She knocked down, they throw her blows (perhaps from an animal), and she wonders when she wakes up. <br /> If you do not hear about these movies, if you do not know that it sounds like a parody image, you might want to. There! (Just asking Charlie Sheen) to ensure that people get used to and get sick! I said pure ground. If you're a fan of underground horror or foreign sheep, check it out. If you do not, I would recommend reading the series before watching! Gour, shock, and creativity are 10 from the aspect, but from the storyline and all the items it is 1. An underground classic ... <br /> My final rating is 8/10 <<br /> <br />
