This gem, the 1936 Invisible Ray, does not often enjoy. But it can not be forgotten. The story is elegant. Carloff, the uninterrupted and discouraged Janos RÃ¼ck in his Carpathian mountain retreat, has read the ancient jets of light to learn the events of the great terrestrial past, especially destroying a powerful radioactive asteroid in Africa. When combining him - elegant lugosi (rare hero), "astro-chemistry" studied. Frances Drake is a lovely, deep young wife; Frank Lawton romantic temptation; <br /> <br /> This story moves in bold episodes and moves with special effects. It has some amazing lines. A mother again sets her mother's attention, "Amma, can you see, can you see?" He asked. "Yes, I see it more clearly than ever and I'm afraid of myself." Furthermore, when Mother Rouk says, "he broke science's first law." <br /> <br /> The first principle of this science is what I have been alone in my acquaintances for many years. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially desert island equipment.
