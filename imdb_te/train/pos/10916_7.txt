The comic ban between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the theme of the murder mystery, which is one of the most strange and unlikely plots. Pavel is perhaps the most glamorous detective in 30 years, and Arthur has a distinct voice, which is often inherited by small tinkly bells. They are so fun to see, so enjoy the brushness of the plot with salt grain and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> There was also a provision that allowed Pavel's contract with MGM to give up another studio, but he wanted to work again with Arthur, and he accepted the script, so he eagerly handed it over. They worked with the 1929 Paramount films, The Canary Murder Case and The Green Murder Case, both in the Philo Vance series.
