Yes, I remember this! For many years since I've really seen it. The story is completely surreal, but anyway! Rated movies and reviews is what any related image objective that anyone must bear in mind. This is one of the first "kid" followed by a similar model. Some movies - like this here - just aim at plain and funny nonsense. Such films are not rated from the hypertrical critique perspective. These films do not have the quality, the sophisticated storyline, the most often not the first-class acting, but when they finish their initial campus - that's OK. I do not have this movie on the list of all time fans, but I still felt funny, having a very happy scenario and a good story. Brian Bonsal is an actor anyway.
