Bob Clumpett's "An Atch In Time", one of the most merry melodies of the American movie directors in the Second World War, establishes a hawahfly on the dog of Elmer Fudd. The little guy turns into a real sadist when doing a home behind the dog, but Elmer dog warns: "One more scwatch and I'll give you a bath!" Meanwhile, Flea is set to be the best of the dog! * It will not end! In one scene, I saw Elmer Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig reading the comic book. Naturally, Elmer and Bugs often co-starred, but did not star in alongside Elmer Porky (if you do not calculate a lot of "What Bands Today?"). But for me, as Elmer reads about these other prominent characters, he has emphasized the metaphysical nature of his world, even though he did not appear in this cartoon, even though he was aware of his existence with his theme. <Br /> <br /> However, I'm probably going too far in my analysis. I'm sure the cartoon is considered pure entertainment, and it definitely stimulates. "I like this way" for the line, although there is somehow that the sensors are not allowed, it's missing something; I do not know what it's supposed to sound like, for one. Is not it a sexual matter? <br /> Finally, I thought I saw everything, look more than what the cat did. The guys behind these cartoons are definitely a thing for TNT, who they can not?
