This game is a bomb and this year 007 game and should be great hits. When I got underwater under fire, I thought it was a good game, but then came around Nightfire and that's fine, but now there's a new kind of James Bond game. This time it is the 3rd person shooter and more than 12 missions, the game's graphics are in the home. Like Pierce Branson, James Bond, William Daphou as villain Nikolai Diaovo and Judi Dench also have great actors and actresses in this game (I'm sorry when I'm wrong). This game is a great James Bond game around. <br /> I'll give this 10/10
