The "telefilms" underneath the lower budget's weaknesses and undergo a rapid shooting schedule, which makes the film more relaxing. <br /> <br /> Scott Ebenezer is full of Scoragogue, fully surrounded by his cool trends, and still makes him a simple character. The production value of the film is very unusual, Bopo did not rely on special effects or soundstage set-ups, and based on on-site shooting and depth and clarity of strong backdrops. A film that is absolutely alone.
