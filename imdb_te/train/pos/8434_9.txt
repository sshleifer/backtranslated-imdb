I'm always a fan of the show, so I'm biased. When the presentation was completed, I thought that there were no answers to many questions. I like this movie closure. Finally, I have been very rewarding to see all those people who have been in the past few years. This is probably the only homicide film we've ever imagined. If so, this is the right way to go out. The film is sometimes sharp, sometimes disappointing, but always satisfying. If you are or are always a fan of the show, watch this movie.
