WHITE FIRE recommends two separate DVD releases and proprietary person in VHS. He is one of the funniest and coolest low budget acts ever made. <br /> <br /> I usually do not see movies and they're going to be bad, but I've done an exception for this ... I'm very happy. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a great way to get to the edge (it's very surprising, graphical ghory), sleaze (in a key role is nakedness, but it turns out to be very happy in a scene) and worse, The extraordinary looking star of The Existentator (and countless other low-budget action thrills) is entertaining in the lead role. Williamson is better than usual, apparently humming it with unparalleled pleasure (he does not come until midway). The rest of the cast is also fun, especially villains, one of whom is a cheerful sexpot who speaks of a mesh-mash of Spanish and Italian. She is priceless. <br /> Fun, I can not hold on to Gary. It's not boring, but it's unusually violent in part with some meat pedals to shoot, and it has a ruthless torture order that no one will soon forget. Moreover, when the bad guys are being beaten by a pack, he has a chain of comfort and the brightest moves that follow and all the action fans are encouraging and dazzling their beers. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the white fire. It's a rollicking - if mind-numbingly stupid - action classic.
