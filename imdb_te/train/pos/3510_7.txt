<br /> <br /> I would like to call this movie a disagreement with the trolls that give rating to an actor. While I did not have the background, when the main characters came from the environment, I spent many years in low-income and working-class neighbors and acting was very realistic and I felt like a representative of how to behave. I do not know what the film is like for other people's comments, the film is "dubious". The dialog is great. <br /> <br /> The cost of low-budget production has not hurt me a lot. I thought I would improve the role of natural lighting cinema. <br /> <br /> I completely bought into the motives and responses of the character. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​good cinema is Transformers or Fast & Furious, skip it. <br /> <br /> (Negative commentators about "trolls": Click on their names and you will see only other reviews or negative reviews.)
