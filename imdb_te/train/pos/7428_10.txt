I saw this film for the first time, shouting my eyes! Although the stars John Norman (Chris Christopherson) and Esther (Streisand) face you, you know what love really matters to you. You will feel like losing such love at the end of the film. Straussand and Christopherson have such great chemistry and the music is amazing! If you see another time when you're playing Straussand / Now look closely, it's just pure magic! This film made one of my favorite song Evergreen, and Queen Bee is such a fun song. I also loved the look of the 70s (except Streisand Afro Exemption, she is an aesthetic). My first one is a favorite movie born of a star. This is a joy to see the film and a heartbreaker at the end.
