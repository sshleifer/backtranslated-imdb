I thought I was going for half an hour when I saw a night of digital subscriber channels a few years ago and saw "Girlfight" I was looking for to start "Heart of War". <br /> <br /> "With a title that I figured I was some exploitative 'B' flic about the inner city girl gangs. <br /> <br /> My surprise is not much about that, and accordingly, A good acting and well-written story about a young girl, who is responsible for carrying her younger sibling sessions and she is interested in watching her fall. <br /> <br /> She is convincing her coach to earn her place in her coach when she is not really a boxer (but only by their father's wishes). The story is clever and believable as she went through various trials on her quest. Coach did not want to take the female boxer, and after she was jealous she had a problem fixing the matches  . అప్పుడు ఏమి జరుగుతుందో తెలుసుకున్నప్పుడు తన తండ్రితో గొడవ జరుగుతుంది. అవును, ఒక ప్రేమ ఆసక్తి అభివృద్ధి చెందుతుంది కానీ ఇది ప్లాట్లు విస్తరించేందుకు పనిచేస్తుంది, దాని స్వంత పోరాట సంబంధిత పరిణామాలతో ఒక ఆసక్తికరమైన అంతర్-మానవ ప్రతిచర్య అంతటా వస్తున్నది. <br /> <br /> All of these seem to have been heard by some of the great little sleeper films. Shortly after I saw a very promotional and acclaimed "million dollar baby" I thought, "Wait a minute, this kind of familiar". Needless to say, I did not see the "Battle of Heart" that night.
