Teenagers, heroes, fantastic story about high school football "stars". How far will you go to protect your friends? Kill, kill How long will you lose if you study an innocent girl? Can beat love inequality? Can you beat the narrow small towns? If your friend scores and you "lose", you'll do everything in your power to make payment for her, or you will be a man about it, and the choice is her right respect? Have you raped her and hit the "problem" girl? Would you be the only one who is guilty of having his own opinion, to make her own decisions, to choose her? It made me think twice before giving my judgment about who was right and wrong, but definitely one - the most disturbing image and the theme in general. Thumb up!
