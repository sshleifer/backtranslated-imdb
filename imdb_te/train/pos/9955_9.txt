Two times in the community shows, this movie really looked like this. I work in the Jane Finch community and the film has really taken over your interview with community depression, decision, development, the essence of creativity and taste. Writing, dialogue and acting is great and she is not really drawn into a teenage Raya story because she struggles to achieve her goal and does not lose her in this process. Apart from the great dance sequences and the things that are smooth and electric shovel, the camera moves with great money and intelligence. All the characters are multi-dimensional - none good or bad and women's characters are amazingly strong. The film is a strong beating heart and the youth, Hip Hop and Jane Finch celebrate the irrepressible soul.
