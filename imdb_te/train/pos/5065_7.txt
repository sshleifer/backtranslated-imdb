The good stories for the fact that all are in good image and did not make the film may be hidden in the masses. Brasnan makes a good job with a hidden past as a Native American and photography is amazing. Some people, it's very strange and boring to others - it's perfect for me a sensitive, well-told story and family view. Now you will not be so hard at the moment.
