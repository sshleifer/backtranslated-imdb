Many war films made in America during World War II were very happy, but there were serious gaps in realism because they were more productive for promotional value to raise souls at home. Most of these movies are not viewable. However, because they are often not realistic, they are really barred from great images. The John Garfield film Air Force is a perfect example - in which B-17 is almost half of the Japanese Air Force! However, a welcome departure from the Marines Pride - score high marks for playing a true story role in a true precise manner. I first saw this movie, I thought it was not true, it seemed impossible. However, after more research I found the fact that the two men who made a lot to earn medal of Honor are actually in the fantastic story. It is a case in which true life seemed incredible to be true!
