Attractive Marjorie (Farah Fawt) feared by a single biker. She is killed by the fact that she knows her address to her attack. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the assailant leaves his Marjorie home, and causes her intimidating intensity. The wounded and bloody Marjorie holds the upper hand in her assault, thereby leaving out of the digestive tract, and her eyes and throat willingly thank the wasp's spray. Hogg was associated with him, damaged, and when Joe came to her home, Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarvid and Alfred Wurd) try to explain herself. Approval of grace is almost the same, but it does not come from Marjorie. Will she continue her own penalty? Violence, sexual harassment and rigorous language make for an R rating. Fawcett never gets away from the ditsy characters forever stain his career. Kudos to director Robert M. Young.
