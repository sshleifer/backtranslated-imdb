Red Eye starts in Texas where the hotel receptionist Lisa Risert (Rachel McAdams) reunites her last 'red eye' to Miami. Lisa meets the beautiful & beautiful Jackson Ripponer (Sillian Murphy) when she waits for the plane & they both seem to hit it, then they find the plane board a coincidentally they sit next to each other. Jackson finds that he is indeed in the air jackson and that they are indeed in the air jackson, that he is indeed a random meeting, and Jackson needs to change his chambers at his homeland security secretary Charles Kiefe (Jack Skylia) & her Miami-operated hotel. <br /> <br /> In the horror films such as The Last House on the Left, Wes Craven is best known in 1972, A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), The Serpent and the Rainbow (1989), The People Under the Stairs (1991) & The Scream Trilogy of Teen Slasers A Short, Punchy, Fast-paced Red Thrill Eye from Covent A big departure is usually done. The script, written by Carl Ellesworth, I thought I would have to admit to a surprise, it's just 85 minutes short of less than 85 minutes long, moving quickly and economically saturated with satellite satellites. Some people did not do it but I did it, but I think it's taking you further action, slowing down the film, slowing down and giving you a chance to relax. I really liked the plot for the Red Eye, certainly this film would definitely have one or two questionable moments in terms of plot but hell, it's an image made for me and what it does. I really liked the two central characters, Lisa was very fond of watching Jackson Ripper (a vivid play on the Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper) a cool 'a worst thin villain' I'm my job 'kind of mentality. Another plus point is that I do not think anyone has been overly stupid, everyone looks like human beings & movies in a relatively acceptable manner. <br /> <br /> Coron is a good attractive cast, with a tight, taught & fast-paced thriller with an attractive cast, good acting and capture plot. Once he starts the action & tension begins & the film Miami & Lisa's fathers switches once the house has become a little simpler but it's still good. A special mention goes to Rachel McAdams who is absolutely gorgeous in this, because she probably could not see the red eye again because of the & drop dead looks amazing. For those who see Wes Craven's name to a red eye expecting a horror film, it should be reminiscent of any horror (though the IMDb list is 'Horror' in the style of Red Eye). I'm not sure at all, the villain is fine for a change that goes against traditional expectation, but Lisa may be more satisfied to kill him in some way. <br /> <br /> DreamWeek clearly gave the first budget of $ 44,000,000 to Red Eye, but it was reduced to $ 25,000,000, although it was packed with a much better picture. Originally shot in Los Angeles & Florida in California. The film was expected to be directed by husband and wife Sean Penn and Robin Wright Penn, but eventually the producers chose younger leaders. As I already mentioned Rachel McAdams himself as the Eye Candy, she's all over the film. Oh, & she also keeps in a good show. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is a really fast paced teaching tension filled with a little thriller I enjoyed so much, I'm glad I want to see it. This is definitely a recommendation for me & Rachel McAdams really has hot stuff in this ...
