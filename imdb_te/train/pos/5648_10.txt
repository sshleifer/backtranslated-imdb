I recently purchased the full American Gothic Series on DVD and it has gone through my memories. I am very grateful to see the episodes for the first time not being broadcast. <br /> <br /> I liked the "Fire Ring" that Gary Cole is a "nasty, sexy" Lukas Buck. Lucas Black is also an amazing player as Caleb. I thought Brenda Bakke was like Selena Coombs is fantastic in her role too. In fact, the entire cast has a tremendous skill and has one of the greatest chemistry. <br /> <br /> This series is really gripped by network design (collapsing with a growing group of sensors) for adult viewing. <br /> <br /> The combination of comedy, tragedy, farsus, satire, gothic romance, and horror genres has provided fantastic characters that support acting intellectual level. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Long Gary Koel (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the most sweetest "fallen angel".
