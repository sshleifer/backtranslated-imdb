As a popular game, a lot of surfing likes. After seeing the documentary, I realized how dangerous it was. In fact surfers were also scared of big waves. Even someone got killed. But they still kept on surfing and enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> According to surfers, we know clearly what they experienced when the big tide arrived. Avoid strike directly from the big wave. When you win, it will bring you much satisfaction. <br /> <br /> Incredible cinematography is not overlooked. This is definitely a visual experience. <br /> <br /> Exciting sports documentary. 8/10
