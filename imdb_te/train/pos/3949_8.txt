I saw many people on this site, the first time it was broadcast in 1971. Some of my memoirs are delayed and I remember how I feel influenced by the disgrace. <br /> <br /> I am surprised if nobody admits that the nominal hero and the characters originated from one another. The 1960s British film, City of the Dead, returned to Harrall Hotel for an American release? The next British film The Wicker Man has some similarities. <br /> <br /> This is a picture of me. It is a small but important moment in the beginning of the film. When I recall, a minister and his wife stopped to help some of those in the 1870 C, west of the road. Friendly-looking Ray Milland he and his (daughter?), Yveryy Mimeoux, introduces a beautiful young mute woman. When the teacher Rai Millland was helping with Wagon, WrightlessNack filters in scenes and coils without any characters, except White Mimiux. She does not fear at all, but keeps looking at the snake with quiet concentration, until it goes away. <br /> <br /> With this weird moment, we know that this seemingly rare for all the common people, although the danger of a minister and his wife is unclear and for a long time is uncertain. <br /> <br /> For many years, this is clear to me after years. The film has a haunting quality about it, it is not possible, and it is not surprising that the people clearly remember. Make it available for video home!
