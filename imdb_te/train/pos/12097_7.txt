He was unable to spend a night in Haunted Blackwood Castle as this complicated story was wager from an English journalist Egger Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood. Once there, the writer wanders around dirty rooms and corridors, and the music and the glimpse of a pair of twins lead him to an empty room. He sits at the harpsickard and begins to play Tune, and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder by the awesome horror Elizabeth Blackwood. She tells him in a vague beautiful / peculiar manner made up of his room upstairs and anyone who always hopes this night at night ... The Night of the Dead. Thus the journalist begins a surprise series of supernatural events that surprise all over the night. Spoiler AHEDD: Perhaps not many viewers are surprised to see that Elizabeth is a ghost. It does not fall in love with the journalist, but it makes them more difficult than the average couple. The ghost, the horror castle, the past events, the sexual and the repeat of violence (in the two years many Americans have seen a little more sharpened): It's a fun movie with absolutely everything. Attractive, attractive Barbara steel is the main reason to watch it. She has never seen you in movies but has a peculiar appeal. Recommended!
