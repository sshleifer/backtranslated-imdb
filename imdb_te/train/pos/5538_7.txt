A couple (Janet and Richard) camping in Woods near a huge swamp. After enjoying camping and nature, the couple will find shelter as an abandoned farmhouse. Shortly thereafter, escaped convicts find a pair and, after the inevitable delay, they rape Janet and lift Richard in a bird's bond. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the film is one of the most horrific films ever made. It is one of the more sick and twisted early 70 shockers. Moreover, it is very mesmerizing and beautiful. I love cogert terror. Music definitely helps with a sense of image personality as well as a lot of beauty. I realized that this movie is very cool. <br /> <br /> The film is basically slow and mending and is associated with the speed of the film. I can not slow down due to the aesthetics and suspense of the film, I think it's a lot of people. Acting is not very good or at least not in the opening scenes. <br /> <br /> This is not true for everyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie in the film. It's not a great horror film I've ever seen, but it's a lot of fun. It is not exactly a notable image. If you see it enough, it will be possible to find many stores in the USED segment. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely worth checking if you're a bad movie fan.
