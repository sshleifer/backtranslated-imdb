Van Troyer once explained how he created such a strong involvement from the viewer with his films by putting his film world around the world in the real world and imagined. So the viewers think we will see a "true" story, but in reality we are totally manipulating, often getting upset with the movie (dancer in the dark) or painful (the idiots / idiotern). <br /> <br /> This story is distinctive to Von Trier: it's ideal for our leader, it feels like balancing his balance. Relations with others, but others will be the victims of the previous ones created in the past. The idealist has to reject society to stay inevitable. Mankind is corrupted and pure only (self) will lead to destruction. (These elements are also common in Breaking the Waves and the Dancer in the Dark.) The film is also filled with cynical (humorous) elements about the role of Germans and Americans in postwar Germany. The film as a technological tool has been designed wonderfully: move and fading washed colors, screen overlays, action over various overlays (with the mayor shooting as soon as it is most interesting). In this film you can see how good looks like Van Troy's technical means. In his later works, he retired from this post (they are easily accessible by not having much interest in technology).
