Oscar was nominated for the Best Live Action Short, and why would I see it being a master. If you're not particularly like blues (despite me, it's like jazz), you can easily appreciate the film. If I feel that director Jijon Mili has directed a film, it has done very well in my life. In other words, the film was nominated for the film but did not increase the director's career. For blacks, I realized that their careers may not be exchanged in high gear, because unfortunately many are blacks in white society or that they are apathetic (or worse) for "that kind of music". If you see this movie, if you do not enjoy the previous episode, pass the 5:50 mark in advance - here it meets significantly. When the singing stopped and the performers began to improve, the pace was slightly improved.
