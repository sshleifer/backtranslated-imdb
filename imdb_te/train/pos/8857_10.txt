Director has done some artworks such as Sydney Lameet Network, Dog Day Afternoon or Serpiko. Not very fortunate in his recent work. Gloria (1999) was curious and Gilie found me an interesting but unsuccessful experiment. Now, Lumet brings his best picture for decades and, in my opinion, is a true masterpiece: the devil knows you are dead or dead. I feel like a reborn for this movie Lumet. This film has a fantastic story, it's deep, and there are many layers.Also, I think the film is perfect. The performances are pretty good. Phillip Seymour Hoffman routinely brings outstanding performance and is one of the best actors in our days, no doubt. Ethan Hawk is also a magnificent actor but he is not fit for my opinion. His performance here is very good. The other cast is awesome (exclusively, the great Albert Finney), but the two actors are curiously curious about Oscar. The film has a good level, NKS for performance in some part and, in episode, thanks to the amazing screenplay. Devil Nose is a real masterpiece with a great screenplay and amazing performances, directing you precise before dead. We need more movies like this.
