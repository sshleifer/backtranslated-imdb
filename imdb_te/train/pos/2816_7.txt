This is the average Jackie Chan film, due to this fantastic ending and great humor, but it's nothing special. All the characters are pretty cool, and fun throughout the movie, yet Jackie Chan is just amazing! Jackie and Y-Man Chan have excellent chemistry together, and both are very funny !, and I looked really menacing with the main opponent! Dabbing is just horrible! The role of the character development is above average for this sort of thing, and the main fight is just amazing! In addition, the jacky takes these some of the bulbs are tough! There really is a lot of crazy and goofy humor, but it's amused by me, and the ending is hilarious! Plus all the characters are very fond of. It's pretty cheap looking but it's generally well made, and it's not enough to look at you from Jackie Chan's movie, it's just for watching, and one of my favorite moments in this film is Jackie (Dragon) and Y-Man Chan (Tiger), with a gun Rise and survive it! Because of this amazing average, and great humor, it's an average average Jackie Chan movie, but the other is that it is nothing great, still it is well worth the watch! Directing is good. Jackie Chan makes a good job of putting the camera work, amazing angles and much more quickly in the picture. Acting is great! Jackie Chan is always fantastic, and here is amazing, he's very fond of, hilarious, as he does some crazy stunts, kicked the ass that amazing chemistry with Wi-Man Chan, and played this incredibly cocky character, he's amazing! , I wanted them to stop dubbing him! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Winnie Chan Jackie's best friend was funny, I really liked him, he was also a good martial artist. I guess OK is the rest of the cast. Watch value is great! *** in 5
