Mel Ferrer is a film that has been produced or directed, you can see his pictures after the race in your life. It is much more to the great classic film of the film starring and starring Claude Colbert (Ellen R. Ewing), "The Egg & I", 47. In this film, Ellen Ewing is married and later she faces all kinds of psychological problems and murders. Mystery is very involved and Robert Ryan, (David McLean), "Bulldog of the Bullie", 65, helps Ellen and sometimes you wonder about David and on it. If you look at the picture, you start to understand the true honesty and suddenly and change your mind how the movie ends. Great performance by Claudet Colbert and Robert Ryan is a totally different character than he is generally portrayed on the screen. I forgot Mel Ferrer's great film actor Audrey Hepburn. Great classic movie, great classic actors!
