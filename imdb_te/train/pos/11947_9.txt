Just well written, directed and acted ... if not the best of Woody's best 2000's of the 80's !! Hugh Jackman is the right choice for his role. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson was banned by Woody, and she was rounded up as a performer. <br /> <br /> It refreshes you to be a romantic with the leading lady. <br /> <br /> There are a few reviews for this film neglect. Do not allow them to stop them from seeing the awesome movie. I saw the audience in the audience, and with some lines I was laughing very hard. <br /> <br /> If you like Woody Allen's movies in the 70s, you will be sorry to miss it. <br /> <br /> I would like to open this film with open minds.
