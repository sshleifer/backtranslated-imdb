I saw this first when I showed up this time 1993/4 around Easter time and I started getting into Michael Jackson (I liked his music before), I bought this on DVD last summer and enjoyed it much more now I'm older. This is a good movie but this is not a classic movie like The Sound of Music, West Side Story, The Wizard of Oz. Michael Jackson is good as an actor and has other cast members. There are a disturbing scenes like the little girl Katie hit by gangster Frankie Leido who played Joe Pesce. When Michael was in a robot, I was scared when I was young. My favorite song of the film is Smooth Criminal I feel better than a thriller in my opinion.
