Acting The film is a well-shot movie. I said that the exhibitions were sometimes weak; But for the most part, acting is very good. Jude Law, the only actor who played Harlan Maguire. He is amazing! Tom Hanks has not seen Allead Idea at some points throughout the film but he is also amazing. Paul Newman, is always good. Cinematography makes this film a fantastic work (and I rarely use that term). Conrad Hall is a true genius. If you make a break at any time in the film, you will see the gentle artistic work of this person. He sets up every shot because there is nothing. When the camera is still on, the screen has a postcard like quality. When the camera moves, each shot is fully realized. But it does not stop there. The contrast between colors and light and dark settings is the art of selection of canads. The way he set the lights is some of the most excellent lighting work I've ever seen. What did his work on this film. LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo are among the best cinematography list. Story People say the film is a 1930 gangster film, but I believe they will lose the point of the film. A love story about a hitman who has tried to save his son's life. The fairy tale that opens between two people in a beautiful relationship between each other. Writing screen is an Oscar worth. Music Thomas Newman performs a sad but hopeful score to intensify this tragic but hopeful story. Music was very thick and moving scores I made livestock. Director Sam Mendis is the new director of the veteran director's feelings. Signs he uses and his performances from his actors Today's image production is rare in the world. I'll be on the site for Sam Mendes Film. 10/10 One of the most moving and beautiful movies I've ever seen.
