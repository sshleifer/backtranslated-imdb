Konskin might be my favorite Ralph Bakshi movie. The best thing in his work is that it does not shy for your face and the second, but unlike some of his other work (although he is his best, although it is contrasted with Konkinke and later with heavy traffic and wizards), it is not unequal. Bucky takes the stereotypes and perceptions of the breed, and in addition he finds himself as a freewheeling robbery; Not even the bucks are there. It's just a blux fluidation flick with just the innovative animation, but it's enough for a significant feature. But Bakshi's targets are high: not just blacks, but the Italians / Mafioso, homosexuals, Jews, and thirteen episodes of the New York-all of Manhattan's urban quarters threw up these strange and exaggerated images. <br /> <br /> This is a great degree of abstraction for us, with a great degree of skill and terrible forms of conferences and racism (ie "tar" -abbit, baby "joke, yes joke, plus black-face). In the delivery of the message, the image of Bamboozed, unlike Spike Lee, did not take itself very tightly, much of it, Konskin is a very delightful work, It's not just in the movie, it's not just laughing, it's a lot of "pie", but some of the works and some of the sudden turns and, in fact, the awkward behavior scenes (I talk about three animated characters "colorful" and so on) , But the screenplay is sharp and it takes into consideration this time for the bucket, which is countless <br /> <br /> In the first live performance, then in the animation, and the most intriguing match in both of them (in contrast, went after business with the Cool World, and a tough edge), Papi and Randy Waiting to flee outside the prison wall and tell about the story of Bread Rabbit, brother Bear and Precher Fox Go harlenku, Rabbit Zappa-the-Hut-Esquire direct opposition to the role of the godfather. <br /> <br /> It has been shown to be no more dirty and unfortunate than ever before with a happy-lucky plot and animation. <br /> <br /> Adding butchery forms that are still broken; Animated characters move along the live-background backgrounds; Violence and gunfire fights and fights can be bloody in 1975; When the dirty cop was in a bar and was put on anesthetic and black face and dressed, he could not even reach Dumbo; A boxing competition with Brother Bear and rival forest like Climax was slowly filmed in the film; <br /> <br /> Like Mel Brooks or Kubrick or recently, Bakshi's Concunkin functions are the first fun and then the second provocative idea. It also produces cinemas with an independent level of courage; Serve the idea of ​​the script where everything from time to time will open more of its B-film plots description of the montage and endless transformation models (though based on the theme of all pieces). Miss point to call it racist; This is called Dr. Stomangouv's Pro-Atomic Conservation or Confederate States of America's Positive Slavery. And, for me, it's one of the best satires ever made.
