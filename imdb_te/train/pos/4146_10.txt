Anyone who lived in the ages of the Meners and Girl Pawer's Revenge will appreciate this film. It makes fun of college artwork "Spring Break Movie" is one of those films that gives everything you need in PLUS. It's funny, (Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch !, Sophie Monk !, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Miss Pyle!) You are dead and cast to make you laugh. Writer / actor Rachel Drarach is a comic genius and Sophie Monk is such a great villain. Wilson Phillips! Oh god! (I am repeating myself now ...) It's like the Miranda July but lives with the girls who feel like eating ice cream and pretending they're dumb.
