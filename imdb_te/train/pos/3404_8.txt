In 1936, the Audience was surprised by what they were looking for: a full-fledged, beautiful full-length technicolor film. I can not say, but it's the first (3-strip). However, it still looks beautiful on DVD over 70 years later. <br /> <br /> The glory of the film is directed by Richard Bollowsky, Director of Photography Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures and DVD - MGM Home Entertainment. <br /> <br /> I thought this story was very early: in the first half, the second place. At the end of the good news, though many people are not happy. <br /> <br /> Marlen Dietrich is not always well-known, I do not believe, and is certainly not such a soft-minded character ("Domini Enfiden"). Hart-Throb Charles Boyer is the male actor and affectionate of Domini, but some small characters are very keen on me. People like Joseph Schilderdratt as "Batech" John Caradine "The Sand Diviner;" Most memorable, at least for me, the actor "Irena," played by Tilly LaSch. Wow, a face and dance you will not soon forget! I've never seen thousands of movies I've seen. Just seeing her worth the price of the DVD she saw. Looking at her IMDb resume, she has only four films, but they are all well-known films. <br /> <br /> There are also actor Basil Rathbone who played the role of "Sherlock Holmes". C. Aubrey Smith, another famous British actor of his day. Shilk Kraat is credited with classic film buffs, with a big hit, Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan as the proud salesman of "The Shop at the Corner". Beautiful direction, photography and color, and tili dance, which I remember well about this film is good and not-so-good stuff which rolled into one all. The last half hour is fine - although I admire the end - I also rate it too. It is definitely an image collectors want to add to their collection.
