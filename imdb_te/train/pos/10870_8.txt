Personally, this movie is a very good watch. <br /> It reveals the actual situation of the trials in Hong Kong and provides a compilation of how the viewer handles triads. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is violent due to mob attacks of murders & torture. Nevertheless, the film is real to the real world, so its reflection on what has really happened to the violence on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to any triad / mafia film fan. Another good watch is Dragon Squad. The film has more swords than guns (in fact I do not remember seeing only one gun).
