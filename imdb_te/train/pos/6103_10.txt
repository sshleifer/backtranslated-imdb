I recently saw this film at the Boston Film Festival. The film is very entertaining and I believe the world and ready to see black America. It's great for comedy, drama, soundtrack. It's all good movie. These roles were well developed and the film was produced by Wood Harris (Remember Times, Full Pay), Brian J. White (Troyis 3, Mr. 3000), and the amazing Joe Saldana (drumline, Caribbean pirates). The film resolves many relevant aspects of today's society and makes it class and kind. This is not the story of life in the hospital, but it's about a story about people and their personal expedition to know who they are, or who they are going to.
