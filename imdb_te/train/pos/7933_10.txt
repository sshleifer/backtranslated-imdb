The cast of the project is a good time to work with Quiroz Brothers and "Guy on the Bench". To what extent they were surprised to capture all the most notable features of the true "B" horror film. Hopefully I will have the opportunity to work with the Pumpkin Patch Pictures team again and again in the future. A few days after I finished Detroit, I moved and was released in public on many occasions from the release. For a time the girl actually lost her mind in the video store and near her dawn. It's pretty funny and I am his 1st real autograph moment, I signed her receipt. One day if the film is often rented by a girl at blockbuster, I asked her, and she confirmed it on the computer. At that time it rented out more than the newly released Ring 2 ... The title really binds instant interest in more urban markets. In many cases she saw that the film did not come back by the customer who led me to not just give me some good people back ... Jaysun Bar (Guy on the Bench-2005)
