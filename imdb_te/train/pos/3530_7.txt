I can admit safe (like the IMDB geek) that 'Phantom Lady' would never crack into my film Noir top twenty. It can not even sneak into the top fifty. The film is just as good as many other classics of the film makers, but it is good for the 'Phantom Lady' and has permanent images that can be viewed as worthwhile. <br /> <br /> The film does not cook until the film attempts to prove all of the "Kansas" (Ella Raines). The murder of her boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis) is innocence. 'Kansas' Anderson Secretary of the day and the enthusiastic detective night. She works well when she works active in the streets of New York overnight. Just a little bit she starts putting a murder mystery puzzle pieces together. To be honest, the film belongs to Rhinos and is the only reason for its existence, the film works better than anything else. Some people are able to breathe life in the film about the prisoners who are not very interesting to her. <br /> <br /> In the film, the journalist or the director is wrong but it is clearly wrong if something goes wrong with the film. As an unconscious detective, Kansas is really quick to speed up another secret gear during a nightly night trip to a moving drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.), seeking some information to help the owner of the condemned owner. She and drummer town painted a new kind of red when visiting "All Night" jazz clubs. Trying to describe this scene, either scene or worse proves injustice, all of which will destroy the scene. You know the scene after the final sound crash ringing. If you're lucky enough to have this movie on DVD, you'll do more than you'll have to repeat this scene again. It's as good as Raina, which makes this film noticeable. <br /> <br /> Many people do not like this movie with some great scenes and an amazing scene. <br /> <br /> In the film, it is "drum / sex scene" as "the van will never be wrong". <br /> <br /> "Going vanilla" should not have a kind of taste. <br /> <br /> Clark Richards
