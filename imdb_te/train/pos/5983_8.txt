At first I saw this film as a youngster. This happened when the heavy metal world was ruling. Trick or Treat Each element has a stone for a movie. How can you make a mistake with the family ties, Jean Simmons of Kiss and the Ozzy Osbourne Precor featuring a skipper? Vinyl play backwards bad messages! Yes it is true, they use records in this movie. Eddie (Skippe) in a scene when he heard a message from the bad Rockstar in his record player, things scared. Monsters start to get out of his speakers and his stereo will be captured. As a teenager, I will turn my records off. About 20 years later, Trick or Treat is one of my most time favorite movies.
