While I'm now in college with my daughter's college, these little children appear at 8-9 in A & E every morning. My neighbors and I did not miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids made a deal that was not late for the whole week's prayer. <br /> <br /> I loved this film as long as I brought out my old VHS copy. Timothy Dalton is very beautiful, but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, day-to-face, humor and gentleness stance was directly from the pages of the book. Although Dalton had a small scene, I could not sit by an adaptation starring Vimpi Wilt Hurt or Crypie Ciaran Hinds. <br /> <br /> Here the magic is loved and loved by Dalton. <br /> <br /> I know what happened in Zela Clark. She was jinge, quiet, officially speaking, voluminous but killed a form. In her view, lightning audiences provide a compilation of the strength and zealous nature that can help protect Jean from the wrong treatment she has suffered in her youth. It is wrong to criticize her performance as "wood". The servant in the proper English home has just such behavior, but she speaks passionately when she overcomes emotion. Unlike many other screen jeans, she is adequately clear that Rochester's appeal to be a janitor to allow the audience to buy audiences. <br /> <br /> The Bronte dialogue does not remain intact if the script of the book is so important. Dalton and Clarke met with mutual and quiet intensity between Jane and Rochester. Although Jane Vanilla looks like a custard and sweet, she refuses to be router, dark and throat. Two Leads play off each other beautifully. <br /> <br /> It is the most wholesome adaptation of the best romance ever.
