Ealing comedies are not good, but I got the best of the film. <br /> <br /> In the film's premier premises, a small part of Pimlico in London is part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explosion and avoid black marketing merchants as soon as they get excluded from the UK market, not rationing. <br /> When they decide to shut down the border, they see that they are fighting against the system, as they become prisoners in their own street. <br /> They force ration water and food in their stand for the right to a right. In fact, it was worse before it started, where it was morally entry. This is a great deal by sending food to London for their plight, if they lose all the food they feel they are trying to beat and surrender. <br /> <br /> The film was successful, filled with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddale and Betty Warren. This is not correct, it is not too sentimental and the story of the story is not forced to remove your voice. Well worth a view
