Perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable Greek movies that has seen over the past ten years. Wonderful performances (especially Yianseus Zuconellis are great) are very unique in written script and effective direction, Greek is the most average standard and film. This is a film that was influenced by Sam Peckfaf's Straw Dogs, which eventually led to some clear and exaggerated conditions and removals. However, this is worthy of our vision and belongs to rare Greek films that look beyond Greece. It's a shame that did not work commercially in Greece, along with other fake and neutral big productions like Politiki Kouzina.
