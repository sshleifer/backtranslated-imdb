It is easy to qualify for the film: "A pure master". This view was created for the following reasons: the performance of the actors, the people of that era, 1100 B.C. They absolutely personalize the characters. The second reason is that the poetry expressed by Horrer's poem is well produced. Chorus's comments on others provide a distinctive atmosphere, which makes the party of artistic composition. The third reason is: the reconstruction of the decor is perfect, in the Mediterranean regions, where poetic action has taken place. And many people, the emotion is meeting. I repeat my admiration: "A pure master".
