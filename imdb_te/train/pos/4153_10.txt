This is a fantastic episode. I saw a clip from YouTube and I pledged that it was always shown on TV, and I would have a glue on the set to see. I wound up watching it with a friend of mine, who happens to be gay, and both of us cried at the end. This really well written, heartfelt episode of restricted love between the two cops, I thought, really (in the words of Kooper) "lucky ones". This is really a factor in making Cold Case, one of the most appealing and most fond of the magic of television magic in CBS. I'm looking forward to more episodes, and I'll always look back again with a rediscovery of "Forever Blue" because I'll see again and again.
