Western films of the Great 1940, a story about "Sierra Madre's Treasure" (1948), "Red Rock West" conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is down and out, but he goes to West to look for work and money from honest, young Texas. He found both, but not as expected. <br /> <br /> The screenplay of this film is quite surprising and plot twists. Amazing cinematography, movie editing, and moody western music tension and suspense. The larger sky provides a wonderful arrangement of the country's expansion. And excellent acting from Dennis Hopper and J.T. Great shows from Walsh. <br /> Dwight Yogam's specially recorded country / Western song labeled as neo-noir. "Red Rock West" hit me differently. The storyline is filled with amazing coincidences and improbable moments, and others consider the screenplay to be flawed. Generally, I agree. In this case, however, the fact that the moody atmosphere is mixed, and the fact that the red rock small town is almost empty in normal everyday life, the chance and time of opportunity, beyond "Nourish", suggest a story ... surreal. It is almost as if the intentional interference of the task with the inconvenient events in order to force Michael to catch herself. From this perspective, the coincidences are not script errors. <br /> <br /> The young man who has to face his own demons will have the plot needed for heroic stories. <br /> <br /> There are disguises like other characters. <br /> <br /> All we need is Rod Serling, his always apparently enunciated voice, that ... a young man stops in a small, almost deserted town of a thousand miles from somewhere, searching for him. It was his last lever in a journey ... the twilight zone.
