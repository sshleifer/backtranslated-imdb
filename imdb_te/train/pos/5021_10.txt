I rented this movie and saw it 20 times before taking it to the store. Bill Paxton appointed some first-rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists. This story is original and well written. Powers booth and Paxton are good performances. This story is said to be an interesting story with two elements 20 years ago, and subsequently alternatives. The storytelling makes for a good thriller that does not disappoint this style. Bill Paxton, please create more horror movies, for which you have the talent!
