** Warning! <br /> <br /> I realized it was hard to spoil a historic documentary, but I would reveal some of the characters and techniques. <br /> <br /> The documentary is not just about the fabulous footage but also the story behind it Naudets were not set to tell the story of 9/11, but a rookie firefighter, men's emotions and the viewer with them <br/> <br/> The textbook is a "9/11" texts in filmmaking.If these events are a true script, the characters are fantastic, then they throw the curve of the response. This is for taking into account the pain and emotions of the raw footage associated with it <br /> <br /> The first part of the film provides a glimpse of life at the firefighter, specifically losing himself in a rookie veteran staff, that part is pretty good, and the documentary is allowed to run its intended course, Perhaps it was great. The brothers were originally filmed by the NYC fire fighting system. <br /> Then, all hell will be broken. The confusion following the WTC attacks is apparent, because various characters that we know have fallen into horror. Not only the attacks, but first hand reactions are the most moving film of human emotions. <br /> <br /> After finding out that firefighters are missing, the human drama on its ridge is over. Hang in the balance of life and death. Unlike many films, the viewer does not know where to live and die, but asks honestly about them. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this is that Robert Dinero (I love) blues is unnecessary, unnecessary, and the story is not forthcoming. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: The best documentary I have ever seen. The crude human emotion and dramatic depictions of the play. 9.5 in 10
