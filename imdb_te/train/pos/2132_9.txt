The cast really helps to make this pleasant surprise and cut-up general-man-versus-woman-argument-all-time-but-air in Hollywood screwball romance / comedy love-type. <br /> I usually do not go for movies and that tiresome storyline but this is a refreshing, fun watching, and charm. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan make other well and very cute couple. The best supporting cast is the villain Joseph Schild Crot from Felix Breezett, who always loves. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan is one of the most interesting characters ever seen in his career. He takes the picture and turns it around the whole different mood for some time when something dramatic happens to him. <br /> <br /> Once again, when the faction has a good mix of factions, it usually succeeds. This is a great example. In this movie, it is romance, comedy and drama and it works well. I will make "You Have Got Mail" on any day. Not comparable.
