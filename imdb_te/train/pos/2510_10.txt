Moon Child is a friend who is trying to make the story of two brothers and future, economically-unstable Japan. After a fraudulent catastrophe has been wrong, someone else enters the new life of Sho's life, a special friend named Kei. After a few years they have been going on, and discovered ways to combine their talent into an unstoppable team. During another surrealist, they face a new girlfriend and his mute sister, who is part of their friends band. The disaster is a long time and the group is different. Alliances have roamed to the enemies and their worlds are knocked down. Sadness and hopelessness take some power and success to others. The tragedy still stands for others. Facts reveal and lives have changed forever. <br /> You do not see many beautiful sunrays. <br /> <br /> The film's friendships, the wheels of relationships, are too long. Moon Child Science combines the perfect cast and talent of fiction, drama, and action. It reduces daily love stories and puts you on important values, such as all friendships, loyalty, and trust yourself. Nothing is comparable. I have never been personally ever seen and I have never doubted again. <br /> <br /> It should appeal to a wide population in many ways and must be seen by everyone.
