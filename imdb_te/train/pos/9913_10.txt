Unlike the most amusing movie, I can add that the clothes and the scenery are spectacular. This kind, ridiculous love woman has a lot of money. Unfortunately, she has two greedy daughters who are eager to get her hands on her hands. This woman is alone from her husband's death. He proposed her in a cracked theater. To prevent that, she bought it. Her daughters decided to take action because she was afraid of throwing her "their" money. The role of the cast is a great plus. I would like to give almost any copy of this image in my video library, but have not yet been released. Sad.
