I do not understand. Not being a critic, I am unable to evaluate the quality of acting, it's reliable and good. My confusion is with the subject. This two untrustworthy women are sensitive to the fact that their families and their nation's continuing freedom are guaranteed and their justification for bleeding men is justified. If men do it home, do we know that "wives" have no effect on their wife? Did these women think that they chanted their holiness from lonely loneliness and killed their husbands when they were facing death or triangular everyday? They did not care for their husbands one time! Only for them. Forgive me, except their husbands and their dead.
