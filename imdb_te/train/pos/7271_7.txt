The writer / director John Hughes covered all the roots (as always) with this bitter-sweet "Sunday afternoon" family image. "Curly Sue" is a sweet, unhealthy orphan from childhood through "Bill". <br /> <br /> They compare a great US tour of A Fate to "very pretty" Yuppie advocate, while others are predictable. 9-year-old Alison Potter (in the Pepsi commercials "You Go Around The Girl!") Is associated with the heroine. This character is 6 or 7, because she wants to go to school. <br /> <br /> Like "Home Alone", slap-stick and small fat pipes have a lot of gripping large fat pans. Again, making it a "formula" film, which targets younger audiences. Entertaining and cheerful. Do not look any surprises, but prepare a tear or two shed.
