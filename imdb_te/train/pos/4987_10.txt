I am a very entertaining and somewhat innovative fun, anime based on EE "Doc" Smith's books and David A. Kails Books, books by Lensman. <br /> <br /> It may seem funny to some sci-fi / fantasy fans like some kid on a discrete planet that inherits spiritual powers and hits the death of his family, which is very fun. Plus, Lensman is the first animated feature to use hand-drawn and CG animation simultaneously. Sure, it can now look a bit old, but still has a discovery. <br /> <br /> They are very bad only in some DVDs / VCD worls (mostly in foreign and different formats). <Br> /> <br /> I have a Lensmans movie and TV series on DVD / VCD rather than just a few parts of the world To be released. <br /> <br /> P.S. serious rules! I think he's a very exciting and good looking.
