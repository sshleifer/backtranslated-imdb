The little, lovely little picture is perfect, but beautifully designed. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in her opening show for her British accent, and the cast she gathered around all the lap dialogue. It was revealed at the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I did not know why the Oscar was taken. Emma Jane Austen's most accessible and less stuffy story, well said.
