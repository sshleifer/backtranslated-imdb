I loved this movie. I do not think this film is good for anyone. Perhaps you have seen me or I personally loved it. This is one of my favorite films and I'm not in Hindi, but I love it. It may be a little like "pretty woman" but I do not see it and I do not think it's better than this. I do not know why you are scattered about it but maybe you have a good reason but I think it is but I definitely love this movie and say it is not good for everyone. I saw it all because they were very happy and I was surprised that these people did not like it. Rani Mukherjee (how I spell her last name) is her most beautiful and my favorite actress!
