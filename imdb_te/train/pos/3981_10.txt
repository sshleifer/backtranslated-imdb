This is my fourth Joe McDonough's shortest, laughing I've ever seen. In this case, Joe, Charles Boyer and Ronald Coleman take voice lessons from a compilation record. When he visits Warner Bros. Studios (incidentally the company behind the series), Jack Carson is confused. He then faces actor George O'Hallon (who is also McDoork), who is not far from his next grocery jetson and he automatically goes to the director's surprise set. I will stay there, and I have found the whole thing and the film actors in the end are attracted. The final scene on that topic was particularly blind, go to YouTube if you'd like to see it in Picutres!
