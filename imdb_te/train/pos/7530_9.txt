This animated Batman has a lot to say and it is pretty good as it is and all actions have a lot in its action. It's good storytellers like Kevin, like Kieron Kimin, Mark Hamill as Joker. Villains Joker, Two Face, Catwoman, Clayface etc. are very good. So I'm sure you will be disappointed with Batman's new adventures. So it's good to watch or rent on TV or buy a collector's edition because this is fine. <br /> <br /> Total score: ********* Out of ****** **** <br /> <br />
