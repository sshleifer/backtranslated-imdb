I'm a big fan of a fairy tale theater and I've seen them all and this is one of the best! It's funny, romantic and a classic. I recommend this for all ages. It's great because it's great for little kids, Cinderella and teen and great because it's not funny and above. I saw a little while and now I'll see it again. My family and I have great lines to quote all the time. Acting was great and it was never old. If you like fairy tales and love stories you'll love it. I have seen many Cinderella movies in my time and it's the best of them. (Sorry Disney) I highly recommend this film and shows all the Faerie Tale Theater. They appeal to all ages and are very entertaining for everyone.
