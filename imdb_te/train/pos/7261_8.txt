I strongly disagree with Jim Balusi's talent "ctomvelu". I like balloons. His first brother, John, was such a big fan of the fact that I was skeptical when he first appeared in the scene. <br /> <br /> Gim Sue is one of his earlier films - one of his weight is not that much of a lot to us) - and I like the movie. Yes, if you have touched the car, explosions and inappropriate sexuality, you might want to pass on this - a warm picture of the three lost soles that they found on each other. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent performances of Balushi and Kelly Lynch, I was not even mistaken, and I had three of the above mentioned keys in the hit film. <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened to her career, but who should be responsible for throwing the ball (Agent? Parents? she?). <br /> You can not ask for more accurate contact to fame than this film, and nothing from her note. <br /> Another tragic Hollywood story ...
