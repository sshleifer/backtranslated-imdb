There is a Disney version of The Lion King Hamlet, then Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are a Disney version Dead. Just to get to Tom Stoppard's beguiling film, we get to view two viewpoint action from the original little characters from: a hat's drop shit song, warthog with a tendency of meerkat, pumpa, flatulence problems. We can see why all the animals bow down down - like Simba's - rather after their story we presented it from Simba Pride Rock. Timon and Pumba decided to follow the Printed Rock Simba to remove the scam. And find out how they deal with Hyena's once and for all. Timon Nathan Lane gets a lot of best jokes, but he has potentially supported Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick and Vupi Goldberg are also good to repeat their roles. Julie Cawner and Jerry Stiller give their new voice for two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only downside is the constant stop start-rewind-fast-forward device which does not always help forward the story. At the beginning of the film there was a wonderful zoom. With more laughs than any other third-one-Disney-series film, Hakuna Matata is looking at the value - only for the hot tub scene which is funny even though still slightly predictable.
