I do not understand why "critics" gave me this documentary "0" rather than political reasons. No film has been investigated on both sides of the film, but then a film on the habit of campaigning against Chavez must be seen as an attempt to balance the entire story (especially the CIA involvement in Latin America, which originated in the history of civil disorder - Google National Security Archive and B. That Coverage of the country and Chawez supporters is clear As the rest of the fake scenes are portrayed by non-opposition opponents). What's more amazing about this film is that the filmmakers were rebellious in the president's palace - it was the first of the documentary making - the pictures of the rebellion from both sides!
