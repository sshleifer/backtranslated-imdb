Although the story is simple, "surprise" is not just a bad joke on the audience, you can see these good actors attracting the project - it's shining good actors, and they will shine. The film was made indelible - for its time. It was rebuilt in 2000 as "Under Maintenance" and if you want to see a version of the story (really really worth it), I can only indicate Hopkins's innovative direction and more clear plot points. The end, however, still blows. (** 1/2)
