It's "not so bad and bad", it's totally fine! For those who do not understand why, you have the intellect of a four years (in response to a particular comment ...) Killer Tomatoes eat food in France, parody of you, and a parody me. This is the most intellectual text in cinema history. I and three prequels are sitting on my DVD rack beside Herzog and Kurosawa. This includes the identification of absurdity and suppresses all standard calls you or me. I wrote scripts and this film opened to me a comedy comedy, which we did not see. It can only be taken in parts ... its kind of exploitation ... Now I am trying to take a minimum of ten lines. Some time ago my comment ended. This will work when I submit now.
