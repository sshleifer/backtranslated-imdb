I caught this movie on Sunday night / evening morning with my brother. We were drinking. This is one of the best movies I can not afford. The fact is that the ferry from the 'luxury ocean liner', the door to the door with the full rod of the cast iron, and the other door to use the same door to another scene. !! But you can not help but notice it will fall face to face with holes. In the final scene, he flies to the ferry with a ferry ferry. His son and a new girlfriend in the ferry, which ran fast from the explosion (Kung Fu's ships used in PR director and police but dismissed for putting things off). ...... then the father is hugging them up. How ???? Who cares its magic. The film does not have a ransom feature. Casino is a large bedroom size with a casino table. There is only one place to hide when the villains follow you, you expect it. Instead of checking under a table, enter the villains who proceed to shoot four fruit machines and a small corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - excellent). <br /> <br /> They spurn Caspour around them and allow them to 'take them away'. <br /> <br /> Get some partners, take some drinks, put this image and lift it.
