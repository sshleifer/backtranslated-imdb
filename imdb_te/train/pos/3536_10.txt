EA has made us a classic 007 agent and has shown us that you can feel 60 worlds. The game's graphics are exceptional and voice recording is very professional. I got this game in April 2007 (after two years of release), and I'm still impressed with the gameplay. <br /> <br /> I have a 10/10 level of play, especially the "consulate" level. I recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13. The only thing I do not like in the game is the Russian boat level, which is very stressed. Overall I like the game a lot!
