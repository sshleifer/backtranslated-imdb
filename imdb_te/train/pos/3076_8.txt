It was not very easy to see a good theatrical release: it was very smart, and it was difficult for audiences to compare with the American Beauty in the investigation of the Midlife Crisis, and the Sopranos and its analysis of the study of law continues to be illegal. Although the panic appears to have originated from the unnatural element, Brommel's written characters make this film genuine in removing a middle-aged person along with sarcastic dialogues and observing direction. <br /> <br /> William H. Alex, his father (Sutherland) is a murderer who works for a contract-killing business. He leads his wife (Ulman) and a double life without knowing his true trade. In his middle ages, he was frustrated with what he had done throughout his life. In his calmness, the collected facade meets his father's control of his life with the suppression of his life. <br /> <br /> The author / director Henry Brommel decided to do the job, and when his main character was trying to break down, he inspired a young man (Campbell) to meet him and leave the family business. Excludes contract-killing. He can easily replace it with any undesirable profession; His characters were well developed and believable, sequences were smoothly and originally and written, so naturally written that he did not act as a murderer on the controversial role of Macy. <br /> <br /> In Alex, Mackie creates a tragic, easy and sympathetic character, and another brooding is always in great function, Bromel's script seems to be a Shakespeare tragedy. Suppose. Mackie's wife is a welcome welcome to the comedian, Donald Sutherland, as well as his compromised father, and Ulmann's dramatic turn as potentially obscene and abusive. <br /> <br /> The first feature of Henry Brommel is that Panic is a well-made film in its remorse, which examines the scene in a bicycle shop. With a first-rate cast, an acceptable script, a text dialogue and a better direction, this character-study is hopeful of Brommel's appropriate taste for creating real-life characters. <br /> 10 to 8
