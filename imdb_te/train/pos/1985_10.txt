I'm not usually a lover of musicians, but my favorite is that it is definitely Oliver. The film is very well done, the characters are well filmed, acting actors are good and the songs review my favorite guy Ron Moody by Fagin's superb filming. When Oliver was released at the end of the '60s, my sisters finally had to sit with them in the weeks after I was playing bloody songs, and I thought it would usually buy my wonderful roses. Before I saw the film, I knew everything. You can not remade a timeless music, it's own. It's not perfect for the book and I do not think it's working well. I do not think Charles Dickens should be disappointed, Oliver is about to paint poverty in London, orphanages, work homes and poor need to resort to life, and the film is very good. Another great reason to see this film is how old-age English bull terrier, his long thin legs, bounced out of the race many years ago, had to be a high and low-hunter to find a pattern like him, and how he looked at an English bull terrier Victorian era. He has scars on his face {is perhaps the make-up}, Bill Sikes probably used him for dog fighting or rat pit. A Victorian Bull Terrier has the record amount of murdered in a rat pit. No matter how a cute dog, he disobeyed Bill Cykes after killing Nancy, who did not have his standards, thought he was his head-head Bill Sykes. If you like music, it's great to watch music, and if you do not like it, it's something that everyone has in the picture.
