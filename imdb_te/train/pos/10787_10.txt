So when I was little I got this film right now and my sister and I loved it. We'll see it all the time. When our friends come we'll sleep and we want to see the big rock candy mountain and grandfather magic dolls. I'm 21 years old, I love this movie, some old friends and I've just met and looked at it, we all know the songs, we're dancing and how much you hate the professor when it's low. A friend actually bought this movie and grandpa's magical toys for her 2 year old daughter because she wants to pass our love with this movie. This is a movie that can really make your kids look safer, no violence, no bad language, great songs and important lessons are ours.
