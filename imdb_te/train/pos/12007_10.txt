This is one of the most spiritual films I've ever seen. I led 150 people to St George. We saw this movie at the St. George's Temple Center. One person in the audience has no eyes. In addition, some of the audience were anti-religious and moron opponents who felt the spirit of the film and struck through the spectacular music and rebuilding of the difficulties faced by the audience story and their faith. /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who knows more about Joseph and the difficulties that the pioneers went through. After all, it is American history.
