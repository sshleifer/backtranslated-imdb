It's great. It just goes to prove that you do not need crazy litle things like continuation and scripts to make a film. This is the second time in the continents in the continents, where people are shot and killed and nothing is done, the slaughtered swords, sabotage on the sinking gulls, David Essex is the epitome of the terrible villain, and John Rice Davis just dude. I enjoyed this movie but I like s ** t movies, this is just the perfect example of Kicks ASS too s ** t movie. If you like the Battlefield, this film, its SwashBuckling, its speedy, its silly, its breathtaking !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> It also appears as it did in 1972
