Two hours, ten minutes ... This is not the first three-hour movie because I'm not actually a commercial for the last time! Perhaps, however, should it be two parts for a total of 3 hours? Yes, more earned, and some more emotions could be explored. Overall, Lucy and Desi lives an interesting form. I love and love Love Lucy from time to time, but I have never read or seen a biography, never know their lives from the screen. Now because of this film I will do it but it's not very good. No one really needs to know here. This is an image that does not necessarily make. But it was made and the reason Lucy & Desi still feel that the big stars and some individuals of American society are aware of our TV and movie stars of the rest of society. <br /> <br /> However, what is shown here in Lucy is pretty good. Two complaints - the actress who played Vivi Vance - is not a great casting. And switch to Rachel York from Madeline Zima .... uhhh, plastic surgery like Lucy and suddenly her whole new person! It's not great. But the story focuses on the rocky relationship between Lucie & Desi. No, the kids did not show much at all and this was a necessity, because as I mentioned, this was particularly focused on Lucy & Country. Lucy spent most of the story about the whole life, and the children still remained. But they can not look at us briefly by looking at gabble & lambard, red skeleton and buster ketone. Wow, I thought I was really good about this story: his presence and influence in the life of Lucy. Really nice and it's not even bad, it's not explored more. Oh! Good. For the most part explored, well done. Honestly, I do not think I will ever see it again and I do not think this film is memorable. I Love Lucy is not a great luscious ball fan, but it should be an interesting watch. This is my grade: b
