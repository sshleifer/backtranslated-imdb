These 25 years ago I saw PBS. It's very hard to see. Truth. There is a heart routing to see this small family struggle in winter. There is no time to spend: the task is thrown together with us and we will sprinkle our shoulders and work. It is based on the original diary of the woman, and I read it several years later. In her parenting her parents said that she died during her childhood and that their difficulties and sisters would have to feed their cattle. She learns to beat, it's not like a lady. No prince feared that he wanted a woman with beautiful, sunless, vengeful hands, but she was happy to know how her husband drank, and she was happy to do. Both were widows and worked together to build a new home. Very sad when the baby dies. However, if it has today, I'm sure it has happened. Only the tragedy makes extra regret. I'm crying very hard. But they went out and pulled out a new calf successfully. Spring is in its path, and life goes away. In her diary, she has two boys and they lived.
