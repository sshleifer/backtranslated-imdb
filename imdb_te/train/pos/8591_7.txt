This is a very good movie. It's good to sit and watch this movie. Just a simple Hollywood movie. This film does not win an Oscar or anything and is definitely not a qualification, but I thought it was pretty good. It's kind of like appearance 24 but set into image format. If you like the whole, if you want to stop the terrorist who killed the president then you will enjoy this movie. I personally think the storyline will be done a lot of WAY, but the Sentinel will add a little twist with the mole in the Secret Service. Overall, the film does not leave your jaw or does not change your life, but who says that every image should be good?
