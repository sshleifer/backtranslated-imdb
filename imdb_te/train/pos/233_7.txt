In fact I found this movie 'interesting'. In the end my time is worth watching and renting. This is true ... some scenes are emotional, shouting, etc. But what film does not stress its agenda, style or 'ax'? Almost nothing! On another review site, I reviewed my review by the SFran Reviewer, but found his negative review on a more accurate description of the film's "own" review. The picture is not all. Anyone who sees this movie realize that it is great to recommend family and friends; Which car chases, yes! Since I am "in" for an Italian family, I am fully connected to the environment that has been screened on the screen. The film has tear-related pieces. It will be in such an environment in real life. Nice picture.
