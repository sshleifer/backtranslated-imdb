Dr. Feinstone is a dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a huge house. Suddenly he learns that his wife is doing pool attendant - he finds that everything is clean. ... Corbin Bernstein is a shocked dentist-he is absolutely believable and amazing. There are surprisingly little gore but dental torture scenes are very nasty and grotesque .Hail recommendation. "Dentist 2" is also worth checking out!
