When is it that some films are fun and are not necessary to change the world? If you realize this, you need to look at the "bogus travel of Bill and Ted". They seem to be in the first film, with the fun of the movie, Keanu and Alex adding their characters from "Bill and Ted's Fantastic Adventure" to a more "style". It's not rocket science but it's great for a laugh, so you have to laugh so many characters can play and tie characters. Do not expect Deep and Argentines, it feels like it's pure!
