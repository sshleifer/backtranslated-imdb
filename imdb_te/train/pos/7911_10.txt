At a young age, I liked computer animation, it was very limited and the tools were not nearly the same. This film, when I was sitting in awe and saw wonderful pictures and almost-hypnotic music, made me want to create moving moves on the computer. It's a perfect-package deal, between music and video, which really packs a two punch. This should be a must if you know any child you love to participate in computer animation. <br /> <br /> When I was about 20 years old, this film was one of my first 3 favorites. Realism, I feel, is still unsurpassed to today's McMovies that is spinning out of Hollywood. I wish I could recreate my own right now. If the film is in the first form of the film, the film deserves a ton of simulation)
