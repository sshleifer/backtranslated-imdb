I'm going to estimate this amazing picture. People see it as a horror film that can threaten it and prevent us from some sleep. It's exactly 1/10 when trying to do it but I've seen this movie with some friends and it's a lot of fun and it's a good movie after Stephanie Beton has a good movie. I think 10/10 is desirable for the pure entertainment of this film. <br /> <br /> The general view on this image is that it's bad acting, old production and it should take seriously and people are rating it low because of this. But I see this as a completely entertaining masterpiece ... It's a lot of entertaining though those actors have a ridiculous funny script that's made more entertaining and not too serious.
