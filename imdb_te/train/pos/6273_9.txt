I love this film, yes, I know it's too far, the film is well over the Shelby car road as well as the 540i traction control and other gizmos than the rest of the film. Cage is as amazing as the usual and the rest of the cast is pretty good except the Brit Bad Guy also, do not you think he is too small "too"? Anyway, great movie, great cars and great acting. At night I remembered that my car was locked in my remote controlled garage and was terrified. :)
