When I first saw Shining, I imagined a good picture from what I heard about it and I liked Stanley Kubrick's other work but when I started watching it was better than what I thought. Sometimes I feel ridiculous and uncomfortable and I can not get my eyes on the screen and is very worried about everything in this film. Now some do not like Kubrick's The Shining Edition because it does not follow Stephen King completely, but in my opinion the Kubrick version, the short-range and the book are all great. Jack Nicholson has done a brilliant performance. After watching movies, Shining looks and keeps thinking.
