This is what I call a "front science fiction; sci-fi" film. This amazing good "mood" type is not much better than lagochi / carolof in motion picture. <br /> <br /> Carlf is doing a brilliant job as a scientist, who is caught in the vice of arrogance, pride and classical competitions. In the three previously mentioned concepts I was caught in the thought of seeing the person drowning. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that the two stars themselves are doing it. At the same time it is a movie that is going to be remade. This time Harrison placed Ford in the Carroll episode and possibly Kaifer Sutherland Bela Lagosi. <br /> It is one of the best productions in Hollywood. This is not good as I said. There is no chance.
