The film is about Down Syndrome. Two kids are very painful for a mother. The mother does not think she can raise her, so she has 11 children with 15 children. mom does not like this & she think she should be with her family (I agree very much) so they take it to the court & the family needs to break & grandparents lose, what does it really mean when mom & daughter decoration? I think the film is good but the plot is familiar, it's still nice and some unexpected laughs!
