Complete of visually stunning and eastern philosophy, this amazing martial arts fantasy master director Tu Hark has brought you, the Hong Kong cinema has produced a man behind some of the best pictures. Special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The plot is a bit of the cerebral side, but they refresh from films to treat their audience if they are morons. If the idea is not your Fort, it is not your image. Perhaps you should look fresh from the Hollywood studio's No-brain Club, but if you're still looking for something, you'll find it here.
