This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. For the first time I was 9 or 10 years old. I started looking at the scene before the rape scene. And when I saw it I was "really what a sick picture it is?" He was really amazed by thinking. Today I have seen from this film and really understand how great this film is. It's exciting, intimidating, shocking and disturbing its unique way. But the best thing about it is that the audience is haunting the characters of the rest of life. This will damage their conscience and worry about the rest of their lives about the dead bodies found in the river. And they can not do anything about it, that they are alive. The ending is one of the most joyous finishes in film history and is the most intelligent, intelligent and terrifying <br /> <br /> And acting is also great, especially Jon Voit and Burt Reynolds. Excellent acting in the film. In all, John Bourman created one of the best films throughout film history based on the novel Dick Chaney. All the cinema lovers must see
