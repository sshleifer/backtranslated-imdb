It's my favorite childhood - it's watching television and remembering thrilling. Now that I have grown up and have my own kid, I want to introduce this classic movie. We saw it last Friday and he liked it. In Abu Ghraib with a giant spider, my son holds his hand and holds the mine - he was honestly afraid. "He's a spider, defeated Papa?" You'll see, you'll see. <br /> <br /> The grandson of Harun al-Raschid grandson Bazdad Ozma may be the Oz. <br /> <br /> He is not particularly Ozma adventurous and foolish by the foolish-thief, and the grown king. In fact, if the story is a bit odd, the king thief is sideways, not all the hero - it should be very satisfying for the imaginative, courageous young men. <br /> It's definitely up to date. I suspect that my son may use it either 'calf' or next generation at age eleven or twelve. The love story is just a dimensional - a cynical friend commented, "Why does the love of Ahmad love the Princess? Abu's willingness to keep himself in competition (repeatedly) clueless, love-losing king is equally incompatible. But criticism of such things is serious when traveling, such as mechanical horses, fifty-feet jeans and the Temple of All-Seeing Eye. Abu's final shot, the last shot to fly over the "stolen" magic carpet "finally seeking some fun and adventurous!" Satisfied to see the prophecy fulfilled in the climax of the film.
