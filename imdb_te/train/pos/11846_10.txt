I liked this movie too. The animation is well done and the romance is beautiful. I liked Bryan Adams's songs and Hans Zimmer score was amazing. Many people do not realize how good the Darkness / Heart of the Apocalypse is. The "civilization" now called "civilization" is "civilization" when someone is at home. The early scenery and music are very confusing. The film is a beautiful one America is a tragedy.
