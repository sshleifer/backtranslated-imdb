Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny film considering the bad campaign especially when it first released. Ben Affleck is funny as a bad Millionaire who is paying for his childhood home to his family for Christmas. He then went over to the crazy family overindulgence for Christmas cheer. I'm not a Ben Affleck fan (I'm like Daredevil and Paeck) in the past but here he plays well in this role. I first love Christina Applegate as a daughter in a family that does not retain Ablek's role. You can see where this film is going, but you do not care. Listen to what critics say and rent this movie because it's more ridiculous than most movie movies.
