This film is one of the most provocative Jesus I've ever seen. It tries to tell the whole story, but not only to illustrate the descriptive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is dark, witty and radically confident of the origins of the Jewish tradition and the modern libraries. Judas is much more common than other films, and we are not the dark and bad evil that we sometimes imagined, but the man who was seriously misled in his enthusiasm. Chris Saranden's Jesus is fun and intense, faithful and committed - too human and even divine. The last dialogue is thought out and two powerful men act as a little debate that makes a terrible commitment. I will watch this movie again and recommend it to others.
