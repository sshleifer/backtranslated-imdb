<br /> <br /> Michael Caciensis is a sequencer in mind, especially because of the great director. <br /> <br /> context: The weight of history and a powerful army and the navy lie on the sides of King Agamemnon. With the fear of his great adventure on the Troy, the action of apostates was able to withstand the oceans. He said that his daughter should sacrifice Efigenia to Apollo, to get the wind for the sail of the thousand ships. He initially opposed, but his wife would come to greatly marry all the great men in Achilles to bring his daughter to the Greek camp. <br /> <br /> Clintemnestra and Efigenia sacrifices to the gods for protection and vengeance. Meanwhile, the proud Achilles finds that his name is used in this fraudulent, disrespectful way. <br /> <br /> Shot: Camera wastes two youngsters without looking directly at each other. They lose their fate, and the weakness of men to lust for lust and war for their loved ones. Suddenly, they look each other, for a moment, their power and beauty and the staggering - camera - at another time, in another place, they probably love each other. <br /> <br /> It is a sharp and sad epiphany. No camera! Story!
