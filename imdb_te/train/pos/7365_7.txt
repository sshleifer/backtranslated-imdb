Spike and Heaton do not say that there are some traitors because of the way all the way through the movie. I feel like I've put the relationship between two different relationships. I guess I have a lot of homosexuals as part of Hayton. My favorite scene was hard on Hetton and Spike mars and the spike should be a bit where I usually runs off I thought the spike was coming back. I must say that I have never seen it, even if we did not see it in our movie study. Overall, I thought this film was great and I would recommend anyone to be a fan of British films.
