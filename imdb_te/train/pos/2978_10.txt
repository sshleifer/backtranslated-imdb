BASEketball is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It is an off-the-wall film featuring South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. It will play two slucker friends who create a game in a national sensation. Most of the deceptions are really fun but the funniest parts of the film when players try to "get out" of other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about things that are not allowed, so naturally they do crazy things as possible. An error pace of this film was way too fast, and after watching for half an hour I asked "Wow this already over this?" Another hilarious part of the film is how Joe and Doug are constantly harassing a hype-up little girl Zakyak. BASEKetball is a fun classic with some very lighthearted lines, and it is very fun to watch!
