Must see for this anime evangelian fan. This is a big work for Anna Hyde, but his frustration and dramatic style is in place. Likewise, those who do not like the Evegelian might find this release a bit more enjoyable. A science fiction anime is actually unique based on realistic science. In fact, there are many small "Science Lesson" interlasts describing physical events behind some events in this program. One of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of the speed near the light. The series travels with the speed of light, performing an imaginative traumatic experience that leaves the land in a return journey of a ten year old land. The main character is approximately 17 or 18 years old. Be warned, this display will be higher in the sap. It is a couple of very completely unmerited breast shots I've seen. Because the series is not very good, skimpy uniforms and boo-hood scenes have been found to be quite easy to ignore, but with low SAP tolerance viewers might want to stay away from this. In an interesting note, Gynex was able to run out of money in the last two parts, as always. However, using black and white movies and still using sketches of actions is a good response. The end is a bit crazy, but I can not help but love my gut leave me feeling such good. Gun Buster, in my opinion, is one of the best pieces of anime.
