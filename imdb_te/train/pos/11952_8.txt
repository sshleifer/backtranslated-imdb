**** Woody Allen * Scoop * My favorite director is not, but I'm "point point." It's a fabulous dark romance thriller that Woody Allen did not start. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is Woody Allen's latest film and he's right in this case, it's OK. <br /> <br /> Johannson will play Sondra Pronsky, a young college journalist who spent a lifetime from Jon Strawberry (Ian McShane). Joe heard when I was on the boat with a reputable repurchaser and a group of other souls. One of those spirits is Peter Lyman's secretary (Hugh Jackman), who tells her joke that Peter is a serial killer in the streets of England. Joe lives with a scoop of a lifetime, and lends this information to a sundress during a magical action. Sondra Magiste has some magic show with Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She is a volunteer go in a disappearing box and gets a visit from her joe, when she's in the box. <br /> <br /> The film has a very lightweight feel to it compared to "Man Point", and it all works. Johansson and Allen work well together. Allen's comedy is perfectly suited for this story and character. Hugh Jackman is a "suspected" serial killer, Peter Layman. <br /> <br /> It is a fun little picture to see if you ever look at yourself anytime. The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget to be yourself with Woody Allen watching. I love you because it's a chance.
