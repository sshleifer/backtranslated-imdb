Another Channel 4 is a long time ago. Filming acting from Phil Davies and the other cast. Sexy, clever and funny. I remembered it at that time, and I was not even asking, no one really heard it. But recollections are hard to find now. Maybe Channel 4 is not enough in drumming their job requires excitement. The general public is more interested in TV voices called Big Brother. I suspect the next one. Garth Merengee's Dark Place's download prompted Channel 4 to release the DVD's DVD. Let's hope the same will happen with the same North Square.
