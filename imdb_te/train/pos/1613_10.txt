This movie is still a favorite time. The funniest, ridiculous moron only enjoyed this wonderful film. The film looks like a slice on a warm apple topped with French vanilla ice cream! I was Cher's finest work and her incredible performance. Cher is always nice, with charisma, and is blessed with an enviably thin man. If you sing or do not like it - who sounds like cher? Cher certainly made his mark in the entertainment industry and remembered for a long time after others arrived. She is one of the most outstanding artists there. Who thinks about Cher as a naturally gorgeous actress? Today she is the forerunner of her so-called "films". Cher Debra Winger, Alfre Wurd, Holy Hunter, Angela Basset and others are similar to that, she feels "acting", and she really changes the character. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do, Every time I see the scenes sitting in the dinner table at home, I'll pause the remote to see the delicious food Rose I do not know if I'm spaghetti and mushrooms (I think), but they can not do it if they eat the ravioli. driver <br /> <br /> Everybody in that family was a hardworking man who respected and thought about each other, his grandfather was not aside and unable to cope, he was an important part of the family and he heard and respected for his age and wisdom. /> <br /> The mother of Loretta is not just "homemaker", an example for her family and her wife. She said, "I did not have children under the age of 37 and it was not up to it." She said, "What's that kind of youth that you're proud of her and what she's proud of?" Got out of the way without the other person knowing what had happened If you thought. She is lovely, quick, and very clever. What a great mom! <br /> <br /> She can tell others about themselves and where they go wrong, but she does not really use the general feeling of her life. She is married to a middle-aged mama's boy, because she wanted a husband and a sense of intent for her life, and she was more traditional than her own mother. You seemed to be like a maternal house and seemed humorous and frustrating, but you realized that she had a lot of love to fall down and be alone and give the right person. <br /> <br /> I'm happy with Loretta and Ronnie's loud, thrown in the future I could see the kids and the Rose and the Cosmos enjoy every minute.
