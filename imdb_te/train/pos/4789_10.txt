<br /> <br /> David Lynch (1999) featured John Roach / Mary Sweeney in the movie Aioau and Wisconsin shortly before the release of the film. <br /> <br /> In the life of Alvin Straits (Richard Fronsworth). <br /> His medical condition is poor, his life is behind him and he knows it. <br /> <br /> In this case, he decides what to do, more great and lovely. <br /> <br /> Alvin is understandable in his life, the greatest experienced man, humility. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) struggles with a speech that makes communication on behalf of the audience a great effort. But it is valuable because the story of Rose can not help but the movie goes on. <br /> <br /> This film is a travel story. But like all the journeys it's a journey into the geographical dimension and the human dimension. <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the film, we begin to understand that this is a very prestigious journey, not Alvin's age at any age. <br /> <br /> However, Alwin has the most qualifications to equip him to achieve his possible goal. His goal is very simple and straightforward. His brother is ill and dying and wants to visit him. He had been with him many years ago and did not speak for a long time. <br /> <br /> Alvin meets a lot of people. The essence of the film is that he behaves with them and benefits from what they know. We know what Alvin Straits does, who is Alvin Straits. And at the end of the picture, we know who we are .. good.
