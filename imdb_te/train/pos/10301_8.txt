Bruce Almighty, one of Carrie's finest paintings ... well ... very long. It has one of the funniest scenes I've seen for a long time ... Morgan Freeman is surprisingly funny and some jokes are well and even the chips plays God. It's a bit boring but some funny scenes all have one or two romantic moments with a great image. <br /> My rating: 8/10
