Unexpected events and feelings in the small village is the arrival of the world's leading conductor. Some people are threatening how to organize the church choir, and how people change gradually. The film moves the heart and leaves your movies and tears in your eyes in both eyes. Kai Polak wrote a striking script based on his most famous ideas, bringing the best of the people. Actors are the best, we know before Michael Niquid but Frida Halgren is new and beautiful acquaintances for me. She has a very clear face with no one untapped leaves. Moberg is the husband of Gabriella for everyone, he is very scary. <br /> If he is to play a good guy one day, the master can see that role. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you do not get hurt. If you do not see it already, do it today!
