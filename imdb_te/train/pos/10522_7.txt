This is a good adaptation of Aston's novel. Very nice. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is unveiled, sometimes crossing at Jimmykie's borders, but the story avoids the boring TV looping loop in the attire, the dialogue driven. <br /> Acting is effective. Ms Paltrow is away, as she needs the character, but the required distance from other characters is accompanied by very little detachment from her own actions. In other words, she does not have enough results for match-making efforts. An assistant cast is guilty of some over-acting - even in the style of motion pictures, although there is a lot of movement in style. Personally, I have no problems accepting Mr Elton Alan Cumming - unless it's a fault of his own, leaving a impression like a gay trolley-dolly in "High Life" that's hard now to accept playing any serious part of it. Acting honors pass the warmth of Tony Coletti, and Jeremy Northam plays his role at the right level.
