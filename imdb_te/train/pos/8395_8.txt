Maria is very strongly readily stating her husband's death in her husband Herman. But one day they see Hermann at the door while staying close to Bill. He is not dead and when he enters the room a confrontation occurs and Maria breaks a bottle on the head of Bill and he dies. Hermann is a suspect and he has been jailed for a long time, and she says she will succeed in one of them and get him out. ఈ యుద్ధం ముగిసింది మరియు జర్మనీ పునర్నిర్మాణం మరియు ఒకరోజు రైలులో ఒక విజయవంతమైన వ్యాపారవేత్త అయిన కార్ల్ ఓస్వాల్డ్ (ఇవాన్ డెస్నీ) ను కలుసుకుంటాడు మరియు ఆమె ఉద్యోగం పొందడానికి ఆమె ఆకర్షణలను ఉపయోగిస్తుంది. Maria decides to do well and goes up the corporate ladder and becomes Carl's wife. She tells her that she will never marry her but she is in love with her. <br /> <br /> Hermann falls out of jail but goes to Canada to try and get everything he tried since lorry was put into Canada. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER allert /> <br <br /> One day, Carl, dies and Maria ***** is determined to do everything to her and she buys her own house. Hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are ready to marry even though they have been married for some time. But Maria left the gas on the stove and both of them exploded with it. <br /> <br /> In this film there are many interesting things about it, one of those movies is a great length to study and talk about it. Color consumption is used in many interesting ways as in all Fassbinder films. As the film starts the tones Brown and gray battle represented Germany damaged but as Maria starts to become successful they change bright colors like red and white. Germany's reconstruction with all the sounds of the construction is used only for the backdrop, and focuses on the film and the looting. Fosbinder liked the reconfigurable sound to remind us of what would happen in Germany at that time. Hannah Skillegala is no better and her performance is critical to the success of the film. It was another interesting film with a low nick, but Skigula is very strong, her performance increases this image to a higher level. Stigula shows Maria very decisive and intelligent but at the same time she uses her to get her beauty and femininity what she wants. She is not embarrassed or she does not feel guilty in this regard and wants to show her a feminist gentleman as a woman selling herself confidently. Skiggall was not nominated for an Academy Award, but she performed a great show of her time-test. Fassbinder appears as a peder in his film and plays the role of his own mother, Lilo Pempet Früm Emk. I have heard many things about the ending of the film and it is related to whether or not I have left the gas with a purpose. Later in the bathroom she runs water on her wrist and she looks sad. If this is anticipation and I'm mistaken, send me an e-mail. Herman's house and threatened to abandon it tisukuvelutunnanu I was happy for her, I think it is excessive (she dharincukovacca up without any reason?). At that time, she read that she learned that Hermann and Karl had become friends without her knowledge and that she had nothing to do with her. The bathroom is the reason for the scene. Hence the house is accidentally exploded. But I show that there is no business life for someone who sells their soul because of the endurance for the Faizine. Fussbinder was fascinated by the survivor but he was very passionate. Maria can not have it in her eyes. Attractive image.
