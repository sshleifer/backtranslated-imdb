Yesterday I saw "El Mar" and I thought it was a great movie. Roma, Manual Tur, and Francesca: It begins with the childhood episode in the life of 3 main characters. <br /> We are going to hospital for 10 years together with two friends. <br /> <br /> I am complaining about people that I am very complaining about the film, including religion, illness, love, violence throughout the film, building a serious and tense image. This is a violent, intense and sad story. People suffer. Edcutaku. For sadness. Blood spraying What I'm showing is that the film is not made for pure shock-value or is unsatisfactory. I also know that some people are "pure" and their torture. But sometimes, you feel uncomfortable in making the film work. This is one of these movies. <br /> <br /> "The film is all in a sense, but it's not very important to the entire story, so I'm still I give this film to 9.
