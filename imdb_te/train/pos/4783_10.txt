"Straight Story" is a beautiful one about an elderly man named Alvin Straight, who runs his pasture across the country to visit his widely and dying brother. But it's just basic sampsis ... much more than this film. He is the last character of Richard's Fernworth, before he dies, and he certainly remembers. He is a stubborn old man, unlike a lot of old men you and I probably know. <br /> <br /> "Straight Story" is a picture that everyone should see at least once in their lives. You can reach it and touch some of you, at least if you have a heart.
