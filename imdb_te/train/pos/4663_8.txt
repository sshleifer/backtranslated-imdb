I saw the movie description in TCM and it was running because I liked both Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was so fond of film and I was surprised to find it very unusual. In fact, it's seriously dating, but it's good to look for a short-lived miniature humor in life and lifestyle forty years ago. The only problem now is I can try to find it on DVD so I can see more often. I have also ruled out the performances of Smith and Ustinov leaders, and the performances by Carl Malden, Bob Newhart, and Robert Morley and Caesar Romero.
