First, no one can understand why this movie is so poorly rated. This is the first real horror film since long since I started driving through the dark rides as a child (devil trains) and a decades long experience of horror being pretty hard boiled. Secondly, you have a face that you can expect to be a leading actress in mainstream films. Thirdly, this lady is beautifully beautiful, I have suggested that all of the directors should be retired by Cameron Diases, Eva Mendezes, and the names of these ephemeral bulb-lights. <br /> <br /> However, "dark residues" also have considerable metaphysical significance. Photographs of creatures of mediation rule between reality and "imagination" are not visible with one's own eyes. But in those scenes only a few individuals and only a few photos of the animals appear in those animals. This means that the photo is not a symbol of reality (reality becomes no signal), but an alternative form of "real" reality. Being a sign, the change of the figures means that the photographs are influenced by objects, which means that the code behaves as an object. Now, it is common to change the signals of goods in our normal world. F.ex., if someone buys a bird, his photo shows him with a beard, not before. But with the opposite, the signals change things first by the beard and only then the beard grows over the man. In this film, the case with the photos taken by the main character in jail is quite simple. It's new, and we should already be grateful for new ones in horror movies, which are usually repeat and re-order the familiar, effects and features from the silent time already.
