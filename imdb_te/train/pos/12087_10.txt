By purchasing the first season's value (Amazon) from Amazon, I took a chance on "Hard Castle and McCormick". When I found it, I started with the pilot, and I immediately hooked it up. I rated it 5 stars on Amazon, and I am rating 10 stars here. It's fine. At the end of each episode, Stephen J. I like things like opening and closing the canons, but for everything, the relationship between the judge and the marks worked fractured on every occasion. I bought the second season as a companion, and I enjoyed it equally. If you do not have this amazing series on Drive, I hope you buy it and keep it in your collection.
