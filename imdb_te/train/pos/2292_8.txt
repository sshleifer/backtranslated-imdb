This earlier Bugs Bunny (the first time he was named here) and the third blog linked Elmer Fudd cartoon from YouTube. This is the voice that Chuck Jones directed for the very first time "Dissally Wobbit", and the Milk Blank is more than Brooklyn / Bronx. In fact, according to Thad, he is making Jimmy Stewart (the personality of his "cowardly boy" at the time). However, after Elmer purchased his pet, his owner repeatedly throws him out of his shower and says "stop those lights" when the radios run away from the radio realizing that all the bugs die. Elmer caught him in his bed. With a different voice, the bugs are definitely his mischievous self and I laughed at me all the blue time! According to Thad, Elmer eventually reached another spot on the bogs when he was passing through, as he was suffering from a mental breakdown at the time, so it would be cut off. Anyway, I highly recommend Elmer Pet Rabbit.
