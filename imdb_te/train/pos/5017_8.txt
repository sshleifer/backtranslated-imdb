I was 15 years old when this film was shown on television. I grew up in Texas, I understood that I was frustrated and changed my life to life. This film touched the teenage heart that reads my opinion and I have remembered with love for the past 12 years. I recently saw the 2nd, 3rd and 4th times thanks to the Love Channel. I'm still crying because my inner confusing young man touched me.
