Shortly after watching my third or fourth, I waited for the DVD while I was away from La Manmann et la Putine. In the meantime, I have read the French screenplay as well as the Monograph of Alain Philip in Jean-Ustachi. The next frustrating filmography, eleven films, fiction, doc and mid, mes pets amoureuses and le peare noel can not see ... look back. <BRr> Some of the questions that hit me this moment are: French French Polonica's most linguistic argument (very maximum d '"un max d'"). Still, does she have voice? I think I can tell her. What specifically adds to the lack of color in one place, can you see the edge of the city? How is this edge different from the sleep and travel that separates the world of Tempest and The Winters Tale? Tito Alphaville. We can imagine the expected years since we finished, but was Erzachi intentionally surrounding the surrounding area of ​​the film? Is it an enchanted isl? Alexander is a fantastic story? Alexander always keeps himself dancing, worrying about what to say when he declares, or whether or not, whether these decisions are less important than he did. Or what is his way of trying to drive others to do the same for himself? How was he different from Vertigo's Scotty? (I said, I think a lot.) What's the difference, and is it between Esther's Leid and Truffauts and Goddard? How different is the current lead? In recent roles, Irma Wape, Le Pornorighe, what was he still in old age, did he still do it? Once I came up with Antoine Dynol (Layay's character) one of the Trufft films. For a long time, every three or five minutes, with a nozzle nozzle down the bottom of the aisle, come in a twenty something female in the scarf, tweedy coat, Léaud hair. I do not know whether this is conscious or unconscious mimicry. I'm at that age, but I do not know what I saw. No scarf, at least. Although I am a brother, Besson seems to have learned his carriage.
