I rented Zero Day from the local video store last week. I never heard about the movie and my reservations about it. From looking at the box I realized that the movie is an indie and hence the quality is less than the main movie. <br /> <br /> When I ended up watching Zero Day, I started immediately. The film apparently followed the basic format of what happened in 1999's Columbine High School, but I was confident that the two main actors were reliable. My first time watching this movie was not entirely sure I was looking at the original tapes left behind shooters at Columbine. Behind my mind is that I'm not true but at the same time acting is persuading to have to keep giving your shake a shake I know what I'm watching. <br /> <br /> Do not disturb the image? Absolutely! Are you going to see the things that question the film merit? Maybe. I find many of the worst they really have feelings for the two main characters, Calvin and Andre (played by Call Robertson and Andrei Keck). Why do some people have trouble? Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre at their high school. I know for myself, Andre and Calvin I have a lot of trouble. I am empathetic to them because their lives come into such a horrific concept. They are in danger of stopping on the road, they are surrounded, and people around their neighborhood see their plight. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is an unusual image. It gives us a very close and personal look of events that events will only see until the end of events. It left thinking about the lives you were involved. And the people leaves you perplexed how to get this point. <br /> <br /> After a week of watching this movie, I still think about it. <br /> <br /> If you do not see Zero Day, remember the following: Comcasters will be shot and killed. The matter is in the picture. It is not the mainstream Hollywood and is not a happy ending. <br /> If you can put that side, Zero Day moves with you and helps you open your eyes a little.
