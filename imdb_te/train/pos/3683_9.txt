18 directors do the same: Tell love stories set in Paris. Naturally, some of them are better than others, but the whole mosaic is very beautiful - besides, is it not boring if all of them have the same vision of love? <br /> <br /> One of the great French actors has always directed my favorite piece and always looks fantastic in Zena Rowlands and Ben Gajjarra starred. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you are doing, 4. Alfonso Cuar√≥n ("You to Mama Tombin", "Children of Men"), "Pac Mansion", featuring Brothers + Steve Buscini. Nick Nolte and Ludwig Sognyer (funny); <br /> 5. "Place des Fates", Oliver Schmittz, Feet. Sedou Borough and Aisa Manga (touching); <br /> 6. "14th Aromatement", Alexander Pane's ("Electoral", "FM Smmt") is an amazing view towards the curiosity of life, feat. <br /> <br /> <br /> She is the mother of Hillary Swanck in the underwriter actress Margo Martineude ("million dollar baby"), a warm, middle-aged American woman; The frenzy style "Fuourg Saint-Denis", Tom Tycurs ("Run Lola Run") in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind man (Melchyl Baslan) fall in love; <br /> <br /> 8. "Pare-Lachise", by Wes Craven, feat. <br /> <p> <p> <p> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/ " <br /> <br /> "Quartier des Enfants Rouges", Oliver Aceous ("Clean"), a tragic story story. <br /> Always Maggie Gyllenhaal; "Le Marais", Gus Van Sant, Feet. <br /> <br /> Gasparard Allill, Elias McConnell and Marion Faithful (Simple but Funny); <br /> Vincenzo Natalie, featuring "Quartier de la Madeleine" by Feat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Des Victories ", Nobuhiro Suwava, is the feat. Juliet Binohe and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> "Basile", excellent illustration of Isabel Cockat (a wonderful director of My Life Without Me). <br /> <br /> Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Kamara and Leonar Watling <br /> <br /> "Pigley", Richard Lagovence, feat. <br /> <br /> Bob Hoskins and funny order; <br /> <br /> "Barfly", "Rivers of Fortune" and "Single White Female" Director Barbet Schroeder called Christopher Doyle, "Porta de Choisy". <br /> I think some sections are brilliant and others are average (or slightly irritable), but one of them is just too bad. Overall, I give "Paris, GT Aime" at 8.5 / 10, and I recommend it for: a lovely mosaic of love and other things.
