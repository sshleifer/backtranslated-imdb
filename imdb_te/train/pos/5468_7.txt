"Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck until I caught in TCM, was not restored or seeing any version for that matter. What a great picture! Lily lives in a practice briefly, and she has broken her father since she was 14 years old! Then he is still blowing up and Lilly (Stanwick) left, and she has done well with Tolesea Harris for Black Maid Chico. Lily decides to use sex to go up to the big city (New York). <br /> <br /> She attracts a pudgy clerk who has come to go through men like reckless candy and engage in the dungeon! A dump kills his fianc√© and his uncle, Lily's sugar-daddy, and commits suicide! Lily just blinks! <br /> In Paris, she falls to Korland, starring George Brent, who marries, but when she has deep financial straps, she bolts. With Chicco and nearly half a million, it's almost free, she learns that she loves the court! Lily is a species that she finds, but is she too late? <br /> <br /> It is best for Hollywood. Stanwyck is stunning and perfect for movie look and music. Those who believe in this romantic, love and power do not like any good baby force, are unloving ultra romantic leasing in movies, reminding me of another unfairly neglected film, an unnamed neglected woman with an innocent woman, I love it. Highly recommended! Look at it!
