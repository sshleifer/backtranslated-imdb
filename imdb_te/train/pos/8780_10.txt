This is one of the greatest sports films ever made by Hollywood. An amazing story about one of the greatest players in American history. James J. Mr. Corbett said that the story of Corbett is particularly interesting, and continues to date with the corbett boxing style. James J. Corbett was really unveiled in that respect. But getting back to the film, all the performances are fantastic. Alexis Smith is beautiful. In fact, she is like Nicole Kidman. And it describes story-time tests, even though it is a period of time; It's not old. John L. Sullivan's Ward Bond's characters are one of the greatest films of a realistic sports figure in the history of film and boxing scenes are realistic, well-presented and highly influential. This film is a must with a great script.
