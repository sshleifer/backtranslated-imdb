In three rebuilds of this theme, I like all of them, I have three to three in the VHS, and in addition to having this copy on DVD. There is enough variation in scripts to make all three fun and re-watchable. Also, in which other film did every three stars have been remade in the Stars? Of course these main actors are great, but the supporting actors are also amazing. I especially liked William Tracy as Peppy. He was such a scene stealer, and I found other films he had. He appeared in a number of people, but most people are not available. Other comments, I also say - buy this one.
