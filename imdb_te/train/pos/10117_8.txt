The story of a drifter, the shepherd's owner, and the owner's daughter is not for all tastes, but it is still very intriguing. <br /> <br /> It happens in a beautiful country in New Zealand, where we know well from other parts of the region from other films. <br /> <br /> In this movie I am a wonderful Mary Reagan, and I have been a fan of her since then. The actors have Bruno Lawrence, who will probably remember the American audience in the movie "Smash Palace". Terrence Cooper took a turn as some of Ranch's owner who was not aware of his daughter (Reagan). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ I have seen this movie in the most edited film on television tonight night in America, but you believe me.
