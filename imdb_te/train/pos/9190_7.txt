Two things were happening with the heavily injured Toni in the inspired coma: his family and friends were passing through hell while trying to deal with the loss of the big man, Tony promoted Salesman's life at a business meeting. The combination sequences came out of the old sweetest ZONE episode, since Tony converted himself into an average zoo trying to deal with Tony's missing bag and mixed-up identities in a cross-country business tour. A blazer and khaki-dressed skelek is an Italian thug from his synthesis Mid-American and Novo Joeye. A nice touch. Surprisingly long furry, hippy-dippy AJ (Paulie calls "Van Helsing" at one time) is a nice scene for his comical old man. The best moment is to have big boys trying to talk about life without tonny, which immediately breaks up a territorial dispute. Vito comes off a line about the new-dead Jean Maybe we have a room case, which is interesting about what light is about to learn about Vito.
