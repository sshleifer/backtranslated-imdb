The striking example of "cowboy noir" is what it calls, where unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses his job because he insists he should be honest (he has a bummer). He can not do anything else, he decides that he will once sleep. When he walked in a bar and his owner Wayne (late JT Walsh) Wayne employed his sexy younger wife Suzanne (Laura Flynn Boyle in good form) for the mischievous person, and Michael and Waynes accepted money. * Then go to Suzanne and inform her husband's intentions and accept her money to get rid of her! If it does not happen, the real hitman, "Dallas-to-Lail" (Dennis Hopper, in his perfect role for him), and Michael is in trouble more than ever. <br /> <br /> <br /> "Red Rock West" receives a lot from the locations. The director of his brother Ricco script co-writer John Dahl, a story in a typical small town, realized the possibility of seeing the good days and residency schemes. It's also an amusing idea to get into an honest person of the kind of trouble if they decided to cancel their principles and give any level of temptation. It's a dark and twist laden story with the classification of the main characters that are morally compromised, such as Michael, though not corrupt. Lighting is magnificent in its mood by cinematographer Mark Roshowski; The climax also set in a cemetery gives the whole thing a good morbidity. <br /> <br /> While writing is not "logical or reliable," the film is a good way to the romantic director and correctly illustrates them. <br /> <br /> Cage has a good job in the lead role, but his co-stars have a great old time drowning in their flesh and greedy-inspired roles. Hopper, Boyle, and Walsh are all fun to see in these areas. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shore Walsh's assistants (in a good twist, Walsh is also in the local sheriff) is also a character in the entertaining role for the country & Western actor Dwight Yogam, Tune. <br /> This is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It gains momentum at impressive speed, and nothing else is definitely not boring. <br /> <br />
