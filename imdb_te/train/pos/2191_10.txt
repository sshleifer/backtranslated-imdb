Shakespeare said we are acting as a great venue. But this phase is Israel's work that we multiplies for ten and we all work a hard style. Don Katzir managed to make a magnificent picture of life in Tel Aviv, but Catsyrer is spreading to the heart of the people of Israel and so far away from the general public, they speak from the heart. The KatyGir film allows Israel to run away from the dark informal crux that they live in, and this wonderful country emerges as a wonderful bird born out of his ash. Israeli reality, known only to information diaries or newspapers, can only be seen as human reality, because millions of realities that are looking for his location, the whole exploration of the state, the whole culture aims only to feel part of it. Katzir builds a wonderful documentary and when he portrays a person with love, deep feelings are predicted by power, and these feelings cross our hearts. Thanks to Dan for opening our eyes and let us give you the most beautiful pictures of the world's most wonderful countries.
