I'm really enjoying movies like "Choss Are," but for some reason I was very satisfied. The first half was pretty familiar, Alex Finch was dead and reincarnated in a new body (in the role of Robert Downey Jr.). He meets his wife (Cybill Shepard) and friend (Ryan O'Neil) and his daughter, who is now growing up. The scenes that accompany them again meet again, once he did well, and shepard finally had an emotion and a cheerful good overall, believing that her husband was finally reincarnated. Several sex-related scenes were completely eliminated, especially with Donne and Shepard, who wanted to stay together despite their age. After that, the film will look at the conditions of the plot, making it as satisfying as possible. I did not expect the movie to be immortal, because I was disappointed. This story has great potential, and scenes in heaven are well. Peter Cetera and Cher has a good theme song, but ultimately the film is not great. For a better, similar image, try "Heaven Can Weight". <br /> <br /> I really wanted to see the scenes in the second half but in the second half. <br /> <br />
