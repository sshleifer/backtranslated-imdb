For the first time I have never seen a television fan for 24 hours. I got too late in the series. Season 5 ended before I saw my first episode. The episode of Series 3 in my parent's DVR (Digital Video Recorder) box when I sit on the weekend. It took me an episode for the hook line and sinks of Jack Bauer's world. And the boy I was hooked !! I watched the next six episodes without a single eye shining. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited monthly pass for twenty-something dollars and it is unnecessary that I have the greatest blockbuster money I spent. I saw the first three seasons in three weeks. It's 72 forty minutes episodes! If I know what's going on, it will be easier on the DVD while waiting for the whole week. I can only imagine anticipation of watching Season 6 week week! I gently get tortured and brutal but I'm going to try and just look like the rest of America !! Set the DVR and you can bet you'll be chomping at the bit!
