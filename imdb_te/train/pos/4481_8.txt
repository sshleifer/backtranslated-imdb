The film is due to give 8/10 stars, and not 10, because 1) Sinatra is awful and 2) kelly leaves the girlfriend's favorite (IMHO). Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - al, young boy. Dancing sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and exciting dance scenes I have ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still mine and mine's personal favorite. I am 28 years old and she is 4, so less iconic than Mickey, he is still very much a favorite of many children and adults today. Kelly is always attractive, his eyes are full of fun and enthusiasm. In every picture I have ever seen him, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. It is wonderfully the motions of Paula Abdul "Sample" Kelly. I will also list Jean Kelly as one of the most beautiful figures of the 20th century. If you want to see only a piece, do not miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will not be disappointed.
