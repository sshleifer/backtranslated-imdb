Barbara Stanwick directed this early Douglas Circk, and requires a universal-producing soap kick. Circl is not as memorable as the next melodramas, but it's easy to see Cirk look at the artistically-driven "All Eye Desire" over the next few years. Stanwick is a young boy who left them a decade ago, a show girl who returned to her family in the U.S.A. Her family and society have mixed emotions in her frightening rewriting. Cinematography is some amazing, and Stanwyck gives tough-like nails and really the power shot of this film. Overall, good performance.
