Tench was imprisoned and sentenced to death. When he ceases electromagnetism, government officials choose to be the most electroductor or accept some applications. He chooses the experiment and is placed in a large metallic particle with a garbage donkey crimson, which also eliminates the electrocution. They have anything in the room (within reason), but they can not go. Some days later the meal is deducted for one day and the room is temporarily 100. Some alarms can fall asleep because they fall during intervals. One day a 'witch' will fall into their cell (though a glass off part) what happens next is I let you find out. I'm in a minority here, but I like that I've built, it's witty to me. <br /> <br /> Media Blaster's 2 DVD Set Extras: Disc 1) Directors Cut; "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack the Gas Station" and "Deadly Outlock Reka" trailers for Drive 2) Theatrical cut; Hydeo Sakki, Reuhii Kimuraura, Zagugi Takun Tsunamu Takahashi commentary; Cast and crew interviews; Manufacturing Original trailer; And promo teasers
