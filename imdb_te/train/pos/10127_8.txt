This is all in the beginning! Of course, friends are not their best, but it's a pilot of the show, do not forget and that's not that bad. We are introducing a gang and central perk to our story. When Ross says, "I want to get married again" and Rachel Storms with a bridal outfit ... writers are not intentional while going for a Monica-Joey relationship but it's just fine when looking back. If Rachel does not always meet in two episodes in this episode, Rachel is introduced in the next episodes that are not known as 'flashbacks' in the last three cases. However, this position is good in a great event. In this episode we may not be common friends when they are familiar with them, but the cast is still to be experienced, but we see why it happens in some of the next episodes! Keep watching, the first season is a blast !!
