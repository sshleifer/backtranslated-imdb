If you're a fan, you probably enjoy it. If you do not know Missy Munde, Daryan Coin, Ruby Laaroca, or Seduction Movies, the movie will not be launched. It's very beautiful, crazy, the girls are hot, and it's fun watching it. There is no sex until the 45-minute film ends, but the cheesy-trippy and the plot is not a whole bore. Missy Munday's makeup is very painful in the film and her hair is in the awkward skull, so she is not as hot as anyone else. But in this her panties are very beautiful (you just have to look at the movie that does not really sound weird). If you like it, "maybe that 70 girl", "vampire waxes", or "erotic survivor" (this is a bit more sexually graphic). If you want to see Misty or Esmeralda in less sexy, more horror / extortion-based (but less budget) movies, see Factory 2000 website.
