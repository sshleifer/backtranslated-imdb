The film is best described or compared to "Big Fish" (the image of Tim Burton). But you face the lower face and the more you face the story. <br /> <br /> The story moves back and forth (so the story in the IMDb is more than you like it before reading the movie). It's funny and engaging enough, even if you come from one story to another and have some dramatic movements. It's a surprise to you and there, things you did not expect. Then a nice little picture, deserves your attention, especially if you like movies like that! : O)
