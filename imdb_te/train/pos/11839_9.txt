The film is highly entertaining. Soundtrack (Bean Adams) is just beautiful and exciting. Brian Adams is also doing all the songs in French. <br/> <br /> <br /> The film is made up of a mixture of traditional animation, which is composed of computer-generated images. The result is really amazing. I watch this movie with my kids at least once a week and we will never see its tire. <br /> <br /> I can not understand those who are less than 7 this film. My keeper is definitely a keeper.
