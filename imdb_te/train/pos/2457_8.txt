When you are dark or frustrated, go watch this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting, and it is very encouraging from a feminist and manual perspective. <br /> <br /> You go to watch the Turkish language and Danish or German language, in any case the movie. In the original Danish version of the Danish half of the dialogue was synchronized to the German in the translated version, the remaining half Turkish, subtitled in Danish or German. When I viewed in Mannheim in Germany, the Turkish-speaking audience's reaction proved to be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialogue, which was disappointingly overwhelmed by me, only in subtitled. And yet, even if you do not know Turkish, this film is interesting. <br /> <br /> Estastically, this film plays a lot about speed and slowness. In the first scene, physical lightning in the lightning is very fast, it becomes a quick, alarming picture. In particular, it's pretty keen to see scenes running, even though the Kung Fu movie. But there are very slow and emotional scenes. And for all, the characters are about to come of age and develop at a much lower pace than you would expect in play; Also, there are a few moments in the characters: see the closest part of the villain Omar, the part and the acting I loved so much. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the same characters are shown simultaneously - human anger and respect in contrast to speed and silence.
