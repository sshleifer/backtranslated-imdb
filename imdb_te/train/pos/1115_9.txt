This is one of those unfortunate films that suffer from more sad and unfortunate death at the box office. In the local art cinema, I saw in the form of restoration, shortly after the death of major films. It definitely deserves to meet the second time (or a third). Sandra B. limits the limit by taking some well-known songs from this part (Hanc Williams' version of 'I Am So Lonom I Can Cry' can easily move to Tears). Perhaps some day audiences are ready to take this film a bit more seriously (but without some laughing laugh). The film moves at an active pace (thanks to some nice editing), so some viewers do not notice it as old and boring. Maybe renewal just pipeline down.
