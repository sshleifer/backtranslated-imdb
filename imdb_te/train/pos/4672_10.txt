I saw Brother Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and enjoyed it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from his family in Brooklyn, parallel to Alexa. He is dead because his brother has died, and his brother's wife and his baby's family and his father's family slowly repair his relationship with his father, who has never forgiven him for the black sheep. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to understand the complexity of their lives more deeply. In addition, images related to timber business and the background of Brooklyn have been placed in this wealthy and exposed family diagram.
