This great great movie, with some great plot twists and amazing performances, is very unique, and creative! All the characters are great, and the story is bizarre, lovely and very interesting, plus Nicole Kidman this is simply amazing !. This movie is very hard to explain, it's a joke / romance, it turns into a thriller the next, but it still turns out to be the same, and Nicole's Russian accent is amazing, and very convincing. Chaplin and Kidman have a very good chemistry, and I liked Vincent Cassell's performance! Plus the plot turns some really surprised me! The ending is very beautiful, and it's unpredictable all over! Plus, this film is very much underestimated! You'll feel sorry for Chaplin and he's scammed way, and I have all the characters really like, plus the ending is particularly good.It's Nicole's image though, and she carries with her incredible sexy appearance! This great great movie, very unique, and creative, some great plot turns and amazing performances !, I highly recommend this one! The direction is great! Jez Butterworth does a very good job here with great camera work, solid angles and placing the image at a fast pace! Acting is amazing! Nicole Kidman is amazing, and is always amazing, she has a very sexy, very fond of, one of the coolest tunes, a lot of presence, having a very good chemistry with Ben Chaplin, and has a very mysterious character! , She is amazing. (Kidman Rules !!!!). Ben Chaplin was great, he was very fond of, he had a cool role, Kidman had a very good chemistry, and I did not want her to get rid of Kidman, but she made it wrong and I loved how bad he was at the end! Vincent Cassell, the main villain, yes he is OTT, but he looks incredible at very intense and very creepy, this character is perfect for him. Matthew Cassowitz is right here, but not much to do. The rest of the cast is good. Overall I highly recommend this one! *** 1/2 in 5
