This film has everything. Play scenes, words and verses. This is a rag tag group of a diverse cultural and social group that came together to defeat an ordinary enemy. If you see more than this, you will find that you are quoting the Animal House (and yes I also love the Animal House). I've put in the top 15 funniest movies. In the boys' military academy Major wants to make every child a bad and disturbing (he is right in the film). He is difficult, relentless, cruel, and removed. A group of guys who are not put together at first could end up in the squad together for survival and could only get rid of Major with an absurd plan could not have been written by Mad Magazine. A must see - you will love it!
