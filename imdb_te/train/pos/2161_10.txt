Would many of us want to throw away the social and cultural responsibilities and be free? Most of us, I suspect. Do we dance? The film is not about the dance. It's learning about what we're looking for in life and daringly going for its search. Mr. Sugiyama Ballroom Dancing is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society that is considered an inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> One day, Mr. Sugiyama Dancing Academy sees a beautiful girl coming out of the window. He attracts her and eventually signs up for dance lessons. He fears his dancing and ridicule. <br /> <br /> He hid the fact that he was attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family. <br /> <br /> There is a lively scene in the office dining room, Sugiyama and Vatanabe, dances and dances. <br /> <br /> It's a little better and more valuable movie to watch.
