<br /> I do not have to say I'm Portuguese. Watching Portuguese movies is not my time. A nationalized idea among the Portuguese people, the nationalities are terrible and are close to what they've done so far! However, in the last decade, "Leo da Estella" and "Costa do Castello" are the best of their time, "Pulaska Zero" or "Sartay Nala" from Fernando Fragata, director of Fernando Fragata and some of the actors and music. <br /> <br /> It's not the same kind because it's not a good comedy, in fact it's officially drama, a woman's play, some unexpected funny episodes, funny characters or the hilarious things that happen to them, the predictability of the Caribbean to get laid just. <br /> Work on the plots and make us a few times surprise; The actors are fine, positions like the score are gradual; But the truth is that it all makes sense, then we can consider it as a nice attempt to national cinema, starting from the Ashes as Phoenix. <br /> If you want to see a Portuguese movie, you can get a good option, but it is measured.
