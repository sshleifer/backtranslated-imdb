I quickly mentioned things in this film: It's a very dark story about the devastating qualities of a common hobby. A young Italian lady who is not mentally unfriendly with the younger-looking political young people (in accordance with his anarchist attitudes and the freedom of life) finds a lonely and passion in a new young girlfriend. Anxious silence is the same that concerns agitation, tension, sensitivity and moves in the surrounding environment. It gives an uncettling mood that is stretched through all political strife of the movie film viewer (unless you have deep sense of Italian politics during the 80's). The film is constructive ... The actress is a grateful oral sex scene that drives the actress ... It's not a simulation and less of the imagination. There are also other sequences of sex in the film because I thought about the madness and loneliness of the characters, but the oral sex scene removes attention on the realistic story. It was a soft sailing up to that point and once found the infamous romantic scene (which had a lot of hoppag in the long run), which was a hitting roadblock. It's jarring and unnecessary and I'm in the camp that is not harming the film if removed from that scene. And what's unfortunate This particular scene may deter people from looking at this mysterious picture, which I believe is worth a view because it's going on a lot under the more crises of layers in the surface, emotions and subtxt. Overall: Wonderful film was hit by a sexually explicit scene.
