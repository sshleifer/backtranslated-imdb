Charlie Kaufman's own self-joy comes with a film that is three times embarrassing for the confusing worst year, such as "Sinekodo, New York". "Frownland" is the love of love by friends, painters and filmmakers. It recognized the person who could not communicate through his entirely authentic, REAL Brooklyn world. The people you see are step beyond the styling of the "mumborgo" movement. They are real people, who are trapped in their own self-contained nerves, and do not like to change or change. They have their own illusions in the real world and it's a movie about people who are very rarely from touch, because it's very hard to see. It can not be a poor 16mm film-making, but its honesty can not be understood without any other factors that are "soft" to the right light, money or film, and it will cause people to finish it and Richard's entire room to give it a prize as he did in SXSW. It remembers the finest images like "Naked" or "mumbcore". It's not an image for everyone, but if you think about it you're no longer challenging to see and a challenge.
