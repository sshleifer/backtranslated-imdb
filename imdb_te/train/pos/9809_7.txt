Randolph Scott goes to Albuquerque to get a job with his uncle. However, on the way there, the stage is up - even if they are not carrying a strong box. However, a nice woman on the board has hidden $ 10,000 for her and her brother's business ... and thieves get to know this. <br /> Once in town, Scott goes to this uncle's job. However, he immediately finds that this uncle is a jerk - a normal bad guy from Western. Do you know a great man who wants to be wealthy as long as he has everything by deceiving and stealing and threatening? And, it just happens that this jerk is behind the exploitation. Scott demands the uncle to return money, and then Scott goes into business with the nice lady and her brother. <br /> Surprisingly, it's not the end of the issues --- just start. Again and again, different kinds of conspiracies try to push the opposite of the uncle. A trick to bring a nice woman to keep Scott and his friends friendly. <br /> <br /> Unlike her romantulph Scott films, Scott shows a bit more Headstrong Man. He is ultimately the most likely to refer to torture in his movies, but in this film he has a lyning (kills the law, let's have a handbag) and he quickly works quickly to threaten his uncle. <br /> <br /> There is nothing particularly exceptional until the movie goes. It is. Gabby Hayes plays a normal role, Scott is a hero, baddie reason and ultimately destroys and Scott girl can not get. Despite this distinctive plot, it is very well maintained and the result is well worth your time. <br /> <br /> There are two strange scenes in the film. First and foremost, Scott and uncle # 1 Bone, Lone Chaney, Jr. have a fist fight. It sounds Chaney, in the fight - I never seen before and I did not admire how he puff away he got his bat kicked away. Secondly, load the runaway cart scene with Wip - now an impossible feat!
