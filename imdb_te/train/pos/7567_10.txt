A spectacular picture showing cross currents in the lives of a multi-ethnic blend of common people in rural Pacific Northwest. Solid direction and writing are good performances, particularly through performances from Qami Taha and Don Stowe. Interestingly, the film was the most successful "crash," written and directed by Paul Haggis in the same year. The speed of this action may not be as frantic as in urban Los Angeles, and the characters are more familiar with each other than "rather than it", but the personal relationships of the characters are flawed and troublesome and echo tales like everything in their "crush". This film must be viewed by those viewers who appreciated "crash". In addition, fans of Jim Jurasses and John Cassaveves prefer this film.
