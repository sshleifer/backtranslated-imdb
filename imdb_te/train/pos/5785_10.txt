While reading through comments left for this presentation, I can not help but notice that a large number of reviewers have not seen episodes of their own free will either through their own free will. The thing about krishing! It's so obvious that your child is older, it's cheesy, forced, and probably looks stupid. I also found a man that was stupid of the sets, but I remember a eight year old wondering why the Taj park mold on the wall of the ikea ice, and also wondering if my parents were able to stick some mine (they were not). Yes, it may be annoying, acting may be good and some characters do strange things with their hair, but when I show children, I rate 10/10. Today is enough to compare them to the air in their place, and I think I'll be back. DVD release, anyone?
