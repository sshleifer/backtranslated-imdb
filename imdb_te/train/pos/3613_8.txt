When "Girlfight" arrived, reviews praised it, but I did not come around to see. <br /> <br /> When this film is released on video and understood glowing reviews, <br /> <br /> The film opens in high school in the middle of the ghetto. We will soon get acquainted with the student Diana Guzman (Michael Rodriguez). She has a bad-donation expression on her face, we can receive from this expression of any kind of Diana, which soon strengthens her when she comes into battle. As Diana comes into trouble in this, we take care of his father, an aggressive type of his own right; <br /> <br /> In this movie, the film is really a new idea in the mind of Diana: boxing is the way to escape this horrible existence. Her older brother has already come into boxing, but her father is not much accepted. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do. <br /> <br /> My first two minutes have been confirmed that I am in a very sunny, Hollywood movie. Before you face boxing scenes, you feel like you are in the face when you see the bizarre life of Diana's life. <br /> When they eventually reach the main story of the film, they can not come back. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this film. I have shown bactering for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby") as a clich in the movie, but I have a great job here as I try to do something to myself. In fact, this brought the genre to its peak. Very good. Michelle Rodriguez is worried that she later destroyed her in Hollywood films.
