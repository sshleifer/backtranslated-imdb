I love the Michael Landon junior movies. It is not good to play Dale Midkiff's "Clark Davis" by Michael Landon Jr's. Doll Midkiff has ways to pull off this role. <br /> <br /> This film has been mixed with me from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Missy & Willis's baby girl Clarks visit is only God's time visit. <br /> Despite the three previous films [Love Comes Softy, Love Enduring Promise & Loves Long Journey], I feel I can see and understand this movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Lanson Jr. is a wonderful director <br /> <br /> I have more movies from him in the future.
