I saw some "speed racer", but I did not really see it and some of the characters wearing the birds on the ship called Phoenix and the other was a revolving ship around a spaceship that looked like a big ocean and it sometimes went back for some reason and for five It is really dark and difficult to understand. I saw almost every episode and it was a bit shocking at the time, though I was surprised at that time. It's actually out there, unlike bad guys almost every American cartoon, no one really ends up with a new Transformers last episode of the generation that ended with this new bad guy to get the Galvatran and Autobots, where the Dungeons and Dragons ever have kids with GIJ with Cobra Together at home and try again ID is ready. This made a conclusion and the program had developed new weapons that got rather cool robot, it was a bit bland to start as it could not fly and had some really cool weapons. When it went, he had a cool shooting fist like an Android 16 that was used against the cell in DragonBall Z, then the weapon had emerged to include baked racers. Then a large robot also grabbed the wings, he could fly and added more weapons to the wings. He also gets a couple of allies in a male robot and a funny one rather than Bobo in America. The villains are Dr. Hel, but half a man is half-man and a dude with a flying head is a really weird person. Show interesting and it's nice to see a kind of resolution.
