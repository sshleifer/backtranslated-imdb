Thanks again from the darkness. The spectacular photography highlights this Disney documentary and provides some of the episodes in the chaos of animals that live in the wild. Over 40 years, Disney and the Omaha Wild Kingdom have provided lots of insights into wild animals from our childhood ... again there is no channel dedicated to National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet. It is always interesting to know how difficult it is for many of these lovely people. The use of elephants for days is almost imposing from the lack of water and very painful. But thrilling the nightly struggle against the lions. <br /> <br /> Some of the underwater shots are exciting. Mama and baby humpbacks Every bit of chilling as its food "jaws" looking pretty white and white shark attack. The most spectacular scenery for me is the breathtaking views of the Himalayas. <br /> <br /> Do not assume that most young children today are very happy, but this is one of the most beautifully documented documentaries. Never seen.
