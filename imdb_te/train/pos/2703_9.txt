I'm not a huge fan of camp kitch, "good looks good" type of view. <br /> <br /> I love the fun factor for this movie - it is believed or not - it's innovation. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is that John Waters' s Ring is an infinite enthusiasm, but produces directions and stylized moves with some amazing actors. Billy Jane moves with incredible expression (see the scene in the bus for a text-book lesson on how to use the movement) and some unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the movie, if you get the chance to see it, you will end up with a confused smile on your face and end up with a new perspective with some big actors' humor. Most excited.
