Dominion Tank Police is without a doubt the shell of one, one of the most spectacular performances ever built, but not just in the animated field. The first part (Acts 1 and 2) is more fun and fun, the second part is more intense and the second is not considered the second part as the first part. The subtleties are really out of this world and the character is very intelligent. You have extra intelligence to appreciate the instincts of the second part (Acts 3 and 4). I have some complaints. In the first half, the tank bonaparte literally jumps over the tank shell and did not make any sense of it. Bonaparte jumping on the wing of the helicopter guns is also good, although one may question. The rules of the book.
