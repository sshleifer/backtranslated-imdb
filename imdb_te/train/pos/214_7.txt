Willy Clark (Walter Mottau) and Alvaris (George Burns)'s old Vandeville Team are one of the best but they hate each other. 20 years later they agree to get together for a TV special ... but they still find each other hateful. Willie's nephew / agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to work with them. <br /> <br /> A huge hit in its day and George Burns won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I (somewhat) liked it. Neil Simon was written by its non-stop one-liner. It's funny but not doing jokes of senility of Willie and Al. I did not like Matho. I never thought he was a good actor and something about him rubbed me the wrong way. His role here is very dangerous. That was as fun as that. Burns is easily great tossing off a leaner and even matthau is good for him. Their sound wars are the best sequences in the film. Benjamin is good because Willy's nephew attempts to work together. For me it was only worth seeing for Burns. The jump started his career in a big way, and two years later he hit again with "Oh God". So it's fine. Only good - not great. Mathou's character really loves this difficulty. I will give 7.
