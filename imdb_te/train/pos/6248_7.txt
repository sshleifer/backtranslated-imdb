An Austrian myself this is a straight knock in my face. Fortunately, I do not live anywhere in the place where this film is, but unfortunately, it describes the Viennese people (or the people close to the area) of Austria. And this is absolutely easy to read that is exactly what the directors intend: Your head is overwhelmed in your hands and "Oh my God, how feasible!" To say that. No, not in me (in my opinion) absolutely exaggerated swinger club scene is not necessary, I'm obscene, but in this setting I am frustrating than putting it in the right context. <br /> <br /> How does the film revolve people suffering from a lack of education or bad company and explains the story about trying to live in the reproductive and boring horizons world. A girl who deals with herself as a prostitute by her super-jealous boyfriend (and still returns), a female teacher who recognizes her masochixes, her super-brutal "lover" line, a couple nearly mathematical daily cycle (she is the "official replacement" of her ex-wife) ), With the twin divorced couple and ex-husband perfectly under his masks the actions of his ex-wife And finally she was a crazy hichaikar mbandham drivers have outstanding questions, and the super-embarrassing podigincukuntundi their nerves. <br /> When you see it, you are almost nothing. You're also surprised, sad, depressed or do not want to do anything ... Perhaps I gave 7 points, I did not react as I responded before. If it's good or bad for you!
