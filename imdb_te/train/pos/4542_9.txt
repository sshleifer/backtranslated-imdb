I concentrated on Detroit's downtown and out skirts, and I found this humor a wonderful new comedian. 'Norikki Pat Morita' is a renowned man who acts as a cop of Japanese stealth stolen pirates who steal a turbo-type turbo super charger, while reluctantly following his commander's command to the United States. Pat's character 'Jay Leno's character', is fast-talking, but down to business-player Detroit Cop. Despite their ways, Japan's honorable 'Ways' meets all old school Detroit Police 'Ways' research. Both of them first encroach on each other and tour, but then develop a 'rythym', an explosion turns into a two layered powerhouse group, that solves the case, cool. Battling with a city crime boss for stealing 'preparations', after closing the case, losing both the two friends and working together. A little less for the costume and it requires an extended vacation on top of all, they manage to come to a win finish. I rated this one 9. Lewis directed 'It makes a perfect comedy. Entertainment for all ages. I would highly recommend it. (***)
