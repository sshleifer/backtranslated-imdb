Perhaps the first Portuguese film I've seen in my life, I enjoyed it. In 1974, young soldiers took power in Portugal, eventually defeating the fascist government of Caetano and taking the colonies, Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissa) - Cape Verdes. The many incidents shown in the film are a subtle way of the most conservative officers, including the new development and freedom of the men, Keteno's men's resistance, and the spinola appointed by the new president to revolve the behavior of the army officers and soldiers. The Portuguese Revolution may be reminiscent of the actions of many young officers, but Portugal has suggested that a very interesting part of Portugal should be democratically developed as Portugal, and the country or revolution that has taken a few years after the coup. The film also did not want to kill any army officers and soldiers. In the end, very serious enemies are respected.
