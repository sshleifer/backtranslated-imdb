Full Moon High (1981) 3 in 5 Dor: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Orkin, Ed McMahon, Rose Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is your average general high school guy. Big upcoming game in strange places, sweetheart and preparing for rising hair ?? But with his father (YES! McMahon), the transylvania tour comes out of control of the hair in strange places when he leaves him with a bad case of fibers. <br /> <br /> 'Full full moon hi' is not talking about often but it is a crazy and entertaining horror satire. Larry Cohen (Q Winged Serpent, The Stuff) was very goggling to be a writer / director. Archin (H20: Halloween, 20 Years Later) shows good time in the lead role. If you're a fan of spoofs like 'Airplane' and 'Student Bodies', I'll be happy with this chuck-fest.
