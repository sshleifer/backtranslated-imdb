This film should be a classic. This is not accurate. Being perfect on stage, filmed with orthopedic knees in tissue form. Jean Seberg is very sweet and very sensitive. She is a full-fledged performer, full of talented and talented, intelligent, emotional, and confident zone character, but, unfortunately, the director lost a piece of character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. His dialogue is more sharper in any other play, or more musical shields. However, to process this image you need to see that it is a lawyer. The film is the case, and the director is the judge. How is this picture enjoyed? 7/10.
