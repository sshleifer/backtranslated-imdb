This miracle of a movie is one of those films that have a lasting and long-term effect on you. Republicans or child beaters will read a review or two from the angry people I predicted, and their terrorist comments talk about the power of films to face people with their own dark secrets. Such a piece of art is always in front of me with laughter and tears and the miracle of that movie. The reality of the film and the function of Bret Car should not be missed. It's almost the most influential nature of the nature, causing people to leave the theater or to question their very identity. Bravo at the next level of the film.
