HLOTS is a fantastic series, its NYPD Blue never existed, the plot in HLOTS is true, the dialogue is real, Relationships Real. The HLOTS is back as a film, all the loose ends up, all the gang is better to reunite, some performances (how can not) the storyline came out in week and week this week, with the fast, emotional and spirit filled story. Homeside, Life on the Streets, Network Drama at Em BEST !!!! 5 stars !!!! Look good and that's all. Thank you NBC did not come to give us last!
