A great picture. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are awesome, the dances, the special mention of "portobello ballet", are gorgeous. Regarding the animated section, the match between animals became an instant classic; Climax chilling and lovely with the attack of the Army. I recommend to see a restored 134 minute version or at least 112 minutes of video. In Italy we have only a 98-minute version, yet the film was originally released in 117 minutes. If possible, watch the German video cassette: It's made up to 98 minutes, but not every scenario between every second World War and the English people and their Nazi invaders!
