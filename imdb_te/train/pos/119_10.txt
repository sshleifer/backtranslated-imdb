One of the best ways to describe Europa in my favorite films list is that it's a surprise from a companion after the film: "I do not know if I can do that." It's completely original in visual style, which is the best example of the film. It can get away from the "Master and Coverage" away from the shooting; Correctly image, sound, effects, clues, dialogue, voice over, performance, compilation, lighting, etc ... all the same, none are important. Although Hollywood's "dialogue" is short, it is not about movie dialogue, not about lighting, action or music. It works best when it comes to all elements with equal elements, just blending of those items, they are delivered in order or combination, communicating this idea. Reduce or remove the contribution of an element, and the film does not understand. "Europa" should work hard.
