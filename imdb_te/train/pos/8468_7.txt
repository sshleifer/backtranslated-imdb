It is surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of repentance in terms of discouragement. There's a lot to have 74 minutes run time, but it works. Concerns are very subtle, and recent Asian horror films are not the jump-cut scares that are densely populated. The "Frightened" way is similar to the unsettling moments in "The Uninvited" (4 Inyong Shiktak directed by Su-Leon Lee), but this is not nearly the same skill. The film makes a good job of balancing a classic ghost story with something more unusual and emotional. It's not perfect, but it does what it's supposed to do. If you get an opportunity, I would recommend it to check it.
