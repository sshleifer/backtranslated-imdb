One of my favorite films I saw in the preview in Seattle. Tom Hulse is amazing, with words out of which can express his feelings / thoughts. I actually donate some money to help Mike Ferrell deliver. It's nice. The system says I need more lines but do not give away the plot stuff. I'm in the audience at Seattle with Hulu and the director, the writer I think and Mike Ferrell. They woke up after an hour. Not really a dry eye at home. I do not know why Hollywood is stupid? (Actually I know, it's our fault, what we see) Get the best you guys have to pay for. Get it and see it exclusively. It's a gem.
