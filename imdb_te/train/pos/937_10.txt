When it was initially broadcast in 1984, my wife and I recorded in our first VHS recorder. I still have aging tape, I try to watch it annually. It was the year of birth of my first child, and this Christmas brings in happy moments of happy times seeing a Christmas Carol in the incarnation - it has been spent with playing the background for many hours. Finally, I failed this year and ordered a DVD that inspired me to take a moment to write this brief reaction. The story of Charles Dickens is here in the best style. George C. Scott is absolutely fantastic and completely reliable screw. The supporting cast is equally amazing. This, in my mind, is a flawless product. Add a lot of joy to the smallest detail. The nephew of the "Similes" Scout and the wife is good enough to play with their party guests. (I've created back with my high school English students after a brief respite from the job job!) Honestly, I can think of some ways to entertain me over the holidays to enjoy more than I'm getting involved in this CBS product. It is actually sponsored by IBM. (Incidentally, it's fun to see the old tape with real IBM commercials ... it shows how computers emerged in 21 years). Bottom Line: A Christmas Carol story, and composition is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... And God bless each of us!
