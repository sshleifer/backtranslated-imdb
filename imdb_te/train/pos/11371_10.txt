This is a great feature of the film. Liptentent Victor Burkov (Stephan Ria) I was initially tied to the story (true) when I was posting autopsy on baby's remains. It is a fantastic story of Andrei Chakata, featuring Jeffrey Damon (The Green Mile). In fact, when he plays it well, the audience starts to forgive him almost until he remembers what he does. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexander Buchanowski is absolutely confident in every detail of Max Van Sidov and his position as a speaker about the psychological disorder in the Soviet Union, local communist commissioner Bondarchuk Jose Auckland. Despite me, Donald has been the best performer from Sudhirl, he has indeed proved to be a fantastic actor once again. I told Burakov how he felt very close to the FBI and his work and I was almost in tears. The film has transformed The Lambs in silence, from the atmospheric and gray Soviet landscape to the greatest performances of everyone involved. <br /> <br /> I would rate this film 10/10 rate
