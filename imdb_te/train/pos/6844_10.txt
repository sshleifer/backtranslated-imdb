"Dressed to Kill" is a full thrill ride of Brian Depalma's best film, Suspense, Humor and Style, which is unreliable today. DePalma is a bum rap in Hollywood, and many people claim that he has rejected Alfred Hitchcock. He is not. <br /> <br /> Sadly, the original pruning version of "Dried to Kill" is no longer available in the video. The current copy released by GoodTimes Jack Valli approved R Rate cut. But there are still some copies of DePalma's original cut. It was covered by Warner Home Video, which was distributed in a black clamshell case with a green cardboard box on the cover or a theater poster in silver lining. If you find a copy, you will get them. <br /> <br /> Go back to the story again. Dickinson plays Kate Miller, a sexually-weird wife who treats her innocent fairy tales by Dr. Robert Eliot (Michael Caine). When the museum is on tour (a true tour-power for camera work and suspense). <br /> The miller is a stranger. You can predict what happened to her, because the advertisements and the box art story. But there are some problems. The only witness to the killing of Hooker (Nancy Allen). Kate Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) is a young intellectual who has decided to deal with crime. And Dr. Eliot's reply machine has a specific message on it ... about the missing knife ... <br /> <br /> I do not abuse all of the movie since I explained above the initial half an hour and the biggest shock of DePaluma were allocated to the last hour . Nevertheless, the film is sufficient to demand cuts (head of the MPAA). He's the cuts he wonders for me. Several cuts in early shower scenes and one or two slashing scenes and some of the dialogue of Nancy Allen (the valentine "cock" was "gobble"). This is a very violent and bloody movie, although objections are a sexual matter. I'd like to hear the explanation of Wiley as it's more damaging to a younger mind than two women in the tender love scene in "Lost and Deliras" waving with Arnold Schwarzenegger chain gun. <br /> <br /> "Credit to Kill" is not only the technically the first rate, but the performances are great. Michael Caine, who is in the worst at this time, is one of his best performances as a doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, perhaps here she has a strong role. Nancy Allen added to the series of her performances, which is considered one of the world's least undervalued and neglected actresses. <br /> <br /> Keith Gordon was intellectually intelligent and I liked all his innovations. <br /> <br /> Depamma is one of the never-to-be-recognized directors of our time. The latest joke in the AFI 100 Best Thriller list is that few people know what's the thriller. In fact, once their eyes open, they see that Dappla is a really good worker in his career. It's better than "Psycho". <br /> <br /> This is a very insulting 4 star
