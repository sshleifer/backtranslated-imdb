The film is not very good in Greece, good actors, great script and good photo is not the "blockbuster" in my country. The film is also very powerful, when a newcomer returns to his home village when he is released from prison for five years. Keep his part and he manages it pretty well ... Lambropoulou is a great and very sexy way in a strange way and of course Hatzisavvas fairy is once again ... 7 out of 10 very similar to some Greek movies!
