Theodore Rex is a great cinematic experience of all time, absolutely a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression! In this compelling intellectual work, Jonathan R. Betel is the great filmmakers of the 20th century, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Orson Wells and Roman Polanski. Special effects are less than breathtaking and do any work through the Spielberg look trail and elementary. At the time of release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that raised film production to levels that were never expected by filmmakers. Dinosaurs are not a movie, but packed with action, we know humanity as a "talking" dinosaur with a post-modern name like "Theodore", a companion of dinosaurs and an anonymous female police officer. The world will never be there after experiencing such aesthetics. Theodore Rex looked at the face of God and said, "You are my dear creation." It's just one of the few movies to dear!
