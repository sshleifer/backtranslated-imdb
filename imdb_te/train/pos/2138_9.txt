The film revolves around Japanese culture, which makes the lives of a modern Japanese family. Even if you are close friends / relatives for more than 7 (especially for people), you are more boring than hugging. Ballroom dancing will ring your hands around and be in public! Low Ballroom Dance is not very popular. People in ballroom dancing in Japan see a bit like riders on the west ... many want to do more, but are resisted by culture. The happy family film that any amateur dancer will enjoy alone in the dance sequences. I understand that it is more popular in Titanic than in Japan. I guess Japan will look like the rest of us - they want to huggle a lot of people.
