Because I see all of the pictures in the Ringo movie, I can say that this is his best film to date, and unusual. This is an ancient Chinese period song filled with kick-ass martial arts, where the roles and basements in the underground caves positions play any major roles. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and entertaining, and the set design is truely memorable. Unfortunately, the Burning Paradise DVD is not available on DVD and the second largest Chinese-town in North America (as I did) is the next thing to get your mittings. If you can find it, do not skip it.
