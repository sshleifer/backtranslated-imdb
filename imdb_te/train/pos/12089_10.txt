<br /> <br /> The film, which was dominated by Raven Beaver Barbara Steel, saw the pale vampire men and women who made permanent images when they saw me at the age of seven or eight, who drew a castle seeking blood. <br /> <br /> The impression of steel horror films and the other world beauty and the Walking Dead Presortion Romero's The Night of the Living Dead Shamblers is that they unite my mind. Connection between this film and housing, it's clever but unclear about the forces. LA DANZA MACABRE is a B-movie without courage, acting you fall in love with Baba Steel and suffer from consequences. Claire's exhausted Claire Bloom does not have such a draw. <br /> <br /> There is no need for rebuilding this film. Not only was the production of sixties, but a huge percentage of skillful criminals in Hollywood did not strengthen the Macabre's formula for terror. That formula is based on a replacement factor: Good Writing. MR. Carsten and Korman lost the likes of the Lost-Grade Classics and Tour Nour's Out of Waste as well as a compilation of strong writing. It's easy. Get a real author like Richard Matheson or Steve McQueer and put them in a plot of cinema today. Moreover, let's try some original material for some change in Hollywood and avoid using the previously superior product.
