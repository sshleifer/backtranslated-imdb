No, I'm joking around. Anytime, Ever will get the chance to watch this movie. If you want to chop your hand to see it, look at it. That's valuable. <br /> <br /> The Fat Days Bus is not a movie you have ever seen. This is a bad movie and it increases the artwork. In Iowa there are poor shots, idiot characters, bad conversations, strange acting and cinematography from the public entry, which actually succeeds as a film in its goal. Dunkest, strangest, which you have never seen, is a very unpleasant movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to plot a plot for those in you who are concerned about such things (the filmmakers did not make it clear), but really you do not pay much attention. In any case, FDTB (whose admirers call it) is a story of a bus tour through Chicago, which is led by Satan. You see, Jesus is located in the town, and the bus, the passengers die, and their souls to hell and going to town with Jesus, hell, into the affected job, recovered from, the person in front of a fool looking like do not like it, so he can direct his spirits signed Decide to get people on the bus to make, but he is ok   దెయ్యం, అందువలన అతను తనను తాను దాచిపెట్టు అవసరం, లేకపోతే, అతను అతనితో పర్యటనను కొనసాగించాలని అనుకున్నాడు, అందువలన అతను రోజర్గా మారువేస్తాడు మరియు డ్రైవర్ పేరు ద్వారా ప్రస్తావించబడని బస్సులో అతను గెట్స్, కానీ అతను కొవ్వు రకం, నేను అతను కొవ్వును అంచనా వేస్తున్నాను. <br /> <br /> Examples of some silence: Title 3 times the title repeats. I do not know why. In the middle of the tour a character will appear in the bus without explanation or introducing, and will have to sit for others and they will not belong to her, they will see her. I do not know why. The two characters fall in love and fascinate the optimum attention, again and again and again. I do not know why. Satan says a title card flashes a minute proclamation about the transformation of human form "Satan is transformed." I do not know why. A character is very clearly a person in drag, and other characters referred to as "The attractive bridge." /> <br /> my internship last summer from tromaloni <br come out of my own copy of it if it is a good thing that the driver of the bus has become fatty.
