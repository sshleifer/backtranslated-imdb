The film is unusual and fantastic, which is quite unusual and amazing. It's unique and off-wall because I give this a little 7, but most of the time seems to be bizarre for being bizarre. If the film combined some of its hilarious movements into a paradox of the platform, it was really amazing. <br /> <br /> The main problem here is that the whole bunch of noisy sound that sounds like funny sound from the mouth of a spatula is thrown in the trash even if the creators are mixed with a bunch of sparulas, Value, but it's not rated the top by the creators of the expansion of wild imaginations.
