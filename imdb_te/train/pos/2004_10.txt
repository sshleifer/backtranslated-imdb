I admit that I'm a vampire slave: I've seen many vampire movies and are losing count and this is exactly ten in ten. I was very impressed with John Carpenter's Vampires and the sequel that I bought and purchased when I found out. <br /> <br /> The film did not adhere to the very first rules, and it was not very dark, but it was very close and I thought it was very well built on the original. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi is very good as Derek Bliss: enough for audiences to believe that his performance can survive in the world he likes. After Joey met, one of my favorite episodes would go to examine whether she was more than what she had seen after leaving the diner's bathroom. <br /> <br /> Other actors have also been elected and they are good for building an entertaining and original movie. It's not just the rehash of the first film and it has grown so much as it grew from the Fright Night II Freight Night. <br /> <br /> If you want vampire movies, I would recommend it. If you want your movies to be less bloody then pick a different one.
