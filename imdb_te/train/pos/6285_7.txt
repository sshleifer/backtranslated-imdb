What's in the name <br /> <br /> If you have a name called Jerry Bruckheimer it should be filled with action. <br /> <br /> Producer Bruhemer's latest film, Gone in 60 seconds, is all about renaming it. With journalists such as Kip, Sway and Spinks and cars imbued with names like Dane, Sue and Elizabeth Eleanore, it only keeps the name from the game to play. <br /> <br /> It's not a huge script by any means, but with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall as a great vehicle for working as Nicholas Cage as Memphis Rains, comes out of the car-poker retirement to save his brother's life in 50 one night Exotic cars. The reconstruction of the 1974 cult hit, the film is not intended for the same culture status but it is fun. <br /> Surprisingly, you do not see acting. Despite being loaded by stars, none of them has a very weak performance on my favorite top and comedian Giovanni RBC. Her recent Oscar winning actress Jolie is also a token lover with any screen time. <br /> <br /> Do you have a range of beautiful cars and a car in a great movie? I think so. The movie is a pleasure to look at and a special scene is compelling non stop and suspense action, while bringing you into the untrusted realm. <br /> <br /> Be careful from other drivers who fight for the poll that you left the theater. <br /> <br />
