Screwball comedy about romantic inconsistencies in New York City. Peter Bogdonovich is in love with all women in his film - he respects them - although Audrey Hepburn (naturally) puts a line on others, because her Princess Bogdanovich is probably 30 years before. He shoots her in scenes that she loves, and she gets the perfect sheets in the hard boiled / soft boiled Ben Gazzara, and she is shining all over her room. The love-connections made in this movie are fast and fun, but I've done a tire of John Ritter's TV-style difficulty. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten, and grounded, mud-sensual knowledge Patty Hansen are very exciting to watch. But really Hepburn is Valentine and she is absolutely glitter. **** from
