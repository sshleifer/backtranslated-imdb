The story is a little weaker, and recently the widow Judi Dench decides to encircle a "blonde" (all well) girl band during the war in London. Let's see how young people in this film do not have their feelings, love, and loneliness! "Old wrinkles" have a good smile. "I saw that David Jason did a better patriot than Ian Holm, even though he fit into a" progressive "drummer all of the girls were all in one cheery movie worth all one :)
