Robert Taylor's mad buffet hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character in the film. Initially I am thinking of receiving itself as John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in Charlie The Naker Spar. But Gillon is going to walk along the way he gets to know that there is no hope for him. Stewart Granger Sandy McKenzie wants him to be hunted because he finds that the buffalo is gone shortly and is annoyed by his killing. Gilson is a natural killer, which is not the difference between animals or humans. Deborah Pagette, an Indian girl who is considering self-imposed censorship at the time, is a surprising character. Although she hates him, she is with Gillon in her entire resignation. The final scene of frozen Gilson is unforgettable.
