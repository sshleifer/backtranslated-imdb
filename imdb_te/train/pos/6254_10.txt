I saw this movie at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. The work title is 'Dog Days'. The audience response is mixed. Some people have identified graphic sex and realistic violence. <br /> <br /> This film is not for heart rate. It is like 'Happiness' with a clear sexual orientation of the less obvious sexuality. <br /> <br /> The poisoning of animals, a senior citizen, a shopping center, an outbreak of anal candles, and a storyline from mental inefficiencies, is not too much to manage this film. The film shows humanity with great frustration and curiosity. <br /> <br /> The essence of our existence is great in our interview. <br /> <br /> There is no interest in sailing for mankind here. And why he? This film is always interesting, from spectacular shows from all involved, and perhaps a very clever social statement made in the film in a short time.
