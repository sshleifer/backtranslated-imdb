The film is a young French girl who lives in northern Cameroon from the French doll's perspective, and his father is a colonizer (French) government and is one of the few white families around her family. It gives a sense of life for colonizers and locals who are associated with them. Another film I've seen about Africa during this period is stable (Nirgendwo (2001) in Africa), but there is no way I know how realistic or distinctive. It's not just a stamp - things happen in the picture - but the plot is poor. The viewer has been left behind to make his own decisions rather than neglecting him, although the story is an adult portraying a kiss from West Cameron's visit to the northwest.
