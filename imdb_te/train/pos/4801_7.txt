I saw our whole family in black and white TV in 1964 at 9 years old. I remember my father "How this happened - Adam and Eve". When Adam met Eve, I felt as if her eyes were dark. I asked my father why he said because her eyes were dark and she was tired and hungry. I did not see this episode in 45 years, and I still remember it - with the home planet, TV broadcasts, mainly shaking the headquarters, with the last two waves on Adam, packed up and packed on Eve. It may not have been the stage writing of art, but for all these years I made it an impression.
