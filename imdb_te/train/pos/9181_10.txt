I do not know what Jane Eyre did before I had seen these little things. I have read and saw many classics, and many classics believe that the boring, over-word and overrated stories are the best plot ever. This Jane Irish Miniseries completely changed my feelings. <br /> <br /> Jayla Clark is a wonderful actress, and she plays an amazing role of Jane Eyre. Her voice is delightful and she is silent, and the company's nature is perfectly suited for the role of young governess. Timothy Dalton is a wonderful Rochester. His passion and power in this film believe me that he was born to play Thurnfield Hall's Brutal Master. I did not sleep all night after seeing this little performance. This plot is haunting and exciting. The characters are masterfully performed, and the story is amazing. <br /> <br /> I read this book later and am surprised how little of Chartlett BrontÃ«'s writing. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see your life-changing masterpiece, see Jane Eyre's 1983 BBC version.
