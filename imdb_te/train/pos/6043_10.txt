I saw the film on the freibert and think its great! It's a fun, entertaining time for the British film industry! It's a good idea how the news agent, who met them at the service station, told the film in good touch. Convincing acting (I'm biker) they reminded me some good times in the bike scene. It is good to watch a well-directed film director. In the end, a new crop was mentioned, which is the foundation for the 2nd film in Ireland? So hope they are coming. Great image, well written, realistic characters!
