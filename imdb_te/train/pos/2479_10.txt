(Sorry for my faulty language, I'm not a native speaker ...) <br /> Yes, this is a movie that requires a lot of reaction. Personally I agree on all those superlatives around. But I do not use the semolial vacuum way to describe this picture instead. <br /> If you are looking for a 'hamlet', the probability of a rival with many theatrical and all the movies - then if you find it anywhere, do not miss it. (Unfortunately, many do not get a chance to see this. There is no DVD there and the German language version - which works very well - is not available in any format. <br /> <br /> If you decide to get a copy: (Or such) reform. It's not fun and pleasant, and gives a false impression of an image that plays an interesting way with flow and architecture. <br /> Germany, F.L. Thanks for coming from
