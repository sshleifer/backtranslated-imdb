There is a great feeling, a great cast, and no more time to meat out of any pity story. I liked it and wanted more. Dench, Dukas, and Lyne, now some REAL women! Still, Dench and her character had enough material to take the script in fewer hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br />
