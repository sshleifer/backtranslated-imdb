This film is a touching story about the adventure of 15 year old Darius Weims. Darius Duchen has muscular weakness, which suffered from her first illness at the age of nineteen in her brother's life and is one of the children in the United States. His and some close friends traveled to Los Angeles across the country, and his wheelchair MTV's, Pimp My Ride, customized one of his favorite shows. The journey begins in Georgia, where Darius grew up and never abandoned it. The gang head west of the uninhabited expedition to all its participants. Darrius is the first to ride in a boat, the hot air balloon, the ocean and the swims of tours that the ocean and New Orleans always want to see. Here the filmmakers clearly have an emotional connection to the material. They're not earning money from $ 20 dvds sales. $ 17 goes to disease research and makes $ 3 copies. The film won 25 awards at the festival and I agreed with the quote given by Variety, "some of the hearts to move on".
