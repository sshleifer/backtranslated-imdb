The story is said to be liquid. No interruptions. The flash spine is currently smooth. Casting is amazing. Young Ya'ara looked a lot like Ya'ara had looked at that age. She played the role of a blind person. Director Daniel Cirkin made an excellent job to work with various actors in this story. Cinematography is great. You seem to be on the shore of the Yarrow and Thalia Sea to the edge of the hill. The English subtitles are closely followed by the Hebrew script. Note that the two names are quite appropriate for the story, even though it is not "live off" but "out of view".
