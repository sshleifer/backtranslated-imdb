Only the Disney productions have seen pretty much the animated film 'Beauty & The Beast', or Jean Cocktay's surrealist fairy tale, much of this 1975 French (but with director from Poland) is back. The plot belonged to a family of a French family who had been married to the well of the English family. The big catch family marries with an ancient curse. This film also describes this family curse as many flashback sequences (effectively). From early credits, to the very end, it's almost non-static romantic fun with very clear & graphic sexual content (which is now unreleased in the X rating of America's image). The film is a little defiant in the ruling class, which probably reminds Bunuel's fleet in the same area. If you really have a great taste and are not bothered with the "taboo" material, then the film can be a bad thing for you.
