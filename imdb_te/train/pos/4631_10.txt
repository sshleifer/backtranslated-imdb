Movies like this, and C.R.A.Z.Y., I'm very sad to American films in the case of a gay thing. With the exception of Parking Glins and Brockback Mountain, The Bubble has some important American paintings with depth and openness. The film is centered on two men, No. and Aoshwar, Israel and Palestine. Their relationship with the tensions between Jews and Arabs in Israel is complicated. Who are the first couple of couples who call the next ones, or say, "I will love you"? No. And Aawwar's early love is complicated by suicide bombings, armed security checkpoints and racism. <br /> <br /> Although Nom's friends have accepted Abbah as Arab, it is clear that there are not many of Tel Aviv citizens. <br /> <br /> One of the most touching moments is that there are many in the film when Nom and Ashworth attend the production of "Bent". As we go to the movie, look at this drama, and their impact on both of them is seriously compiled. <br /> Finally, this touching moment is played in the most painful way at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Ohad Nolar and Yousaf 'Joe' Swades are the best of Nom and Ashwara. Director Eytan Fox is brilliant in Shakespeare creating an intriguing and interesting return of classic Romeo and Juliet. While most films have sex with them (almost a sport), this old love and passion goes back to the old tried and true version of sex. It's very refreshing. Also refreshing two gay men are not seen as people and cartoons. The film has cartoon characters. It's not going to be two gay boys for a change. Somewhere on this site I read a comparison between this movie and "friends". Well, really not. Yes, these young characters are consistent with the first difficult actions of youth and relationships. <br /> <br /> I do not remember "Blow Up" in the background of shallow stories in "Friends". <br /> This is a very good movie. It is heart, and heart break. And all the good love stories do not look like love. But it's completely bloomed in it intact glory. Still, it's a very satisfying picture to watch.
