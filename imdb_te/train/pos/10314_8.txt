In this new version of the Twilight Zone, this and "Her Pilgrim Soul" are two of my favorite sections. As I mentioned in my comment in the new series, there is quite a bit in this new series. Most of the lesson can be emphasized. This is slightly mockish and sentimental than the version of Serling. However, this episode can be considered a lot of sentiment. I think the appeal is not united for lovers, no matter what. I remembered that I was amazed by the Korean film "Isle Meyer" (later "The Lake House"), because I saw the first episode of this episode because it destroyed the impact of the next film.
