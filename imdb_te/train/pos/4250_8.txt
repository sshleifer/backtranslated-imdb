Todd Rohl is a mad intellectual. "Fakeface Jones", his third, and quite thoroughly, has a sense of short humor and some are scratching their heads. The film is about at heart, and he almost disagrees with me, is how a simple Joe finds faith to get through a little inspiration life. Or not. You have to look for yourself. Smaller Festival circuit rarely happens, so keep your eyes on and you can catch it - you'll be happy. It's so happy. Other short films of Todd are set up here and there: "single space" and "slug 660".
