Rookie is based on a true story of a 40+ year old school teacher in Big Lock, arriving in Texas Majors. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a small town high school science teacher and baseball coach. His team is losing terribly until their coach plays minor leagues and finds that a pitch would throw 98 mph. <br /> <br /> After batting after throwing the batting practice, Jim agrees that if his team win in the regional team, he will try for Major Leagues. The film tells the story of a boy who plays in the lead role from Jimmy. It's a great underdog story and a very friendly family film. Dennis Quaid is considered to be worthy of the film, providing an emotional performance and Bryan Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. <br /> <br /> The story takes a while to develop and some scenes are a bit slow, but ultimately it works well. Baseball sequences are fun, well-filmed and awesome. The movie is not really about baseball but about a guy's quest to reach his dream. It's exciting, it's emotional and it's funny. I liked it, you expect it. <br /> Rookie. Cast: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T. Jones <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 stars.
