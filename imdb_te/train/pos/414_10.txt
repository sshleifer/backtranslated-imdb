Cecil B. DeMille really knows how to create a classic, and then comes across his Western Real McCoy for over 7 decades, engrossing, entertaining, exciting; <br /> <br /> I would tell Gary Cooper's performances as a true fan of TV's Deadwood, Wild Bill Hickack and Jean Arthur. <br /> <br /> We no longer have any giants in Hollywood. From the 1936-1945 decade only dozens of classics are PlainSman. Over a decade of commercial life decade: Release, Release and Release Picture producers like today's Spielberg, Jackson, and Brookheimer were like playing games in a sandbox. None of today's films have been requested in 7 months, allowing only 70 months.
