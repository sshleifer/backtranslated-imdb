The bizarre oilze likens this intriguing story of the emotional journey of a young man to a rarely visible poem in the film. I understand the concept of literary and cinematic drama through poetry. There are many publications about this film, almost a novel page has been moved to the page. In this sense, the film did not achieve many depths; But it is also very slow at other times, once it's the depth of undercut that has been favorable to many. The film's actor Ashley Judd has not made a better film than his debut. Although she does not have to work, she's almost like a glove like a ruby. She has the presence of real actors in the film and although she is impressive in regular films, she has not been able to make the same appeal in later films.
