It's the simplest film that explores a theme that explores a theme and each spectator offers something different from it. The premise is very simple: the unnamed popular actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to look for a future role by visiting a shop and looking at people. <br /> <br /> When two actors are experimenting with each other for experimentation, he takes special care in the cashier at "10 items or less" lane (pazgyway). A character is a solid size for the characters in the study. The traditional role is not studied; They refer to each world. The life of the Kashyas is caught in a strict and frustrating "real world", but the actor does not do simple things like remembering phone numbers, as his fantasy exists. He confesses that he is put on a face when he speaks to people, and the whole thing that researches real people shows that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But the actor is only inspired by real people for his work; We also see the reverse process. Many characters recognize "Him" and learn how he inspired them with his film roles. <br /> <br /> The cashier's favorite song "Al Pacer La Barca," refuses to hide behind a girl's beauty and prefers instead of paying (instead: honest work for the boat pass), is a good choice. It is parallel to the speedy role, and only the store or worker can work hard to succeed, with no brain or ambition. (This is the hope of someone like Pazzha) that's a strange little picture. If you are looking slow and slow to the "Talkie" approach, the film is entertaining. Characters are absolutely contradictory, and effective acting makes them laughable. Good watch.
