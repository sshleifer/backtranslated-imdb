Dick Tracey is one of my favorite films. I have to confess what I have not seen. You really love it or really hate it. It came a year after the success of Batman. So everyone's estimates are so simple that the plot is very simple. But based on the comic strip ... what did you expect? Creatively, this movie is amazing! The sets, make-up, music, costumes, and impressive acting make this film spectacular. The film does not have a bloody torture and bad language - a rare thing nowadays. Ace Pacino's nasty Big Boy Caprice and Thugs are directed as Ace's crime fighter against his mob, produced, and Warren Betty stars. Madonna steals the show as a seductive Breathless Mahoney. Madonna is one of the best characters ever played. She is one of the best I've heard is linear! Madonna fans love it! They used only seven colors to look like a comic strip about the film. The film is really an art form that sadly ignores people. Over the amount of things up, this film brings us child in all. It's the picture you're laughing at the end.
