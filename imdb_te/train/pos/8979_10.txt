I loved this film, the first slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but I quickly got it. Thousands of hours of footage were fired and I really enjoyed doing work in reducing it. If you are easily shocked by drugs or violence, it's not a movie for you but there are some great characters here (and some real tossers). Technically I liked it very much, they would have to use the new di-interlining algorithm, or the footage was dark, but I was not angry with the usual artifacts found in the video for movie transfers. (Open Water has brought me nuts, because I'm looking for the cheapest, progressive cameras available now and I do not want to hit one if I want to open it in the movie). Sorry this is my own little dramatic. If you ever have a music scene, I would recommend this movie, but it's a lot of tragic moments, but most of it is so happy, I am accused of laughing at others, but it's a classic piece.
