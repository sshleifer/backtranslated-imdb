Spirit: The Stalian whole of Simaron is a wonderful picture. The combination of animation types is unique, the storyline is amazing, and the music is amazing. <br /> <br /> Drawn animation is something special about many animations. Particular marks, especially markings, are particularly spectacular by their animation. While horses are easy to understand the way communicating through the body language, horses may not be understood by many small children and people who do not study. Without speech, I imagine that it would be a challenge to express them through symptoms. Because of this, I understand the 'eyebrows' that I've added to the horses (there are no thick lines in real horses). One of the few things I have observed about surprisingly painted horse habits is that the Spirit has led his mother's flock. In wild horse herds, the mainstream boys usually chase young children. <br /> <br /> When some people portray white soldiers, the 'bad people' are identical, the Native Americans are portrayed. Sometimes back; They treated the Mustangs very seriously. For example, in the real history, the Apolloosaosa race was almost wiped out by the Army officers. <br /> If the Native Americans did not save them, imagine what happened to one of the best-known communities in the world. <br /> How realism is not removed by talking to each other. The feelings of the Spirit are expressed with little commentary, but mostly by music (by Bryan Adams). These songs express the story very well, and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams have done a great deal of melody and literature. <br /> <br /> When I see this film the emotion I received is the first time or twentieth (yes, I saw it too), you can not believe it. Some scenes remove your breath, others force tears in your eyes. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence of the Spirit's homeland will immediately put you in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> Some people in this movie are very unhappy. Overall, I rated a 10/10 - a must see.
