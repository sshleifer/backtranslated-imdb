Three sergeants in the British Army in India were sent out to rebuke the murderers known as the Tuggees. Cutler, cutter, lead one of the camps that have taken a golden temple, and the Durga Guru seizes the evil mentor. Ganga Din, the water boy of the regiment, returns to the camp for help and the other two surrenders back, but they are also caught. Now three have completed the full details, but they do not realize they are going into a trap set up by Thuiz. Nevertheless, Ganga Din, protecting the day. A politically incorrectly, awesome buddy film. Grant, McLaughlin, and Fairbanks Jaffe are the most comical and breathtaking performances in the title role and Seyley as a very evil guru. Rating - 10 out of 10.
