The Lion King series was the success of the crown in Disney animation easily. The original Lion King is a great masterpiece in the cell animations. The Lion King II: The Simba Pride is the best live video sequel BY FAR for Disney, or any other studio animated feature. It is desirable for a theater release. This is the same for the film. Elton John, a happy story, exciting action and touched character moments are original songs and songs. Everything you look forward to from this series. Not quite a new story, but the fill and extendable theme on Timon and Pumba and their place in this story. I'm very impressed with, taking care of the animation. For all, Disney short films on the animation quality of their video and television efforts. But here, they combine the new animation compound with footage from the original image. These scenes never appear. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are in full swing, such as Timon and Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick, Robert Gleme, and Moira Kelly have reconstructed their roles in Simba, Rafique and Nala. We also return to Hupa Goldberg and Cheche Marines. There are so many big smiles like hainas. If you love the Lion King, you need this picture. Without this story the story is complete.
