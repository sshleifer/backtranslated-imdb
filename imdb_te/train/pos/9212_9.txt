Yesterday, I went to the cinema alone, because in Mexico, movies from other countries were part of "Camara Alternetiva" (alternate camera). But after watching this movie, I realized that all foreign films were alternative. Unfortunately, this is a good example. But I said that this film is very happy .. I'm so glad that this film is a little spoon of hope in these days. And the main lesson for me .. at the end of the day ... love is the main power behind us. It's good to watch a good movie in Spanish ... and good music, especially the main song of the film .. Cassus Que Hakeen Qui La Vida la la La Pena ... The amazing song! !!
