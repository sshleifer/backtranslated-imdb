Choreography work or slapstick comedy and Gordon Liu's performance, works perfectly for others, especially the sympathetic monk. The film is a little bit more or less than the stars, and there are certainly more and more violent, more violent and shop brothers films. But some people have a magic mix of involuntary, excellent training and struggle, and good with a subtle and warming story of a well-made person. Light is full of heartfelt joy, this impossible is impossible to give the highest score.
