Series 2 got a great start off! I do not think there is a need to look at the series 1 to find out what I'm looking for, but it's good to feel a sense of the characters in any series and take care of what happened to them. And this show will make you think! This 4 30-something women seem to lead to attractive and exciting lives and the premise is reliable and real. So it's exciting to see turns and turns coming in thanks to their love and sexual lives but you also know that these are real issues that even happen to true women. What about the decisions we make about this and sometimes ignorant of some of the ways in our lives and how to make those decisions!
