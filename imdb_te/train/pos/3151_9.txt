I saw this presentation 3-4 years ago. This dam. I like it when I play it in ETV (Estonian Television) for the first time. It's bad that the show was bad for me. Hide Frank Sinatra is like a cool man who likes to sing! And he comes stupid thoughts. He got these glasses of wheat wheat. I like it. And Fez is. The group is wrong. We know what he's doing when he's alone ... he wants to be serious. He is also in an episode with his boss. And there's Michael, the stupidest man on the whole group, perhaps the stupidest in town and his one policeman! He is so stupid that I remember the following: Hyde said: did u make cops? - Not that Michael comes and says. How does anyone know how to turn siren He is a town playboy. Michael is a former girlfriend named Jackie and her haired friend. Eric Hamm was the grandson of the war veteran and Kitty Hussein's son. His big pussy. But he loves Donna, and his girlfriend plans to get married. Donna is a hot girl. What do i forget Highhead lives in a dungeon.
