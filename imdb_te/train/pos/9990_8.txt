I have seen this film recently and really liked it. I was surprised and cried. The film is similar in style, similar to "Away From Her" - or "The Bucket List", but the entire aging theme performs with an incredible loyalty. It's really really hard to have an improvable main character like Hagger. The director with the challenge makes a master work. Hagar is hard to understand. She has hard edges in the world and she is not a warm charming lady. <br /> <br /> The first scene gets this without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstein) is carrying his son and daughter to a nursing home. She exposed the At-Root and Stupidity. Her edges are really hard. She understands. She is illusory and selfish. She is a stone. I did not like her - not even a little. <br /> <br /> We will get insight into the film. Why does she do Penanis, why she is in favor of a son to another, how her losses have created her role ... I started looking at the angel ... I liked her. I especially liked her when she poured her daughter to her daughter. Ellen Burnstein, you're a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. <br /> It's not a "good feeling" image, but it's exactly the viewer who will bring the viewer accordingly. <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother - she is not even in my mother, law or neighbors ... But the parts of her are many women (and men) in my life. Some of those parts make me more sense that I've seen Stone Angel now.
