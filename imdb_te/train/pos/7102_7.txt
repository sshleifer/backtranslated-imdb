Other reviewers here seem to think this is an awful movie. This is not true and very little injustice. <br /> Acting is of good quality and moves with a good liquidity in the direction. I do not think the stories are mistaken for each other with the Tarantino-Esquire route. Probably try a new tool for directors. I thought I made the film more interesting. Perhaps some of the items in the script need to be cut, but it's the only error I have found. Nestor gives a great performance like Cantillo Silvio, as well as the Rios Rios excellent and alone is the price of the entry price.
