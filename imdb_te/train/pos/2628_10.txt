I Lion King 1 1/2 One of the best sequels if not the best of three Lion King movies! Tell us where the tymon and pumba are from where they come from and the mines with other makers that are suffering from other problems like tymon! Timon and Pumba find their dream place, find it, find it immediately, find the scene, but soon choose between their dreams, or Simba to deal with his evil uncle scare and Pride's Lion King Rock! Titan's Ma (Julie Kawner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I thought my favorite character was Uncle Max, because he was very thin and Ben Stiller's father voiced comedian Jerry Stiller. Disney is very good to play Stiller in that role! Amazing characters, animation, and story and music are the best of any sequel in my opinion filled with 1/2 of the Lion King and even better than Simba's Pride, I have agreed that I really did it! The Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney sequel that the whole family can enjoy! It's a good story and it's very cool! 10 out of 10!
