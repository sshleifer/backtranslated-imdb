At least one half an hour a week. I did not have any interest in the big 3 networks (ABC / CBS / NBC). Singles are of interest to all but laury is sometimes annoying. I really like the Middle Earth action figurines they bring with the hunter. Other characters are very interesting. Siegfried and Roy's shoulders are entertaining at most times. The animation is top notch, and is definitely the best CG that took place on a weekly TV show. Normally when they employ large names in the show, they are trying to hide the poor script or characters. This show is not entirely true, there are weak and improved twin characters by voice acting, but the characters themselves are the same. <br /> This is definitely 16 and higher. Many kids can not hear beforehand, and there is nothing here that most jokes probably fly right over their heads. It's definitely not as raw and experimental as South Park, but it's the same "Bash everyone" brings it to some. One example is that Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand make fun in one episode at the same time. <br /> <br /> Pride's Pride and Other Dreamworks Productions Shrek also feel like the spiritual descendants of animations, pinky and brains, and freakzaid. It's the same kind of humor. <br /> <br /> It may not be as intriguing as Spielberg's classic TV series, but it's still nice. <br /> <br /> By the end of this season, I feel that it will be full and will be restored for future seasons. Once again I can not find a reason to see the big 3.
