Julie Waters is outstanding and Adrian Padrar appears to be extraordinarily entertaining on a very warm, very realistic, exceptional entertaining, gender dysfery and a catalyst in a young executive life. At the heart of this film you have to accept yourself before others hope that you will accept the true truth.
