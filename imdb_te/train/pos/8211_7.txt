I have never seen the original dirty Harry, and I have judged this movie in a clean slate. And I'm very happy. Sure, Sondre Locky's acting made me a little squeemish - but hey, it's 80's. But even if you can not get past her (and I'm not nearly) or her vengeance murders (it seemed a little overpone; p), it's just worth it for dirty harry. Or at least, the bull dog he loves 'MeatHead' names: P <br /> 7/10.
