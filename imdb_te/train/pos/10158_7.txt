Johnnie and June Carter Cash have been funded by both the traditions of supreme stories. The music is great, you can have a real feeling of the world of Jesus (I'm also there), and June's got a proud pride of Magellan's episode. <br /> <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who led Jesus is the evil one. 2. There is no limit to the story of cash in his faith-based music. 3. I suspect this is never widely distributed, since this is not unequal. <br /> I'd like to buy a CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Pine Texas, USA
