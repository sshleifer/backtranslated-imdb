Probably the best film producers ever released by the Releasing Corporation, this little horror piece takes care from the first to the end. Director Frank Wisbar clearly finds a good story, how he writes about it and how it realizes its full shock ability. The plot and characters involved are attractively drawn, but the world is completely out of reach! Just all the action takes place in the middle of a night or a clinging, pervasive fog. The chilling atmosphere was raised in Visbark's innovative direction and was utilized by completely persuasive performances from his players. An exemplary heroine by the graceful Rosemary La Plan makes it even more beautiful and enthusiastic. Robert Barrot presents the native large, direct, down-to-line portrait, although his son is a good man, the best-looking man after Dallasville's writer / director Blake Edwards.
