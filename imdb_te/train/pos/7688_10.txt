Back in 74, Eric Monte Classic T.V Show Good Times. JJ is always my favorite and I love watching Reruns in T.V Land. Jimmy Walker is not always an Ester Roel, but star. John Amos took some time to see millions of fans sit in Good Times to gain popularity of Jimmy Walker. The show will die if JJ has not always been able to save him with a cool Aid attitude. Alcohol is his favorite thing in Kyle Aid Show. When it ends I am 3 and 8 years when it ends. By 1974-1979, I grew up in the 1980s.
