I love this movie / little thing. Jason Steel is amazing! When my favorite episodes were in the French Song and in the opening title spatial soldier "SPOONS!" I will break every time. I would recommend this movie to fans of Knox Coalition fans and those who enjoy Jason Steel's other movies. His style animation is very original. Take a few impressions that will notice the detailed backgrounds. His humor is also hilarious, and it's not something you'd hear before. Like Max the Dermatom Spat, which has a sound and light system on his head, he lights colorful lights and happy music whenever he talks about his painful life. It's amazing animation to watch anytime anywhere.
