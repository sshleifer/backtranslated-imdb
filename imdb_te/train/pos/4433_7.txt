Story: The island texel, photographer Bob, takes a photo shoot for a magazine and meets the mysterious Kathleen. Her liberty spirit and lust for life conspiracies Bob soon experienced the most painful experiences. However, her life is not so easy, though. Through Kathleen, Bob trapped in a dangerous network. <br /> <br /> Review: The dialogue in the movie is quite natural and the story looks good only on the surface of the story and the role of 'psychology' of the character works a bit more. Why are they doing these things? What promotes their options? This picture is what gives something to think about in depth and in my eyes. While the stories are not reach the emotional climax, the characters are adequate to justify. So you do not know the letters at that deep level. Actors act well and are very natural and trustworthy, but I think that if Kadalin is played by a young actress it is better suited because of the character's gratitude to the woman. Camera work is nice, and there are some great shots of nature on the island. I give it to the picture 7/10.
