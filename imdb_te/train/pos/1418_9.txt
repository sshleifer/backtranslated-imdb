I almost did not go to see this movie because I remember the penguin's march was not too exciting. When I saw it on the opening weekend, Disney promised to plant a tree because I had gone, but after I saw it, it was just amazing; It is worth your money to capture images impossible for photographers. You can only look to other habitats, different trees, animals and natural phenomena - but touch your souls and raise the question of humanity How the natural beauty and wonders out of the nature of our creatures have changed to such a degree we take to showcase our ecology . You do not have to be a land lover or tree-hugging environmentalist to appreciate the wonderful surprise of this documentary. You have to be a very interesting spirit to question the value of life and the marvelous questions. Have fun!
