This game is one of the best RPGs. Fist, it is actually more amusing than any other of the battle system (depending on how you attack the enemy, you can transform the dragon, special attack, magic ...). The script is good. The characters are all lovely and you have long dialogues, as happened in many games of the Final FuttiCy Series. When I got bored of the dialogues about the last game, you should go with the story of the game. The environment is an ornament in the sport that combines mid-yun fantasy with future science fiction. It's not surprising that animation effects are just as big as other modern games (I can not remember that the Dragoon Legend is now 8 years old). Then, the map is huge, there are enemies of all kinds of places. Finally, the music is not the best game I hear, but perfect for the game like this.
