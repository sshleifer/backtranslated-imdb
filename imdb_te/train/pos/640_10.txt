Me and my sister last night saw the premiere ... It's the whole thing we've been holding tightly .. hahaha..i I think I'm hooked for the season !! .... they are some really good actors this thing .. the head coach guy and pet the favorite player is very good and the plot has already got me but I can not understand how I really extended the whole season .. maybe some big twist tho .. It's up to Tuesday Stay .. Who is Jeremy Sanders? I'm going to be big. He's so good that he fell in love with his character .. Wait for the next episode. GO Jeremy! <br /> <br />
