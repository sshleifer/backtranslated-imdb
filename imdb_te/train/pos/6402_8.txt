I thought this action was great. There are some things that are less than perfect, but overall, I was very surprised. Eventually the court scene seemed slightly untrue, but it was real enough to be entertaining. The film has been a hit despite the military training and the sacrifices that accompany me. Being a military pilot I have been part of many of these parts.
