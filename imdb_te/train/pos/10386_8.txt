If you're action car sequences and Jessica Simpsons are not blown away by the hot body then you are mainly scrapped in the head, what's wrong with you. The film of course is not a masterpiece, I do not think it will be a target. I'm fun and funny, I've never seen a show when I was younger, I recently saw one episode and when I saw the movie, I thought it was the same kind of atmosphere. It's nice because the film seats are practically shaking, and the car sequences are good because it does not bore me and pulling as some scenes in 2fast 2furious. And Jessica Simpson is plain hot, I wish they used her more in action sequences. All in all, I have a hell of a time looking at this and I see it again soon and I will buy it on DVD. People, enjoy what it does.
