Well, this is a fun movie one hell i must say. Although dubbing was pretty cheeky, obviously, there were some basic moments that turned into a dark blue color, and I was disappointed. The story is actually quite interesting: the last member of the poison clan finds out the other five members and find out who is better used to learn how to use their skills for evil. During the training, the clan was all masked and after all disguised in society and changed their names. <br /> <br /> Battles for every member of the poison The Klan has a different fighting style: Todd (my favorite), snake, floating, lizard, and centiped. Combat sequences have jumping for all of the cast members, and thankfully the camera is planted and uses an extensive shot so that you can see all the actions clearly. <br /> <br /> A drawback in the picture will drag a bit to the first bit sequence in the first half of this story. But it will stick, and you will not be disappointed!
