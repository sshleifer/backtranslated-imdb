It may not be one of the best movies ever made, but overall it is a great pleasure, in which there is a good time for everyone. It is recommended only as a good factor of good feeling. Well, Frank Sinatra's "acting" goes quite as fond of, but his singing is perfectly suited to the great zealous feature and songs romantic atmosphere. Sinatra has produced several films that are undoubtedly driven by his films. However, his first attempt at Hollywood, his voice, not his performance, played the lead role. I saw it again on tv and it still removes my mood as I have seen it many years ago.
