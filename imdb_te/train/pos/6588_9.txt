After seeing several episodes of the series, television producers have come to the conclusion that they are not fully realistic. <br /> <br /> Here is a real sci-fi standby, which is intelligently wrapped in the original original concept form - and still they are - can work almost as well. <br /> The dialogue is great! Male actors have reasonably skill in their careers. Most characters have special contradictions to the hero and have more kick than him. And most of the episode platforms are pretty visible. So what might be wrong? How about the female characters and the aesthetic perfect actresses who choose to paint them. <br /> <br /> The producers insisted that they play the role of women in this role - the final product would be a cheerleader, a good sequence. <br /> When the episodes are throwing down, the female guest star or recurring character is coming to the screen. You can not understand that the actresses are totally unreliable in their roles, and they are unable to achieve their acting work. A blind man can say. Listen to them. They deliver their dialogue with all drama and influence of a 16 year old age at the high school school prom. Who do these women believe in the PhD scientist, senators, corporate executives and medical doctors? <br /> <br /> If the producers make a choice of a Stacked Channing or Morgan Fair Child, select - every time? Moreover, this range suffered for it. Very bad!
