So, in the end I know. Along with other Uk contributors here I saw this what I should be the only UK screening in the 70s. I remembered the title, but I do not know when people say it. When it went to bed with me (it's 2 'r's) but when you whizzing about your brain and listening all around for the upcoming terror, then what's not all about a true CLASSIC horror movie ?? I can not remember the implications of the movie, but what I remember is that I have meat and feelings that repel my body. Can anybody who is black and white confirm my doubts? Again, if anyone has information on how to get this copy, please stay in touch ...
