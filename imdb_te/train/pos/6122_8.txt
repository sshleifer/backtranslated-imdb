This film is absolutely cheerful. Primarily, the plot revolves around a serial killer, and some become a snowman through a B-movie chemical accident. He begins to scare heads and locals for the town. Try and stop him for the local police chief and some other characters. It's made of a low budget and it definitely stands out, but the worst thing about this film is its worst. The Styrofoam and polystyrene, which imitate heavy killer snowman, is classic, and this is clearly intended - one of the few films whose budget is its main selling point. There are comics and some other great comic movements - listen to the voice for a voice than a father to die for his children, and the funniest rape scene is always committed to the film. Excellent frivolous fun
