<br /> <br /> First, I'm really fun to see 1996 style Toronto. Silly haircuts, sunglasses, clothes, and attitude. It really did not change what; Only a nice, safe, cheap, provincial small urban backwater makes great meeting place for international movies! It is also fun to see Kenny and the heads of LA to LA, and it looks back to all of Toronto's booms, musicians, wealthy mentors and even more sensitive film genres. I did not see the film pitch that I enjoyed; It's not fun unless you see the viewer turning it off. I called the pitch to say that power and money were really done by studio executives and production houses. <br /> <br /> So, Kenny and Spin are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, but the message still exists.
