I found this movie to be lovely. I thought the characters had been developed since I saw, and I was concerned about these people. This is a period of belief that during the recession took place. The single mother, the so-called urban monk (she has the cause), puts a statement on paper for "a husband". Christopher Reeve plays a former-kin who went to town looking for work. He sees that statement and goes to see her. She will appoint him. I really got some chuckles like their relationship forward because I found it easy to put me in their shoes. Everything really took place. He needs to work so as not to disturb her. And she needs her help, but do not get him over the top. Dancing around the fact that they really start to need each other. Things are warming up ...... big blow. I do not spoil it by saying what happened. But the clarity point is absolutely amazing. I realized that the story was very reliable at the time of the story. I think this is one of the good "relationship" stories. Maybe the younger generation "get it" but I think you'll like it if you are more than 40. And if you like "Christopher Reeve" you'll love him in "Akking in Time".
