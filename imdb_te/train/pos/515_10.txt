I first saw this movie - I've been in the workplace for the weekend & amused the tv in the background. But I have never seen or heard it until I disappear completely. A Matter of Life & Death (The British title - Stairway to Heaven in the US) is a joyful, compelling, peculiar, and movable, all-out-of-the-art, well-balanced, full-featured package. This is really a classic in Casablanca, a classic Life, Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, & Charities of Fire. Why never get the same public notice and video store expertise? Fortunately, some knowledgeable critics put it on their "Top 100 of All Time" lists. There is hope - the Fantasia of 1940 was not hit by '60s' & The Wizard of Oz was box office hit, but was successful by TV. Buy it - rent it - watch it - demand it! You will not be disappointed!
