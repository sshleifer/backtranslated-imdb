The Kangwon province's authority is the second film of Hong Kong-Suo's second film effort and much of its earlier release in the film, including several dialogues (in this case, both) and relationships with troublesome or disturbing stories, as well as a powerful dose of irony. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " However, the film also has a moment of surrealism, contrary to its original description. These two stories follow a young boy who goes to Kangwan Province with her friends, who only finds herself on the stranger, the second person in the neighboring Kangwan province who is struggling with her friend and her relationship. <br /> Again, hang shows a strong sense of sarcasm and human nature, and he is totally unfaithful when he comes to his roles, with criticism he draws with his sarcasm. I feel I'm in love with Hong's movies, they are actually complicated, complicated and controversial characters. <br /> <br /> Not only does he say that every person is feeling guilty or confused, he and the actors are fully developed and believable. <br /> This is not a fast moving movie. There is a lot like lingering and last picture, patience does not pay immediately and things are not immediately connected in surprising ways. There is no element in the film that is not intended to be in the film and it is dragged into the mix when the movie progresses, so I know little about the various seemingly extra characters. <Br /> <br /> Power is a fantastic picture of the story that shows the guilt of the personal emotional level and the worrying of the storyline and the human decree. It's a rather hard balance to keep and it's surprising how Hong handles twice in a row. The technology production values ​​have been well received since the first film and direction earned steady and clear. This film does not have the same emotional loop pack, but its guarantee that the most profits and refinement in the search helps to really tighten the overall focus. Great view of art lovers. 8/10.
