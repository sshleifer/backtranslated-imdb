"Why did they make them bigger? Why did not they give the poor money?" Mr Harvey asked the student about a question about Cathedral during the Salisbury Cathedral school school tour. "It's a good question," he said. "Some people stimulate them - to get them in search of awe." I'm not sure that the cathedrals will affect everybody, but this film has definitely influenced me. It's awesome! <br /> It did not start. A school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral - a little more than a portrait. If anytime in a high school trip, it's basically. You have a very happy children who are happy to stay out of school one day, the bus driver drives them crazy and desperately trying to keep some teachers in control. Right there, my initial response to the T-shirt was made, that made. I figured that eventually becomes a simple story of a teacher who manages to inspire a group of these selfless students. Yawn! But it will be much more! Timothy Spall is as brilliant as Mr. Harvey - with a strange merry for a merry, unsmiling teacher cathedral. In this film, his story is slowly coming out and becomes the focal point of the story. We were also introduced to some students in trouble - especially Helen, who played an incredible role by Nathalie Pras with self-disorder. <br /> This is not a religious image, but some powerful reflections on religious matters. Harvey's co-worker Jonathan (starring Ben Miles) said, "I do not care what I believe in as long as Harvey does not force anyone to replicate it," it's not patience - it's apathy! "- It's actually a recipe for religious tolerance in my community, and there is a recurring scene in the movie, and the director Susanna white camera slowly climbs up the Harvey bus upwards, so that the final shot is in the sky - the purpose of the cathedral is that the purpose of the cathedral is to scare people Return to Harvey's comment We're afraid of the universe and we choose to define it, but it's a very powerful and exciting movie.
