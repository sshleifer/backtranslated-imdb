This film, made for TV, may have a questionable ancestor, but it is one of the best films I've ever seen. The film and its actors have won many awards. It is gripping, fascinating, and it will absorb you completely. It is a fictional story, but it's a true story, as a hunting story for a killer in a fiery-iron Russia in the hands of people who love to defend their lives to protect the lives of future victims. I highly recommend it.
