Director / writer Andrés Waissbluth is working seven years to complete this two-hour film about the criminal underground in Chile, Santiago, and perhaps it is one of the reasons the film seems to be needed episodic and editing. <br /> <br /> Two brothers - Silvio Large (Nestor Cantillana) and Victor Young (Juan Pablo Miranda) - were shaken. After their parents' death, Silvio went to Santiago from their home in the town of Tangco and worked with Victor's education. On Victor's seventeenth birthday, Sylvio takes her boyfriend to clubs that encourage her to lose Victor with one of the stripper / prostitutes of the club. <br /> <br /> Silvio is impressed with the ability to rent the owner of the club to 'owners'. <br /> <br /> Silvio 'Bodyguard / Henchman and Victor make good money to support the education. But Victor had eyes on one of the dancers at the club (Antonella Rios) and began to embrace her, dropped from the frustrated school of Silvio. Gracia is the squeeze of the club gang leader Don Pascal (Alejandro Trejo), just Silvio's owner! Gračia has this story in conjunction with the medal of Victor, Silvio, and Dan Pascal, and the consequences of this tremendous menage have a treasury's disastrous results. <br /> <br /> By retracting the story by Victor, Silvio, and Grecia, we grow to understand the vulnerabilities and cracks of each character. Chilean pulp fiction? Well, it was filmed in a shaded, colorful, dark manner, with many frontal nudity (female and men) and provocative sexual encounters. But in the eyes of the director's eyes, the sensory element is that the film is the first to play against the hardcore professional sex worker. The cast was very strong, especially in the role of Rios Grazia's demanding role. There are enough twists and turns and replays of the events that you think you first understand when told by the eyes of a different character. In a two-hour boundary, some legitimate editing film's effect has helped. In Spanish language with English subtitles. The famous film Nair is recommended for those who love the genre and the art of South American cinema. Grady Harp
