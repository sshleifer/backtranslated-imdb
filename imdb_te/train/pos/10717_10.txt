Excellent presentation. Instead of looking at the same old sitcom type instead of showing the same old thing, just different "stars", this refreshing show provided a lot of entertaining views in the show office conditions. We've been away from watching television for 2 years and we're looking forward to seeing this show in all the programs. I think this is a winner. Be realistic about things, make some Canadian shows. I believe that everyone who participates in this program will get this program and lead the global away. I guess I want to stick it out with the typical mind-blowing programs from the States rather than dragging behind a Canadian made performance that has a lot of promise. Do not get me wrong, I enjoy a lot of shows on TV, but let people keep different, come in. This unique presentation provided a very ridiculous view of the life and relationships of the office life and relationships, with unique characters that you do not see on any day or in any previous comedy. It is noteworthy that this is not a bad mistake to the world.
