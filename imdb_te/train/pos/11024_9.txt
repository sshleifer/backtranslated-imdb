This image is good. It's fun from the beginning to the end, you're always at the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. In my opinion, the film is critically evaluated by critics. <br /> <br /> Slice in the role of well-trained mountain-rescuer gaab walker is perfectly suited. Michael Rucker will play a great role as Hall Tucker with him. <br /> <br /> 75% of the movie's film is going on with the victims of mountaineering. That will make way for action too! <br /> Brilliant Movie!
