The first time I saw this film at the theater at a foreign film festival, it was a witty, attractive, delicate bicuscule artist. Very European, very Dutch! I recently rented for a second time and could hardly find a religious-sexual orientation with a clever complication of laughing with the distinguished theme of the mad author. Get a grip! This person is a freelancer living in society. I suspect that it is the real reason for these fantasy-nightmares about "SpiderLoman", and the year after announcing his guilt to ignore the advice of the mother about carcasses (and bed) with strangers! He exploits (probably tokfree) to make stories (lying on guilt) but he is too small to pay for the hair cut, hence he hits the beauty salons owner. Then he was nervous to complain about the bill! But I also suspect the world has alot changed since the film has made this film. It is fun to see John De Bont's camera work and one of Paul Verhoev's previous films in an important note. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed so much?
