My favorite movies of all time are definitely one. I have seen at least a hundred times and I can not go without crying. I feel like Sealie and Nettie or Shug and Father's reunion and I do not want anyone to see your eyes dirty. Woopie Goldberg must have an award for fairy tale. And if you loved the book, for the guy who said you can not love the movie is wrong! That's an inscription.
