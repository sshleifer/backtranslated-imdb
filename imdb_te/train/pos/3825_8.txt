A young woman comes into her husband's hometown when she dies in an accident. She was settled in this small town, but sooner her son was kidnapped and lost all her hopes ... It follows all the plots in a simple movie: finding a new partner and finally being happy; Or to kill and finally crush her to kill her ... She tries to kill herself, but after intense struggles, with God. She believes in God, knowing that God is everybody and the killer is also apologizing. Be careful here about God, this is not a thing against God. The way the film dealing with the problem is very interesting: not in the woman's viewpoint or in the view of God (thus, growing grass, clouds flying views, I think). <br /> <br /> The movie is from the third party eye, let's look at the movie and explain a subject. <br /> <br /> This movie is not very interesting. There is this man who is around the woman and clearly in love with her, but in her own way. He is funny man, I'm a clown, shouting around our heroine. The combination of both, the woman full of tension, the always crying, the thrown, and the laughing and stupid one ends with the good emotional balance: absurdly or wrongly. <br /> We highly recommend.
