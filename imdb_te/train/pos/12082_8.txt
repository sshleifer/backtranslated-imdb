I was amazed by the film after watching the film's strength of critically ratings. Despite the obviously low-budget, it has the symbols of brilliant ingenuity. For example, when Julia wandered in a strange house, when she looked out the window, I was thinking of her loneliness focusing on her face, improving with a shot outside of the house and moving back to its discrete space. And lo and behold! The next scene was exactly the last shot of that house, standing alone on the hill at the edge of the water. There are other examples of how his filmmaker can elevate his images to a very ingenious thriller level. <br /> <br /> Savvy audiences must recognize them but they need to be assured that they will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> George Mengridge is his usual creepy self-reliance with performances. Nina Foch is surprisingly good as a non-fantasy work girl who does not need to be presented without a fight. But Dame May Witty, Oh Boy, she suspected my own eyes and believed that she could stay away from her bad plans. <br /> <br /> This genuine diamond is not tough and should not be missed.
