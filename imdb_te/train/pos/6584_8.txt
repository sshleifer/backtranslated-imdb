Doyle never wanted Holmes to overturn the final problem with Professor Moriardi from his joint death. However, financial opinions wanted him to write the house of Baskervilles (in 1901), which is still considered his best Holmes novel and his best novel. But it was a "reminder" of a great detective written before his death. <br /> <br /> The new short stories (and the last novel) are not really bad, and Holmes has brought his people to Holmes completely restored. . Perhaps three of the stories are really terrible, but even terrible ones are very readable. The next ones (such as the adventure of solitaire cyclist) are very good. But the stories of the inequality (especially in his last good story (1917) are evident later that he repeats the last storytelling, and he shows Holmes's negative aspects, the story of the three gambles in the story that Holmes appears to be sarcastically seated in an African hierarchy role. <br /> <br /> Sparzer Coming Soon: <br /> <br /> Holmes is trying to recover compromise from Holmes, Milton, the most successful blackmiller, an interesting example of how Doyle made a very readable story with the least plot for the less realistic detective work in the story, Holmes was appointed to negotiate with Milvarton to buy letters, but none of them could be recovered A lot for magazines The amount would be considered, Holmes himself was ready to defend himself from his person milvertan proves to explore. After being romantic in a pseudonym malvertan Holmes learned of the home. In the end, Holmes goes to wrest Milveston with Watson. He and Watson were at home when he and Miltonton discovered that he was looking forward to a new business deal (with information from Miltonton) in his study. Careful hiding, when Holmes and Watson looked like a woman, collapsed collapse from Milvarton's past operations, and blackmailed her to death. Holmes and Watson are able to extract compromise documents before fleeing Milvatore's house, and then find a woman (for themselves). The police did not recognize Lestrade and found Milwaerton's activities (they could never get him home).

This is a story in the longest version of the story's simple hour of story. But the teleplayer's terrific confusion for MASTER BLACKMAILER spends some time in the Miltonton victims (in Victorian / Edwardian England). A good young nobleman, a military officer, killed himself while facing homosexuality due to Milwaithon's extreme demands at the start of television. And it's not just gay people. Men and women who have good name for men's weddings by exposing illegal children or formerly absurd relationships.
