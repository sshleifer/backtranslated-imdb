I rarely see the film that I filled up with. This is one of them. It is good acting, dialogue, story, and scenery is beautiful. I laughed loudly several times, especially with a kitchen ride. The Slapstick comedy performed by the Lankhead has a floor, but I agree that it's a sucker for the slapstick. The story took place with a group of people returning in the 30s to a summer camp that was attended 20 years ago. It will be closed forever at the end of the season, this is a farewell week of camping. The camp was different from older people and they thought it was different. <br /> <br /> I recommend all this funny, moving film. <br /> <br />
