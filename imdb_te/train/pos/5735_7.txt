This is a small, wildly animated series of David Lynch (as it initially mentioned), and it follows the unfortunate aspects of a backwoods, the big man wearing the whole, a stressed wife and a troubled son. The two elements are repeatedly smaller and have no real plot to see. <br /> <br /> It's easy if you want these exceptionally odd, slightly horrible looney tunes-too much gore, pornography, bloody violence, and occasionally happy moments. <br /> <br /> I am the Erasherhead that appears in the past. If you want an artistic masterpiece do not appear in this series. In fact, it looks almost like a statement on such topics, its rough style flipping with any kind of animation convention you can see. As Lynch says, "If it's funny, it's only funny we see it's absurdity."
