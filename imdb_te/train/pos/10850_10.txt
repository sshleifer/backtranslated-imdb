What a good movie! Memorable fads: at one end of the rock's unknown side. The famous rockers are not old and get forgotten, not music. And with good sense of humor. Have you ever watched Bill Haley's rock around the clock? <br /> <br /> Even crazy, perhaps the best film about rock n roll. For example the spine is better than the top. Why? Still in crazy, people are mature. They have a different opinion about love and about rock about life. They seek to meet their crazy young people. Out of this story, we see characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. <br /> Get a good look at this subject (Listen to the awesome soundtrack!) And finally think about your own future. <br /> <br />
