Despite Hollywood's technical expertise, the small town has not yet seen a (Hollywood) picture that matches the authenticity of the river climate near the ocean ... Tom Cruise's Last Last Samurai is the last installment of the Lord <br /> <br /> Rings trying to capture the rural Old Japan . <br /> <br /> If you want to be indecisive and serious lines, this is a must watch movie.

The characters are very deeper and work with very intense.
