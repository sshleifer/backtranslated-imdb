I did not see this film at the end of the 80s and decided to make its VHS version. The plot is very slow, and the actors are almost robotic in the movie Breakdowns. Music, hip hop / free style artists and bridading sequences. Bridining is better than "Breakin", but I'm breaking up the Breakin 1 & 2 "energy and improves on the screen, this is a movie I'm putting in my library, but it's not the only one on the blue moon.
