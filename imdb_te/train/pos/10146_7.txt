As we all know is a genre with a romantic comedy already known ending. Both Leads will always get together. Late in the third act I'm trying to figure out how to wrap this up and how they will end together. A clue is given right from the beginning, but you will never realize it until the end. It's a simple hook, but it works. It will cover you a lot of common ground, but always take the latest spin when possible. I loved all NY characters and I liked locations. This is NY's postcard. And it's very good looking at the movie. So, if you like a good old fashioned romantic image ... then for you.
