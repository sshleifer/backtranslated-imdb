"That '70s show" is definitely a comedy show on TV. I started to look about it two and a half years ago, and I said it was a great show as soon as I saw it. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo is also a fantastic character when he is, I hope he comes back because I am really hilarious. It was classic when Faz went to the "Bitch of Bitch", and Kelso "burn!" Whenever I say, always smiles at me. They have two great characters and always have something funny to say. Jackie hottie is another reason to see the show; She started being really good looking but damn, somewhere around the season 5-6 she just got really hot. I've seen episodes many times more than once, some 10 times as much and still fun. This is one of the few shows I can see and look upwards as I saw it the first time. Classic of the cast; Almost everyone is funny, where there are only a few funny characters with many shows. I will be sad to see the end of this show next year, but it is always going off the air as one of the best performances ever.
