Without going on this edge, the exploitation might be one of the best movies ever to come in - Edies will do their thing, I have put things like the ruble-stuck bedroom empty gin bottles, urination on the cats bed, holes in the walls, and racoons out of the final scene It looked very sad - the child's birthday party was seriously wrong As ID. Sure it's worth looking for a lot - you'll never forget, but very disturbing.
