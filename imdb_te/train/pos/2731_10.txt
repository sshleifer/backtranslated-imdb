Sorry, I do not have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist, but for 25 years one knows. She said that Scott Wilson was a sockpotyat (no conscience) that she had played in an amazing manner. I agree! Robert Blake also said that she was unable to control herself, even though she was portrayed by a conscience conscious and motivational control. I agree! What a chilling and immensely picture. I have seen over 2000 films and this rank is in the top 100. My lifelong friend deals regularly with clients like this. My last criticism is the preachy narrative at the end of the film. Most people are growing less than ideal circumstances, but only one million of these 2 losers behave.
