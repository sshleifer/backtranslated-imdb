Rogensstress is a touching story of courage over difficulties. Reichdach women are reportedly locked out of their Jewish husbands pending expulsion. Lena Fischer, a group of her family, found herself in the manger as General Gunarian's sister. But the rank and special authority can not be considered exclusively. <br /> <br /> Her husband does not serve Reich as a woman who is learning in Ostfrent. In the horror scenes of this film, garders take the wedding ceremony of her soldier's husband. <br /> <br /> Today, in the US, we do not assume that we are normal German brutishness, and their bans are prohibited, Lady Bush has been ordered to recklessly arrest Gold Star Mothers (who died in the action of mothers of US service members). <br /> <br /> Fortunately eight-year-old daughter Ruth captures and escapes. <br /> <br /> Fischer would prefer Ruth to respond as Rosenstra√üe Lena would normally take Germany. Lenny Fischer's brother, Colonel Arthur von Eichenbach, is also aware of the Holocaust and opposed Lena. <br /> <br /> The siege ends with Rosenstrasse, but Lena regrets: What happened to Ruth after the war? Years later, Ruth's daughter, Hannah, survived in the search of her mother's past and meets with 90-year-old Leena in the guise of writing personal history of war. <br /> <br /> I thought Hannah was very interested in the family, but her grandfather had never checked in the past as she knew that she had been serving in Orestreft.
