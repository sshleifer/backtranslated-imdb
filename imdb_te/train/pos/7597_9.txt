Lost is interested in everyone. You can say a lot about this series, and a lot has been told, so I will not say it all for you again. People who love it will read and know what you would like to see. The good thing about this series is that it's totally new. Many movies and less simple are based only on suspense backgrounds, but the theme is lost with dissatisfaction. It's about its descriptive and you tell each episode its story own but the episode is greater if you combine an exotic location, nice plot turns, an amazing cast and a good format (combined with the current and last in single parts). If you want to have all the ideas of the characters, you want to see the whole picture and you will need to know where the authors take you. The result is its array that you do not want to go. With more skepticism, the series went down a bit in season 2, due to its own success. Lost was written for only one season and the authors were also engaged when it came after the best of success. In my opinion they made a mistake in fixing more secrets and season 2 in order to resolve them (or at least partially) of season 1. At the end of season 2 you can take a big blurr secrets, plot turns and unexplained phenomena, but most viewer can take. The difference between Season 2 and 3 is huge. Seasons have been given many ideas, partially replaced by new questions. And that's exactly how they wrote; You would like to hit a plot twist later, all you see as a tsunami, and then select some of the viewers to explain. They got in that season 3 and brings us a good series for the season 4. Its range is good to see such a different format, so the most popular.
