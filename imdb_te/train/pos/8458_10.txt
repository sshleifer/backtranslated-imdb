Gundam Wing is a wonderful show from start to finish, every episode is a pleasure to see. The unique Gundam price for this story increases as we build space colonies for the growth of future Earth's population. The story is set in a completely different reality than any other Gundle program though. After colony 195, the corrupt land giant, known as the Land Rigging Coalition, seizes violent free colonies. To overcome the Alliance control and the next bigger threat (a bad military organization in the so-called OZ, which later controls the land and colony), select the members of the colony Send 5 super powerful moves to rescue and save colonies from the oncoming threat. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Gundance has announced previously, is probably the most enjoyable Gundam Series to see in my opinion. For this reason, the difference between the series and the other group lines is quite large, but the stories are much deeper and more complex than the other group lines. Gundam Wing has more depth and emotion than any other Gundam Show I have ever seen. This particular series has focused more on the relationship between the characters than the plot and epic battle battle. Now I'm not wrong, the program still has many epic battles, and the show still maintains the epic climate of the other Gundam Series, but the story follows the story of a combination of 6 or 7 characters <br /> < No matter in this case it's really one of the most exclusive and pleasurable gudge series, and I'm strongly animated Sains mother usually fiction. The program has some amazing animation and amazing action sports, but the depth and complexity of the story is what keeps you coming back more. The characters are very well drawn by the end of the show where you end up loving each one of them. <br /> <br /> This program should not be missed. <br /> The perfect 10/10!
