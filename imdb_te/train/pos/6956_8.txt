I said that Uma Thurman was the sexiest woman on the planet. This film is beautiful and I mean Uber beautiful. It has all the "sexual" content that Ivan Reetman has with comedians, but with some lil extra, chemistry. Both Uma and Luke have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seems to surpass this scene. Both will create this odd, twisted and interesting relationship with those powerful "sexual" tensions that laugh until you both will not feel your face. Anna Farris and the rest of the supporting cast will play perfectly with each other characters and even Wanda Sikes' rather small character makes you laughing. Although this kind of comedy is not for everybody, I usually go with a guy who does not enjoy these movies and he is laughing as crazy. This film is not exactly for everyone. Some moments are very small, especially young children ... tell ADULT for a younger audience. In all the films I am pleasantly surprised by the film, and I'm a little weak compared to the rest of the movie. (5 * 3 to 3 * / 2 *)
