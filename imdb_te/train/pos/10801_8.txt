Honestly, as soon as I saw this film years ago, I wanted to stop it. When I sat for the next 10 minutes, I realized that Navin stole the show. He shook my head because he was not more ridiculous than his facial expressions and humorous behavior. He's going to this "marty feldman" but it's a lot more talent ... without taking away from Marti. The picture really shocked me by how close the original jerk was, but then again, it was so much more. If I really release this movie first, and I saw Steve Martin's movie 2nd, I think I was the 2nd rip cheap. I feel like a BOLD statement, but that's true. I really like Steve Martin, but his performance as an actor in Jerkoo is 2nd. I thought I could get a copy for my collection. I want to see if you can find it.
