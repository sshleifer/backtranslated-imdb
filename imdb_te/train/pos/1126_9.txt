My interest grew when I was moving, and I had seen the name of Efigenia. So my name is Eugenia, so I think it is what we see. I am very happy to be in the channel. What a wonderful, exciting story. Drama, sadness, some on top acting but a fantastic time. I see this and keeps the film industry out and makes me sad for all the drivel that passed over these cute little gems. Iphigenia try one and hope that you will enjoy it as I did. I enjoyed my children (27, 25, 20 and 17). It starts slowly, even though you are drawn to theatrical structures and stories. Looking at this lovely movie, I have more Greek tragedy and regrets.
