<br /> <br /> "When I was young, I saw it in 1989, I did not understand it but I saw it." I began to love the songs in this movie. I loved my favorite songs "Let Me Be Surprising" and "Soon You Come Hum Beautiful songs known as home ". Charlie is a dying picture.My sister did not even see that part of me. <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Overall I love this film and I want everyone to see this film 10/10 stars.
