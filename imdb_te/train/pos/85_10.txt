The film was shown in Birmingham Southern College in 1975 when it was joined by Red Balloon. Both films are similar to their dream-quality. A large part of the film is called a happy fish swimming in his bowl, but his new owner, little boy is away in school. A cat enters the fish and his bowl, and begins to strike his "animal". The boy begins his walk home from school, and wonders at the time when the viewer can save his fish friend. The fish are concerned by the existence of the cat, and finally jump out of the bowl! The cat quickly runs on the fish, gently holding him with his feet and returns to his bowl. <br /> <br /> He is surprised at both his hypocrisy and its technical complexity. It is difficult to imagine how the director recovered technical skills in 1959 - this was more a trick for 2003. <br /> If you find it, look at it - you will not be disappointed! And if you find it *, let me know so that I can also get a copy!
