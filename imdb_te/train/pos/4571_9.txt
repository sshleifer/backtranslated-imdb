The important thing about this film is the clever performance by Daniel Day Lewis and Hugh O'Connor who broke all odds despite Christie Brown, the artist and warrior her physical condition. As a person who has worked with paralysis patients, I can assure you that their appearance is intimidating. Christie has been promoting the immense support of her family, the low income, the class dubliners, the impossible and brilliantly encouraged to make this film if she did not read the book painted, but the dialogues were captured by Christie Brown's intriguing arrogance personality. I do not recommend this film to all, especially for classic movie lovers.
