'Five Days' is a specialty, a crime play, a series of sequences, each time in a separate police inquiry. But in fact, this factor in the story is limited to only 24 hours of action per episode, as the episode is different from the other program that can only be limited to 24 hours for each episode, The fact that one of the sub-plots focuses on a single, dull female policeman is not nearly as helpful in drawing comparisons to the last 'main suspect': it's just the absence of comparisons to Helen Mirren's absence. Everyone is suspicious, suspicious and sympathetic to everybody, with a lot of concessions, manipulating music and a set of characters. It is also possible not to predict the ultimate predecessor party, but because the dramatic structure is not complete: some things need to be true, sometimes focusing on the range of some characters. Despite these failures, the series has risen to me: in the end I got a lot of trouble. But the BBC, which has made the likes of "The Singing Detective" here, is a tragic sign to spend "the best drama of the year": there is little realism in offer and the lack of the suit is definitely disappointing. 'Five Days' is not actually the worst; But the principle, and hope that the BBC will be something much more innovative and fresh with the very best offered by a BBC.
