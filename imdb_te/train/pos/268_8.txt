I liked the DPI Pfeiffer (right?) In Cybill. I did not see her for awhile and I lost her so much. I thought she did a great job in this regard. The supporting cast is very beautiful. In some dimensions the daughter also looked like a young Nicole Kidman. The abductor is pretty creepy and the story usually has some good twists. The young boyfriend is a hottie. <br /> <p> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have my interest and they will see again and again. Can anyone recommend similar films? You can post on the board or send me a private email if you want. Thank you in advance. Aboutagirly.
