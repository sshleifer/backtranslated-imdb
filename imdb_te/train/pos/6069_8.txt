........ Cadildipper, Kell San Fernando, etc. The man is very beautiful and a scream. I love he w / Amanda Blake, or Don Knots or someone else's mutually looking - he clearly has a ball and I think he will make his guests as well as possible - as long as they move forward with a discipline, take a 19 type of preparation. <br /> <br /> He reminds me of Milton Burrell, Benny Hill, Jerry Lewis. The great time, the antique gags placed in the audience in the stitches for decades, is the perfect pleasure about what he does. <br /> <br /> Personally, I've bought two DVD sets for his performances from '61, that he is great, it brings his stuff back to me a fond way. <br /> <br /> When I closed the series in 1971, he was able to see him on TV in his run. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan or interesting, check it out. He was a riot.
