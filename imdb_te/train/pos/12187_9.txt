Stranger, a small film Noir film, a small film Noire film that proved to be a powerful genre during the budget and at the time and proved his biggest box office success in the forties, the MACBETH in the Old Western film Shakespeare's follow-up in a 23-day sheet, a lady from Shanghai , Of the revelations of the Venetian mythology A dark film star who woven from the same fabric, the executive amberson, MR. Aardin and any other film director did not save from the clutches of the studio. <br /> <br /> After six years after the Malthus Falcone, the film's no-frustration of Noir's full-mouth, Wells, is a darkest, darker, mysterious than any of his contemporaries, a true visionary director of all time, excellent artistic integrity, And the shadows that are snake have imagined a labyrinthine world. It is astonishing that the film is misunderstood, a full hour of footage is forever left on the cutting room floor, and once again the classic of Wales is Europe. <br /> <br /> Some set-pieces are standing. Aquarium scenery with its flickering light and ominous shadows, and of course the funhouse / hall of mirrors final, is the classic part of the Wassiane Bramira in Citizen Kane or in any Tree. The only bugs I found with the film were Wesl's advisor Irish voice and perhaps some of the first editing of the first action. The stories make intuitive mesmerizing, which only intensify the cuts. <br /> <br /> Wales wrecked herself in Europe for ten years, and in 1958 another Stonewall Classic, a memorable touch of Evil, was probably worn on the crown of the film noir in its wrecking days. Hollywood's premier star Rita Hawthard did not win a Star Vehicle victory for the box office success of Shanghai, and Welles ended up dating Hayworth before it was released. Sixty years later and less than an hour footage, Shanghai is still likely to learn one of the best movie noir pictures. Surely it must be counted.
