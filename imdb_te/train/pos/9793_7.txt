Everyone has an interest in their roles and I give 10 to 7 for this movie because Unknown Batman is an interesting "game who can guess". But the film needs more robin. He initially appeared in the film and the rest of the rest throughout. I just let Knightwing know the new animated series, neatly the new Robin role did little justice. This movie continues to be a bad tradition. The movie Bruce Wayne and his romance spends a lot of time, and it is not as bad as in a movie if sex is not so reliable. If you're a Batman fan still it is a good movie and I recommend watching it.
