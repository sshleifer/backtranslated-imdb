This picture surprised me. Some things have been reminiscent of "క్లిச்சிஷ்" and some techniques like "The Enemy of the State" starring Will Smith. But for the most part most entertaining - a good mix with Jamie Fox and comedian Mike Epps and 2 Wannabe Hughes Julio and Ramando (with some comic relief). It's a movie that can be seen again - say ... some Wednesday night when there is nothing to do. I gave it 9 for the value of entertainment.
