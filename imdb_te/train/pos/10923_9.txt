This image is good. Thinking and guessing is what the plot of the plot, which works as the viewer of the puzzle forces. Such a trick brings in incredibly surprising way and the viewer is really looking forward to a riddle solution. The scenes are very good. There are a lot of different fighting styles (one bit of one of the styles is unrealistic, but it's only my opinion) and it's a lovely show. The irritating thing is to see the actors. A bit too flexible (at least me). Hong Kong Kung-fu movies are especially good in the 70s and 80s, so "Five Vancas" (or other versions) are a great choice.
