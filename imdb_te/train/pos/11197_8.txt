Another silent love triangle from Hitchcock is not a mystery, but a very English language, well-paced and photographed. The sensitive boxer Bob Karbi (Ian Hunter) places the circus boxer "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) as his sparring partner, to some extent near Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davies). Jack and Mabel's characters are characterized by characters in the North and the novel, standing in the church's behavior, tall and very small men, fat lady, twins next to the course, sit on the side of the arguments, and argue about the wedding feast amusing. Mabel loses the rest of the movie Jack, turning it back on his heart or doing something like that. It was another era, evening dress, with audiences, and boxer dress, while in the ring. Camera angles, pace, use of icons, cutting all very stylish and master. The last boxing match camera work and editing is very gripping. Brisson's good looks this one is used well; Because he is in Hitchcock's The Manmerman, his laughing is not to be around him, and therefore not annoying. But do boxers have such spanks?
