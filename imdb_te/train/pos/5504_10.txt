I saw this last night, which was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passion Plate I' series. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and several other shows recently (September 2003). It's pretty awesome. Motion picture producers literally slipped into the story, making a documentary about Chavez. Instead, they appeared squarely in the midst of rebellious open events. They have unprecedented access to events and people, and for the most part, the story unfolds when it happens. They have their own theoretical perspective (they are clearly visible) but they have a background and instead seek to focus on the background and history that led to incidents, people and rebellion. As a movie, this is not a stylized or aesthetic feeling and it should be what I think. Let's see what we really want to see 'embedded' journalism. A Chariosmatic Leader (Ch√°vez), who is really interested in his people ... leads to a democratically elected leader of the story about power and greed as a corporate / military / media interest coalition ... It has never been in the past for a historic event Not accessible. <br /> <br />
