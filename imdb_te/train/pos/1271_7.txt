We have never seen this film based on an entertaining novel by Nicolas Katzenbach, and we decided to take a look at the first ration cast that we met for production. "Just Cause" is not a horrific film, Jeb Stuart takes too much freedom with the original thing that he did not succeed in his treatment. <br /> <br /> When we walk in the local courtyard for questioning a young black man, we are the first thing that police brutality. After all, sheriff show Tony Brown, and any kind of beating the police officer Wilcox, Bobby Earl, accused of killing a young white girl. <br /> <br /> Then, the scene turns out. The grandmother of Evangeline, Bobby Earl, a distinct Harvard professor, was sent to the north to ask a retirement lawyer, young man Paul Armstrong wanted to save him. A woman is comforting to see Amstrag to investigate the case. <br /> <br /> He believes in the innocence of the young man. Blair Sullivan, who works at the same time as Bobby Earl, comes forward to tell him about how he's linked to the murder of the young man and changes the course of the case. As it plays in the film, the audience is confused and does not get the way to Armstrong. <br /> <br /> This thriller is delighted by Sean Connery of Armstrong. Lawrence Fishburn, a serious actor, earns a gentle seal like Sharif, until we see him, and abuse his prisoner. Ed Harris is an excellent opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. <br /> <br /> Blair Underwood, Kate Coppasha, Ruby Dee and young Scarlett Johansson appear in support roles. <br /> <br /> This film is not disappointing with its flaws.
