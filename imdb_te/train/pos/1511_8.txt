The no-nonsense inspector Holau (a great deal by John Bennett) examines the disappearance of a famous Thabiani and learns about the past history of a creepy old house. The first and most worldly story, "Murder for Murder" - successful author Charles Hillier (played by Denham Elliott) is the haunting hit of his latest book murderers. What's special is to say something special, which leads to a real build-up to the end of the true surprising end. The second and most sharp story, "Waxworks" - Lonely Philip Grayson (always the best Peter Cushing) and his equal solo friend Neville Rogers (Wonderful Jose Auckland) attracted a hated wax statue of a beautiful but deadly idolatry. The third and most serious vignette "Sweet to the Sweet" by Jean Reed (usually a wonderful semi-sympathetic character Christopher Lee) is nicknamed Nanny on Norton (a good nurse Dan Porter), her seemingly beautiful and dangerous daughter Jane (An outstanding unusual and exceptional performance by adorable Chloe Franks). This stand-out scary episode confirms the real embarrassing concept of lurking evil migrants under the terrible evil and innocent angelic layer. The fourth and most amusing cotton, "The Clock" - Pompas horror movie Paul Henderson (who happily commented on the hilarious hit by Jon Pertvy) will buy a mysterious clock that transforms into a vampire when he wears it. This item makes for the delicate fun and more profitable. Director Peter Duffell, the horror scribe Robert Bloch performs a complex sensation, working from a heartwarming horror and witty script, and makes it a great job to create an atmosphere. There is also a splendid cinematography of Ray Purcell and the spectacle of a sensational score by Michael Dress. A good recommendation for most omnibus frightening fans.
