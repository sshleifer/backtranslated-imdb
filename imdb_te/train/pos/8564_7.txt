I do not think the film can be better understood from Romania. It is about the value of the film, perhaps the film's lack of universality, but also in Eastern Europe, something about history and history of other people in Romania compared to other countries. <br /> The film is adapted to a novel called Martin Preda, a controversial novelist who died in the Communist regime soon after the book was published. It tells the story of his philosopher's intellectual after being arrested on false charges at the end of the Stalinist era. In fact, the first part of the film tells the story of fighting for survival in prison, explaining his lien to retrieve his life after the second release. His release is indeed clear, and 60s Romania asks him from a different kind of compromises and crimes, but his fight for survival is strict in jail. <br /> <br /> The film is somewhat best Romanian actors. Stefan Iradche, the main character, is another time and a mega actor in a different location, where his amazing performance can get a good compilation of the art. As the story and story of comics rarely narrated in romantic comics and the fall of the story, the film is still important in Romanian films and the process of restoring moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society.
