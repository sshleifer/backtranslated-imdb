Gong Ho is trying to express many opinions and at the same time tries to enjoy ourselves with a brilliant comedy. The result is uneven, but is generally fun. Keaton balances all three aspects of his main character. Wandered is also good. One warning: George Wendt was very poor in his supporting role. Otherwise, this is a very enjoyable time capsule.
