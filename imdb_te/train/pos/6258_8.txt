They might have probably skipped some in the beginning - I'm not sure why this turkey starts part of Asia. Even in the beginning of the Mediterranean, they came more closely to modern Lebanon. <br /> <br /> When the cameras and crew reach the Bagheati tribe, it's a fantastic 48-day journey. Around 50,000 people with 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this tremendous trek of the Karun Karun River very fast. They use rafting rails by increasing the goat's skin - to see where the head and legs are removed. The other "bank" of the river was very steep - I'm guessing the growth of 60 degrees. <br /> The scene is surprising, but there is so much more to come. To reach the pastures, they also had to overcome a big mountain with 4 feet snow. The ability to climb the hill is very beautiful, but they (and all the animals) have reached this mountain footwear! <br /> <br /> A disadvantage to this documentary includes internal titles with poor efforts at humor. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the documentary from the silent age, or the only face of this tribe, but the wonderful challenges to conquer. This is an excellent document of a group of people who face all kinds of challenges.
