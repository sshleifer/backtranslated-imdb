Zombie Bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans to zombie fans with true love of horror style. I understand from the commentary and the subjects I read that took place during the massive Midwest flood in 1993 when halfway underwater in Missouri. The buildings are under water. Cars and houses are underwater. According to an article, the film will help sand and gas to the river after shooting every day from zombies and staff. This film is a wonder of everything. It's like a massive mashing of every zombie movie ever put through a Troma filter. It is a party image to enjoy bright and goofy characters. <br /> <br /> The risk of toxic spill at a nuclear power plant causes people to melt or drive away. The local government covers it, melts the factory and builds houses on it. A cave opens up to some ground shifting (?) And some new residents find the cave and leave the dead in the newly built community. From there it gets crazy and crying and fun. <br /> I've read these reviews a few times here. And it is clear to me that the same person has attacked this fun little picture three times using duplicate names as different critics. They use the same words and sentences. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It's raw. It has some bad acting. So made half films. There is more work there than this fun movie. If you hate this movie too much, do not buy it. Personal attacks are not required and the band or cast is a "trailer trash." It's obvious you are not from Australia or England. This great service is because IMDB makes use of others to waste. There are bad reviews and good reviews, and I do not mind them. I am giving bad and good reviews. But it is sad that some people want to use this forum to personally attack the director of the film. <br /> <br /> Some of the so-called "critics" have also primarily questioned their "review" to promote their own films. This film is called boring - well, love or hate, one thing you never know about this film is that it's boring. <br /> <br /> Oh, and this reviewer from the Netherlands ??? Um - Liar. You tried to post the same review at Amazon, where it fell. This is only a mixture from Missouri. <br /> <br /> This is nonsense to stop. Love it or hate it - give a real review or give nothing type. <br /> <br /> But if I saw this thing for the record, I was far from the worst though it was not the best I saw. <br /> <br /> In this review we hope that some people will look through the stupidity here.
