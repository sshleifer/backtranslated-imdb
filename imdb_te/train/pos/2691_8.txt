Perhaps the greatest achievement of Beas Luna achieves a gentle balance between great, romanticism and surrealism. Tuff Hooper's "Life Force" is the most expensive tasty Madlya May, the item of the young Beal Durran's pre-teen lust. He was unable to get the breasts of May from his mind and wanted to kill her and kill her own mother's breasts. The film in the pursuit of May. Luna "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!" In the writings, the director brings a slightly curious sexual sensibility to his weird but beautiful story. Common suspects are offended, but open breastfeeding is a breast romantic poem for a woman's breast. The pictures of Jos√© Luis Alcane are gorgeous and Nikola Piovani's score is sweet and richer. A charming movie chaos with a pleasurable anarchic sensibility that makes the Spanish more natural.
