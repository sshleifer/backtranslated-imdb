In this Muppet film, college graduates who decide to bring their successful college music, Manhattan Melodies Broadway, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzy, Gonzo, Raoul, Scooter, Camelia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janees, and Zoot. Unfortunately, any producer meets with Muppets. After many producers are rejected, the Muppets decide to move on to their own. However, Kermit still believes that he can get his performance on Broadway, but after discovering that he has finally sold the show and shows, Kermitt's confession and others do not know where he is. <br /> <br /> Muppet Babies has many great scenes including the Sepp Street cast and Traveling Matt (from Fraggil Rock), scooter as a movie theater excerter, and a live action sequence introduced by a Muppets-filled marriages, including a scene Rizzo and other mice Cook breakfast <br /> My only complaint is that most characters are not included. Sure, most of them appear at marriage, but Bunsen, Becker, Beauzargard and Sweetum have some important roles and Lips will be part of the electric Mayhem in the film as the last season of The Muppet Show and The Great Muppet Capper, and Miss Pigges's Dog Foo Phu Should also be with her (after all, Steve Whitman performs Ina Rizzo the Rat has also played a big role in the film, at the time).
