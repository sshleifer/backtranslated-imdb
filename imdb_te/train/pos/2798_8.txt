Jesse 18 is very smart and wants to play nothing more than football, when she joins with the local team, she needs her parents to sleep again and again, she never chases her eyes, they are very much like Beckham Beckham Very good feel good feeling that does not need to be deeper and complicated, it's just fine. The cast is very good and they like their characters well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the script is very real and very funny. <br /> A great family picture 8/10
