It is a romantic comedy film by Albert Einstein Walter Mathouau, and his friends play matchmaker for his niece (Meg Ryan) and talented Auto Mechanic (Tim Robbins). The role of these major characters increases by the well-known role of the actors' excellent supporting cast. This film is beautiful and fun ... "feel-good"! Hearty recommendations.
