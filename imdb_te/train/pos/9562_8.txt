First things First, Edison Chen has done a fantastic, incredible job as a Cambodian hitman, born and bitten in a cans and a wrestling ring, where he lives on the mantra to kill and be killed. His performance was compelling in Cambodian / Thai, with some dialogues or at least a few lines, perhaps what was in the jet le truck Danny the Dog, <br /> <br /> Like Danny the Dog, the bare talked about the fighting scenes to face the fist. This creates a sense of realism and grit when the characters are cut in chaos in each other to reflect their own lives if they take them away. It's a terrible, gritty and dark film literally and figuratively, and it is separate from the normal run from the mill cap thriller production. <br /> <br /> Edison is playing a hired gun from a Cambodian, running from cops to Hong Kong, his pickup. Chiang Sue-Foi is head of the chairman of the chasing leadership, who has to fight with the independent member Inspector T (Sam Lee) who has joined the team and has agreed with his dream of acceptance. The cat and mouse game begins in dark shades and shadows looking for the seeds of Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> This story is specifically worked on several levels in the role of hitman, and the police. On the opposite side of the law, in each character is not black and white, but shades of ash. With Hitman, he's hooked up and looking at his caring side when developing feelings of love for a girl (Pei Pei) about a maturity, sensitivity, and revealing the heart of the gold. The policeman who has questionable strategies and attitudes makes you wonder how to make a buckle when you are ready to do what you can take to get the job done. There are many interesting moments of moral questioning, how the anti-hero, the tactical tactics have been taken. If you ask, what man does, and the beast, and the changing trends of situations - is that all of us in that dark inner streak? Man? The dot-ബൈറ്റ് డాగ్ will catch you from the beginning and can not go to the end, but there are ways in the middle, especially pulling in its soft moves, and suffering from the fact that it will not end. I have chosen a favorite scene, which should be one of the market food centers - very well controlled and distributed, the breathtaking edge of your seat moment. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you have seen almost everything from the thriller genre, it is particularly recommended.
