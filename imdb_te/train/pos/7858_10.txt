STORM COUNT OF TESS Probably the best film of all of Mary Pickford's films. During two hours, it lasted for a 1922 silent film and continued your interest in 80 years after filming. Marie is one of her best performances, just like the "Great Hit" performance of Mary's innocent, Mary's little supposedly, Mary's little mother, Mary Spitfire, Mary's romance. Previously used in a single movie. The film was surprisingly passionate about the unlawful child of a supporting character in 1922, and at one time our little Mary thought of the unannounced mother! If the Academy Awards were in 1922, Oscar was the best actress of the year.
