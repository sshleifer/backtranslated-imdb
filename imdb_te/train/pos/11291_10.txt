Can anyone purchase this movie? My uncle "hatch" is a real (not reel) pilot. When he fled his wings in the air, he received his wings with his pilot. <br /> <br /> He is only on screen for a few seconds, but my family likes this movie. He was killed in a dogfight in Italy, only 24 years old. <br /> Does it look in the video store like blockbuster? <br /> <br /> It is very cheap to make DVDs these days, and I want them to make the entire lists of these old movies. <br /> <br /> If you know that you can buy a copy, send email at nfny40@yahoo.com. Thank you.
