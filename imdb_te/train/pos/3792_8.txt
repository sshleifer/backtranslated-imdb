I was watching this film before, and I was amazed at how accurate the dialog was for the main characters. It did not look like a movie - it felt more like the documentary (the best part I liked). <br /> <br /> Famous women in the film seemed to me real to any fifteen year old girls. <br /> <br /> In all, it's a delightful film for those who enjoy independent pictures.
