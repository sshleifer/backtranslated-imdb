May and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is awkward because the grandchildren and "children" do not really get to know each other. There is no warmth there. After dinner, May's husband does not know him well, accusing his daughter's cooking and wants to go home. That night he dies. <br /> Now a widow has gone. She is clearly not a passionate marriage or a very interesting one, but she has a purpose. <br /> <br /> She has a person who needs herself, and she has nothing to do with her own needs, but she has nothing to do with her. <br /> She is depressed and unmotivated. She goes to stay with her daughter, Paula, who did not always think that her mother gave her mother a bit after her mother's arrival. She was so angry that her mother was breaking up. Disarmed and stunned, yet she does not even have the power or the desire to make it really right. "I love your mother and I love you." What really do you say (I have heard from my own mother many times the way and have yet to figure out what to do) Paula is a bit (well, a bit more than) is nerve. <br /> <br /> Two women are very different. <br /> Paula was involved with her son, Darren's friend, who worked in the house owned by her son. During Paula's work in the day, May have conversations and dinner with Darren. <br /> <br /> Darren was married to his wife who lived with his wife, but did not live with his wife at home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Darren is attracted to Nick because she provides peace and understanding that she has never received from other women in her life. (Though he is not obvious in the desire to be with him on such a journey, he may be interested in giving him "all to escape", and in the day, he was fulfilled as an unwanted woman and wanted to know her again. Say, the rationale of May <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the end, Paula learns by some, that when she is totally disgusting on the face of Maya, most of her graphic sketches made by her mother, in fact, she is a companion <br /> <br /> This film is undoubtedly seen in many ways. <br /> At one time, in a group of works by Paula reveals through a short article that she hoped to abandon her children, and when they were sleeping, they set out for the pubs <br /> Apparently, when a good mother went to her local pub, left. Whatever the case, her husband revealed in the film that she should not have any friends, so she had nothing. She wanted to do what she wanted. She was disappointed, but she said, because she said, "It's easy." May, though she is not the best mother, may be seen as the act of a woman who has no sympathy for her, May's actions require her to stay "a few minutes" at her sexual time. <br /> <br /> A man who wants to hear a man, be a man, his friend, a lover. <br /> <br /> Paula is distant parents who raised her up, even though she is nervous and sorrowful. <br /> <br /> Many of the more complexities I have said, the more accurate images, and the many, perhaps the opposite, the reflexes that leave the viewer perfectly. <br /> <br /> The one thing that left us is a fear of horror and loneliness. Those who view "right" or "fault" by each viewer, the concept of age and loneliness, many of us fear and avoid.
