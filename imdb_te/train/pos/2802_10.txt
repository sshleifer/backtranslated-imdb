Because I have never been in the sport, I seem to find it hard to go for football (or we can call the American, soccer) - "Bend It Like Beckham". But I said, it's a cool movie! An Anglo-Indian Zemminder illusion (Parminder Nagra) and her WASP friend Juliet Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I say the British and International way) and just worship footballer David Beckham. But Jessminder's traditional Sikh parents do not approve (her mother initially provides a description of the early texts of football). Okay, so it's a clich√© of that sort, but you should watch this movie love! And if it's like me, you may not know the definition of "Bend" in football in this movie ... do not worry, the film explains (I never heard of David Beckham before this movie). We know that Keira Knightley did it a big hit. A few months later, "BBB" In the States, she starred in the same "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl".
