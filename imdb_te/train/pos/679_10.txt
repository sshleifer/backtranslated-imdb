This supernatural Peter Weir thriller is one of the most haunting and lovely movies that really has ever seen. Richard Chamberlain is doing his best performance as an Australian lawyer who protects a group of young Aboriginal victims. When he looks closely to the case, he learns himself about the main defendant Chris. Chris says that he is Mulkurul, a species of supernatural humans living in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, the extraordinary high rainfall is the world's snowing, and the aboriginal prediction coming to the last world seems to confirm. <br /> <br /> <br /> Dream scenes and supernatural effects This is a wonderful experience to extend and make this image. Olivia Hamnet and David Gulpil play the supporting roles, as well as the role of Charlie, who plays the role of an old aboriginal who can replace Charlie. Do not get engaged, as opposed to other superhuman thrillers, as the climax and the latter. However, this is not a pure thriller. It speaks of a drama and spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. Peter Weir, who is visually owner of fairy tales, is an amazing work.
