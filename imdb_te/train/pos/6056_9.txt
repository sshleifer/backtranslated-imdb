Super Speedway makes a great presentation of your new DVD / big screen / 5.1 channel sound system. The IMAX camera keeps you in the race car, where you cruise different tracks at high speeds, a reminder of the driving sequences in the Grand Prix (only on DVD!). <br /> <br /> <br Soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all the engine you hear in the real car. You can not hear sounds when you go under the bridges.
