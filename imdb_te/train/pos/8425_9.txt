In the end, I saw these episodes in 2008 and they confirmed that they were constantly going back and actually produced. They are scary to see what they're saying in the future. Whisper and strange people that lived in Parker and Stone Texas and saw the idiocy of Gov Bush or they pay attention to things. Boo, scary! Bush's frat brothers attacked white house dressed as Arabs armor rifles? Bush 'unexpectedly' anyone running (No, wait.) He may have thought that he was at the time a failure failed, but now it should be treated as horror, principle, and intelligent.
