Spielberg's first dramatic film does not exist. It is a beautifully made image without any errors about the life of an African American woman. This also proves that all the African-American ethnic groups are ridiculed by an African-American director. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] Moreover, Danny Glover is superb as Mr. Mister and is usually the only one in his films. But in this, he is completely branching and another one for once. However, the entire film's performance resistance comes from Woopie Goldberg. She looks amazing as Seale. <br /> <br /> Now I can say that this music version will be a movie too, I can say: I hope it's good to be like this one, because this film should not be lost.
