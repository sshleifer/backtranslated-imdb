The film (for some reason, alternate title "Marshall Law 3") was introduced to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And this is a great introduction. I never heard of him before, he was a fantastic battle. Action scenes in this film are great! There are a lot of them, by the way. Law and order The fight to recruit at is particularly good. There is only one person who can defeat the worst of the group of really fun people. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen is a good choice for the villain. Such characters fit her (but others do not). Matthews Hughes has always done a good job, as always. He is a great fighter and macho-like character, and Wincott's good opponent in the film.
