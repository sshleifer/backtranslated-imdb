Riff Randall, who is a fan of Punk Rock Group Ramones in "Rock 'n' Roll High School", was followed by # 1 fan of actress P.J. Souls did not become big stars. The soles of the feet are so fast, that you are still too old to be in high school (actually all kids are equaled by 24). The film is a fast paced hilarious, not a cop out; Everything was blown out to SmitHines in the end, and it just has to be. Mary Wornov, a sophisticated kinky and funny presence as the principle of Nazi, a great, one-one-at-one beginning with the frisbees on his head) and Dy Young is very good, Kels Ramba. This "high school" is a weak link in the chain-gang, fits ridiculous, Ramones. They can not work, they are not funny, and their concert section will last for a long time. A Ramones song, "I Want You Around", is considered a fantasy and well captured; Other random songs are good, especially at the beginning of the rare Paul McCartney Ballad ("Did you meet before?"). So much happiness! **** from
