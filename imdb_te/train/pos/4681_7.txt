<br /> <br /> However, I really like the similarities between the film and Nicolas Closer. Particularly the role of Adrian Granery is a scene that questions Clooney Owen's character Julia Roberts about Rosary Dawson's sex life about her sex life, similar to the scenery in Closer, although "Love" deals with less confusion and intensity. Notice that both Dannson and Roberts's name are "Anna". Not coincidentally. Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's play and the film depends on Arthur Schr√∂thler's "Regen", so I do not know this connection was formed. <br /> Does anyone have an idea?
