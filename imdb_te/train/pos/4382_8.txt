The same year, "Braveheart" flourished, compared to two costume plays. I accepted my biased attitude towards Mel Gibson, and I will maintain a rational significance for "Rob Roy". "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" both describe the history of Scots in a bloody, romantic style. "Braveheart" is an epic paean of personal respect and courage and a fine revenge fantasy. It is also dramatic, unhealthy and moudlin. Notice the use of its cornflower for slow motion filming. Its torture is ugly and majestic. This is the second quality that is more appealing to the mood mood. "Rabh Roy" overtakes the "Braveheart" compassion levels (not to mention repeatedly), and the next film is more mature and satisfying. Its action is more understated, yet more surprising and clever. Its sex is less attractive and more sexy. "Rob Roy" also has a romantic interest to enjoy. Estimates the poetry of its dialogue period. In the mouth of the actors, its curved teeth try to predict the uterus of the era. Tim Roth is a villain villain. Also recommended: "The Last of Mohicans" and "Patriot." With its importance on blood comedy, you are in line with "Braveheart" equivalent to "Rob Roy". All of the films mentioned above reflect their R ratings of violence.
