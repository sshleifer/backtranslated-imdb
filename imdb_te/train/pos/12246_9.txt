I started looking at the film and realized that I was looking for quality product, so it was not surprising that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and these two films produced by Sue Burtwistle gave us the best 1995 pride and prejudice product! Only six of the six episodes, such as Emma only 3 or 4 or Pride and Prejudice, have not been implemented. I feel like Prunella's standards as Miss Bates, but I liked Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong. The language is very pleasant to hear, and in this day and age, anyone can go to town and imagine without actually saying a word. Samantha Morton, like Miss Smith, is really amazing as actors with Pras and Prezedis. I have seen two times in two days. Once again, thanks to BBC for another quality of television. I've seen the Paltrow version and it's ok but I do not think the BBC version is too superior. Excellent product I am very happy to own on DVD!
