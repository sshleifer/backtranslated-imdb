It's a tricky thing to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress is majestic and harmonious, and on the other, she has almost all movies about Queens as well as the basic plot line that seems to show the vulnerability in the audacity and determination collection to overcome odds. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is very bright as Victoria, but I'm not a good man. I can not help it, but it is not a Mills & Boon novel adaptation compared to another young queen, Elizabeth about a darker, more dramatic film. Hence the Queen of Blonde can not implement the emotions of emotions, at least not her full size, from her youth, young Victoria. To see the old Victoria, check Mrs Brown. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Valli is an interesting choice for the director. He was finally C.R.A.Z.Y. He did it, it was wonderful and added to his fame. It's a very different picture but I remember the beautiful looking and probably the main comparison between the two movies. However Vallee C.R.A.Z.Y. Written by Julian Fellows, I wrote this role and I really enjoyed his Gassford Park, the story for the film is very interesting. I immediately lost all government politics. Lesser participation was because there was no potential execution of monarchy. I said it.
