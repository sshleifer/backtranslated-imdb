For decades, there have been a lot of zorro films, but it is very little to look at one of the best. <br /> <br /> Zorro's Fighting Legion is different from other Zorro films. First, it is a republican serial in 12 chapters. And at this time, Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, did not play the top studio star Zorro, instead played by worker-like actor Reid Hadley. While Hadley does not have a strong presence on those other programs, he does a job well, he has helped him not be the only leader here; <br /> Another big difference is that this setting is not California. The story here lives in central Mexico in 1824, where he plays the Goddess who lives in the area of ​​his own plans to overthrow the newly formed Mexican Republic, promoting the local Indian population and slave group. <br /> <br /> "Do not get me wrong, the episode has at least an incredible cheesy moment, the sound effects for ludicrous performance. <br /> <br /> It's the best thing to do than the whole serials and is not always incomprehensible or slow. Action-fans of the action can notice many bits taken from this serial.
