I always liked Johnny Conco and I'm on the VHS and DVD of this movie. Frank Sinatra is one of the most exceptional performances of the film. <br /> <br /> When Frank first met the title role of the film, he was a brother who was a brutal pistol out of town at this time. The brother kills the heart of the town's heart and Frank takes full advantage of the safe and safe violence in his shadow. Phillis Kirk only has no feeling for him. She is the daughter of Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two other gunmen reach William Conrad and Christopher Darkk and kill Conrad Sinatra's brother and come to his town. They will scare Sinatra, and get him out of town. <br /> <br /> Overnight turns out to be coward from the Sinatra punk and is the one who searches for a kind of backbone. It is well-known that his Oscar nominated acting in The Man with a Golden Arm. For some reason this did not happen. </ P> <p> The other two shows have become a preacher who helps cinetra need to stand for Keane's wine, former soldier, Conrad and Dark. And then the role of his career on the screen is what I believe in Conrad. <br /> <br /> Previously referring to Genie Kano, an unforgettable deal with Conrad and Dark. Let's believe that I am a primer for what you can do when Johnny Conco High None MGM's answer and all of the bad causes the law and order break down.
