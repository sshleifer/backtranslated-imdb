It's an interesting little movie made in 1967, cool amusing twangy soundtrack music and a plot to laugh at you ... okay, it's not really stupid but cheesy is fun. I have seen many similarities between me and the 'Living with the Blue Hand' (AKA the Bloody Dead) and the same director! Scotland Yard's best is to investigate the killings of young girls in a college. It is learned that some of the bad guy's bidders were forced to leave the local prison and returned after completing their work. Prayer Acid Skin has a nifty device hidden inside a Bible and there is another device that can not be nifty or confidential, it looks like a large skirt gun and the victim should be beautiful as they drown before they expire. Joachim Fucherberg plays an inspector and he mostly pushes gum and looks away from distance. There is a "monk", and if someone recognizes this as "Sank", it is better than a red dress with a whip and clothes with a red hood, more than a clan who is in a different color than a monk. There are all kinds of nifty tools, such as a fireplace and a fireplace oven to admit the monk, and where his vertical edge stands on a fire without properly setting a nifty trick. It's odd combo of crime drama with gophee overtones, and it's fun to watch if it's silly at times. 10 to 7, not bad ....
