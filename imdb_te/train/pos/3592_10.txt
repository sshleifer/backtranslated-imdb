Another powerful chic image. At this time, it revolves around Diana Gusman who is getting battles at school. Without getting out of the boxing ring, she gets someone else's anger. She trains to be a boxer and where she meets Featherweight Adrian and begins to fall in love with him. This movie is a great message to take your dreams and go with someone who does not believe you (in this case, her father did not believe her). That image alone is worth the price. Enjoy
