Emory Sinchani Steel Worker, like his father in front of him and in the late 20th century most of the two pillars of his family were steel mill and union. Once the 45,000 employees employed the mill has reduced its number to 5,000 and now it is 1, the plant closed its doors, leaving the same security guard. First and foremost, the newly unemployed Emory and his Pals are enjoying their independence, surrounding the town, and slumping into their favorite band where they are neglected "depth allegations". The mill is repeated again after listening to their union spokesman's optimistic spiel, but reality attempts to sell their personal vehicles, to keep food on the table and to prevent their foreclosures. Emory's father - a special union man - is sure to remember for his short-term closure in his own 35 years for his son back to plant. Meanwhile, some of the unemployed are hopelessly hunt for jobs or trucks, hoping to hap and find desperation for employment. <br /> <br /> Finally the union agreed to its helplessness, as Emory has changed his stubborn father and explains that the mill will not be reopened again. Emory asks with tears "What's wrong with me?" Life, association, life and time of a lifetime of family and family and leave him somewhere somewhere. He falls in the bottom of the rack when his sons lie down on his men, throwing his wife on the floor with drunken anger. Stinging from the plant manager's remarks that the distance from his own home and he and his men did not work enough to justify their substantial payouts, Emory is able to hire steel workers remaining in the town to do something to demonstrate what they still do all of them. At the beginning of the morning they enter the mill, fired the furnace and work harder than in their lives, producing a shift enough high-quality steel pipes to fill the loading docks from the wall to wall below - something plant manager is impossible to think. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you suddenly reach the reopened plant, the Stupid Manager looks around him at a tremendous output from a day-to-day work, and that this product will again benefit the plant. The manager asks Emory: "You can do this every day?" Emory needs to get "No" and the administrator asks: "Then you're trying to prove it?" Emory explains that the decades of hard work, honesty and devotion in their jobs mean that Emory has tears with his wife and children by showing that they can produce a "spin in your eye", and he tries to pull his buddies down to work in the south, Promised. <br /> <br /> It is a powerful and honest treatment for destabilizing American workers by foreign competition, who offer short-term demanding unions and the costs they make for greedy plant growers. Every penny they have earned from their factories has been unveiled but never renewed by them. Peter Strauss as Emory, John Goodman as his best friend, Gary Cole is a sympathetic wife of his college-boy brother, Pamela Reid Emory, and John Doussett as his dying father in the movie.
