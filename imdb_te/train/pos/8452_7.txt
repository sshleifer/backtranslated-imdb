Over-powered mobile suits that can eradicate all armies - check! Rarely targeted weapons and still destroy them - check! Mobile suites based on angels - check! <br /> <br /> Okay - its Gum Series. <br /> <br /> With the characters, the initial weak Renault Dorlan (later Sank Cruceth, later back to Dorlan), Gundra Wing, good character development, real world complexity, interesting ideas, stronger and more independent (though heiro Yuy, character). The above mentioned Hiro, initially a cool, tight bushi, becomes more human and still remains in the role. <br /> <br /> Missing Mildero Peacroft (Oz de Guerrey Jakes Marquis) shows that some people might lose themselves in their own creation as they float between Freelance and White Fang's command. <br /> Political and military situation is very good - it reflects how the real world works. However, in 49 half an hour, this complexity can not be used for its probability, which is a bit of a responsibility. <br /> The main intentions of the series - the struggle, the desire for peace etc. - are also echoed today. In revision, the series has its time, what is "war with terrorism" and all. But these ideas have created some of the best works of this series, the surprising dramatic part of its exploration, monologues, especially the Trium Kushrenada. <br /> <br /> Sometimes good writing is sometimes too poorly, causing dramatic loss of some of its margins. In terms of eye-candy, it's in bucketloads, all from mobile suits, well-made battleships (no-tombones you idiot!), and explode with orange big balls (this is because bad animation has better explosions is). But who cares ?! <br /> <br /> Within a short time, the complexity of the series, if you lost some episodes, you will lose a lot. In poor writing you leave the crying, and sometimes the animation you say "WTF?!?!" But it expects of its classic animation style, its level, sparks of incredible dialogue and its more mature search of japenes animations.
