The film is essentially depicted on the hand held hand held by the actors. In other ways, in some ways a video killer from a California killer is completed due to the attack of "diary" columbine. If the film does not answer all the big questions, it gives you an insight to learn how to avoid it. Through the film, you showed how the actors illegally shot shotguns, piped bombs and came up with an action plan for "Zero Day". Actors (if you can call them) are clever, they are obviously borrowed from their own lives, but at any stage I do not really recognize them (something Tom Cruise should try). The use of CCTV and 911 operators at the end is intellectual, but I'm not sure if we need a very last scene. The whole picture is very good on the very hard stuff.
