I saw it at the age of 17 and did not see it ever since. 'CBS Late Movie' is used to show it in a sequence. I was so sad and it was desperate, which really caused my stomach ill. What they do today is not what they are today, but it's a feeling of being alone in Amazon, losing both parents and looking for a way out, well. I remember a lot of bugs and maggots, most of them are realistic, eating her flesh. It was a dark film that was controversial at the time, though it was strongly modified for the TV. I'd like to remember more details, and maybe even more commenting if I could ever get back to see again. I've been looking for this for years. I feel like showing another title in CBS. I do not know this was always released in the video.
