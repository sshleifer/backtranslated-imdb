This film is very happy. I thought the plot of the film was a realistic and relevant time in American history. The woman always has what she can do to climb the class system. I think that Lilly's character is portrayed correctly and can not do well. I loved it when I realized that love was really true. All the people who have fallen for her in the movie are in love with her, she has given everything, and she has lost her career. Until she met Kurtland, she did not understand why these men were so happy. She did not have the way to end her life. I would recommend this movie to any mature audience, so you can understand the meaning of the film and the plot and underlining meaning.
