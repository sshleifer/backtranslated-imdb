With dipping and amazing cinematography with symbolism, the extent is much more than the romantic drama we all have come to expect. It is almost silent, there are no dialogues in German and more simplified by Jerman. Probably the filmmakers intended the film to reach a wide range of European audiences, because anyone from the high school level could easily share it with the duchet subtitles. The story is no less important, however, with the film being a success story, not a narrative. Signs of Fever and the Power of Nature Kills Human Characters - The flowers there blur the face of unexpected actor Handy LaMarter - movements that remind the audience of Dreier, Vertov and Rifenstall's works. If there is a message to be portrayed, I think it's politically: the bourgeois person is vulnerable and eunuch; The working class man is a happy, productive creature; And woman creator, destined to be fulfilled until she was born a child. The Soviet Socialist Reality and National Socialist Doctrine did not kill this mix of the film anyway - a beauty to see from the beginning to the end - but it is kept in a very different artistic age. And, oh, heyy does not get her kit off.
