The film was originally viewed as your distinctive Western film, however, it was a lot of fun and was very unusual for me. Charlotte Heston (Sam Burg√©e), "Midway", '76, James Coburn, Zach Provo, Jack Provo), "Deadfall", 93, and Zach Sam never forgot, and with him repaid. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey, Susan Burgady, "The Lady of Portrait", 96, caught up in this situation and found herself in the romantic men who did not seem to be left alone. Sam Bourget had to make some tough decisions and I was very surprised at the end. It's a very fun movie and good acting.
