When I first appeared on television, I saw the first version of "A Christmas Carol". It's more than imagined seeing the movie when it's really propagated and lived up to my expectations. Every year I bought a DVD and plan to watch. With the exception of "It's a Wonderful Life", this version of "A Christmas Carol" was one of the best Christmas films I've ever made. George C. Scott is amazing and surrounded him with an amazing cast led by Roger Reese! Scott is once again one of the greatest actors of our time. Scott plays a role in artistic talent and acting, and the role itself is unique. How can you remember both Patton and Scrooge? Scott is so easy. The film is magnificent with wonderful sets, costumes and music in this direction, which depicts a unique concept of film, space and time. You just love this movie and it will be kept as you wish to see in the holiday season.
