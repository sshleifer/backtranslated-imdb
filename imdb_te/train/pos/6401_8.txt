There are many great things to honor men. Good action sequences, "good feeling" scenes, a good musical score, but really great part of what makes the movie great acting. Mostly by Robert Dinero. Men of Honor, Cuba Gooding Jr. played the role of Carba Brisheer. The first African American in the navy wants a deep sea slum. It describes his hardest fight from entering the diving school and being more like a poor farmer. This is a good story, but it happened several times. Several years ago, a person opposed to inequalities, for some sentimental reasons, until they accomplished their goals. This may happen, but many of the struggles faced by Brussels in the film are questionable C.O. His final examination was in diving school. Nevertheless, Robert Dinero finally made it to the scene when it entered the film. Deeper Matter chief plays Sunday, who is at the diving school teacher Brusheir. As soon as Deniro arrives he ignores this stir with the extreme pride you can not hate unless you have the wonderful wilpower. Before the movie ends, Deniro gives off many lectures that you are laughing at how cool he is but you are so stunned that he punches them. Finally you should suspect some of the elements of the film, but you must confess, if this is true, if you touch your seat for the first twenty minutes.
