I have seen this movie many times and I told him, every time I enjoyed it. This is the pinnacle of Belushi's in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are so popular and you can not help but you can not help but the ordinary man to be involved is noticeable. The film has excellent actors, some adults, and others just started. It is a good feeling and what exactly is it. This movie teaches you that life is not so bad. Sometimes you've just gotta look at items from a different perspective that already appreciate what you have. When you finish watching, you have so many things and you're laughing too. You can not ask more from the movie in my opinion, it's not a happy movie and you will not be interested. <br /> From me Rating: 10 I'm out!
