One of the best movies I have seen in the past five years! The cast is remarkably magnificent in the story of young love and courage on the lower east of New York City, with two heroes being super stars. It's funny, lovely, sad and exciting, it's totally refreshing on urban youth, which is in the gutter that holds Larry Clark's frequent-clogged shirt ... I have to confess that the bully is cut over its usual fare. A film that leaves you missing for growing Victor Vargas ... so do not miss!
