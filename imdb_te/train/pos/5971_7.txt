Skippy from family ties goes from clean-cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy picture. The film seems like the metal music was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed their children were turning to evil or killing themselves - this is trying to recover from the grave except a dead satan metal star (helping using skippy). If the plot is wheat and clich√©, carbohydrate (for example, a nasty green fog pick up a girl outfit) and the soundtrack make this movie so hilarious (and great). And of course, Ozzy Osbourne's love song :) There is nothing like playing a preacher asking what happened. There is definitely an image of having some friends for a good laugh. When you are at it, make a dual character with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - Driller killer in black leather w / fringe is a "bad rocker" (as stated in the video box). A cheesy cinematic must watch the fans.
