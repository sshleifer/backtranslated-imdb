"Before Sunrise" should be a fantastic love story and my top 5 favorite movies. Dialog and acting are great. I love the characters and their thoughts and ideas. However, the romantic Vienna does not exist in the film (you can not find a poet sitting in the middle of the night) and can not get all the places in one night, but it's your first night in Vienna (if you're a stranger). But it is not. The relationship between the two characters is very important and this part of the story is not spurious. However, nothing really happened, this film is not always boring. The end is sadly clean without "Titanic" or something. If you do not like love stories, watch this movie! I'm a little skeptical about the sequel to be released in the summer. In my opinion, the first part is perfect.
