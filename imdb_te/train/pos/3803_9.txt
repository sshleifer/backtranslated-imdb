Failure to understand people about this film is not an early, middle, and ending, just the end of the 26th episode long TV series. So you all remember to talk about how the world did not explore enough enough. This was done on TV show. <br /> <br /> The visuals between Lian-chu and GuizZo at the end of the *** Spoiler *** movie, this film has a lot of love for me. When I saw the roles I fought through 26 episodes, I was scared, and while Guizado was running out of her, she was almost tear-jerking with his sharp blade of Lyon. <br /> <br /> When Lian-Chu struggles with these fantastic dragons (pre-series) Guizado is very rare and indirectly we are totally contradictory when threatening to kill Joan. * Shader * I am surprised that this particular scene is not mentioned in the warnings. In the sense I can see that any kid I have is not Gujido himself and is intended to want a young girl to hear the voice. <br /> <br /> The world is amazing, the plot is much better than multi-million blackbusters, and this is a good way to see some of us. Go favorite characters. Check it out. :)
