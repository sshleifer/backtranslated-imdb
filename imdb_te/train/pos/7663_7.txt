According to one rule, the Full Moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid an image. But I enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films, and I shot it. <br /> That's not bad. Not great, but it is something else. The film will have a fight with a mysterious (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the world, and the title role. <br /> <br /> Dr Mordrid is also to deal with people, and in the secular world authorities, he will succeed. <br /> <br /> Follow spoilers possible. Mordridid ​​can travel between "dimensions" and make a fortress-protector colleague; However, the blind is blind. His eyes were ruined. So the Wizard goes his hands across the other eyes, and hey, Presto! His eyes are restored! <br /> <br /> Later, Mordard and his "brother" fight to fight the skeletons of animals in a museum. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is not as bad as it's a comic book. Dr Mordred's "human" adventures are very good, and the cobbler convinces this role. <br /> I saw our trash.
