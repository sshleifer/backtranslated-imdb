The film was directed by Victor Nannaz, who also wrote screenplay (Uales Gold). Nice and simpler writing has been nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, which is looking for Ruby Day a day. The young woman we see is a piece of Ruby's life. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby resided on her and began to establish her own identity. She is looking for jobs, friendships, boyfriends, sex, a typical young adult search. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. I have selected Sundance films as a freelance film enthusiast. <br /> <br /> The stories were completely different, but I remembered no one's fool, watching Paul Newman. The next film is a part of a normal person's everyday life. I like it. The story is very well said, and we sat down and enjoyed the story of everything we had to do. The only thing I was not sure was the title. I'm sure there are not many flaws in Florida, and there are no flies in heaven. I'm allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not a heaven for me, I'm worried about Florida. I'm changing full red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean walking at the beach of Florida City, Florida. In fact sand is very white. I'm there. Favorite Quotes: "The need is always good." "When you find a man, that fuss is not all different, when and when and why?
