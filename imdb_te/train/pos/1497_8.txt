The film is a highly entertaining horror film (Tales from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (Psycho author). It's a great fun for horror fans and has excellent performances. The film also has a look at a funny character from Jon Pertvay (Third Doctor) for Doctor Who fans as a nasty and vicious horror star.
