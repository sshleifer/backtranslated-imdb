Wonderful nominee of the year's best animated feature race in Oscar. It's an Irish film heart, but Belgium and Brazil co-producer, I'm guessing the animators working in three countries. This product is one of the most beautiful and unique images in recent memory. The character is designed with a slightly thicker, black script from the French animated film Two Years of Percephalis. This image is not black and white. Oh no. This image makes great use of its color, some of the most outrageous and startling use of colors I've seen so far. The simple design of the pictures is also very geometric, mainly with rectangles or ovaries. The movie is spending most of the discovery of a circle - the main element of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image. These geometric designs benefit all-the story of a young boy who learns to work on bright manuscripts (Kell's book is a true bright Bible). The film's story is not particularly deep, but it's a pretty good fantasy story. A young boy in Brendan Kails, the big walls surrounding the city, built his uncle to keep the Vikings. Kelly's new arrival, Brother Aiden, inspired Brendan to portray. He lives in a nymph inside the Keller's vacation and to explore the nearby forest. Bruno Collais made an incredible score, almost as good as he did for Coraline, which I thought was the best of the year.
