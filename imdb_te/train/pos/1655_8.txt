Mendez and Marichal gave us a serious, rigorous and painful analysis of social, spiritual, economic and political crises. It expanded in the 108-year colonies of Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> As we refused to face the imperial responsibilities of our country, I met a lovely island with very respectable people, and Puerto Ricans were allowed to die and die. <br /> <br /> Spiritual crisis has created fundamental institutions that protect Puerto Rico's families and protect society. <br /> <br /> The corruption is unhappy that people do not pay taxes (leading to the financial crisis for this country) and the sense of hatred and distrust that the island's culture does not expand. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a more breathtaking image will be produced. <br /> You must see. . .
