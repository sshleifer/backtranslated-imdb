I've seen this movie a lot of times and it's great. The film is also known as "Castle of Terror", "Caffeine of Terror", and "Dance Maccabre". Barbara Steel, her simple cute / creepy self. George Rivier, the male leader, is doing a good job with his role. The whole picture sticks with the atmosphere, and everything is good tension. Camera angles are good and most of the acting is not bad. This film is very suitable for rainy day or evening. I have a DVD pruning version which is very high for the modified TV version. Hold some popcorn, turn the lights back, restore and enjoy. John R. Tracy
