There are some things that are pretty amazing. First, it has to be based on a true story. That, by itself, is incredible that multiple tornadoes hit the same town at night in the fall of Nebraska. The real town's name is close to "Blainworth" (the town name in the movie). There is Ainsworth in Nebraska, but there is also a town that starts with the Blans. <br /> <br /> Slow moving whirls appear when you're at home. On the other hand, the scenery that goes to the TV mess is based on the fact. Before doppler radar and weather radio, if you change your TV to a separate channel (not on the cables) and tune the brightness correctly, you can tell if the tornado is coming. The problem is that then you will be able to hear. <br /> <br /> When I know about the Mid West Tornado, this film makes me fun. I enjoyed more than a twister. I mean, give me a break, you can not make it through the F5 and carry it into a hole in a home.
