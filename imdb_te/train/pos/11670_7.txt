There's a difference in a featherweight plot and dubious characters when there is a movie to see if there's an image of this one. Lively action and stunning stunts - for their day - give this image some real zip. And there is some original comedy from the inexpensive chemistry between the two leads. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the rigorous character of Maureen O'Hara, which is the sexiest of the era of Hollywood. Even if you can forgive it from the time you made it, it is still hard to run. For all the heroism and adult screen off scenes in adults, it's still a little better than a child's good time.
