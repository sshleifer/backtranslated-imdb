It's not an easy image to watch - it's three and a half hours and the dialogues are fully composed. <br /> Furthermore, it is believable and ruthless in the human character, which is one of the greatest films ever in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> The film is discouraging, dull and cruel. (If you want something uplifting, look at Jacques Rivetta's amazing saloon and Julie Go Boating, which was made at the same time). <br /> It is known as the Managage-a-Troye that originated between Alexander (played by Jean-Pierre Leid). , Mary (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronica (François Lebron). Alexander was, however, shown as any other man as chinwist and jealous. Women are more willing to heal and define their femininity by males. <br /> <br /> The film is the most ending of the most revolutionary French New Wave. In the history of film, this movement is one of the most important movements, and it has a serious impact on the film in what we know. Jean Pierre Leyad is one of the main actors of the new wave, starring Les Quattress Sung Coopes (1959) as a rebellious young man by François Traffat (in other films). <br /> <br /> Unlike other directors from New Wayne Wave, Director Jean Estache is not the same. <br /> There is no advancement (unlike John Cassavettes films in the US) and dialogue real-life conversations. The film resonates with Eustache's personal experiences. For example, the former lover of François LeBron Esta. Eustache himself made a lot of real life, based on suicide and Mary character in 1981. Coro and bitterness are distributed directly to the audience that ends in a harrowing monologue through Veronica, the rest of the film breaks the goal of cool. This fascinating, personal, and honest movie adaptation is one of the most vivid pictures of human nature around.
