<br /> <br /> Okay, this film has not won any awards and is a pure bubblegum, and it's a modern update "It's a wonderful life". But it is a cheap release on the DVD and there are a lot of outrageous ways to get $ 13 out. You get a picture with a surprisingly strong cast but most of them are still a year or two from the list of celebrities B. An enjoyable way of passing an hour and half is not just thinking of it.
