Intercutting sequences of people in a shelter are quick intercutting, and montage / superimposition of images, and vague, in-depth descriptions, this is a very hard picture to follow. Apparently a man (Masui Inau) acts as a porter or janitor in a shelter, so that he may be near his imprisoned wife and save her. But she is apparently mad, huddled on the floor, empty expression time and nervousness, misery, and rest of the rest of her face confused by the rest of her face. The filmmaker sometimes changes her perspective, and she sees a vague image of a child sinking on a pond or holding her in a sinking child. She had been abused. When the attitude changes her or other madness, the filmmaker uses lashes and other distorted objects, showing us what we are looking for and then how they react. And this place is fraudulent, laughing, hiding, in a day of dancing and daytime dancing. On one occasion, the man tries to bring his wife back, but the night outside the door frightens her and she goes back to her cell. Gradually the man slips into a nightmare he interrupts in another attempt to steal away, and he killed the doctor and many attendants, and all but mad folklore and laughed. When he wakes up he relieves and the soil moves. In the 1920s, some of Japan's life, streets and buildings were some of the shocking shots.
