OK, so FX is not a high budget. But this story is based on real events. Something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors, even the richest !! Many films are based on books, not just inadequate mummies. This film is based on real events, only a couple, so many people believe it is not knock-off! This picture is too small TWISTER! <br /> <br /> There are a number of things you can remember for yourself with problems with hurricanes and hurricanes in the film ... "night of twisters" took place on June 3, 1980. So the film was released 16 years after the original events. Try to know how far storm surge was ahead. It happened in a big town; The Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. The film calls something to the town, and says it is a small town.
