Personally I can not get into this 'Is Not a Love Song', it's a wonderful movie and it has a great storyline, and I checked my phone every two minutes every minute. <br /> <br /> I love the love between the spike and the heights, where they rely on each other to stay side by side in life. At the same time I wish there was more than what I was involved with. Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike Ibsen't fall in love with Heaton, or he does not know how he loves him. Two parts, betrayal acts, and two men have a big impact. When they really needed one another for survival, another fled and left them.
