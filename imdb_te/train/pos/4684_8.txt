Petter Matteo's "Love in the Time of Money" is a wonderful visual picture to watch. Matthew gives us a clear explanation of human relationships. This is a picture that we seem to tell people about money, power and success in different situations that we encounter. <br /> <br /> With this background being different from Arthur Schichtler's plays, the director currently transfers this role to New York where different characters meet and connect. Everyone is connected to one way or another, but no one knows about the previous conversation. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. Let's see how these people live and how they see the world that lives with their own home. <br /> <br /> All the souls in the film are individually different from each other. <br /> <br /> This is a good act in the direction of Manthi. <br /> <br /> We want to make good luck with Mr. Matthie and we are eagerly looking forward to his next. Work.
