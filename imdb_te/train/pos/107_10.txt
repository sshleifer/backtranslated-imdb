Lars von Termers Europa is a very good movie. How is it Van Troy has a pretty way to tell a story, at least he is with Europa. The whole movie is like an experience even when I see a small television screen. With all the tricks, in my opinion, most of the movies in the top 250 list of the film's full, real and movable piece of cinema. I also think that is probably the most horrible, very Gothic and full movie. All the other are also good, but this is my favorite. The final scene is one of the rare scenes.
