At first, almost never liked Neil Simon films. But there is something about this particular thing, which attracts me and I say it is one of the most entertaining comedies I've ever seen. The second time I saw it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon met my grandmother? <br /> <br /> Ah, they were afraid to sue and shift them to men. And if they are just housewives, how busy the biz stars are fun is. It's a personal review and my grandmother's father, who was 97 years old (she's Walter Mouthou's fantastic impersonation!), But she refuses to find some of these characters. <br /> <br /> I have a little patience for George Burns, but somehow he turned out to be one of the best performances I can recall (and even though my late grandmother also did not recognize the remarkable similarity shared by her character) In a very tasting race, and above, you either laugh and laugh or turn this off. To me, joy lingers.
