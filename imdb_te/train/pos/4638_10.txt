When I was in Israel in the summer, I saw this movie. My Hebrew is not in despair, so the subtitles are very useful, I do not think I would ever miss any of the film. You can use subtitles after about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This film fell out of me !!!!!! Two of the most prominent slogans in the Middle East are: homosexuality between Israel and Palestine. This allows a person to simultaneously enter into two areas of conflict. Embarrassment and emotions have emerged. The film climaxed with tragedy when driving a lover in anger and rage. A complete look !!
