I really do not know what people do against this film, but it is definitely one of my favorites. It is not preachy, it is not anchored by moral, it is not controversial. It is just God. Any possible god is not in religion. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrie Bruce plays the role of Nolan, and the TV reporter usually puts the news easily. Do a good job at an anchor job. This drive is slowly driving away his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston). When the last Strauss runs, he will not laugh quickly, but it yells in the face of God, and gradually gives his powers to Bruce. Bruce did his best for himself, who was convicted of helping others, where he lost the point of his powers. <br /> Meanwhile, his continued enthusiasm about his own life makes him more selfish and leaves his relationship with a dangerous field. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's a long time. But a plot, it works well. <br /> <br /> We know that the stage of fashion that we meet challenges of God is far better than to combine his problems, and he can hide himself better. The first film is in the role of Carrie's pitch-perfect acting character (fortunately for him) and gives the scenes the scenes through the controls and scene. Whether they agree or not, the character is written or rewritten exclusively to Carey. Without him, humor becomes flat, half-hanging. And humor is very good in the first place. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Aniston is very good and does not cause the third action, though some say it. At least, you do not think when you see her. She gives a heartfelt performance and forgets that you are watching a movie, and she and Kari feel very much like a real jest. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be gogooooodd (understand the movie picture), very good feeling, thinks better and better idea than expected and the whole thing is just to lay together to protect Karey's career (which is not Goin anywhere).
