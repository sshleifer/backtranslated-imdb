I accidentally felt in this movie on TV, and I could not leave it ... It was a fantastic film to get people to learn about American history in the Vietnam War, Flower Power Time, and racist fight. This explains the conflict of political views of the nation in the 60s. .... I was born in 1980, and I did not know all the things before ... In France, USA history was a priority and the film really realized me a lot of facts! By the way, I think all actors are great; Especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I see this movie everyday !! <br /> <br /> It's really nice to see this .... it's a shame that's not seen on TV in the movie ... <br /> <br />
