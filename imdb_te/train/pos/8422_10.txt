Gave an extra call to play a common role in a film about the Russian Revolution. Nonetheless, he's not a regular extra. He is a former revolutionary commander in Russia and former commanding general Sergius Alexander, who was forced to relive the same scene, who suffered professional and personal tragedy, satisfying the director insulted by Alexander. This may be the time to finally "break" this broken person to the end of his last war. It was a powerful movie in the exact direction by One Sternberg, giving him a great satire in every role he could do in the role of Alexander. Junnings deserves the role of his Oscar with a very moving performance in his peak and his deep valley. Pewel gives a bad support as a reparative director and Brent is sure to play his role with her face and Jones's love of expression that is very expressive. All around the brightness. Rating, 10.
