The robot jokes are not bothered with the story or the bad effects. I mean, if you know what I'm talking about, it happened in 1990. RoboCop 2 still used stop animation, as did many movies throughout the 80s. If you look at your biggest blockbusters in this period, most of them have been shot at special effects that are available at the time. It was not until Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released in the following year, progress in technology was identified, and the protagonists started using that intention. But if you see this movie, Transformers, Gundam Wing, Power Rangers also have binge memories. The enemy robot is very menacing. It did not want to face a man without a good back-up plan. And there are some great moments in the film. The mole / spy work in the middle of them. You think you'll see it, everything is helping you, and you may be a person who does not expect him / her. And it is a lot of trouble to think so, do not you agree?
