The film is slightly clunky and confusing at the beginning, but sit tight because you're in for a ride in your life. The concept is compelling, with interesting devices used to tell the whole story. Philip Seymour Hoffman's cast is the best thing, there is no surprise. Ethan Hawk is also eligible for credit for a very strong performance. Mr. Directed by Lumet is dynamite. The film is a thriller based on relationships that feel sevens in relation to taking risks in telling this story, but unlike the majority of solemn movies that populate today's landscape, this is a cheerful relationship rather than special effects or product plugs. By the time you invest in this film you get a very great reward.
