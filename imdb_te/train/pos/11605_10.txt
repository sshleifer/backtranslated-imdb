The biggest reason I see this movie is Susan Swift, the exceptional and all-under-actress actress. Time travel movies are generally not interested in me and do movies about witchcraft, but this film is lovely and creepy. It did not rely on the terrible special effects, and it did not focus much on the viewer's lost and confusing time travel. This is a truly creative film that is simple and focused on everything from great acting.
