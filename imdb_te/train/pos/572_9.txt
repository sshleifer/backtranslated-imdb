<br /> <br /> Jess's brother is a dramatic satire in the story of the character of Jess's brother who believes that there is no benefit to the role and who is playing: Craig Shepher / Norman Jess's brother was able to foretell the problems of complete life by looking at how it turned out. For example, in a number of cases where Brad Pitt and his life were running parallel, Jess's brother Craig Sheffer was brought to a tumultuous stroke, and after a few days he found Brad Pitt. Craig Shepher's character has a big emotional crisis at the death of his brothers, since he has a dramatic irony, he has been able to do more to prevent it and eventually creates a more compelling mood in the film.
