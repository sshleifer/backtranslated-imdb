It is one of the best Tarzan movies as suggested by other critics. Unlike other people, I like the beginning of this film, it's like a commercial post that looks pretty definite. Harry wants to go back to the jungle and why it is necessary to excel. The film is also one of the most exciting and terrifying chase scenes at the start. This occurs when the Harry Safari group overcame the tribe of cannibals. Pre-Censorship Production Values ​​are actually very original, which clearly illustrate the terrifying threats the Europeans are going through in the wild. Even though this film is perhaps the predecessor, it provides accurate account of how local Africans are seriously damaged by their white owners. In addition to Sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some great sets and two cheetahs! An adventure classic is not missed.
