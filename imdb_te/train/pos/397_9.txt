I have to confess that the Tui Hark is one of a kind, you can not have a person with a strong presence in the movie. <br /> <br /> The director tried to bring back the classic fantasy stories of Zu Mountain, which he showed. <br /> <br /> Zu's new legend has really evolved. From one of 1983. From this new millennium update, we could see Tui Hark's vision of the mountains of the mountains. Excellent visual designs, fantastic action fantasy epic make up pretty well. He caught me through the whole movie. Great cast with good acting. <br /> <br /> Now the down side is absolutely confusing with a wide heroic story shortened to a 95-minute film. Plot characters may not have too many relationships, but looking back at the movie, you have a good sense of understanding the characters. Some complain that the enemies may not have physical combat, including the characters that have the supernatural powers to defeat, and the struggles with hand-to-hand execution are not really meaningful. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this nice stylish picture. It may have a narrative story, but hey in Sunie Hark's "Time & Tide", we were confused with the plot, but it was really beautiful and wonderful. Sunie Hark Always H.K. Cinema. American audiences may find it hard to understand when looking at the film, not the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the whole new style. It's not a masterpiece, but special effects are really good than storm riders. This is really worth checking out.
