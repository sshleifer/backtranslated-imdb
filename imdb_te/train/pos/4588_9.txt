PG-13 for violence, brief sexual humor and drug abuse. <br /> I saw Police Story twice. In my opinion, Chan's best film from Police Story 80s. He did it because the Protector did not like the other police movie to star it. I have not seen the Savior so I can protect. Acting is not too bad and the plot is pretty good. I have seen this film for a while but this film has good action, stunts and comedy good chan movies. If you find Police Story and Chan is a fan buy this movie! <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p>
