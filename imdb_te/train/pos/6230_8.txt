1936 The most productive year for Astier and Rogers. Their second film for RKO was the third film of the film. Mark Sandrick 'Follow the Fleet.' This time, Astier Baker Baker, and Sheri Martin (Rogers), have a painful discomfort as a marine camel that goes to make mistakes in the CD Waterfront Cafe that plays romantic sweet dances in every ear. Yep, you guessed it ?? They are hot again to each other. This time only Sheri's spinster sister, Connie (Harriet Hollard) threatens the whole penalty for falling bacon's budding friend Billy Smith (Randolph Scott); A kind of use 'em up and toss' out of the guy, thereby rethinking the viewpoint of the show and compulsorily revising the opinion of all sailors. Irving Berlin's standards 'Let Yourself Go', 'All My Goods in One Basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance;' A divinely inspired skirt about the suicide that became another immediate detective and completely dazzling pose duck for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> The transfer tad weak on 'Follow the follow' is weak. The gray measure is nicely balanced but now it's thick looking with not nearly tonal variation like previous titles. The grain still exists. So there are age-related artifacts. Once you are settled into slightly more dense and sometimes more softly focused image quality, the overall impression is more than acceptable for this vintage image. Audio mono but very well balanced. Extras are a feature, theatrical trailer and the smallest thing, but there are exceptional? No audio commentary. The significance of the film is an exceptional monitoring from Warner Ho's video in the entire protocol of Astaire / Rogers.
