Today, Spielberg's "The Color Purple" is largely selected by eleven Oscars and Jilch. Spielberg did not even nominate him for best director. <br /> <br /> The story was originally anxious about the trials and trials of Sally Johnson (Wopie Goldberg), her first wife and then her abusive husband. The film has expanded for many years and focuses on Sally's relationships with women around her. <br /> <br /> The story is an interesting factor, at times it is concentrated in humor, but the main character's struggles are in Paramount, from the perspective of a definite women. Some people may not appreciate the change in the tone at the end of the film, but in the low picture I move in my eyes. Nevertheless, the film received three Oscar nominations for acting. : Wupie Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). <br /> As I mentioned earlier, I think Spielberg has not received the best director nomination for his efforts. Such removal beggars believe because Spielberg's direction is top-notch here. <br /> <br /> Quizzy Jones is not particularly crazy about the score, but it is nothing less than average. <br /> Finally, this story is a satisfactory one, a major film producer who works from Pulitzer. It'll be like a try and I'll baffle you about how much I can treat on Oscar tonight.
