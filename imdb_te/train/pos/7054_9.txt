I thought that the film was much better than most critics. Although it does have its confusing parts of the plot, it does not interfere with your understanding of the movie too. If you are not told that you are not open to more liberal political ideas, this is probably not a picture for you. I thought all the actors in the film were the best. Each character has their funny moments and the whole thing of the audience is laughing at the Tribeca Film Festival. I felt a tad top of a particular area of ​​irony, but deliberately done. Although set in the future, John Cusack is exactly right, which really makes you look right now.
