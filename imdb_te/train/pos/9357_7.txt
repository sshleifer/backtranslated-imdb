In New York, the family dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadley) meets his former colleague and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) on the street. Charlie became a lonely and disturbed after his wife and three daughters were murdered on September 11, and Alan faced difficulties to discuss his inner feelings with his wife. Alan maintains his friendship with Charlie and they are close to each other. <br /> <br /> Allen Charlie attempts to fix his life, sends him to psychologist Angela Waqarst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has a strong reaction to treatment and sent to court. <br /> <br /> "Over Me Over Me" is a play about good loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11th is not irrelevant to the story; This is a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as Donna Remar's sex abuse by Alfon, played by gorgeous Saffron Burrows. But family play works, supporting great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is quite impossible to recognize, she does not know whether she will make a high makeup look old, but her face is weird. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Rain Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
