Attractive and undisturbed look at the first cousin of Edith Bowie Biel (Big Eddie) and her daughter (Little Eddie) Aunt and Jackville Kennedy Onassis. They live in a rooftop basement, a low-rise building, which is considered a health problem by the city. It would be very quick to say that this is two exceptional past. Little Eddie is 53 when she is ten when she is ten years of age. The first ever conversations were Big Eddie for Little Eddie panic, she was abandoning her potential authors and destroying her career as a writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions are usually very rhetorical, useless, and sometimes fun. In the latter half there are long struggles of singing by two parties. Of course their songs are perfect and it is only the other that sounds bad. In a spectacular scene, Big Edi actually physically attacks Little Eddie with his cane to stop his warling. It is very attractive and some of them have a feeling of intense exploitation, and it is too far to get to know things. Filmmakers appear to be treated like a leash at the circus, every day (and chuckle) can come about any bizarre behavior. Finally, it is a tragic film showing how the world can be divided into two countries. Their hopes and dreams are as decay as the building they live in. Despite their frustration these two need more than each other ever. There is no shelter from loneliness without the other. The most wonderful punch comes from Big Eddie that many cats relieve her bedroom. Her response to the smell is just unbelievable.
