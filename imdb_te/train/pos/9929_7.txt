This film is based on a very true story. Initially it was based on a true story, sort of. <br /> <br /> Domino starts speaking with Lucy Liu, working for the FBI. Domino is questioned about what he knows about the 10 million dollars stolen. By past moments, Domino is a child and model, and we are wondering how she is a bounty hunter. She basically tells Ed and Choco, 2 other criminals. They will join her in the group. She is tough and can use any kind of weapons, and she will make her look good if necessary. <br /> <br /> They participate in a scandal going to Klimmant, a bailiff. Also, the group begins a reality TV program, and that's where Ian Gerling and Brian Austin Green take part. They are similar to the hospitality and are really disappointed to appear in this regard. <br /> <br /> I thought this story was fun and some laughs. Editing did not bother me. There are too many tortures, mainly guns and blood. <br /> Final Verdict: Good enough to watch.
