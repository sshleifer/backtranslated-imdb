No message. No signals. No dark undercurrents.Just put through get-throughher with people who have a wonderful melange music, nostalgia and good fun apparently doing it. It refreshes some of the naked garbage stands by studios. The course is worth watching anything with the incomparable Judi Dench. And Cleo Lyny's amazing jazz singing is a bonus. This lady Ella is in the last league. This goes back to my movie shelf when I feel a warm experience and feel the need for a hearty good-natured chuckle. Just a wonderful picture!
