I enjoyed all versions of this story but this is my favorite time. George C. Kate gives the depth of the screws that others do not give. This film shows more about why he is bitter. Changes in the screw are visible when different ghosts and faced with the events they show him. <br /> <br /> The film has the best little TIM so far. He is the oldest age of acting as a teenager in other films. Anthony Walters still has everything or more of his baby teeth. <br /> <br /> <br /> David Warner is a wonderful performer of Bob Crochett. He is a versatile actor. He painted a man who clearly loves his family. He puts it up gracefully because he offers a family because he plays a role in daring but an honorable role under Scouts' thubb. Susanna York and other actors play a good job of bringing the characters to life. Edward Woodward is the best Ghost of the Christmas gift that I have ever seen. Very often he will play as a fun Santa Typing role. In which he showed anger at Schr√∂g's stance and would really make the screws rethink. <br /> Textiles and sets really brought Dickens time to London. A wonderful picture.
