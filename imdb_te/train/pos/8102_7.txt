Come to Things is a historical film. Along with Metropolis (1927), it became one of the first great science fiction stories. This is one of the first doomsday films. This is how filmmakers predict the beginning of World War II within a year, and this is in the real world. But the film is out of realism, showing World War I (not only nuclear weapons but inxicated gas in 1936). <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film is the sensational use of stunning scenery, designs and matte films - later becoming a science fiction genre. After Things to Come, with the b-movies of cheap manufactured, science fiction was identified with a stereotype that was not broken until 2001, more than 30 years later than a space odyssey. If they drop down the effects of the film, things are very different in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and some of his co-stars have played a number of roles in the film. Massie portrayed a great "doctor who" tries to win people of a devastating country that ruled a popular (for the 1970s) civilization from a common leader (the most efficient performance by Ralph Richardson). In the end, the plot applies to 100 years. <br /> Maybe in such episodic film - it is somewhat reminiscent of intolerance - it's a traditional plot, but I thought it could make more material, and despite the visuals in the final third of the film is really amazing and worth the entry price ... The plot is lacking and the film is also getting suddenly interesting. <br /> Come to Things Every serious science fiction hub should be seen at least once. However, unlike metropolis, it may not bear repetitive views.
