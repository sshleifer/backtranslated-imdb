Chuck Jones 'Hare Conditioned' is a fast, often happy cartoon. If Bugs Bunny pot against a strange, yellow skin apartment manager who wants him, 'heur conditioned' will take full advantage of its multi-purpose setup. Chase Bugs and his explorer are driven by different units, which can lead to an inspired gag, which quickly emerges from various sections wearing clothes associated with parts of the store. However, bugs that transform this great gig to the elevator boy, trumpet the real manager with the elevators to bring the store manager uninterrupted or off-loaded elevators. This will lead to a very funny final gag, which is a brilliant fantastic set piece. At the time, however, 'Hare Conditioned' was recognized as one of the greatest chase films that burst into the forest force. Since Bugs is more refined in other cartoons of this period, 'heur conditioned' showed him to be more anonymous.
