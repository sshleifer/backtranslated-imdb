In this great (1928) silent comedy, the great and infamous Marian Davis shows her the subject, which displays excellent William Hines. Davis plays from Georgia who crashed Hollywood with help from Heynes. They appear in less comedies until Marian "discovered" and became a big dramatic star. A great lampoon in Hollywood and its prestige. Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hawthorn, John Gilbert, Eleanor Glenn, and Marion Davis (you would like to see) is an amazing team of Davies & Hines (they never did the tachy together) and the guest shots) as an owl. Whether for any serious image effect or for anyone interested in Marian Davis who is still abusive!
