I do not think many of the Bragg Hamlet movies are good, but I think it's awesome. Like almost every product of Shakespeare, it has problems and it has hard choices, not all that work. For example, "every secret secret door", just does not work. That element does not achieve the ominous sense of the metaphor or similarity that it seeks, which is very painful in the play and loses its trademark sense of thousand secrets. This is a big problem for this product. And even though it's big, I'm excited to say it's the only problem. Almost everything works beautifully. All right, so Branagh's title role is too old a worm. And the relationship with Ophelia is a little forceful. And he sometimes gets very crazy. But it is. There are no other complaints. With these flaws, I think this version is a seminal, and if it is not as powerful as a drama, every bit must be equal to literary work. We have the full text of the longest version of the game that we have brought to the screen more extensively, which is written on full and modern and most understandable voices - even when they speak very quickly to get heavy text. But in Shakespeare's performance, the audience can not speak slowly enough to really appreciate the full depths of the language. For this, the drama must be found in print forms. <br /> <br /> All the actors of this version are merely mesmerizing and fully and promptly classic (with Jack Lemmoon). Julie Christie is certainly the best of Gertrude, and American actors are surprised, esp. Charleston Heston as King of Kings - Who's Who Thinks It? (When Heston once played on the Hamlet stage, and a reviewer in the front row said he was loud, "It's terrible", Heston answered right from the stage: "Yeah, I wrote this rubbish!" This may not be true, but this is a funny story - And if it is true, a bold and contrary choice for Bragg here to include Heston.) Robin Willi Inc. "Young ojrik" <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a very well-built version, are the most important scenes in my mind, the most cirasmaraniyamainadi. However, I saw the film as I was interested in Shakespeare (and Lohrman's formidable Romeo + Juliet), and it gave me a great impression. As the second BBC version of Dark Jacob's 1980 BBC version, I thought of my favorite, Branagh Hamlet. I was probably working more like Brannog's Shakespeare's wishes, finding him an expert commentator and celebrity, appealing to the words, and the deep and appropriate and unforgettable excitement of the lesson. In the world of Shakespeare, Olivier and Branagh, and Olivier's best actor, Branagh Shakespeare, from the footprints of Snowboard and Artifus, are no active, lighter, popular, and self-respecting worlds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
