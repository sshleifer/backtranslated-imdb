An older version of Hollywood secrets than a horror show is unseen. The picture is a bit slow but keeps all the weird images alive and visible. The basic idea of ​​young girls in the dungeon is old, but it is valuable to see good performance and production. The film is important for its emotional impact and is not exactly for any obvious action or special effects. I rate it from 10 to 8.
