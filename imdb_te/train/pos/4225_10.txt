Ruth Gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers ever to face Colombo. And, all the way around the plot is ingenious. It is one of the best Colombo episodes. Mariet Heart and G. D. Spaldlin are excellent in their supporting roles. And Peter Faulk offers an extra little bit of his scenes with Gordon.
