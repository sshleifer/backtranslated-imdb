"Yes, Jorgio" is a lightweight and cheerful image / comedy with beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie but it's a movie I've seen more than once. If some critics want to enjoy pavarotti, they will be better off taking the opera DVD. However, the opera talent of the full opera Pavarotti may be a good representation, often seeking a opera outfit, and has completely hidden conceals of the person's appearance and nature. "Yes, Jorgio" allows Pavarotti to use his spoken voice and allow him to show a personality and character in an opera. <br /> <br /> Many critics have found this story unreliable; I do not agree. Being smart enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people - the most talented people will be both self-centered and lovely. In addition, people who are very different from each other often get ideas about them and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who can not choose who are not elected on their own. <br /> <br /> Make sure you go into a portrait of Pavarotti at the peak of your vocal abilities, It's time to get closer to the turntiate of Pussy's end.
