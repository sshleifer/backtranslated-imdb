Simon's carefully written conversations are actually electrified by Mathau and Burns. You can literally hear the script cracked. There are some films that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script. For example, the renowned reunion scene involves low-quality actors. Matteo Willy Clarke (of course, Oscar Moreeso in the Odd Couple) was born to play, and the characters in the role of Matthew (he lives in the city when Lewis lives in the country with his controversial and habit with his sentence, which is the most logical example of Lewis "From Touch" ) I have seen any actor in any role ever funny Annually drama or anything else. Period. Mattau and Barnes work wonderfully together; They contradicted Simon's remarkable handwriting when creating a comic conflict. This film is just the ultimate "must see" and a prestigious prestigious place in the pages of movie history.
