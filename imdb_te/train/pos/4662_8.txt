I saw the hot million in TCM and I completely forgot this gem. Ustinov intelligently creates a clever and divisive plot going from intelligent to two bit con man ... well you see. Maggie Smith has a hard time holding the job but the rays through this film is perfect as the male secretary / neighbors who have that warm and powerful personality. <br /> <br /> Milden and New Heart are the best executives and come out of their own comic life come. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Seychelles Romero are just a pleasure to see and I have at least extended to hand to help Ustinov work to know the case of Romero. <br /> <br /> The film is intended to fire back at the age of the growing computer age and the problems with the average cannman or man for that matter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
