After watching the trailer I was surprised that the film never did in the theaters, so I ordered BluRay. I have a great time watching and have to say that this movie is better than some major animated films out there. However, there are its flaws but I still can really recommend it. The animation is very well done, very entertaining and unique and the story kept watching it until the end of me. Some backgrounds are just dead-dead giants, seen behind the French talent. I thought that the performance of Forest Whittaker was a bit lifeless, but the character was portrayed by Lian-Chu. Overall, thumbs, I really liked it and I hope it has been successful enough for all studios involved to continue doing great movies like this. I would recommend giving me an opportunity and wondering how big a movie is with a small budget. His moments are some of the stitch-like ones, and hectare alone is worth watching this movie.
