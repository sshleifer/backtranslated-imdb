Hickory Dickery Dock is a good poiot mystery. I agree that I read the book, even though I was an avid agatha Christie fan. Despite its problems, humor, and valiant efforts to get it right, moreover, lost a little and the events that led to the final solution have been moved. I thought some of the mystery padded so there were some slow moments. Nevertheless, I would like to see how the Hickory Decree Dock is portable, which has a very similar visual style to the excellent ABC murders, and what really sets the atmosphere, dark camera work and dark lighting. Dark movements were somewhat creepy, which helped a lot of haunting music in a Poirot adaptation, perhaps one of the Nightmare's One Two Buckle My Shoe. The plot is complicated with all the necessary ingredients, although stir my shoe can not be moved, and somehow a good thing. This acting is very good, as David Suchet Papad, and does not do justice to Philip Jackson and Pauline Moran (I know I can never use this term, but it's not good to explain his performance in this series). Their compelling characters are brilliant. And the students are great people and the whole well-developed, especially Damien Lewis like Leonard. Not all in all, solid mystery but best not to rank alongside. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
