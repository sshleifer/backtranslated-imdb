Her newly motivated (by Nietzschek's works) with Barbara Stanwyck is an amazing, pre-coded tale of her disposing of sensitivities and exploiting herself and using men for her purposes. The German philosopher was not really fair, but it was the year when Hitler came to power. Stanwyck, even in this young version does not have much for me but she definitely performs well here, the performance of her and the forward image. Most of the meat may not be performed here as expected, but there are hazardous conditions and surprises like quips and induedo. Great fun, not a distinctive glamor of men, and I suppose all the honest gold dug and very attractive view of the male. Still, it's life!
