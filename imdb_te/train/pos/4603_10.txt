It's not common for Jackie Chan's films, but it's here. There are a lot of funny items, but there is some very hard and extreme weather about it. Jackie is terrible and moody here. He is not an attacker, only then fights back (in the usual laid back pattern), but he can go there and start anxiety. His manner of hitting the bad guy in glasses is amazing. Every time it is "cracked!" I especially enjoy the scene when I am going to the jackie pub and the villains facing his girlfriend. It is one of the best blitzkraxes on screen. In addition, the whole scene was filmed with the background of some of the action scenes on the wall (it appears as "Robachi" poster from our Soviet era) and a few lines in Russian on the left (I quite accidentally noticed). It looks fantastic (and nostalgic for the Russian people). I also love playing the windows in movies. This thing is very much here. <br /> <br /> All the films in this movie are good. I'm preparing to see the quality down-slide but I have seen the perfect trilogy with feeling and unbelievable battles (and Jackie Chan's character is only seen in three films - it's awesome and keeps on). <br /> <br /> I want to describe every movie as a few words: No.1 - in all subjects (in all subjects - from the very end to the story of the past) and the funny (many scenes are ridiculous); No.2 - Raging (Jackie really * beep * off here) and painful (Jackie comes to violence); <br /> <br /> Nominally, I'm undoubtedly. Others. <br /> It can be seen again and again (at least through my) a trilogy. Action / Humor is in top 10 in its jewelery. Finally it was released in Russia on DVD (second best film - Chinese / Russian soundtracks and English / Russian subtitles). <br /> <br /> 10 to 10 solid.
