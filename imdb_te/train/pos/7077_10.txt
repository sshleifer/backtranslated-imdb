One of the greatest science fiction writings of all time, Blade Runner or Gilliam's own Brazil, makes it a visionary and thoughtful inspiration. Willis will give his best performance here, but he's overtaken by the most insane turn of the Pitt without anything he did before or after. Even while Stowe does not out of her league here, though. The story is very layered and offers a lot to think about. The climactic scene is pretty amazing, and the final lines fit perfectly. The scenes in the mental hospital are serious and are still very funny in their own way. There is a lot of dark humor in the show. Fantastic production design and worse cinematography. In my first ten.
