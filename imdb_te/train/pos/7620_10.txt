Last is the best TV series. First, it has great actors and superb directing. The writing was a very controversial issue because the writing of the first two seasons was exceptional, but the post-season writing was the most critical of the season. For example, who is Jacob? Why are the polar bears on the island? What is fog? How is the island disappeared? Who is Richard Alpert? Many people have lost the writers and they can not explain the questions and mysteries. I believe that these people are wrong. I have faith in the writers. I think that if you leave the mysteries, you lose all the charm of the series. Nevertheless, it is a losing great TV series and it will last a long time.
