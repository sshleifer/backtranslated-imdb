I really felt it was not this bad. A great work of art but Dermot M is a strong performer by far. The Patricia arquette has increased the time. He was really impressed with Cello, and his lines were never forced. Moreover, he is a wonderful person. Really sexy. Add that to the talents, and he is quite acceptable to anything. He does not always hit the very highest mark if he has some of the projects that always give him all .. In most cases the actor is not wrong. There is some strange films that he does not resonate at the box office unfortunately. Always with A-list actors but not always a "hit". But he has "every penny value" of any DVD or rental on any DVD. See the wedding date with Debra Messing - one of his best movies. Every penny is worth it! ; ) (If you do not yet see, do that, understand the quote!)
