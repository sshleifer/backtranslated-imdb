*** This should not be considered a spoiler, but be careful than I careless *** I never saw this movie when I was little. I first fell in love with my three daughters. <br /> <br /> She is an amazing voice for Cinderella for the small acting made in her lifetime; Very attractive; Very believable. Music is really good for the movie. Performance was great; Loved rodents !! You really are "hated" by Lady Tremain and Phase-sisters; They're just awful. <br /> <br /> These love stories, especially if you come in love stories, is a fantastic picture. My daughter has seen the film 25 times and is finally happy.
