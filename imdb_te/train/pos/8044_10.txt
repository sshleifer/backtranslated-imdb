First of all, I was a fiery movie I had ever seen. It includes a full-time slapstick, sexual humor, and a cleverly thoughtful stand-up. But it goes deeper than that. Soul Associate's original love story (which we have not seen often), I hope there is love, two people who love each other can work through their troubles. And such a humorous life (I believe all of us) accept people who really care. Chris Me was an amazing performer like Barry Singer, who wanted to win an Oscar. The film is brilliantly written and I hope to see more images from everybody in the future.
