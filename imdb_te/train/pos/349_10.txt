I call it stupid, but I totally love the 2001 horror film, Valentin. It's very well made, well written, well-featured, well directed, etc! Everything about it is amazing! Very funny and creepy (peighing death), and just plain heartbreaking (the first scene) is a lot of fun (Lilly's death) and very funny (www.Bleed-MeDry.com) episodes. David Bournez, Denis Richards (who met with them, and while filming the film - autographographs - very good people!) And Marley Shelton. I am very sick to the people called this movie "another clone clone". This film, in any way, is a scream clone. In fact, the film runs the rings around the screen. It really makes sense! The scream itself is not the only film that it has a mask killer. Sorry, but there's also a clone of scream (ahem ..., Friday 13, Halloween, and many other scary movies also have masked killers). I also think that Cupid's masked killer's strange intelligent. It's a sweet, lovely face looking at all these awful things is fantastic. Another strange (nose bleeding) will make way for an amazing finish! The end brings me cold every time I see !!!!! <br /> <br /> If you do not like the first time, look again to Valentine and give you another chance <br /> <br /> My new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Soon ...
