An amazing horror image that gives you a cool time once you have settled with it. The atmosphere is very creepy and stylish, the score is chilling, but it has performances which are best about the film. It is rare to be afraid of performances and the film's solid performance plays an important role in the frightening factor. <br /> <br /> This story is very interesting and draws your attention in the first minutes. Even though black women do not have much screen time, the audience gets cool in some spectacular scene. Dialogues are very detailed and your imagination will work and when it's really scary. <br /> If you have the chance, this is a completely different experience in the theater, but it is scary. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Ghost films, for people who wants to be scared.
