Compared with the complexity of "The Sopranos", "Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas" Each character has layers of thorough and thoroughly three-dimensional layers. We care about Tony Soprano, who is bad in good versus bad simplicity. Soprano is the most provocative, complicated and attractive character ever created in history. If you're in the mood that you should be openly challenged as a viewer, and watch the "Sopranos" to change your feelings from time to time. I explain that I sat in the first episode of Season 1 and did not want to continue the series. Each season is perfectly in its own way. DVDs are required for all 4 collections
