In Stand By Me, Verne and Teddy discussed the solid, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often talked about who was winning most of the fight. Sometimes we get irrelevant and compare boys like MacGyver and Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now we talk about boys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a nonsense comparison that Lee feels dead, but it's a fun one. If you see from Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Masks you must at least say you are right against Chan. <br /> <br /> In this film he appears as a martial art god. <br /> <br /> The black mask is about a man created with many other people, supreme fighting machines. Their sole intention is to win the wars of losing other people. They are invincible in some ways. The movie is now in the premise of the film, but it is a wonderful dance-directed action scenario. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a miracle. He can do with him and his bodies in a way that no man can do. <br /> <br /> Unlike marshal arts in the film, the black mask is strong with humor and jet is due to chemistry with his co-star and police. Officer. They are great together. But to be honest. If anyone reads this review, they would like to know if the movie is a kick ass in the action section. And that answer is an amazing yes! Lots and lots of gory null action. You love this movie.
