This is definitely one of my all-time fav episodes of trek. It's going to be a lot cooler in the film. The guys first to an alien planet thats about ticks that explode. They meet a freaky librarian variety (played very well). Kirk himself then tries to re-transport the 16th century land. McCoy and Spock attempted to follow, but in the past a 100,000-year-old frozen version of the aliens was killed. Kirk makes it possible to deal with Locked and Witchcraft, but Spock has some amok time with a sexy cave girl who has captured some of the bad guys in this frozen and awful world. At McCoy and gives a royal assestment whuppin 'doc indicates they need to look for a way out. Anyway, they finally run away, leaving behind poor caves. The spock will eventually take a ton before it leaves and leaves it. At the end you can literally taste pain. She left the cave in a frozen wasteland was cruel and really touching. Love has come out of his Valkin mind to be back and forth from his lovely ambition. <br /> <br /> Get the most bang for your buck with this episode. A love story, Salem witch trials, desperate to leave the whole spontaneously spontaneous ... leaving behind, and three totally different settings on the alien planet. It's amazing that they managed all this jam in a fifty minute movie. This is a classic, do not miss it .... I want the DVD fer shure vulcans it !!!!!!
