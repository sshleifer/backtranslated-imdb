I saved "gray shades" as a good clip show episode that went out on a limb and eventually stolen the life and death struggle of Commander William Thomas Ricker, who is facing a deadly disease. <br /> <br /> The scenes of Moody Ricker's flashback sequences were well executed when they received his romantic feelings like "11001001", "Angel One," and "Up to Longer". The tragic movements are highlighted in "Evelyn Skin", as well as "Heart of Glory", "Conspiracy" and Tasha's death in the context of the pulse-hitting risk of the "Evil Skin" mentioned above. Ricker also performed boldly by telling some funny jokes, "My ancestor once blew through a ratlesnake ... After 3 days of severe pain, the snake is dead." This episode has put pressure on Will Ricker's psychological ordeal. And, YES, I am partisan in my opinion that during a virtual broadcast, "gray shades" as a solid piece, because my face is covered in sweat, wondering how will my face recover alive and wondering <br /> <br Over the years, I have created a singular impression of this particular episode ... But, the award is to go for "Best Clip-Show Episode in Television History" I think this part is considered to be more in this case.
