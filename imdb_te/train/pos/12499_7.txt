I have always been talking bizarrely and guilty (because I'm a very well-educated non-teenager), but actually Olsen's twins are sort of, I respect movies. Target audience. A traditional Mary-Kate and Ashley movie "Rome" is full of adult love, such as foreign travel, accents, motorbikes, "B" storyline, fashion trend and credits, as well as gag reel. I enjoyed it. While "in Rome" and other Olsen twin movies are nothing to do; Most of the time, they are broadcasting only in the video, and they will be disappointed by the people I expect to see this film next to "Citizen Kane" or "An Affair to Remember", this film and expect that it is anything other than another Olsen couple film. <br /> <br /> That is, the fans of the Olsen twins really enjoy them. It's great to see those who have seen them from the first episodes of "The Complete House" are getting more mature characters. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br As long as I am still in touch with the film and I have some time to challenge those challenges Take. Olsen refuses twins: Olsen should not be a teen "Valley Girl" from California, to be a fan of twins. In fact, it's not really a target audience. If it is, MK & a fashion line of clothes and accessories will be run by gap or some such store, not Wal-Mart. While "in Rome", which is "high" and having two girls in a valley in the world around the world, it's not really ... it's places to read young children. Some of the cute guys on motorbikes means setting the image in a glamorous overseas city, so it does. It's called marketing - you are selling an idea and selling it by appealing. At least they're sending a good message, which means a little surface. <br /> <br /> Do not beat the film until you see it, and do not beat it after you try to understand what the Olsen twins do: They encourage young people to be creative, natural, and driven younger. This film does that, I think, like their others. Children - have fun. Parents - do the same. If you want the Olsen twins, you will not be disappointed.
