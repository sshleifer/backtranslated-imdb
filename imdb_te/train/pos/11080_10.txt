First of all, when people hear 'Guy Richie', they immediately snatch. Yes, Snatch is a good movie, but the problem is that everyone is connected to Guy Ritchie Snatch. They do not expect him to explore new boundaries. The film is different than a revolver snatch; It is very dark and very complex. The reason I gave 10 ratings because I came to see revolver 3 times the meaning of everything. So this picture toys with your head. <br /> <br /> The movie is different than the snatch. It's amazing, cinematography is beautiful, and you can recognize Guy Richie's personal touch (direction style). <br /> <br /> What is the complexity of the leader who succeeded me, the more questions than the answers.
