Tom Cat, Jerry Mouse and Spike The Dog (here is Butch, his third name, his second creature 'Killer') decides to sign a peace treaty for all mutual love. It's weird and a bit unnatural this all of them will see a friend's buddy and their friend will think so much. But in the end thanks to the disagreement on a steak, everything is normal and what it looks like. This small one is edited into one of the three spotlights on the new Spotlight DVD and I do not cloak why it is. This cartoon "Tom & Jerry" can be seen on one of the DVD's disc of spotlight collection DVD <br /> <br /> My Grade: B
