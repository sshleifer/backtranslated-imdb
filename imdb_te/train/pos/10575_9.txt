Fast-paced, funny, sexy, and amazing. Cognny is always amazing. Blondell gives you her wit and power. It is clear that this is an early censorship film of the script, textiles, and the way they touched each other. And bikinis are in front of bikinis! This is not forbidden for everyone. I do not understand if the issue of John Garfield. Whether he is in the film or not? If he is, he is so small that the screen is basically a prop. If you're there, you should see the frame through the frame to find him. I'm a big cognizant fan, but never seen this before. I have found in Turner Classics. I have found an amazing accident. Sit back and enjoy the ride!
