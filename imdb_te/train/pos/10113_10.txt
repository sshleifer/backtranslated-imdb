I liked this movie. Ed Wood Jr. does not bring a fan to the fan, I would like to congratulate him on his "infinite enthusiasm" and confess his errors. His movies are fun, but his personal story is broken by a pain. I'm worried and happy, the film does not understand the life of his tears, but killing him with posthumous praise. From the beginning to the end, the film becomes a legend from the documentary, the cast and the director accidentally connect with each other and the Ed Wood junior. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "We have a good time to talk about him from all the best and most unfriendly viewpoints and show us their role as Ed. We relate to Ed's personal and professional life: inspiration for his love, his drunkards, his sexuality, his friends, his enemies, and his filmmaking. Since the use of movies of many theatrical films since 1996 (such as being honored) (such as a presidential suit rather than a president), the low-budget way to get out of respect for Ed. Set designer also uses the concept and insights of humor to suit every background member's background. <br /> <br /> Fans are happy to hear personal evidence about Ed Wood controversies, and this man is surprised to be honest. <br /> <br /> Gems in DVDs ("Crossroads of Laarado" and Photo Galleries) are impossible to find, but the true treasure of the film is surprisingly attractive and intertwined. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood is accompanied by a woman called "Swimming Pool Owner" with him and his friends (for good or worse) to give him baptism in his pool. This ability to define a person's legacy comes around the world, because the film's most striking effect is that Ed Wood Jr. is the most impressive person, but also created to give the community an overview. Anytime, a cast member has been interviewed on the screen, and Ed Wood's connection between different people in his life is clear and the viewer is left with great involvement. <br /> <b-list The title of the title is also in the headings, but in the end, we also see that this is a grace. <br /> <br /> The unintelligible stories begin with random people, all of which cast as the most anticipated fabulous fabric of the cast, which carries history with Wood Legend. <br /> <br /> In many ways the country scholar and Ed Wood Jr. have not been reduced to a single view. He knows that this combination of effort is available to us anytime. The perfection of themes, which is once honorable, provocative, attentive, persevering, pleasant, sad, kind, and fulfilled.
