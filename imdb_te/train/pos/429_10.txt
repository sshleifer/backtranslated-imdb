About 50 years since making a film about romance and spirituality. Two films I expected were "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films were used by the stars not spectacular actors. In both films, all actors have given their best romantic performances. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" There are four English women who enjoy happiness in Italy after the WWI were unhappy in their lives and on vacation. It's amazing "Enchanted April" took place in 1992. It stands as an enjoyable classic.
