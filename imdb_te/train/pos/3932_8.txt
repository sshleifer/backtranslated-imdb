In the same tune as his American drums, along with Mohawk, John Ford captures American history as fictional and far more reliable. Henry Fonda Ford made three films in a row during this era and had some time and place with emphasis on three years and cultural environments. In Mohawk, the Americans are fully driven by Americans who want to be against the Indians and other forces. Here, Ford shows us the 19th century America; One time innovation and creativity started to blossom and this country has become really great. This is the longest, luxurious, young lawyer from All Illinois, named Abi Lincoln, and the film has made her life a lawyer, then suggests the greatness that he achieved. <br /> <br /> Fonda is fantastic in the film, the essence of Lincoln's personality, although he does not yet know what he is. The sets and a supporting cast work well and give the American Dream and its many kinds of Ford's lovely balance. It is not a symbolic film, rather than a reflection of Lincoln's literal cost of creating his legacy for events in his life. There are some scenes between him and his younger Mary Todd; It's hard to see how they got together, but that's not the case. I think Lincoln's greatness is just a tribute, which is widely considered to be the great American president. His quiet and straightforward behavior is rare and today. In fact, our government must have more men.
