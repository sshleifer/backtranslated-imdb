Last night I watched this movie (still still limited) after I waited for the age and age of being released here in Canada. It's waiting and then some value. Margaret Lawrence's most readable reader and I am glad to see that this novel has become a movie. I really ended up liking the movie over the novel. I was a bit less rigorous of Bram Shipley's, and seemed to have a love story between Hagar and Bram, making the scenes more shocking at the end of Bram's life. The damage was strong. Hagger does not like much in the book, but Ellen Berstein is a genius in this role. She is through and through Hagar. Christine Horn is amazing and I definitely have many great things to go forward at. Her scenes combined with Cole Hauser. I have gone out of total 9. Fantastic and it can not wait to get on DVD, and I have to make my own for my collection!
