<br /> <br /> The film does not have the most alternative dramatization or most artistic performance. But do not say this is the film? I'm not a supporter of the idea, an important film must be faced with serious, non-commercial or questions. These films which I love most have many movies. <br /> <br /> The Bogus Journey is, of course, not one of these films. What you get is pure, high creativity with a very pure, innocent power. The film does not reflect reality. Its friendly naive and utopia. Suppose a future world described by Rufus - a beautiful nice time-replacement combination for me to live in it! <br /> <br /> Technically, the bogus jorny did well. I always liked cinematography and scenes of the film. Especially in this point the Bogus Journey has so far its prequel tops. Even the effects are good, and I think most people make it without cgi. I want good old effects in big budget films. In some people's opinion, make sure its 'another Hollywood movie'. <br /> <br /> A short term for the soundtrack: All the band and orchestral music is well suited for the film. Also there are no errors in the sound design. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but this track was required to get the station from the station by the winger and built the bill and ted robots in the van. <br /> <br /> This film is very naive, very imaginative. It's fine way than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - the wrath of God. This is definitely the citizen Kane, the apocalypse now or the Chris Markers sans solilo ... ... it's better than the whole recall ... is not it? <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is just the best film ever. <br /> <br /> "Whoever dares to contradict, he is guilty of" art-farsi behavior "or terminator salvation <br /> PS: Part 1 is not a good image. So Bogus Jarney is a superior sequel. Even Terminator 2 is not a top sequel! It's not!
