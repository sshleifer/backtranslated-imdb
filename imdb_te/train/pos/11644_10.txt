This show is awesome! I was a fan of the first time and it kept on watching me ... Here I saw some horrible things, I wanted to have it, but it shows how it really affects the addiction, just slave. Shopping for drug addiction or alcohol, or eating disorder slave can be found in all kinds of different types of addictions. In fact, it is also really sad to see some of the famous faces that come through. We have seen musicians, an NBA player, and younger people who really need help. And since they started showing some follow-ups, it's pretty awesome. Now, you can see how long after their ep transmission. If you do not check it, please. It's in A & E and it's awesome! Sunday nights at the new EPS 10PM EST, if I remember correctly ... set your TiVo!
