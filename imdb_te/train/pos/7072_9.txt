Twelve Monkeys is a frantic time-journey, action packed film starring Bruce Willis, who plays James Cole's role in time to gather information about the devastating plague released in November 1996. Unfortunately, this film is thrilling and has great performances from Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeleine Stowe. One of the great films I believe believes that twelve monkeys can enjoy. <br /> <br /> Terry Gilliam has created a real masterpiece <br /> <br /> 10/10
