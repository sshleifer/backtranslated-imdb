This film sort of reminds me of my marriage. It is very clean as you can see with family. Very well done. The songs are right. I think the director's director is great. It shows how the film is getting married. They have couples at different stages of life and the relationships in their life depicts in some stages parallel in the same story. Some dialogs are very good. The film is not so dramatic that the complex human emotion is dramatic. It's not perfect after all. The fate of the marriage arranged is the best of the newcomers. The film is well written and directed.
