Being a fan of a monster, when looking at "Yeti", after hearing a lot about it, it must be a perfect one. <br /> <br /> "Good" is a good copy of the oil for the bottle of Vol Bataleg, I have seen that the film really is, and I dare think it's good. In fact, they are a cheesy giant-monster movie. It looks beautiful pretty quickly which looks pretty soon, and we get acquainted with different characters. <br /> <br /> They are one of the most beautiful girls who are pretty clear in any kind of funny cycle fiction films, a lot of subtle, some good people, and a girl. Guy who is a straight man at Woodstock concert, and he is not really bad after the introduction to the world in particular, such as a funky cage. Godzilla is not he - despite his crude awakening, he does not even have a rampage (actually he rarely ruins anything in the whole picture), but puzzled while trying to figure out things. However, we want to see Yeti's big thing, and he's pretty much in the whole picture, and in a typical low-budget approach, he is trying to change the size of the scene and a group of "fake legs" stands out there . <br /> <br yes, special effects are not great, but here are some good people. He has used the bottles of the building as "ladder stairs" to climb above the top - each step with his feet and often inside the invaders - "nice" in a sequence is much better than that in the "Bad" film is. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" does not exist. The only beautiful girl when she comes closer to the original silence is that the nipple's nipple is steep and he appears in her "oh baby baby" manner. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty long for this kind of thing, but surprisingly it is not boring - the story is really cool, and the girl looks at this absolutely gorgeous actress on the screen that makes any male viewer happy. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" may not be in the top of the big monster idols, but it is definitely through the distance of the other King Kong '76 APR and 76 "Queen Kong".
