It is more than a middle-aged fascinating story of the delight of ballroom dancing. This is the story of a man who learns to love life again, pushing all the pressures of work and money to find happiness once again. In this movie, Bonus focuses on modern Japan's slowly changing attitude from ballroom dancing to physical contact. <br /> You have to laugh out loud ... where do you want to stay and tango ... and many others you feel better. A great introduction to contemporary Japanese filmmaking may be among those who think that all Japanese movies are "huge" and impossible. <br /> <br />
