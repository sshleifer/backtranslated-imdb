Melvin Douglas and Jon Blondel played in "The Amazing Mr. Williams" in most of the symphony in mystery / comedy in 1939, which has been forgotten due to the number of superb films in 1939. <br /> <br /> Douglas plays a talented police detective who marries his job, while his girlfriend is waiting for a wedding to be postponed continuously. <br /> <br /> The two stars are great at comedy and work together (and often), what's going on in the film is no exception. And help this battle sexually fun. <br /> <br /> As you can read in other reviews, Melvin Douglas does not do much for the lady. <br /> <br /> Here's the melvin Douglas trash of our great stars in the comments. He was literally alerted by dozens of other person and best friend before he came into his own as an older man. He is not lazy, but a very hard-working actor (easy-to-be) who has a broadway career simultaneously in his career. He did not appear as a leading figure in movies or did not play a very challenging role in the studio system. I challenge anyone to call his destructive performances in "hood" and "never see my father" and call him a lazy or talk about his scratch.
