The posters look a little bit because it's not Mark Twain or Rodgers and Hart but obviously it does not. You see a long time to find Rodgers and Heart fans than me but Burke and Van Hussein are not exactly a choppy liver, inside the der Bingle and some great songs - but beautiful, moonlight, which is always, The Ever Ever Ever, To fit his most personal style and here they are with another fine - and Yayanga overlooked - ballad, once and always, plus a couple of upbeat philosophy-lit entrance to the Moon and Busy Doing Nothing you stump your toe. The soft plot does not need to be taken seriously - if Merlin is so tight, he is more alert to the Arthur to others - so why you're not going to get a lot of fun out of what's going on in a funy film, a schoolyard is a summary of the chivalry and steep metamorphoses into historians sold. On the balance, it's fun, prepare to make it very good luck.
