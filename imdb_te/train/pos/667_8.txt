Although I was a fan of Peter Weir for a long time, I did not see any of his Australian movies until I saw The Lostve. <br /> <br /> Richard Chamberlain plays David, who is an attorney who invited the five Aborigines to kill another Aboriginal. For David's colleagues it is a clear case of drunken disorder and they must admit guilt and serve a quick sentence. But David believes in a mystery under the murder of tribal rituals. As his trial continues, he learns only about his clients but also learns about him. <br /> One of the most important movies I have ever seen is to ruin one. <br /> <br /> The act of the Chamberlain, for example, has several aspects that make it a very attractive film; Performances performed by David Gulpple have played the role of a young adivasis, who introduces David into tribal secrets; And Nandjivara Amagala, who plays the old aboriginal, a spiritual guide. The relationships between these three characters make the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> But the wair represents the supernatural in the film. David has dreams of alerting him about the future. Along with Australia's cyclone and stormy weather, black rains can be more than pollution. But it is related to David defending case. It's one of the great revelations of the film. Smaller events are conducted to create Veraer's fear and oppression atmosphere, suggesting without showing any future horror stories. <br /> <br /> Charles Vine's score is excellent, especially the use of disorderdido. Photography is very good. Russell Boyd portrayed Oser's longtime DP, the mysterious full-dark, creepy world of winning the Oscar for the Master and Commander in 2004. <br /> <br /> For the film I am concentrated on adivasis, it is a whitewash against white culture, or as a sensational celebration in their traditions, such as Wolves with Wolves or The Last Samurai. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it can be frustrating, and it can disturb the viewers who want to complete a movie with reaction. But for those who do not care for some fantastically or ambiguously, a great movie to see the last wave.
