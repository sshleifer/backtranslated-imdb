Many 70s (and 80s) do not work in the kang kong martial arts films; There are usually some well thought-out fighting scenes, but the plot is pretty pronounced to fill in the gaps between the nodes. <br /> <br /> But there are many things in this regard. Very openly, directing and choreography makes each combatant a 'style' - it really is based on Chinese circus acrobatics and comedy theater, but the effect works. <br /> Second, the language of the camera uses a few excellent techniques (even today's measurement), from time to time slowly moving from time to time, and from the drawn or filtered views to the past or future direction of the storyline < > At least publicly, but very powerful and unexpected, construction. Who will decide the end of the contest winner? The owner (writer) set up a game where the main character does not know who he is, which is the same situation we find ourselves in the audience. One by one, he's at the same rate, who are who we are. It follows a tragedy / noir arc. It seems to be a sarcasm, a la "the sting". <br /> <br /> "Five Wheels" is a template for Tarantino's 'Deadly Viper Assassins' from "Kill Bill" volumes.
