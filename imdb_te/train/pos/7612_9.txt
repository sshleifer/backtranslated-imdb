OK I'm honest, the first time I saw the trailer for the show, I thought it was a statement to some solar-screen production. All the people walking on the beach. Despite this I decided to see it, thinking I would have some new show that I could not laugh at. <br /> <br /> Why do I hire you from the first 10 seconds, why are you lying in the trees, why are you in a plane crash? <br /> <br /> It is not everyday, along with a mix of experimental, humor, action and suspense. But 'Lost' manages all of this. Pretty good actors, beautiful places, and pretty good special effects, 'Lost' will hold those who are in tunes and watch those who are ill with cheesy sitcom and sweaty reality TV. <br /> <br /> Channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O on Last 10th Tuesdays
