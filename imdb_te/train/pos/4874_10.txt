Katharaka has done again. Another masterpiece. Frenzy Rhythm and many wonderful moments, full of coral comedy with his own milestones, we laughed and laughed, no party! Music is everywhere, and shooting, animals, crazy bastards, sex and amazing gadgets and discoveries, everything is visual-visual visualization only. Summary Pure Cinema. Excellent experience to see. Good comedies are very rare and are so special thanks to them. Well, this is one, and if you enjoy Kusturica's previous pictures, you may like it, however, in all jokes, it's about a chemical reaction and you're in the mood for it.
