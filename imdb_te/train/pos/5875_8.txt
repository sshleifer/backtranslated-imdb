This is one of the movies that do not need any brain or thought, it will pass you a very funny time in which you forgot the next hour. I was really surprised by John Abraham's performance, and he played a full-fledged face with a totally unmoved face, playing the entire opposite, and successfully doing it in the comic genres like Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar. I was very surprised with Akshay's 3 girls because the characters were not very talented, but mostly I was very surprised about Akshay's differences (for other girls). A good thing, even if the majority of the songs are good, this is a boring Sunday evening this colorful and fun makes this perfectly lighten your mood.
