I feel like a great admirer of David Lynch's works with special "Lynch-Elements" for viewers with distinctive specialty films. After seeing most of his writings, I thought I could estimate Lynch's next step. I'm dead. Dublhland I have never dreamed of as David Lynch. Still, after my desire from the first shock, I began to think of this very old mainstream character, and I decided that it reflects all the absurdities, cruelty, cruelty and boredom from the reality of disgust, and stressed it by distorting it. We rarely hold things in our lives because they are frustrating or terrible, yet they are surrounded by us, so courage is focused on these bits and pieces. It's not a movie to be happy sometimes, but you sometimes laugh with weird, distracting humor, an animated image of all the things that we can observe and obscure with its simplicity, morbidity, and inconvenience. Take it, you do not like it. It's just. Finally, if you are attentive, you will also find things related to Lynch. I would recommend it to the enduring people !!!
