I went to see this football movie and came to say that this is one of the best films I have seen this year. Intrigue is made up of 5-6 different stories, all in one small town. These stories eventually become better, perhaps a bit made by Tarantino's films. Most actors have done well, and this is absolutely necessary in realistic drama. I especially enjoyed the performance of Anna Haitala, the main actress, and Zhuha Chunenen. I noticed btw that I got the wrong information about IMDB Sanna. Her name, as you have observed in my review, is not) hikila but hiatala.
