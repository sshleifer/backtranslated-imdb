I did this at the end and I almost "no, no, no, no!" It can not end here! There are so many unanswered questions! Mona's disappearance of dishwashers engagement? The hell of the hell? "Zombie" little brother saved his father? And what about the head ????????? Oops! Then I have passed at least two cast members and I say, I know probably is not true to Lars von Trier's attention, but I'm glad he'll see the last replacement actors to see the last end of the plan! Granted, anyone can play as hell deserves the role. Helmer, doctor hate you! I want to see a more self-absorbed, unfriendly, self-righteous role on the screen! But, I was able to overcome a change in the stars .... I need to know how it ends!
