In any circumstances I decided to film director Visconti James Cain's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I'm not sure if the Viscount book's rights were earned), but the result is definitely interesting. This is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to the wonderful direction of Visconti and Karama Kalamai and Massimo Giroty (the most sensual couple), it is essential for Noir fans. Noir responses combined with Visconti neoarialism are a great influence. But this film is not perfect. My main complaint is that the film is too long for its own good; The story moves very slowly (I do not think Viscini is good enough to edit his pictures). I think the film works well during a short running noir. Fortunately, Kalamai and Girito are magnetic actors that attract the viewer. However, like this film and reconstructions, I have not created any definite version of Cain's most appreciated book.
