First of all, we know Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take the majority of his movies, you'll see characters have these moments. His role in this film is far beyond everyone ... and counting. The story begins at the beginning (so far) in the future, where a man was previously sent to identify the origin of the virus that was wiped out by humans from the earth. The story goes to the SF but is close to the play due to the slow rhythm of the story. About it. Movies are quick and slow at some points and they have grown even more in the beginning but when you look at this movie you can find out about this stable rhythm of the story and reveal the facts that do not speed up or slow down. Its the same speed that gently and beautifully flowing well. But that is not the habit to pull your nerves to the end, that's pretty good reason. As long as it goes in, it's accurate. Such films are easily destroyed by evil directing but this has become quite well. So, if you're ready to see a siz-fi movie or some action, you will lose it. B has to be more movies like this.
