I have a weakness for alternative history stories, from its amazing life until GROUNDHOG DAY until 12:01. The great gem is among these great gemstones. It is very difficult to get through MR. Murders from the heartfelt James Belushi, from Courteney Cox, have been awarded with praise for each cast member. The film does not have gravity and the scale to make a great film, but it warms the rainy afternoon. It's also a great rental for an affordable date.
