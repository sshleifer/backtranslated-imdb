Never seen this movie and it is not considered a great classic with great veteran great actors. During the film, people in America are different, except radio and Hollywood movies, and we have TV or all modern things today. Self-innocent stories of little love between a young man or a young man are seen differently than today. Anna Shirley, "Murder My Sweet", '44 has played a young orphanage known as Carot Top because of her red hair, and she took two older men to her home, two wise owls and Anna Shirley. It's a small town and everybody knows it and if anything happens, the whole town is aware of it in minutes. It is a very simple way of living is down to the image of the good land good people trying to help each other. Today, it seems a lot of maize ball and stupid, but if you believe me, there are people in America in 1920. & 30 and they are a great generation who loved good family movies.
