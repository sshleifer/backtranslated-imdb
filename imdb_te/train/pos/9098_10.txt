Domestic import is a great image. I laughed the whole time. It is funny with many levels of hilarious situations from crazy outfits. Acting was great. Alla Corot, Larry Darf, Howard Hesseman, and others have done a wonderful job. Since it is a freelance movie by the writer who wrote it, it does not have any of the clich√©s expected from other moods, this is a relief. It is a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and heart-warming story. I heard it based on the true story? If so, that's hilarious (and amazing!). I highly recommend this film.
