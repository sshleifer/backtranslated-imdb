Paul Greengrass certainly saved the last best Bourne! I have complained that most people have filmed the film and some comparing the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I said was you ... are you funny? That's not so bad. I'm helping to make the action scenes more realistic, and I like it in the most beautiful stunt choreography. <br /> <br /> I do not really recognize it for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> You can say that Damn is truly comfortable with Jason Bourne's character. Sometimes it may be a bad thing, but it's a good thing in this regard. He really is Jason Bourne in this installment. Damon is also a great assistant actor in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Styles. David Stratheren played a great role in the cast, and he added a more depth to the secret CIA firm. <br /> <br /> If the film is filled with a great car and full of continuous action, the character will develop in all of them. The film is much bigger than the other two Bourne films, and is definitely one of the best films of the 2007 Summer Season!
