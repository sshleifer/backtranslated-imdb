The film has a special place in my heart, when I first caught it, I was teaching adult literacy. It's very real to me and an extraordinary student at the time. Smile on your face with sudden emotions that you gulp and familiar with characters and their circumstances. <br /> <br /> <br /> With their best work by Jane Fonda and Robert Diniro, Young Martha Plympton, the exciting storyline, and a hunting musical score is a very enjoyable and rewarding experience.
