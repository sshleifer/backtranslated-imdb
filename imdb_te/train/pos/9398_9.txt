This amazing modern day film is noir ... It's interesting that "amazing", the beginning from the beginning. Here are some holes and some goofy parts make you shake your head in unbelief ..... but found someone who has not caught up in this story. The film has proper action, suspense, plot twists and interesting characters. In addition, it has some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar based soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I labeled this crime film "movie star" because it's awkward and not all the characters are good. The only good guy who is also played by Nicolas Cage, gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair that he should have. In the end he does nothing wrong, but by saying I can not spoil it. <br /> <br /> Do you think anyone better than Dennis Hopper about "Bad Guys"? Not much. At least in the "disturbing" category, he's tough to beat. Laura Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a group of reasons. J.T. <br /> <br /> Walsh gives a very good assistant performance. You can be fun watching it. By the way, try not to mention the name of the film three times fast!
