They have me from the first show. <br /> Welcome to Trinity County. A small mabberry that sleeps with a little differently. Sheriff really is Satan. There is a spoiler. However it can not be detected in 10 minutes. <br /> Oh, but it is not. Satan has a son named Caleb. Some people are trying to keep him good, but it is uphill. Sheriff Buck (Satan) Who knows who Caleb and he likes to spend time with him to teach him in the dark ways. Sensitive. False. He never goes bad. For a long time he was a hero. Everyone should give him a big refund, because he often creates a disaster and protects them from it. <br /> If you think that one of my favorite departments is Lucas and Caleb's cabin in the woods, you think he'll get rid of him every time. And some guys with guns decided to exploit them. Lucas used it to teach Caleb to the lesson about evil. <br /> <br /> The exploitation (Ted) is hesitant to shoot them. Ted has half conscience with Lucas Caleb. If he does not have a conscience, he will burn them now. If he had a true conscience, he was not always a criminal. So he called Half Ted. It's pretty funny. He blames criminals. And of course he had ten steps forward Half Ted all the times. And of course he has full control at all times. <br /> They really liked Satan. <br /> pretty much show. This is one of my favorite horrors. American Twilight Zone Night Stalker Circle of the Gothic Supernatural <br /> It's a good company.
