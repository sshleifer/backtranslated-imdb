And Anna Bronowski's "Forbidden Leo $ $" is like any other than Andrew Jaracci's "Extraordinary Friedman". <br /> <br /> It describes, reveals, defines, reveals, and interrogates about the honorary murders in Jordan and the "honorary last" author, Norma Khorri, who made the Best Seller in 2001. <br /> <br /> For the opening part of the film, Khory presents her story about the honor killing of a friend of her, the film's exposure "is very special. Amman, the story of the book. <br /> <br /> Then Khurri returned, accused the women of the rights of women in the Jordan, where he had lived in Australia and Khorri in Australia, but failed to prove a successful false test in this process.
