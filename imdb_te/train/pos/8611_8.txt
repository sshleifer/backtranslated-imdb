Very happy to watch this movie. When I saw it I recorded it, and then reviewed it. I actually enjoyed a second view more since I was able to grasp more of the brilliant dialogue between Natalie and Adam, the two main characters. I thought the story that evolved in this story is very evident. Natalie was very surprised how her daughter treats her friends, for the first time she seemed to be feeling very hostile, but once she started talking more happily, let me see how this visit will be. I'm not disappointed. Secrets that Sarah kept from her mother gradually began to expose a daughter who is not so perfect, many of us like a man who wants her freedom from a dominant mother who thinks she knows her daughter, but unfortunately has to learn a lot of painful times sometimes you have to give them their freedom Rema. Eventually, the audience with the film saw a very touching performance from Diane Keaton (also known as Town and Country in some of her few films). It is good to wait for Diane Keaton driving home to wait for someone else who loves another man to learn to live our own lives, love others, but do not have them and finally we go. It's a hard lesson but it's worth thinking now and later. Thank you CBS for this broadcast, it is a long wait value.
