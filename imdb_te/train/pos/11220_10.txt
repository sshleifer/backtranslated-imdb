Aim for the Top! Gunbuster is one of the anime series that holds the classic written on it all over. I totally loved this series, and to this day, it is my favorite anime. It is not Gainax's first animated product, it is their first OVA series. <br /> <br /> The comedy of 1970's sports drama Aim for the Ace (Ace Nero!), steam, Noriko Takia, as a serious play ending episode 2, forced his father to die, while the first encounter of mankind with the insect breed was killed. NARICO is a fighter pilot because her father's death. But her lack of faith proves to be at times and she falters. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, also has doubts as a pilot of Nariko. However, Noricho's coach, Koichiro Vota, has confidence in her. <br /> <br /> When he survived a battle in Narco's father's murder, he made his personal mission to see him become a pilot. <br /> <br /> Other fighters Jung-Freud, Russian squirrel Nouriko and Kajumi, fighter pilot Smith Torne, was killed along with Narco's romance combined with their first devastation, and Kimiko Higucci, Norica's childhood friend. The intervention of the kimiko is also interesting, but while Noroco is in space, the kimiko is lagging on the ground to live a normal life. And because of the actions of eruption time, Kimiko age is usually the same age when Noriko relatively relatively left when she left school. <br /> <br /> At the end of this series, while Norco was 18 years old, Kimiko was in his mid-fifty. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're a fan of the giant robot it's an amazing anime series to watch. Macha and Gainax animation. If you like Hideaki Anno's other shows, or if Haruko is Michael's artistic fan, give this presentation a chance. It grows on you.
