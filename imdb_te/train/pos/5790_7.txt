Wow! Elizabeth Montgomery's enemy (she speaks Russian), then I surrender now. In her cone, hi-top boots, and fall line, she's a real catch, she comes with some sort of zombie-like eye-shadows and passes. The most sexy in this 30-minute series. The realistic and exposed wrestling match with Brunson is that he wields himself on the chin and destroys all. Well, maybe I should leave my hormonal response. <br /> <br /> It produces a well-built half-hour time behind the success of Buck Houghton. Obviously, producers want an average entry in the third season. This is the American nuclear-holocaust post (we know because she is part of the expedition) and only twenty tons of American Branson and Soviet Montgomery are in ruins. Alternatively, they are destroying the sentiments, but when it comes to thinking about how much time politics takes to drink for biology, it will eventually become (Lucky Bronson). And that's about it. No real debate is better than Bronson's. Nevertheless, the screenplay is still entertaining and daring for its time, all Russian women have suggested that truck drivers (not like the time of the famous cold warfare of time). <br /> <br /> When traveling - the most slavic-looking Branson (Buchinsky) is an American and Slough-like gigantic-looking Montgomery. Looks like it should be reverse. My opinion is that producers are not willing to act in a physically weak role of male, regardless of performances. Still, the typical TZ is no fear or the atmosphere is too small, but still a lot of it is 30 minutes to watch.
