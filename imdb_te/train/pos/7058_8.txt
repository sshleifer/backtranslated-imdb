Immediately after watching the film, I came to know the true magic of Walt Disney films and I realized that long ago I saw 'real' magic in a movie. A mix of right music, lectures and magical effects brings Disney feeling back to your body. The non-effecting effects of the film began with the transforming into the Cinderella castle with the Diddy logo, and the story of your grandparents ended with an old story. <br /> The magic came back to me. I am rating this film from 10 to 8.
