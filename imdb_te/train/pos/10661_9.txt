Jeopardy is a long, satisfying thriller, cut on top of B but is not really a major product. It was almost an experimental film, and was looking for new types of films, stars and directors to compete with the metro and new types of television in the production studio. Director, John Sturges, continued for the best years. He has recently started directing a level film and has already proved himself to be the most talented artist. Stars Barbara Stanwick, Barry Sullivan and Ralph Micer are in their stages in different stages. Stanwick's fame has been behind her for years, and as she's still shot here, she still carries a movie. Barry Sullivan, like her husband, was one of the dozen or more prominent figures who opened in movies in the forties, many of whom did not succeed. He is a fine, low-key actor, ensuring, but in the upper middle of the way above the upper class, he made him wonderful in professional roles. The only survivor who escaped Sullivan's life was the escaped trainer (he was caught under a peer, and the tide was growing), Ralf Meeker was more powerful than usual. The bad luck to the successors of this magnificent actor Brando and Clift. He was on his way as a good actor, but he did not have Karisma. Her husband (who, as of 1953, only), makes herself a different kind of sexual harassment for herself, having interesting questions about Stanwick's role as Stanwick, who comes down to sex with her as much as possible. Micker is actually a more exciting role than Sullivan; And in the scenes with her, Snawwick is more lively than her husband and son. But this Stringberg drama, a formula that is intended to be a stanwick, is putting the question of her husband's problems - unexplored. In this sense the incoming tide is not much like, although the movie, the spectacular acting, the good place to photograph, almost everything, and lamenting in the painful direction. Sturges.
