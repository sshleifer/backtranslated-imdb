I was late for a night, on TV, to see Cisque and Ebert weekly compilation. I did not hear anything about "Red Rock West", but did not see it before leaving two thumbs. <br /> <br /> The next afternoon I followed their advice. Because of the lack of distributors' money problems and the lack of promotion, it has not been in theaters for a long time. They are right, which is some of the most fun I have at the movies. Some readers point out that there are some plot holes and the last 10 minutes will never end. But it's well worth, for fine craftwork that went into the first hour. It's the best role I've seen for Nicolas Cage, but almost everyone will be perfectly cast. Dennis Hopper goes to the top, it becomes crazy, but it helps to do everything works. <br /> When I came to my family later, it did not work. In the theater, tensions have long distorted at home and appreciate the distractions. It deserves your attention; Turn off the phone, you do not have to work hard every time, see, and listen.
