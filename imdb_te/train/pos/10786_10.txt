Me and my sister are these movies and we use our rent so every time our parents are so mad (but they tell us anyway) and I love it ... Anyone who lives near me I am talking about ... I'm not the only one who loved this movie I'm glad ... I wish I could find this somewhere on DVD !! I love a little child and now I like to watch this business ... now I'm doing 15 !!! I remember so much about it ... I came from the little bunny Fufu song and all my friends know the song but the movie is not! I think the little girl came by sliding down the slide in her small playground thing
