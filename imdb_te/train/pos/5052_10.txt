This is a fantastic picture. It is very familiar to a Canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle, such as winter, boat, trap, hunting and so on. It's very easy to take it up for granted, but after watching this movie a few times it has grown up. <br /> <br /> The story of Gray Owl's story is well known to many Canadian creditors for director Attenborough and screenplay writer Nicholson. <br /> <br /> Brosnan pretends to be a complex person. Annie Galepow is lovely in his first big role. The rest of the cast is great.
