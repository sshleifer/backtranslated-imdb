This image is pretty good. I'm not a big fan of baseball, but it's a picture designed to understand love, decision, heart, and understanding. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza, and Milton Davis Jr. are brought with many talented actors and perceptions of the game. The plot is incredible, and I love the message. Dear William Dear and guys accompany a great movie <br /> <br /> Most sports movies roam around true stories or events, and they do not work very well. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
