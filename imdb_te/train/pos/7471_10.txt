Despite the amazing trailers for Vanilla Sky, I heard that I did not receive great reviews because I thought this film would be disappointing. However, I'm afraid of how good Vanilla Sky is. <br /> <br /> There is no bad acting in the whole movie, each character is reliable. The romantic movements between Cruise's character, David Aiams and Cruz's character, are tear-fast, realistic and intimate (maybe they are soon real-life couples). The Vanilla Sky's plot is confusing you in the last third film and you have very little chance of guessing the end. <br /> <br /> It is not very difficult, because you are drawn to the film and a I do not take your eyes out of the screen for a second. <br /> <br /> I'm usually watching movies, but Vanilla Sky still stands in my mind after watching it, and I recommend to anyone who wants change from simple and unreliable movies.
