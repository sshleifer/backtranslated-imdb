The title is somewhat overstates the content of this image, which can lead to some unrealistic expectations. To be honest, there is a small "fear of the streets" to look at here. In fact, only a handful of people throughout the movie know that the murderer has a person who is plagued by everyone and who he meets. Anything that we have here is a good scene, however, (because in the "streets" unlike people, what the viewer knows) and that director Elia Kazan is very deliberately constructed. When a plague killer demands, one of the interesting sidebars I have discovered is a growing relationship between Dr Reed (Richard Widmerk) and Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). In the beginning, both of them have to work together, and both of them really do not like each other. In the end, they created an honorable relationship with each other. Kazan has done a good job with it. <br /> All the demonstrations are awesome here. Widmark and Douglas were great, and I saw a lot of advance when Jack Fulton played his distinctive "big role" role. I can not criticize here. Although Barbara Bell Geddes Reed's wife is a little like Nancy, her role is not really the source of the story. All in all, amazing piece of work. 9/10
