I love the series! The stereotypes painted by South ARarners are very clear, but such people are very often. The depiction of Southern Government Rings is not true, but sympathetic characters remind one of the most good things about South. Some things never change, and we'll see "Good Old Boys" every day! Lukas Buck is a phone call to make things happen in every southern town, and the story book "Poe" is very familiar. Along with supernatural elements, all of the modern South can be well done! I think I should do something, SC should be in Barnwell County!
