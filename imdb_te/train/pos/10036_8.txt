Titanic is a long but well-made tragedy story. It happens on an ill-fated cruise on a sick vessel. The director / director James Cameron made a great deal of work for the film about a fictional love story between different people and was drowned after the iceberg hit North Atlantic's ice in April 15, 1912 with the true incident of Titanic. The two characters, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are great in their roles. They do it for a couple of good on the screen. DiCaprio and Winslet had a real chemistry, which ultimately made romance, and ultimately were ultimately incredible. When both came out, they both showed realistic talent and both showed similarly in their recent films. The rest of the characters, like Billy Jane, Kathy Bates, Francis Fischer, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton are equally impressed by the rest of the characters who help bring the film to life. Love story, action, suspense, and special effects occur specially at that time. The horror characters of the situation seemed to be real because it really happened that many of you would like to survive this life and death situation. The speed was slow in the shortest time and it was too long but the rest of it was made up of some flaws. Titanic makes a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry all the time they watch. After touching an iceberg in the Titanic Atlantic, it is precisely portrayed by the fact that it really happened. The story that moves a tragic heart about two people who fall in love while being in an unhappy ship when they bring life through extraordinary performances from the Titanic hero, DiCaprio and Winslet.
