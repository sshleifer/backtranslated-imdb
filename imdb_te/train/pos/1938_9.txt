The big garbage swimming is the low budget, the indie feel about it. Many times I'm starting to watch independent films, they're getting a lot of praise and they voted for those who voted by those who inspire inspiring audience to inspire them to forget the movie. <br /> <br /> If there is no message or high meaning or metaphor of big trash swim it does not know if it fails me. BBS rightly thought it was easy and warm and human, no big plays or meaningful ideas, I was directly connected with the letters. <br /> <br /> When I lose the connection, I feel sorry for the better. <br /> If you're looking at something bigger or faster or more intelligent, to deliver more than that. BBS offers a great, enjoyable, true experience and I enjoyed it and was satisfied with it.
