I sink in Victorian literature slowly into the slopes of the distant yards, pulling it under the weight of the under-skirts. Television comes in: Well, it has a redemptive power, and criticizes such as the BBC, the Victorian literature gets a new move in life. Religious themes and moral sponsorships can no longer be easily astonished by ill health in the world, and contact with cohabitation, affairs and domestic violence. <br /> <br /> Today, the powerful, feminist and extraordinary Anne Bourtay masterpiece, "Waldfell Hall's tenant," is in fact. Emerging from the main sludge of compulsory corsets ?? Body, mental, social ?? Her heroine, Helen Huntingdon, escapes a brutal marriage, escapes cruelty and alcoholism, not only the fury of her abusive husband, but the pinhodd intolerance and harmful gossip in society to experience a change in her life. She pays the price; But she has self-esteem; She comes to love along the way; She was weak but successful, and strongly emerged. I love watching women like this on the screen. <br /> <br /> Are the actors amazing? Best brits offer. The love story is beautifully maintained, with a sense of real hobby and well-matched actors. Tara Fitzgerald has every aspect of a complex heroine and is said by other critics, that the scarf had a low face and beautiful face that survived. Toby Stephens, who hit her, sparks, headstrong, beautiful young and enthusiastic, anxious disruption to the right combination. Rupert Graves (one of my favorite British actors) gets himself a glamorous villain (and you're almost entirely with him.) The supporting cast has consistently tied up with modern tastes, and created a world that you sink without feeling unheeded yet another BBC classic, highly recommended: How is dramatic?
