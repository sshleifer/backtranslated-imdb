In 60 seconds. Where am I started, it puts you in some way with some good actions and some cool cars. People are not some good parts but it is not a good movie I'm not sure which film does not have any action. If I wanted to rock or fade off this film, it gave 10 to 8 from 10 acts and gave me a humorous relief, which is one of the lowest cinemas in my mind - Roy Lindo. I sometimes look for movie movies and want to enjoy the movie. That means the action agreement. What if they are trying to make their way to change how they are making movies and trying to win each award? I think they made the action movie they made, give it a chance and you're sorry.
