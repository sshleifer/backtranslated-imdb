It's a fantastic movie that's all right, but it's likely that young people are available to young people (at least in print that I've seen) by using the unfortunate option of English sub-titling! Most of the film is almost impossible to imagine, which is set at any time - no modern technology has been shown, and throughout the Chinese cycle, just a brown color, almost monochrome, everyday life, dazzling contrary to the Seijoan opera show and celebration fireworks show. Although the band of soldiers represents their immediate departure for the theater of war, it may be at any time in the last 150 years. <br /> <br /> We see a motor car in short - at the end of the 30th and 40th style - and we are seeing a Chinese on the brink of rebellions and we see most of the world we see in the world's 2nd Ocean Revolution and Communist Revolution. <br /> <br /> The central character's desire to stick to old traditions and traditions in the film is what is more sharp. <br /> <br /> The film also today increases the importance of important importance in China and other countries. Components of the world: boys and girls, odds between men and women; For various purposes, trade in young children; Corruption in society; Injustice; The Importance of Friendship <br /> <br /> I have been reading this film too. But I do not think so! <br /> <br /> I also think that the images of these evolution pictures are often scandalous in the United Kingdom, but the quality of the coin is gone. .
