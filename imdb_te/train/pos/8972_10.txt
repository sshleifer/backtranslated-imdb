My discovery of John Shankmaker's film opened my eyes to the whole tradition of check animation, including Jiri Trineca, a pioneer. <br /> <br /> Previously, he goes about making a pot. But the massive hand comes to crash the pot and demands the Potter himself to make a statue. He had a hand, but he would soon return and capture the bird cage to make a stone hand. <br /> <br /> In the marvelous line of Metakaina, he puts a candle on the cord, which burns his visible puppet strings and puts him in a queue. He escapes home. <br /> When he fell on his head, he was accidentally killed by his own beloved plant. <br /> <br /> Unlike modern films, this film is not original?). Hand, for example, a handwriting is clearly one's hand. Everything else is mud. Strings appear and part of the story, which is the precursor of the film strings. The atmosphere is strange: the hand that handled in order to frighten me more than the many horror movies combined after the little Potter. <br /> <br /> The picture is clear but being completely manipulative for its simplicity. This is a story about artistic freedom and outrage that does not help to win the heart and mind of those who have the freedom as a natural right.
