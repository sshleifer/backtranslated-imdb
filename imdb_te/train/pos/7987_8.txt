Fire on fire is hot. I loved the classic story of Ol Reagan and the good reason to take revenge on kidnapping an innocent little girl is that viewers understand the Christ and actually drive Christ to protect the pita. The choir was not in the attempt to save the pita through "correct" channels, but instead used torture strategies and street smilies. Some people may say, "There is nothing to do with violence," and you may be right, but when you see the pain and the pain of her getting hurt her, you can not help it with creasy and pull him to be more merciless. <br /> <br /> Creais's quest is the breakthrough of Creais's quest ended with Creais's quest with her mother returning to the pita and dying in the creepy's vehicle. But the death of Karmi's death did not diminish the effect of the movie, but it was actually improved by showing that it was willing to die to get the pita back. His death is true. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This film deserves good marks because it is definitely a good image.
