I've seen so many solo movies and he's great to have music, dance, drama and great movies in his films. Imperia shows a much better solar with more contemporary concept of dance and music dealing with multimedia ideas. The dancers and musicians in this film, dance and music are equally important: in fact, there are different aspects of technical aspects, experiencing technical problems, and emotional experience that can be played. Saura's interest on the bridge between traditional and contemporary music and dance is again a mixture of the film. That's why I strongly recommend those who love good cinema, good music, good dance, great art.
