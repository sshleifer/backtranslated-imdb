This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It takes me on a roller-coaster emotions. I laugh and cry and cry with disgust and happy and in love! All this is a little over two hours! <br /> Actors are cool! I should say about the well-known actor, Michael Nuquist. He does great work! I also admire the actor who plays the Tour, who plays this mentally challenged young man. He reminds me of the Leonardo de Caprios roll in Gilbert Grape! And the most beautiful song in the world is: Gabriella's s√•ng. <br /> I recommend this to everyone to see and enjoy!
