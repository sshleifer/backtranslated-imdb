As with many comic actors like him and him, Adam Sandler never condemned the talent, and I hoped it would be just a great film based on his presence in a film. It looked very good overall. There is also a person who has already thought that Sandler can deliver an efficient dramatic performance, and he is surprised at how awesome he is. He especially cries you in his intentional sudden and unexpected statement. What's amazing about his role is that it's hard to say we've seen before. We have seen many emotionally distorted characters, many mentally depressed people, many lonely and most emotionally self-centered artists, but Sandler's Charlie Finlayman is none of these. He may have a taste for everyone in some ways, but his role is really unpredictable and completely individual. It is happy that the audience is drawn emotionally by him and every problems, ideas, opinions, and motivations are different from his many roles. <br /> <br /> Don cheadle is an interesting completely different level performance. He is every man. He is the most ordinary possible person in the world, so you can play him the way most characters, or at least what he plays Alan Johnson, whose name was also found on the assembly line. <br /> <br /> Chedell is bright, funny, smart and stupid for the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is packed with actors and actresses, in small but very colorful characters. Jada Pinkett-Smith's excessive refined upper middle-class wife, Donald Sutherland, is unfortunate but surprising judge, Robert Klein Sandler's fondest uncle. <br /> <br /> Mike Binder's script is very intuitive and something too deep about the wonders of all its guises all communication. <br /> <br /> Babel is the most subtle and most intimate home. <br /> <br /> The camera is only interested in the facts of opposing the style. The film struck me in the 1970s with a kitchen-sink style. Cinematography is brown and unfastened, but it has its charm. <br /> <br /> The music that plays the main character in this movie is a lot of its title. Powerful. Initially, you seem to be doing something else for a soundtrack like Schmitt or Little Miss Sunshine, but you realize that you are more than that. <br /> <br /> In this film, many of the songs filled the emotional scene with music. Blancman's director also shows that he is capable of miracles.
