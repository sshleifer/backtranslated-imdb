This is one of the best films from Hong Kong's 'New Wave', which started with Tui Hark's "ZU: Mary Warriors Warriors". Tauy established a tone for the new wave's approach to the Marshall Arts film, so all the directors of the new wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wang Jing, Ching Siu Tung etc.) were accepted; That is, if the comedy is not a comedy, it needs more than the touch of sarcasm. "Paradise Burning" ceases to everything, and with vengeance. <br /> <br /> Here is nothing that does not mean humor; But completely human humor, like the old Buddhist priest in the beginning, holds a quick feel of the dirty young whore for some time hiding the straw in a single bundle. <br /> <br /> When the sarcastic was introduced in the film last time, it did not study in 'pure hyperbole' Red Lotus Temple, a pre-pure Neilizh, which has never been recorded in the film. He is the Satan's incarnation of "Lost Paradise": "The rule in hell is better than Serve in Heaven!" If he can not get enough of Satan's hell, he will rule the world around him. He can rule. <br /> Here's clearly the brutal torture of images: Abbott just does not want to kill people; He desperately desires to be totally disappointed and to accept his nihilism as a suppressed reality. There is a definite sense in the Red Temple scenes that no other reality outside of the temple - it's all in the universe, and Abbott is the mastery of the infinite power, being charged. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the film does not end there. Despite the risks, mankind is simply the human being. (If you want to know the film, watch the movie!) However, there is no doubt that we will visit hell when watching this movie. Hopefully, we can not see our own partialities; But we definitely feel chastened by experience - something better for it all over.
