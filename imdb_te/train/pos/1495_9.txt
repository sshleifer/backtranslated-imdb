This awesome amicus horror volley, 3 great stories, and fantastic performances!, Just disappointing the final story. All the characters are awesome, and the picture is very cool and curious, plus Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are just amazing! It is much underestimated and my favorite story is the 3rd "Sweet Sweets", plus all the characters are very much liked. It is some predictable, and the last story is incredibly disappointing and instead bland, but the ending is really cool! <br /> One Story Story ("Murder for Medder"). This is a wonderful Amicus Horror volley, 3 great stories and fantastic performances, the last story only disappoints! This is a fantastic story of suspense, and the killer Dominic is really creepy, and it's very well acted! It's the perfect way to launch with a story, and for the most part it's unpredictable, plus the double twist ending is surprising, and very creepy! <br /> The story 2. ("Groups of wax figures"). This is a great story, but the ending is very imaginable, but it is still creepy, and a little bit of suspense, Peter Cushing has done a fantastic job, I enjoyed this story with Jose Auckland! Grade B <br /> <br /> Story 3 ("Sweets to the Sweet"). This is a lot of story here, it's very creepy and all-out, it's also a great twist! Christopher Lee has done an excellent job, and Chloe Franks has done an amazing job as a younger daughter, and the end is astonishing! I do not want to spoil for you, but this is one of the best horror stories I have ever seen! Grade A + <br /> <br /> The 4th story ("The Clock"). This is a terrible story that is really weak and unfunny zone Pertwhee is irritating to me, but the ending is a little surprising for me, and the Ingrid Pit is always so great, but it's just dull, and many times happened before, yet creativity ?? Grade D <br /> <br /> The direction is great! Peter Duffel does a great job where the fairytale camera works, adding great angles, some creepy atmosphere, and keeping the image at much faster! <br /> Acting is awesome! John Bryans was great here, the narrator, he had some great lines, and I wanted him to have more screen time. John Bennett is a good man, and very serious, and finally he's good, I liked him. Denhel Eliot Charles is as amazing as, he showed the threat, the threat, the most loved, and I loved his facial expressions, he rocked! Joanna Dunham is very beautiful! She has done great things to do with her, and she has a great chemistry with Denhel Eliot! Tom Adams was very creepy as Dominic, he was creepy looking, and worked well to work! Peter Cushing is always as magnificent, and here it is amazing, he is fond of, visually, lovely, and always has a ton class! (Cushing Rules !!). Jos√© Ackland is always as wonderful as, and looked very young here, I just realized, his accent was not too thick, and I played a different role that I loved! (Ackland Rules). Wolf Morris is creepy here, and he has to do well. Christopher Lee has always been fantastic and is amazing here, he is very intense, very focused, and always has a great intense look on his face, he's especially wonderful at the end! (Le Rules !!). Chloe is the daughter of Franks, she is somewhat crazy and gave one of the best child shows I have ever seen! I love her. Nory Dan Porter is beautiful and daddy is wonderful, I love her! Jon Pertwee was angry at me here, and was very corny, and totally unfunny, he had chemistry with Ingrid Pitt! Ingrid Pitt is beautiful, and makes her simple vampire thing and does it well! <br /> <br /> Make the rest of the cast a fine. Overall a must see! **** from 5
