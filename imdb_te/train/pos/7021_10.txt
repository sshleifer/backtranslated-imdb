Last weekend at Pacific Barbara International Film Festival, The film drew my attention for a short while, as I ran across an article in Jalousie Magazine. At the time seemed interesting, but nothing too exciting. However, I saw in the festive program and decided to check it out. When the final credits roll starts, I can say that I am speechless. It's one of the most beautiful and refreshing movies. Photography, art direction, acting, and especially directed, patches and impeccable. There's nothing for you in this film '. Many movies make the exact opposite of today. The dialogue is carefully portrayed and, this script is not wall wallpaper, the letters are very deliberate and meaningful. <br /> It's definitely worth a second view, this is more of what you'll notice. This is a very layered and intelligent movie. Not sure when or where to play again, but the film enthusiasts must see perfect.
