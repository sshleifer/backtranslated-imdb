The only movie I've seen prince but it does not matter. And when he was singing boy I thought I was only wrong. This is his best performance. The music is great. Why did it win an Oscar award for Best Music (or something like that) in 1984? Now he is an Oscar and Grammys under his belt. Even if the accusations are in the film (just make sure the children are in the room). Do not tell too much without telling the plot. If you do not go out and get this movie, your collection will be complete. I can tell this story now, unless I go.
