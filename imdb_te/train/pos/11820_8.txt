Hey, if I told you to compare Dark Knight to the comics-acclaimed movie 5.9 at the age of 18, do you call me crazy? Only to catch your attention. Everyday I meet people complaining about people who have only recently complained that there are good movies. Old movies are not always a good thing to explore and explore with good artistic values. <br /> <br /> Negative reviews about DT's "tumultuous" story have been mainly complained. But it seems to me that the storyline is very clear, and I'm not following it. I did not see comic books, but I'm not a big US comic fan but I congratulate the top-line film making and performances. There may be a lot more about the story of many people's estimates. But if you look at the movie that depicted Madonna and Warren Beatty, what can you expect? I have some grooves on my head and can not help, have you really seen the movie? The title character, although not as effective as it sounds, still pulled him and attracted the audience. Madonna is more expressive than "breathtaking" in her seductive role, but the story is so much fun. Al Pacino is funny and prodigy for him. Apparently he is bold enough to go on the satire of his previously successful characters. We can see a hybrid of Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro. <br /> It's not too bad for me. The surreal feeling really came to me.
