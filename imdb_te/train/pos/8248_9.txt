When you look at the cover of the DVD, this is a Class B cheesy cheaper, which is made for $ 1,000 in $ 1 perry. <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> It is quality material and good. It's a funny and a wise one. It also has a lot of spots, with a soft spot. Production values ​​are very good (it's great), actors are known, film direction and sets are great. It's awesome. <br /> <br /> Carrie-an-mos, against-the-play, is amazing, "Helen Robinson," June's cleaver-like wife; Billy Connolly is a strongly heartfelt zombie "Fido;" Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") Sexy zombie girlfriend "Tommy" and Henry Kerney and Dylan Baker in the neighborhood (Czech) are fantastic, even youngsters Canine Ray "Timmy Robinson," can not be ignored. <br /> <br /> If I explain this story, some of you will understand that you will see it. You need to take the word of the people you love, it's a very pleasant surprise. You need the dark sense of humor, though; Abusive appreciation.
