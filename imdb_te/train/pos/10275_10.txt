Get ready for it: this is one of my favorite films. I do not know much about David Mammoth's (writer and director), but after half a dozen times in this film (a pleasure to always see), I can say without doubt that he is an intellectual. The film is very well written and quickly attracts you to your surroundings of Quick, Con-Artistry and Backroom Histories. The idea of ​​the film is the same as The Sting (1973), and it gives the film a noir to the noir. <br /> This is a very emotionally complicated film and it is definitely thinking about different plot turns and intentions. Shadow characters. I'm commenting that it's not just a gambler, a smoker and a thief but a bad 80's hairdo sports a heroine (Lindsay) Crows) is a good idea to have. I agree, but I think she is the best in that role. <br /> <br /> You know very well about the plot of the film, because Mamet's recent film is more attractive, like the Spanish prisoner. Just sit back and ready to be taken for a ride through a movie that comes close to cognition.
