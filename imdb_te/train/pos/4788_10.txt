This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen: I was shining inside the whole picture. The spell was done when the music and cinematography were taking place slightly on screen. The mode of travel (a rider grass mower with a big trailer) was slow and maintained with slow scenes of background scenes and sounds and other characters. <br /> In fact, it happened; Alvin Strait died in 1996 at the age of 76. Actors are originally transformed into characters, which is absolutely true. Sissy Spacek gave a sharp performance as some disabled daughter who suffered a lot but forward fake, always want to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth has appeared in full and he has become a stubborn but beloved elderly man who is Alvin Straight, and he goes to meet his loyal brother Lyle. <br /> <br /> Alvin learned much of his life and appeared to be the best among the people he faced along the way. <br /> <br /> The importance of the film is to us. I look forward to seeing it again and again and again. These films, directed by David Lynch, prove his directorial skills. Forsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; At 79, he was the oldest candidate ever for that award.
