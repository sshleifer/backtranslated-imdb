The film was shot in theaters. You can see why it's not received because of nature. It has been unfairly panned over the original image. <br /> Plot / Story: Higher learning is mostly Malik (played by Omar Eppes), which is not a spectacular film. The simplest track star is not enough speed, and a rigid professor (played by Lawrence Fishburne). He is friends with a beautiful woman named Fudz (Ice Cube) and Deja (Tyra Banks). Then they have to face some skin heads on the premises. Remy (drama Michael Rapaport) campus ends with some local skin heads. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Higher learning is not without its disadvantages: Character developments Omar Eps, Tyra Banks and Leader Skin heads (I forgot the name), Busta Rhymes did not fit in the film. Homosexuals became clich√©s after men were abused, in which I did not like a piece of film with Christie Swanson. Besides, this film is not half bad. Lawrence Fishburn Professor Phipps (though I can not do it without a slang), Fudge Ice Cube's best performance and Michael Rapaport is confusing remotely. All in all it is one of John Singleton's best films and I am one of the reasons he's angry on the worst he now puts on. Films such as Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning, and American History X, and Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and a shorter reminiscence of shafts.
