In this real fascinating and dark film, a young poor young student devil sells his money for a lot of money, and instead the devil takes his reflections (the film is magnificent and baldine, knocking the front of the mirror), his visual future for a "fierce battle" A visual form of activity. The student gets his money, but the woman he loves (he made a covenant with the ghost, he is cut off from love and other wealth of the soul) or you can exchange your soul for money, you should not be. Baldwin's performances with his double (inter-celebrities perform well, some of the scenes are awesome, while the Devil's disappearance is a delicate image of Baldin, in a human society (the scene where he fled from his double ends in 'wasteland' at the edge of town, (He lost his life) He was outside the human society There are many other things to say about this wonderful film like a wild animal.Paul Weiner is an outstanding actor and director, a cultural leader of mine.If you know bit about German history and the German dopinglager tradition (not google, get the right book) , This is a very early film, which is a little bit of a wick at times It's clear, but it's worth considering what's to say and it's a tragic end, it's the best (yes it's!)
