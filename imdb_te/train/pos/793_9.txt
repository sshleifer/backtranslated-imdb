Really really enjoyed this film. (That's why I'm surprised that this is a low rating from many users on this site!) It's not a movie masterpiece, but it's a great way to spend the cold and ice Saturday night. It's funny, sharp, and great stories of female friendships that can be done through hard times and bad things for girls' friends every other thing! (Ladies Up Lace, We Have All!) Bill Paterson Reverand Gerald Marsden and Andy McDowell proves that she is a good actress when the character is right and she keeps her mind on it. (And really, the best I've ever seen or dried in this film is "Wedding Escape" ... I've never seen anyone ever!) You laugh and you cry --- Ignore any marketing campaigns and how this movie is marketing. .. It's a secret gem made of the box office's turn offs. (Now I look around to buy a copy!)
