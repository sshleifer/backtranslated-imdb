I saw the film to find out if the film was never successful (commercially or artifactly), and found considerable artistic merit - it could have been its trade. /> <br /> The first of all, the film tries more than "extreme" science-fiction, social commentary, action-adventure. It has action, but this is not what it really is. If you look at it, you end up with a bad "Aliens" clone (as identified by others). <br /> <br /> Cinema Todd (Kurt Russell) is related to the approximate machine from the human and back to the human (mostly * rear *). But since this does not give you the distinction of giving Hollywood style, Kurt Russell should do so without much expression, without talking about this transformation. <br /> <br /> The surrounding "social logic" is flawed and it never describes the ability to have its own status with Todd's army. From his experience on the battlefield, or his newer human-ness or whatever high-profile troops, the film still looks great in Russell's (unpredictable) talent.
