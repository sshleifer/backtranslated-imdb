Beat Street is the best film on the Brassic scene. Everything about it is spot, clothes (Puma), music and especially dance! The storyline is fundamental, but what about telling the story about hay? The whole point of the picture is to show what the kids of that moment are doing, what is important to them. It shows that young people are generally good, and they are music, dance, and friendship for everyday children. I was amazed at how long time I was after watching the DVD recently! Not by clothes (perhaps Puma now has a huge comeback), the music is still fresh, and the dance is still appealing. People in the age group of 10-25 years should be seen in youth culture.
