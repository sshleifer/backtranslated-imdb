I think she took a lot of guts for her to come forward like that. People are more likely to help if a celebrity gets hurt. But, in her case, her performance was great. I have been in the field of five years mental health and I think mental illness is not a terrible term anymore and I feel great to believe that she helped. I always thought she was great and always will. I am glad that she wrote this book and made the film. She is a remarkable woman and I hope she will continue to act. She is by far and has encountered. I really really like to see his work with children, especially child actors. She should not be a strict test and I think she is wonderful as a teacher for young people. This film shook me a lot. I have the advent of my disorder and have PTSD, which is suffering from a TbI, she is good to know that someone has enough courage to show her life. I believe this country and people usually help others realize that there is help and help. Thank you Mrs. Duke, or Anna who you do not like anymore.
