I originally rented the film several years ago, and it was fully appreciated. Recently, I enjoyed the strange need to rebuild some of my most enjoyable movies in my lifetime, "Erendira" and decided to give another look. <br /> <br /> I immediately discovered that the film is not separated from the brightness of the film. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenager (Erendira, Claudia Ohana - in some respects she is similar to Vinana Rider!), suspiciously burning her grandmother's palace, making her a hipnot by her grandmother Irene Papas and prostitutes the road to pay a damages to the girl. <br /> <br /> In the underlying premise dealing with adultery, however, there is no taste of absurd sexual content. This story revolves around the girl and her grandmother, and they are interconnected with various other colorful characters that they approach on their temporary residence - this is in the rough and slim side of rural Mexico. </ P> <p> <br /> The film is very cluttered with the atmosphere and the quality of dreams. It is sometimes a dilemma, but David Lynch is not to say the film. <br /> <br /> Often in the background you listen to a lonely accordion sounds, quiet and sadness, right music tunes to highlight the Mexican setting. <br /> <br /> This film moves very fast or too slowly, at a good speed, after every scene I rewind the tape and play again, just because it makes you want to do it. <br /> <br /> Hopefully you will see the movie in its Spanish language version, subtitle. I studied Spanish in high school and college, and I understood many conversations. For example: "Not a great world." <br /> <br /> I would like to remind you about the film falling in a vintage vintage wine bottle. But very satisfying, you get some sadness when you realize that there are no more bottles in this case.
