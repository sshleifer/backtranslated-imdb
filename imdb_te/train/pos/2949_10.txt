This is the ridiculous stand I've seen so far and I think it's ridiculous that I'll ever see it. If you chase with a complete joy, it's not your tea cup. But I'm honestly unaware of anyone who has seen this. It's now 17 years later and my friends and I still get everything from queo goo go to quack fart game, aunt Bunnie ice cream man, Ralph and Ed !! There are so many personal and collective skies honestly, if you do not see this film honestly, you will lose the best stand-ups ever. Take great figures like Robin Williams, Damon Weines, The Dice, George Carlin or Richard Pierre or Red Fox and it goes beyond. Murphy does not know how he got some of his items but it works. That's what it comes down to. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine how to use this episode of people using the Eckie Buckwheat and Mr. Rogers and the many SNLs in the film? Listen to the audience when you break his first joke or say the first time F-word, they're in full shock. <br /> <br /> For the first time, he was skiing about F-gay homosexuals Mr. T. <br /> "Hey Abbey, Hey Abbey, you see them in jeans just now, and f @ ** <br /> <br /> A crowd of folks faced a laughing mouth, but the results were just awesome In fact, my stomach was not too far from smiling since 1999. I saw the South Park <br /> <br /> "Bigger and long, UNCUT." That comedy is raw and unapologetic and it went for the juggler, like the Dewey sound.I do not think this piece of comic history can be seen and laughing. Took over and I put the hook worm and put the fishing pole back on the kids and slammed their heads in water for two minutes in the gus Children can not shake like that gus then they movin around their heads and come m **** f ***** <br /> <br /> Let it look again and be ready to laugh your freakin donkey. <br /> 10 to 10
