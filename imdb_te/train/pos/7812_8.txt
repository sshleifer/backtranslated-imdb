South Africa is a long film about a very important role from Stephen Biko. One of these blacks who do not survive apartheid has long died before their normal time. The earlier film did not show how important Bika is. His life and his teaching were very low, some intriguing remarks. The film from 1987 is to attract South Africa, the liberating edge of South Africa. The film was aimed at showing how racist supporters in 1987 saw racist discrimination. The film is to show that the film is beyond Bicca's death, so its speech is not the center of the biko, but the white revolutionary journalist and his abusive system of living. His escape was mandatory when he was a victim of his compensation and his family. Because he wants to publish the first book in Bika after his death and can only happen in England. The film leads to an escape from South Africa, but apartheid still stands out and is still being killed. So do not expect this to be realistic and true. It's not. But the film is of magnificent age because it does not show South Africa with any historical distance and Nelson Mandela is in far-flung attitude to the presidency and apologizes to those who wish to be forgiven. The film is strong and emotional but a very historic limit makes it weak today, especially since the film is not about third-class society, Indians. Panegyric books or movies have all that defect: they are looking for the person who is supposed to portrait portrait from just one point. However, as it turned out, the film explains why the film has long been a number of years old. <br /> <br /> Doctor Jacques Coullow, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorobane, University Versailles St Quentin Ann Evelynes, CGD
