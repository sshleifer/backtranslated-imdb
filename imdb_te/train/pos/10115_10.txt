The film deals with brutality in Derry 30 years ago, commonly known as Bloody Sunday. <br /> <br /> The film is well researched, starred and directed. The truth is as close as we'll get until the outcome of the Savile inquiry. This film is worse in the context of that time. This also shows the brutality of the soldier. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a wonderful play that is moving and surprising. When a Savile report comes out, see this again to see how true it is.
