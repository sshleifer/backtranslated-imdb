1933 (for example "duck soup") appeared to be a great year, and this is even better if it is about the invasion of the bridge. Since the magazine's "Goings About About Town" page starts, Tone has a humorous piece from The New Yorker. The odd casting is the only thing. A few years later, William Powell and Myrna Lai were perfect. However, after 1934, such a sophisticated approach did not involve adultery in young and beautiful Loretta Young, a british team listening to some pruning and soft suits or a bridge competition on the radio. Even if you do not know anything about the bridge, you might want to see a rare example of Hollywood idiot.
