Why not pick up this bag full bag? This is an excellent commentary for the frequently shot / performed part. Visuals are breathtaking (especially on wide-screen ... Pan & Scan kills the wonderful cinematography and sets of this film really). Each frame is a painting. Astounding. The play is completely intact, and Branagh's passion is evident from its early titles. No Zefferelli here, can only make a great story, but rarely. Jacqui is absolutely perfect as Hamlet's killer uncle: Measam-Curling did not play bad villain, but a lovely politician, let's see why Hamlet only suspects foul play. Brong Hamlet's fake / real madness and the intimate man of the line between his burning fever is also fulfilled. And many characters do not get much better, everyone from Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Dapardeau and Charlton Heston, you refused to lose in the eyes of Branagh. A mesmerizing.
