The series has stayed with me for 20 years, just a season. It's never been so far and above all my favorite cartoon. I will give you almost anything to have anything on the DVD or in the format I can get. If you see this series, I suggest you take full advantage. The first part of this series (in my opinion), is a true coherent storyline that spread across many episodes. It also really cares about the characters and what has happened to them. Goose's character heck sometimes feared me. He was just odd at that time. Even the group leader reminds me a lot of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones's combination. If anyone has any way to contact the creator / owner of the rights to the series, put them in DD, for all that!
