The film was her younger years Queen Victoria's life and her first few years as Emperor of Great Britain. <br /> <br /> "Young Victoria" has an amazing product. Each scene is decorated in detail and in detail. Extreme clothes, luxurious lands and beautiful landscaped gardens make "The Young Victoria" more impressive. I am very amazed by the intelligent cinematography. Each sequence is well composed as to how each person is placed in the background or in the foreground. When Victoria talked to Melbourne, I brought a lot of attention. Melbourne is in the middle of the door frame from Victoria's perspective, the Melbourne's perspective is between Melbourne and Melbourne, where Melbourne is in the hands of the hand that holds his hand in his hands. <br /> <br /> The story of the story, which is very shortened, is to follow and understand a man without the historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events have also been flown or not explained. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Young Victoria" is a good movie, and I think it would be much better if it was longer. , So events could not be properly explained without rush.
