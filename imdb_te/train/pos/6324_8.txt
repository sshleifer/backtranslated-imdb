These guys have no common suspicions but anything! There are a whole bunch of oddballs that they like to see you away, but they are very rare that they have very little chance. One of the better than William H Macy in the role of man with a big heart is on his luck. This was his best performance since the portrayal of Fergus Sum Rockwell's role as Madehead Boxer. And the rest of the gang is the same. Luis Guzman brought some great comic relief as kosimo and George Clooney steals every scene <br /> <br /> Directed by the Brothers of Russia. The Ken Brothers is enjoying the film and it's interesting. See how they develop their careers. They are a long way to go to Coen's match but this is a fantastic start and I look forward to their next celluloid outing. ....... "Yu mutha's whore"!
