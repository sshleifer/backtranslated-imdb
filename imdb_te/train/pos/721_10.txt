ROCK ROCK ROLL HIGH SCHOOL has a special place in my heart because it introduced me to Ramones. In the mid 70's of the band I was very young at the time when I was quite familiar with them, even though I was a big fan of old time. Finally, I saw RNRHS on television one day afternoon in the 80s and so on by the age of fifteen, and laughed all the way through it. (I was reading this film two years later after a year and seeing Ramones concert scenes and thinking again, "Man, these boys kick kick! Some of their albums will have to be checked! " The rest is history. Twenty years, countless number of Ramones LPs / cassettes / CDs and three rumons, they are still one of my favorite bands and the RNRHS still cracks me every time I watch. Now Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny are away from us (R.I.P. All) at least this tones of the movie and great music to remember them.
