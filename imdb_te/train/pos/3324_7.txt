Some have welcomed the difficult task of merging with romantic sports. In fact, sports and romance are like oil and water. So, together with the two on the screen successfully ... well, that's about the equivalent of the division of the atom. I did not think it would be done. I usually say I do not like romantic comedies ... but I love a lot about sports and sports. This film is a good good mix of both. Being a baseball fan, Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Fallon) is a funny Boston redson fan, so I can really appreciate humorous tests. Anyone who knows anything about Basel knows the curse of the Babe that has suffered from the late 1990s redsx, and knows how nuts they are in Reds fans about baseball. Farere brothers took a great job and was designed for good humor. This is a good film that appeals to many people.
