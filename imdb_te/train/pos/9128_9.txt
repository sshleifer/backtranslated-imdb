I accept purple rain one of my deepest flawed pleasure. Purple rain only broke the boundaries, it set a decade, costumes, music, behavior, and dance! To this day, my friends and I still pretend to be the Jam and Prince and Revolution for the Purple Rain Soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Now, this movie, I say in the title, for the most part, the movie is made by music. Acting? Please do not let it judge me because I have my favorite convictions because I know that it is not worth any Oscar. But I took this film duo Morris and Jarome, their passage about passwords is beyond just hilarious. I want to rate this movie concert scenes because I thought it was the movie. <br /> Prince has created a music genius and beautiful music. While the film and the acting are very bad, the film is still watching overnight and very dance. This picture is defined as 80s, so enjoy it. Prince wants to do that, just coming down to the party! Oh, boy, lame sound. <br /> <br />
