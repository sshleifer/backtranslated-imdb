The film was first seen on Chelakax Friday, and it's interesting to me after the Dark Series (back when the cable box was built as a keyboard). Though it is a meaningful factor for the film, it has acted well. Depardieu & Dewaere's performances are very pleasant. They have a good chemistry and Miu-Mi makes a pink hue exciting. The politically timely time (not least in the US) is made because of sensation of violence, exploitation, and general sexuality. The film is good for good talent and is a good thing with good talent. It hurt me so much that Patrick Deveier committed suicide. In the near future I get your hand out of the DPARDY and MYU-MYOVE
