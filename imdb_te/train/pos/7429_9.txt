She is an extraordinary singer, who cares about anything !!!! The last scene show biz - bar is one of the best moments in all! I'm glad she kept her camera for ten minutes - she deserves that iconic title - the power of the voice. <br /> <br /> I first saw this film at the age of five, and it made a big difference to me. I'll see today, and yes, I can see some flaws (Esther is like giving up Grammy's right to announce her award). <br /> <br /> But some of the comments of other users are plain false - that is where the inappropriate dance is - perhaps we have seen different pictures ??? <br /> <br /> Stilland's singing ability is remembered, and if she has a big ego - fine! <br /> She stomped.
