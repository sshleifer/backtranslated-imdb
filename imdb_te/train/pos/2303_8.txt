The dead man is a veteran of the farming family in the 1950s. The main story follows a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon), who raised a crush on a 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London) , She ends up falling for her sister (Emily Warfield) and how unexpected tragedy will never change the dynamics of this family. In the 1950s, here's a love-inspiration and the screen place you come to almost immediately. Witherspoon already begins to show the emerging Oscar-winning talent in this early role and London makes a lovely celebrity. Warfield increases the morbidity of the sick, which also gives the role of an older sister. Sam Watersston and Tes Harper played the role of children's parents and Gail Strickland, who plays London's mother. By this silent and influential play I accidentally moved, it stimulates strong emotions and deeply understands the phrase "family relationships".
