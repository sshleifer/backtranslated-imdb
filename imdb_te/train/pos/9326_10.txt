I wanted to be honest and I bought this movie because not because of content, but because David Kubitt was in it; I know ... no matter what or what? <br /> <br /> I do not know what I expected from watching this movie, I have read other writings, but on other sites but I have to say that the brothers have drawn into the world since I almost get it. Calm Peor is credited with the role of David Kubert Theo and Ryan, and the film shook their relationship after the two brothers tried to get to know each other again after the death of their brothers and siblings. <br /> <br /> When Theo Ryan realized that homosexuals played inspirationally, he literally walked in a scene, leaving Ryan unmoved - which he had. <br /> <br /> This movie is well researched and is therefore very sad, moving, exciting and parts of a life of celebrations. I'm away from the tragic feelings that Ryan went on, but the drug addict Theo gave me a disappointing and convincing love. I agree with other criticisms that I find the scene that Theo tells him that he will move his father, and I will go a little further to say that I have spoken to my thoughts at Ryan. A father 'and Theo just' you are. <br /> <br /> Theo goes away, but the little exchange of speech speaks of the nature of Ryan's nature by responding simple. <br /> All counts, acting, directing, writing etc. are all well made. I can not really find anyone to tell about this film, unless it says it's very difficult with the death of a loved one, but it's awesome to the level of infinity. In this regard, the emotional and the passion of love (without misery and mkkish) we speak volumes in this selfish world today. <br /> When most movies bring me tears, I usually give myself a break from thinking about life, and I am not happy for all the things I have and I did not, but this film did, and it did not believe in the matter.
