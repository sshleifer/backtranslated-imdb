First of all, I love the central idea of ​​"intruders" and others who are weak in spirit - sometimes even more unpredictable, although mainly subconscious. In fact, the infiltrators are common throughout the film: Prestagonist in the Swiss-French border leads to a breakaway life; In his recurring daytime and nightmares; Within his unhealthy body after heart transplant .... In the last half of the film, he turned into an ancient French colony in the hope of anticipation in the past, he became intruder. <br /> <br /> The whole tone is rather remorseful, remorseful, sad, and ambivalent, failure is more or less dominant. It's the most horrific film at the age of self-paced but disappointing vacuum and lonely age of aging. The director creates more images to feel anxiety and desires than any obvious meanings. Some of them are mesmerizing, but not humorous, the Somanobulist can only see the unrelated dramatic type.
