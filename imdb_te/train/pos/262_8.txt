*** Spoilers *** *** Spoilers *** <br /> This film, "The Divers", is really interesting. I know almost all about Nazi history, Nazi history, underwater scenes and everyone speaking Danish. But I decided to check it for a reason, the story evolved around a drowning WWII German submarine. I've got a fetish for German subs, especially killing ruins. I'm somewhat skeptical about the Danish part, but the subtlet can weigh that weight. <br /> <br /> Nordic films are not always good in budget size, and I'm at least quite skeptical. <br /> I have some ideas because the actors are not perfect, some are very young, especially the two main actors. It's not a complication, they both do well. Other actors have their 50 and more people. It makes some interesting interaction between young and old, often not visible on the screen. Whatever is unique, but somewhat rare. <br /> <br /> The Danish language is very impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> The submarine is also another aspect, and I suspect there may be internal shots and subterranean underwater shots in the submarine. After deciding that their budget is narrow, I felt it was going to be better and worse at the bottom. Again I was amazed, the outdoors of the Wreck are beautiful and interior scenes are quite realistic. German has a fetish for the subs, I must look subtle, especially inside, and not let down. The team did some serious research. It's great. <br /> <br /> I feel that I will issue "I am warning". In this movie the submarine was not a real pattern that existed during the war. It is a special purpose sub. But to give a hint of what you expect, it crosses between a Type VII, Type IX and the Japanese Transport Subchapter equivalent to I-52. <br /> This set is on a Danish island or peninsula, I can not remember. It's summer and two brothers every year they travel to their grandfather to celebrate the summer. Their grandfathers are a sailor. Cinematography is very nice, a lot of summer sequences in the island docks, some newly young love, nice diving atmosphere and "perfect" a simple concept. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the visitors, his 50-year-old man, German eagle and swastika tattooed his back. A German U-boat World War II sank at the end and since then the Nazi gold rumors are deeply reminiscent of all of the island's senior citizens. "<br /> <br /> <br /> *** Warning - spoiler *** <br /> Nazi experiments, Nazi history, treasure hunt, mystery, competition, teen love, intrigue and ... surprise. <br /> I do not expect to see some supernatural elements in this movie and this is a handy fan for me, even though it is not a big fan of psychic events, Well done, no problem faced, it's everyone's vampire at the end It's a bit more subtle, but it's a bit more subtle. <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave it to 8 because it's not a Hollywood movie with an enormous source of resources.I learned that I have a fair budget and some actors are Danish But if it's Hollywood production, I'll give it 7 or 8. Yes, the child's story is in a way, but again The story. It was a lot of suspense and adventure of brilliance, I looked very pretty. Also, the cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> 2001 / medusa <br /> <br />
