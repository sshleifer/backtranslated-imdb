I do not know how low the rating was given in the IMDb. <br /> <br /> In this film, a collective work is performed with "I Curious: Blue". <br /> <br /> The movie is not just a film you like, like psychology, or if you imagine rationality to be porn. <br /> This is not the image you want to discontinue; > <br <br /> <br /> The main thing about this film is that it combines the whole picture of the film, but sometimes you forget that the fables are not real. <br /> <br /> The film is like several films: <br /> <br /> 1. A political documentary about the social system in Sweden. In many ways today are still relevant. <br /> <br /> An interview made by a young girl named Lina. A story about filmmaker Wilgot Szomone is making a film ... He is associated with his star in the film and never participated with the people who have to work. <br /> <br /> The wilgot is going to be filmed. It is a young and very politically active young girl named Leena, who is making a documentary (IE # 1). <br /> <br /> The miraculous and perfect brilliance of "Curious: yellow / blue" is how to cut these elements. In a moment you are watching politics in an interview, and the next time you see what your interview is doing behind the scenes, you sometimes forget that story. <br /> <br /> Dynamic between "yellow" and "blue" If you see one, you should see another. "Blue" is not a sequel to everything. <br /> <br /> Think about the real events in a lifestyle thing about "Yellow". Scenes. <br /> Think about "blue" in 14 scenes in "Yellow" that you have not seen, which is a full story. <br /> <br /> "It is not until I see the first 30 minutes of" Blue ", which I have fully understood to you. <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> "
