I thought this was a fantastic way to spend time on a very hot summer weekend, sitting in the air-conditioned theater and looking at a lighter comedy. The plot is simple, but the dialogue is witty and the characters preferred (the serial killer is also a suspicious bread). They're not point to this point 2: While some disappointment when absorbing risk addiction, I thought Wooden Allen still proved that the control of the style to grow so much love for us is entirely up. It has long been a lot of Woody's comedy films (Did I say a decade?). I was never impressed with Scarlett Johansson, in which she was able to reduce her "sexy" image and abandoned the average, but enthusiastic young girl. <br /> <br /> This crown may not be a jewel, but is more attractive than "Devil Wears Prada" and is more interesting than "Superman", a great comedy to watch with friends.
