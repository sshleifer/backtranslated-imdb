The really different cast is that this performance is low in FOX. This is kind of a sitcom that grows on you. If you look at just 1 show, you do not like it, but if you see two or three times - you'll be tied up. <br /> <br /> Some of the jokes are shed. Similar to today, the themes are very mature. Humor is generally very mature. <br /> <br /> In this movie Red (Kurtwood Smith) is a well-known actor doing some good dancing humor. Debra Joe Roop plays well in this ensemble. Danny Masterson, the oldest actor of "Children" is great. Lara Preston (Donna) is a natural redhead (who has come up with a blonde in her) appearances well in earlier shows. She often shows good talent & comic timings. <br /> This is one of the better entries in FOX in the sitcom department, one of the most successful live action
