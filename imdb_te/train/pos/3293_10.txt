If you want to remember the song from yesterday film, it means "Chloe de Dar Chalo cham ke paar chalo" which means sung the song by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohad. Rafi, Kaif Bhopal's lyrics and sailboats are not about cinematography when it comes out against black background and shining stars. The other is "Chalte Chalte." Before you die, you can see Kumari's final film, the time it took to see the screen. Each of the songs she painted, she looks small, but not later. But an actor who does not change in his acting eventually falls in love with Raj Kumar, especially when she goes to the train cabin and looks at how beautiful she is. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakey is a beautiful romantic story. It should be seen on the big screen as possible only for cinematography and songs. The film is directed by Meena Kumari, Rajkumar and Ashok Kumar and is directed by Kamal Amrohi. <br /> <br /> The grandson of Kamal Amrohi has now started renewing his father's studio comedy film.
