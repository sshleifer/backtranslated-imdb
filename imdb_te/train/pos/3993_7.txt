"The Mother" is an unnatural low-budget film, at least two uncomfortable themes are not explored in the film: rejecting the mother for their own son and daughter, and at the age of a masculine and passion. <br /> The letters are terrible: May be a frustrating lady, I believe that I can not feel any sympathy or sorrow. She agrees that she does not love her son and daughter. She has betrayed her husband twice by a madman. She steals her daughter's beloved, not protecting her from a morally ill, does not love her, but she feels the son with him. After she loses her husband, her daughter attempts to maintain her life by destroying illusions. Paula, her daughter, agrees with her life very much. Her brother Bobby lost his savings, his wife, who insisted that he had his shop, was actually a horrible business. <br /> <br /> Acting and directing is very good: actresses and actors have the best performances and the direction is very accurate. I liked this movie, but I realized that many were recommended to specific audiences. My vote is seven. <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Re-Start")
