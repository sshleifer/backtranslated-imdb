The film was sitting in Tivo for a few weeks after I watched. I was scared of the self-pleasing UPA film about the bad relationships I went through. I'm mistaken; <br /> <br /> This format is Max Ophals 'La Lande,' based on the play by Arthur Schchnitler, an "inspiration" credit. It stands out in a street corner in Brooklyn, where a man starts from a courtesan. She succeeded by a home contractor who had sex with her on the hood with her car, but could not come. She refused to pay her. When he is frustrated, she answers her cell phone and takes a message. <br /> <br /> The story turns into a professional caller contractor on a rich, frustrated New York woman, who plays with him until he is provoked. She is desperate and says she is sick; He tells her how beautiful she is, and lucky her. When he goes, she asks if she will have a sexual relationship with her. She sat on top and bounces up and down. <br /> The woman and her husband dismissed a feast for their sophisticated friends. While talking about the hubby (Robert) business, the wife (Ellen) is frustrated, and becomes subject to sex, and how often men and women think about it. The husband turns the conversation into the desert. Then, after the guests leave, Ellen tries to get Robert into sex. Robert did not want anyone, and put it on the jazz record. Ellen turns on the radio; Robert changes music; Ellen turns on TV; Robert turns into another TV. Cacophony slaves. Ellen goes on the roof, and Robert meets her. Ellen has a lot of men agree to enjoy people rather than Robert. <br /> <br /> When we follow Robert, an artist played by Steve Bassemi meets Martin. He can play more roles in Buscuse, a sexy, smart, full-hearted person. Robert praises Martin's work, assuring more than it deserves, promises to take part in the show. While Robert turns out he is talking from his groin, Martin is enthusiastic. Martin attempts to kiss Martin on the lips, Martin tells him that he is gay but is not gay. Martin made it clear that Robert was not a homosexual. Both artworks are acknowledged as bad. When Robert allows Robert to kiss him, he is leaving. <br /> They follow Martin, who is preparing for an art exhibition at the Manhattan Gallery. He was killed by receptionist, Anna, starring Rosario Dawson. <br /> <br /> Her boyfriend, Nick (Adrian Greener), has flowers. She was cold for him; He tries to figure out why. She survived from her when she was in San Francisco and had sexual relations with her. While in San Francisco, she put the fact that she stayed in her former village and had sex with her. The next statement will be a lie. Two of them participate in feasts, but she decides they break down. <br /> <br /> Nick, we accept his problems for an elderly woman who meets on the park bench, Joey (Carol Kane). Joey is a strange and childlike, but a good spectator for Nick, he needs a sympathetic ear. Both of them go to the island of Kony at night and see the stars. Nick comes under Joey's spell, despite the age difference between them. They go to Joey's apartment, and Nick realizes that she has sex with a silly elderly woman. She is on top of him, do not let him go. <br /> <br /> It is Joey's phone rings, and it is one of the friends of the psychedelic friends network, and Joey is one of the supernatural friends (played by Lottie's wife in the taxi). Although she is still damaging from Nick, she gradually reaches her mental shirt. That night is in his office, and she wants to have sex with her. Joey's business is gone, Joey goes, and the man is coming. She wants to avoid talking, but she finds that the man has abandoned the phone, and that he has stolen a lot of money from her company, and tomorrow is found. His life was destroyed. Joey finds that the man is going to commit suicide, she believes that she is her friend, and she asks about her. <br /> The man creates a pistol into his briefcase and finds a prostitute on the Brooklyn waterfront, and we first came back and opened La Ronde for the same prostitute. She wants to give him $ 75,000 in cash if she kills him. He tried to kill himself but could not. The prostitute wants to do it, but holds his hand and holds a gun in the mouth and emphasizes where his point is. Eventually, the gun goes away, and the prostitute walks down the street, usually joining her business. His pre-paid contractor in the movie will roll down the window. They see each other. End.
