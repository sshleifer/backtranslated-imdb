Fort Teenage Friends go to Fort Lauder for spring break. Unfortunately, they get a flat tire in Medley, Georgia, and one of the girls witnesses the deepest murder of the forest. The local sheriff is behind the crimes and the nightmare begins ... "Surface Grave" is a pleasant little budget surprise. The cast is preferable, the direction is stable and violence is pretty horrible especially evil and misogynistic.Especially second murder. The killings seem to have been remorseful for what he did with scenes not a dimensional role. The subplot with two boys who meet in the diner will go somewhere, but the stalking scenes in the woods are 10 to 10 minutes.
