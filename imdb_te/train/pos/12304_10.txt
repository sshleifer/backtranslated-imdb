This is a great movie. The coin goes up to get his ink, and I like the skeletons chasing him, but fortunately he was shattered, opened the window and did not notice them. xiao qian is pretty much too much. & When it's hard to sew up our wu's butt, its silly. And when he says standing great between the two swords while the great thing on the ground is very great. Many kill him when he sees a part of his buns. Then you see him reading poems when you run to escape from wolves. Love scenes romantic, Xiao Quian and Ning are beautiful. Comedy timing, giant tongue, and horror, romance, comedy, all at once. Not to mention the spectacular special effects of the 90s.
