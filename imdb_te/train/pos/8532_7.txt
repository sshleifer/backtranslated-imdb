Lupine goes for Morocco, looking for an epic treasure. His only clue is an interesting ornament given to him by the old man. <br /> <br /> An interesting fact about this film is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual and is usually a different place than Lupine. On the one hand the classics dynamically absorb, but this is the pace change. Plus, in this way, Lupine can focus on ladies ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko rules in this. Her lupine seduiting throughout the feature, and to us viewers. Then there is Laura, this is a short story of the story, and she's very fond of it. <br /> <br /> The best villain in this is a very entertaining elegant ninja guy, and naturally he has some great fighting with gomone, which is more nudity than any other Lupine anime. , As well as Fujiko some pleasant scenes. Inspector Zenigata is of course a warpath here, in fine form. <br /> <br /> Pretty much, this lupine is a smooth ride. The plot has an average and some slow spots, but all this is a real pleasure in the film. Enjoy.
