Compared to hundreds and hundreds of detective films from the 1930s and 40s, there is an exceptional score for a small film, nine being the best, and Powell's "Slim Man" films. Although the Kennel Murder case is not a comedy, the film is not like the Thin Man films as it is a traditional mystery-detective movie. Now it's not fun to have Nora Charles or Asta or traditional comic parody (something that looks practically in all of the movie detective films) but I do not miss them because such an exceptionally well-written movie - all with a genuinely interesting case and uniformly magnificent performances. <br /> <br /> The film begins at the show of dogs and is known as the Kennel Murder Case, but the Phillo Vance film is actually the main character of the film to have a dog show and a short time in the dogs. Instead, a totally hated person dies and leaves in a completely closed room - an idea that is repeated in many other detective films (like the CRIME DOCTOR's Stranger Case). However, this all seems pretty reliable and well suited to put together - keeping my interest across. I certainly had other detective movies on that day with a cleverly written plot and extraordinary performance. This is definitely a keeper.
