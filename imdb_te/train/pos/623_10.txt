All movies in the film gave me a feel like Stardust. Like the awesome fairy tale of The Princess Bride, Stardust is very strictly fantastic entertaining of the 2000's as well as the spectacular 1990s. Having amazing, hilarious and amazing imagery as well as unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and especially Robert DeNiro, I challenge anyone to see this film without a smile. You know how to complete it from the first ten minutes, but it's not the destination to travel the visitor and to the viewer from beginning to full. <br /> <br /> Ten stars are low.
