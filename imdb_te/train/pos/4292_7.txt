I did not know anything about the film before looking at it and I thought it was the "hope" factor that helped me to be the first to live. This is more than what I was expecting. </ P> <p> But interesting. I think this story throws the audience a little bit. The soundtrack does not play in the background as it creates a "Romantic" atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Emma and Louise is just sensitive. There is some different strange chemistry I can not afford; I fell in love with it, here I am writing this review. Micro love acting is amazing by the two actors, and I believe that this is the main part of the film. <br /> <br /> This film is not a romantic comedy; Of course, not all of us appreciate it. I sat down for a while and slowly started to understand the little things that were not originally caught. I can not guarantee everyone, but I hope you will.
