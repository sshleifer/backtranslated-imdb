Booth puts a whole new twist in your typical J-Horror film. The film will keep you in the boots of the film's hero. <br /> <br /> This storyline, the protagonist, the love, and the intention of the people who love our hero and wants to know what he sees around him. An old radio station is DJ Booth. The story absorbs the layers of the main character as an onion in the flash-backs while running its course, and from that we find that things are not always visible. The film took place in a small, outdoor radio station's studio with much bad history as the main role of the radio station radio station was to force the broadcast of its broadcast. This film will develop from this limited space and you feel very claustrophobic and very suspicious. For some time, our heroine was not surprised by the strange events of the old studio with ghost or some conspiracy by his colleagues or that it was in his mind. I love the movie, the filmmakers look through the eyes of the main character and you are just as suspicious as the protagonist. The film is very smart, with a little 76-minute film adaptation.
