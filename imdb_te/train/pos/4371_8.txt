When Braveheart first came out, I was in good health, and one of the movie's favorite fans. When Rob Roy came out, I was amazed, and enjoyed the movie but I did not think it was a great movie. However, as time passed, my appreciation for Rob Roy grew, and my enthusiasm for Braveheart was reduced. Braveheart is great fun, perfect, but there are also errors. The most important thing to me is that the role played by Robert the Bruce is without Scotland's great king. Another historic flawed film kills the movie in accordance with historical distortions. Even if I'm in this movie, even in reality feel sad, Melis Gibson's egomania's openings have been seen clearly (by my least), not only for the first time can be seen clearly. By contrast, Rob Roy grew up over me for years. Partially because it does not bother many minds in Braveheart. Rob Roy is like a good wine, because with every view it becomes more mature and complex.
