Serials go "Zorro's Fighting Legion" one of the best action serials of the 1930s. Studios were still made in the cast of the big cast, the 12 walls of the wall wall. <br /> <br /> The newly formed Mexican Republic of Benito Juarez (Carlton Young) is trying to keep his new country in a great financial way in 1824. Finally, he has rich golden goods sent from the local San Mendoleta mine to the Capitol. <br /> <br /> The members of the local council plant hopes to establish itself as the ruler of Mexico, with the help of a golden aristocrat and local yachie tribe to steal goods on behalf of Don-Dell-Oro. Don Francisco (Guy D'Eunice), who opposes him, creates a squad of locals helping Juarez. Don Francis Don-Dell-Oro's men, a stranger, fopish Don Diego (Reed Hadley) arrives in town. With the help of his friends Ramon (William Corsoon) and Juan (Bud Buster), Diego echoed Zoro Legion. <br /> <br /> Diego and Ramon both caught seats on the local governing council. Soon some of the council's other members are in the league with Don-Dell-Oro. The first council chairman (Lyndor de Cordova), Manuel Manuel (John Merton), Chief Justice Pablo (C. Montagu) and Gonzolez (Edmund Cobb). <br /> <br /> Zorro suspects several hairstyles that escape from his colleagues from the followers of Zorro and Don-Dell-Oro. We have a so-called cord bridge, a deep ridge between the two peaks that can only go to the safety of the zorro, crashing, fires, coaches and carts passing crash or cliff. There are hats here for the leader of the Republic's delicate team through the legendary Yakima Canat and Yergros, Bill and Joe. <br /> <br /> Donald jumps off his signature stunt on the team of cantat runaway horses, and then dropped under the coach that he repeated in other films, including John Ford's "Stage Coach" in the same year. <br /> However, Zorro will eventually restore peace to the valley before the false god Dan-Dell-Oro and the sunset in Chapter 12. <br /> <br /> Other people in the cast are Din-Dell-Oro's men like Gian Pierce, Curtie Dresden and Charlie King, and if you look closely you might find bits by future serial star and loan manager Rene Clayton Moore and Stuntman Canutt in bits . Jim Pierce's "Big", Tarzan playing in "Tarzan and the Golden Leome" (1927) and Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs daughter Jon Burroughs reminiscent of his marriage. /> Fully enjoyable.
