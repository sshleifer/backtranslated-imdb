Goldie will always go down as one of the most legendary games in VG history. There is no doubt about it. But even if it is very different, this game will be a modern Bond champ. <br /> <br /> It is not a bond game based on material from another medium. It's totally new; Scripted game. It also has its own theme song! (Hah! No bonding!) The gameplay is amazing, and if you're a fan of Bond games or movies, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Cast members cast their roles to the fictional creations for the game, rather than some / much gameplay. It gives a more cinematic feel. <br /> <br /> With the story that you can make as many players as you are losing in a movie, you feel you are in the game. Even if the game is defeated, there is a lot more. Ranking system and unlocking, as well as its multi-player missions, is a stand-out game. Despite the old age now, in the video game years. When you experience the need to get a bit of your life, you can play & play. Even thinking about it now, I got the theme song stuck in my head. <br /> <br /> As the actors are in front of them, life on the screen is coming, and every bit is entertaining as a game. The real Bond fashion is amazing. It's awesome, awesome name. </ P> <br /> I have now dismissed this game. If you have not played yet, you are missing!
