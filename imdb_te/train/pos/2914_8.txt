Many films have not been made about Aviation's Light-Thane-Air (LTA) aspect, but this is one of them and this is good. <br /> For the most part, the naval blimp works with NAS Lakehurst (in the role of NAS Tustin). Wallace Beer is a preferred non-Munchausen senior chief Ned Trump, who plays a listed pilot, no one really believes that its long stories have gotten too often. <br /> <br /> The second half of the World War II scenes are fun. The disabled son of the widow ended up having a father-son relationship with Jess. He will never walk without crutches by doctors, the chief trumpet pulls some strings and the sailor flight helps restore the sagging leg of the surgeon lad. <br /> <br /> Jess wants to join the Navy to become a Flight Officer, flying blimps back at Lakehurst and experiencing a new set of challenges. <br /> <br /> Very well done movie, some of Hollywood's dialogue is the last in technical advisors without slipping, and Marie Berry's clear inability to step in. Otherwise the film will get better sequences of technical accuracy, and provides a rare look at Navy's LTA operations. The exchange of money between Trumpet and Jess's future love katie, cash register scene, is an absolute egg.
