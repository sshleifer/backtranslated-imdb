I was one of those people who'd be crawling a mile through broken glass to see a hall Heartly film. From TRUST and IRIS to Henry Fowl and (My Heartly Fan), the flavor of Hall's unique brand of films purchased. His Fort feels filling the mystery / spying on equal parts with the ingenious comedy. Comedy is not necessarily your face, and often runs across the entire scene before coming to the scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> Henry Fool's sequel Faye Grimm suffers with Faye Grimm. Fay spends a quiet life until she comes home to find a CIA agent in her kitchen. His name is Fullbright (Jeff Gold Blum, Ian of the Year) and he wants Henry Notebook. There are many Henry Fool notebooks, and they believed they had no previous gas wanderings. Clearly they have a lot of them. Secrets of weapons weapons research or terrorists? Henry but who knows. Agent Full Bright reveals that her husband has died, but it tries to find her way back home and search for Henry (it works ... but not the way they think). <br /> <br / phi Henry collects notebooks and fights many spy rings to find him. His brother Simon (James Urbaniak) is jailed from prison and she has signed a contract with the CIA to go to prison (he has helped Henry to escape Henry Fool's film.) Multiple overlapping events are fast: spy rings shoot each other, finds Henry in a jihadist "security" Leaving the brother, but the life of his son And threatened to put dangerous phase eliyakundane CIA gets his guard. <br /> <br /> Hall Heart, loves to play with themes. And he's going to do so seriously here. There are also their own unconscious meanings that even the character names (grim, fool, fulbrite, fog) are very funny. Ol's over-the-top spy films have been given plenty of screen placement, and firearms are put into fire in stop-motion sequences, and always on her line when she's our hero. <br /> <br /> Now that I have made the appreciation of this creation, I would say that Fake Grimm's Parker Posey's character is not the best part of the film, which insulted how much time she would spend on her screen. I realized it was probably that I wanted Hurley: Italy is an abusive woman with serious hand gestures. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, fans probably swallow Fay Grimm and pray more and more. This is not my favorite Hall Heartley movie, I know I'm ready.
