Peter Ustinov plays the role of an unconscious who comes out of jail when the movie starts. As soon as he runs out of the gates, he immediately stole and starts working on a scheme to make a bundle, this time he has a pretty high set of attention. This is actually one of the weak points about the film, he does not know anything about computers (some have returned in 1968), but literally to become computer intellectually literally! Yes it is true. Anytime, he starts a scheme to deal with a computer expert and get a job with a large American corporation, so that he can kidnap a ton of cash. Computers are fundamental to considering his knowledge, which manages how wonderful he puts into a clever plan effect and infiltrates the computer system and its protection. But, it's a movie, so I've stopped disbelief. By the end of the film he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) are likely to run with one million pounds. <br /> In the end, it was quite confusing and Smith announced that she managed to accumulate more than two million in fact through active investment in the companies that started Ustinov (though they are all dummy companies). In the end, this means that these stocks are worthless. They seem to know (and here I guess I'm wrong), which Ustinov and his new partners have stuck in stocks and the stocks are so useless. Either way, the film seems to be posted on a magic end and nobody is hurt and everyone is happy - and this just does not make much sense. Acting and writing is really a shame, which is really great. <br /> <br /> If I feel like described at the end, please let me know that this image is very blurry in the final details.
