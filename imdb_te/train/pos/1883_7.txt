Wonderful comedy film by Dudley Moore, supported by Liza Minnelly and good-talking John Gielgood. Moore Arthur, a multi-millionaire family, is close to earning $ 750 million, and marries another woman (Susan) from another multimillionaire family. In theory, Arthur accepted the situation, but eventually met Nice and poor Linda (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he just enjoyed drinking and enjoy the prostitutes. After many serious thoughts in her life and for the first time, Arthur decided to marry Susan shortly after their marriage. Linda and Arthur are ultimately happy, but know that his life will change in the near future. This comedy is a good lesson for everyone. The riches are generally not happy in their lifestyle.
