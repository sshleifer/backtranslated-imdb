The film, which was recently shown on cable television, is opened by refusing any contribution from real life individuals. It has the eye catcher. Yet the scripting and acting from the main characters is fantastic and I found myself engrossed throughout. In no small way of active, thoughtful and interesting dialogue. The film is drawn together in the past about a one-day meeting between two real life musical "legends". The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophy, and in a story, it promotes the explanation for their initial "split". The actors have to give them seemingly realistic pictures that they play, the characters and the flaws and all this, leaving the audience least at least believe I've seen the real incident in almost every detail. The great skill of this drama can be done in a film about "talking about two" in a film that can be a stunning masterpiece featuring chaotic writing and respect. Value at least 8 to 8.
