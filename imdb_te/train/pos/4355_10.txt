I also saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. This is an amazing film about adult family relationships. Paul Ryser wrote the film and added some similarities to his family. It's funny, warm, sharp, and moving, as well as entertaining. This film is very well done with the word oral review. I will definitely tell my friends and family to watch this movie. Let's hope they will have the opportunity. I will rate this film in the best films I have seen in a year. It does not question whether violence, action scenes, murders, sexuality, and so the distributors have chosen it. Believe me, there are usually people who like to go to look at a movie like this in redemption, instead of many common large box office blockbars given there.
