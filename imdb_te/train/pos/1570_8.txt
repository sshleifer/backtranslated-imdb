Okay, my personal list here is Nicktoons similar to today: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Just note a word with only letters? <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is a simple but great animation comedy - Mr. Blick, Gordon, and Waffles - mainly three wealthy cats - from trying to reach the human Kimberly's sleek party for root beer to protect a planet of slugs from evil space Fortunate and truly surreal. This is a nick show you have to tickled sooner or later your funny bone! The theme song is impressive and memorable. Voice actors - including Wayne Knight from "Seinfield" franchise - brings a fresh life with quirky personalities too. Stories are enjoyable (fans of "All Route Beer King" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). And humor all the earthworm gym takes place in some style. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Catscratch" is one of the Nickentens series, "Invader Jim" and "MLAATR", which has become very popular worldwide for just 3 seasons or less.
