Tilman Jr.'s play about the first African American Navy Master Driver (Guding Jr.), achieves his goals despite a harder barrier training, overcoming all kinds of inequalities. The screenplay is not bad, sometimes a bit extreme, but directed and acting is the first rate, and this film is inspiring and achieving what it needs to do. Although I do not like Deniro in the lead role, even though I'm not equal to his main works (Taxi Driver, Godfather and others), it's as good as other good performances, such as King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and believable here, a very good performance, is not bad for the gooding junior, certainly one of his good performances. --- IMDb rating: 6.6, my rating: 9/10
