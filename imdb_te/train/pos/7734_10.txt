A few years ago I saw this film and I said that I loved so much. Jason Patrick played for this extraordinary role. The director? I can not do much things about him ... and I care for t. The screenplay is nice playing, it's perfect. In some of the films I told you about this original, weird and dark film, but that's fine. I've seen a few years ago and have never seen it since then and I want to see it again.I know that it does not see me ill. Scenes, atmosphere, actors, story ... everything is fine.This movie has stayed away .I feel that 120 minutes will be perfect. I hoped for a part 2 for this film.It's not bad. Jason Patrick: You're a man! Very good picture. End. :-)
