This is my favorite movie as a child, and sometimes in stage construction I'm always my favorite muscles and I can not change the story of Averiver Twist back to the screen, which is better than this <br /> <br /> My all-time favorite "bad guy" Oliver Reed as Bill Sixes. My age was aged when he was about six years old, but now I have a much more affiliation with Nancy's character, a bar maid / prostitute who helps Oliver get the life that he deserves. Zack Wild is amazing, like the artistic cheat, and I have not made him out for anyone, street-pocket picker, and Fagin's best friend. <br /> <br /> Music is fantastic, especially Fagin's numbers, and I'm not even given Bill Sykes's music, it does not work with him. Carol Reed has done an excellent job of Nancy's sticky ending, giving her a rating of G rating by breaking her beating, but she has been given away enough to show Bill's violence. <br /> <br /> The film is a beautiful scene, and is accompanied by a bad music, as well as a moving drama that follows a little kid when trying to find out where he lives.
