"The Tenant" is a great film IMO of Roman Polanski. And I love "Chinatown", but it's very original and unusual and clear creepy. It's also a great black comedy. I showed some people that this film was very painful, and then some people would be advised to do so. Paulens performs a major role in directing and playing the lead in "The Tenant".
