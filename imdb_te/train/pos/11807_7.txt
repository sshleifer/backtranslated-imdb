After watching Dick Tracy in the 6.99 $ bin at the Future Shop, I decided that I would be a big fan of Mafia and Crime films without previous knowledge. I am very happy with it and also a smart entertaining film with great performances. The film moves well, which has another great performance from Werene Beatty, but the real stands of the movie Al Pacino and Madonna. I'm glad to know that I have been nominated for his performance on the top gangster trying to get to the city of Pacino. Madonna was great as a child in distress, she really drew me and added depth to her performance. If you go with a fun, good acting and smart image with a solid script then go with the desire attitude to see Dick Tracy try one. I do not think you're disappointed. Look for characters from Paul Sorvino, James Ken, Kathy Beats and Dustin Hoffman.
