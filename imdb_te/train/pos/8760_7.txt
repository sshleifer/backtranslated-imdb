It refreshed to see a movie you think almost like every other American movie ends, that did not happen and then surprise. I like the happy ending as the next person, but sometimes it's better to portray it in a more realistic way, and I thought I'd done this in the Brooklyn Palace. <br /> <br /> With a friend primarily she left her predecessor poor behavior and moved them in the first place and moved them very much. In the end, I eventually agreed to her because the movie about the friendship between the two girls told me about crime. <br /> <br /> The story is the boundary of the cliche, but the actresses kept my attention to their amazing performances. Very realistic, very attractive. <br /> 10 to 7.
