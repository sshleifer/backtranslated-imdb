First, when I know my stake in Star Wars, I want to say, I'm not a fan. I do not know how many chromosomes are a vampire rat or a wide family of TK427. I know this: Star Wars, all movies (less so episode 2 though), something magical captured. What's hard to say, what button Lucas found and boldly pressed, but it works. Star Wars is more than a picture. It's an idea. <br /> How can you ask? I will explain. Star Wars templates are very common, touching good vs evil. It is clear, so seriously, any person can literally understand any environment. Episode VI concluded an epic battle between a son and his use and overturned father, along with prequals, revealing to a more disclosed story. Suddenly, it was Darth Vader, and the audience realized that it was just a story about Akin, not just Luca. But even before 1-3, it's all in amazing depth. <br /> <br /> Star Wars is certainly far away from me, and I must admit, when I see them, especially this one, I feel so small. I feel as though I've thrust into a world that is so clearly defined as good and bad. When I look at them, I'm feeling a tiredness, I have a feeling of something, somehow, and any material thing.
