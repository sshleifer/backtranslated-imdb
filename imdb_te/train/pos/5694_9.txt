Wallmaker and Dylan McDermott are excellent. I saw Kimmer in The Doors, but his explanation of John Holmes is amazing. There is nothing compared to the slow boogie knights. Wonderland is a movie which you can show a horrific crime story from the perspective of a person who shows his drug vice and indolent what ever happens around. At the same time, John Holmes's character shows a very brilliant hustler, who is virtually unharmed and in urgent situations. The movie is viewed more than once. The seventies delicate and full of medication is amazing.
