One of the funnest Mario I have ever played. Levels include creative, liquid controls, and good graphics for its time. There is a crazy boss and a group of enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels are frustrating, and you need to get some more skills to fight a boss, leaving some of the hard levels and yet, it will be annoying. Another complaint camera angle; It works very long and sometimes it's a pain. If your big time Mario fan; This is for you. Although he is not your biggest fan of you, I still recommend it. Its a big game, and it takes a while to get what you need, but it is very satisfying. Time is good playing small cracks. It is almost of your interest; It certainly does not have mine!
