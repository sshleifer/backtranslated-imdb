In November 2005, I was able to see my boyfriend at the New York International Film Festival. We saw both the impression of the plot and the mood swings. It is well-liked with very good pictures. Visual effects are excellent - especially small ones. It has an original fantasy approach on a realistic and serious subject: the film is about a young girl who visits a monster to help her with her vicious father. In the end there is also a surprising twist. It refers to the gothic feel. I would love to see this full featured image. - Carrie
