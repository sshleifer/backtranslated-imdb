I really enjoyed the movie, however, I do not realize that Little Richard will have so many things in his life. First of all I do not know about Lucy. Little Girl Relationship With Little Richard Women did not mention any involvement in a romantic way of life. I wonder why this part of her life is not mentioned. Overall the movie is very good. Lyon did not like Little Richard's character, he was a good actor but I think I should go to another actor. Visually Little Richard did not remember me. I'm not fully aware of the conversation in Little Richard. From the film he was portrayed as a sexual slave. In today's time he is advised of counseling to his sexual orientation. He is a marital. I do not want to ruin the movie to a person who has not seen the film, but there are many things about the film that I think should not be part of the final cut.
