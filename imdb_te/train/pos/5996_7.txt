Again and time, if I do not want people to make reconstructions or sequels, I have not seen them and announced that I should enter the world of the independent movie. However, the last time I had seen the independent film six months ago was easy. Here is a review for an indie, I caught my attention on YouTube; Cure. <br /> <br /> Immediately, you can say that the film will go for an Avant-Gary Film process, which will be telegrapped in its use of extreme close ups, scopolia and fast editing. It's so proud to be visible - and it's right. For the most part it is a fine piece, a phenomenon that appears to have a 180-degree rule and a calling card for self-financing projects, which will only save a troubled denial of a humorous evil gun effect. <br /> <Still, despite these amateur mistakes, the majority of the shots are actually a pleasure to see. We're presented with a good use of goods and locations, good visual acting and some very atmospheric, fluid editing, as we have absolutely something you can not see very often at all from a YouTube offering. The plot is split and the basic mantle is quite simple, but some certainly find out exactly what happened, but what is seen here is the Avant-Garde storyline; You can not directly guess the three suite structure and you may not be ready for this type of image. <br /> <br /> The sound is sound but unfortunately sounded. What you hear is that the distorted voice-over is often hypocritical and worse, which is a continuous background music, which goes through less change and does not add much to anything. This is really clear when audio recognizes that the sounds that are most obviously ignored are visualized to the visuals, and realizing that you are losing the four sentences of this article and realizing what took you back to your attention. <br /> <br /> So give it a watch, but the sound is turned off. <br /> The last thought; Who was initially marked by Doug Nallor's Red Dwarf novel "Last Human"? What do you know if I have a book you say?
