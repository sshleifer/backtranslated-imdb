The great Vincent Price made several fantastic horror films, some of which are within the range of great gems of all time. Roger Corman's brilliant P-cycle (the greatest horror cycle of all time), with Michael Reeves' "Witchfinder General" (1968) or Ubaldo Ragana's "The Last Man", "On the Earth" (1964) The images of this man are famous and therefore made him the Amartya Horror icon, although " He started with the "House of Wax" (1953), starting with "Mad Magician" in 1954, following a plot similar to its successful ancestors, but not to say that the film is not originally a joyous horror and absolutely fantastic gem.When the above lines suggest Vincent Price My favorite actor, and, personally, I do not personally lose, my fellow man <br /> <br /> Pryce Stars, the ill-fated magician and inventor of magical devices, known as Dan Galoco (or airgo the Great), whose owner is a worst businessman, His wife (Eva Gourber) stole him. When the owner removes one of the clever discoveries of Galicia and gives it to his opponent, The Great Renault (John Emery), Gallos suffers, and begins a sad murderer of sadness ... <br /> <br /> Does Vincent Pryce love when he retaliates? Some of his most famous and greatest films such as "The Abominable Doctor Fibes" (1971) or "Theater of Blood" (1973) murders some of the murders and revelations of the previous film in his horror career, such as Vincent Pryce. The film offers an amazingly unusual role for Pryce, as always, providing an excellent performance and guarantees a 70-minute outrageous entertaining and horror fun for every horror fan. The other is to see my fellow price fans.
