What about Elvira, who has not already been told in the press of the world? <br /> <br /> From the very first film frame, it is clear that the movie Elvira is fantastic. Heart out, Betty Davis! See a baseless Elvira, see a inspired Elvira, see a jealous Elvarva, see a murderous Elvira. <br /> <br /> This is a lavish desire for a Las Vegas show star at the heart of this comedy work. With the horror hostess (the richest) "Back to Backup", Elvira finds different emotions to the small screen ... and physically! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you have a baby, Learn crazy laughter and lines .... <br /> <br /> Why did she not win the Oscar as the best actress for this role?
