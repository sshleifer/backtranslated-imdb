This film is a real and historical film. It is very useful for LDS church research, because it is 100% true. This is a wonderful movie and I would recommend it. <br /> <br /> It is very genuine, exciting, and inspirational. <br /> <br /> It is about the reconstruction of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and the prophet Joseph Smith, who revived. It was such events in his life that he had a little boy, Emma Smith, Emma, ​​his wife, his birth in his love, and so he had. But the most important is that it reveals the church renewal.
