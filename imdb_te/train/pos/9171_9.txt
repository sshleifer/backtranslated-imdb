I'm a jane ire of lover and purist, and this version has almost all of the important details in the book and I have roles as I expected them. Jane Eyre can not properly distribute in the complex story and feature-length format of great wealth, so it requires a TV mini-series. Timothy Dalton's Rochester is probably the best. He was so attractive and so many talks about his age. In this book, Jane (the narrator) describes him as "roughly 35" and is neither old nor younger. I'm at the age of 38, Timothy Dalton. Also, we only have Jane's opinion that Rochester is beautiful. She rarely asks what she's going to meet and what she wants. As a novice and humble girl, I can not imagine her, she thought him pretty. The actor who plays Rochester has to show us the role of man, and it fulfills perfection. I love the relationship between the two stories, the crucial thing about this story, and their humorous encounters. Other versions have blown it off, but this is correct. Toby Stephen (at the age of 37) is progressing on BBC1 in the 2006 edition and it really looks great, so I decide if this is my favorite when it's done. <br /> <br /> When I saw this series, I decided that this version is better with Timothy Dalton and Gela Clarks after seeing the 2006 version! Charlotte BrontÃ«'s dialogue has been preserved and it is essential for the power of the story. Modernization simply does not work - it has characters that contain a Victorian story and ancient poetic speech. This version has an outstanding cast - Jayla Clark is small and the difference between her and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has a real presence and is an outstanding actor. There are no additional scenes to diverge from the plot and the screenplay has all the necessary scenarios, but it leaves off unnecessary details and makes it point and grip. I recommend it to true Jane Eyre fans.
