My watch was a bit late but I'm glad to see both this and the sequel ... It congratulated the film's manufacturers for giving such pure and basic treatment to Romanticism thought ... and much less separation from the idea of ​​relationships! As far as the film is written about, I would like to highlight some of the parts of this film that I personally liked. <br /> <br /> I think Jessie and Celine phone their phone It's a very smart way to talk to each other about one another without traveling up to 24 hours by their respective friends ... There is a lot of curiosity for the two people who have no effect on the other two <br /> <br /> In the plot front, you have a romantic story on pure conversation <br /> <br /> I'm not easy to incadam romantic similar taste .., the characters are also designed to clear the mind of the writer and the director. Actors get out of the way .. The right or the wrong idea can justify the victims can justify ... If you want a role, the actor's life is to go beyond the notes and story ... the actors just do the right job! Kudos .. And before the sunset it is another feather that makes this even more beautiful!
