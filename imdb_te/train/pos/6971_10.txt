Of course the average "science fiction" war star galactica fan hates it. That kind of pleasure made me happy. I do not like that cheesy science fiction, especially war-star galactica, so I like this show. <br /> <br /> The creators of the show got the heat for it (the extraordinary science-fi way) and it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I have heard that all previous women should appeal to only science fiction members. <br /> <br /> It has a very interesting, intuitive, and deep scripts at any time and is really unique. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p>
