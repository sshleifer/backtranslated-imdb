The movie is about friendship between a businessman and a person with Down Syndrome. <br /> <br /> The role of the character in this film is amazing. Harry believes that he is a businessman who neglects his family, and Georges is an innocent person who loves and carries the "normal" society. Acting is amazing, and Cannes's best actor is well-deserved. <br /> <br /> Fictional scenes from the movie Georges is his desire as a bad mood and general desire to leave his family. The song also supports this song to play repeatedly. Mentally disabled people have a good nature. We treat them with discrimination and negligence, highlighting the scene of a gift to the waitress in the kitchen). If we understand and share the world of these people, we and mentally disadvantaged people can be very happy. <br /> <br /> I painted the emotional experiences in the film and the characters. This is a touching image for good-looking souls.
