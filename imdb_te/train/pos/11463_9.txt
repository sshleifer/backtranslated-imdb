I saw this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and completely blown out. The image structure and execution is amazing ... I know it does not, but it really deserves an Oscar compliance. Call and Andre are both exceptionally disturbed classmates. Yes, the film is very controversial and because it deals with shooting at school, I can see many people with problems and especially with killers. However, despite its tough and bloated subject, Zero Day is worth watching. I'm looking forward to buying it, so I can buy it - this is very good. Very powerful and intense ... end of the shooting process leaves you speechless because you are very realistic. Their uncertainty, "recordings", students footage and panic, are completely indescribable. I really hope it has attracted the attention it deserves. The Blair Witch Project, handheld camera, is the same as the original home video documentary of the full movie in the same format - but God is the best. Very impressive, hats off to everyone involved. If you have a chance, it really should be seen.
