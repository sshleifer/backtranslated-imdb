A few years ago on British television I saw this small series for the first time and was immediately impressed by this story. It surprised me because I was not a great fan of 'Jane Eyre' or 'Worthing Heights'; I thought of myself as self-righteous as the heroine in the past, and thought that it would be the next thing to do. <br /> In the episodes of 'The Wild Fell Hall's Tenor' is also somewhat discouraged, like the ones mentioned above. Nevertheless, the darker parts of the film began with Helen's flight, the excitement of Yorkshire's breathtaking forest and beautiful landscape and the enthusiasm of Toby Stephen's sexual magnetism. <br /> <br /> This film is frustrating all women of forced lifestyle time. They are suffering from minor domestic violence as they are filmed by women's treatment at Mammam House. At the other end, Heston married Hasteste's wealthiest person, and is subjected to brutality and humiliation by chronic recklessness. She runs away and feel a brief moment of freedom, but as a mystery woman living alone in a rural community, she has inevitably become hateful gossip and speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is the longest-looking handsome Helen Markham. The most beautiful with most incredible Chic Bones (despite that terrible vague hair), she is more than capable of playing the lead role in the film. Tara, meanwhile, is respected and avoided when looking to think Helen is still dangerous. Rupert Graves disrespectfully, curiously attractive Arthur Huntingdon - after watching him, I can not imagine another actor who plays the role. Pam Ferris specifically refers to his role as Simon Carter, who played the role of his sister Rozz, and the vicar of vulnerabilities for the Good Things in Life. Finally, I could see the film only for Toby Stephens; He looks very good, tough, sexy, delicate (but not a frustrating sentiment). <br /> <br /> If there is a mistake with this film, I am in favor of the use of the past. The story flow and made it a little confusing. <br /> <br /> Other people who have seen this movie with me have been in trouble. I explained to them that some scenes are actually recurring. For this image. I appreciated the video (rare event), but it led me to buy Anne BrontÃ«'s amazing novel. Obviously, this is better than cinema, but a narrow margin. <br /> I'm interested in anyone. After reading the film, you should read that book. <br /> <br />
