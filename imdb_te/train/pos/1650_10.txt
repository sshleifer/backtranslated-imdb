An amazing series, masterfully starring and directed, but unloved (I said) by Mr Deighton and withdraw him after a performance. It is currently viewed only by the British Film Institute at personal collections and special requests. The neo-liberal portrayal of the tired, non-determined Bernard Sanson's Ian Holm was unfortunate; One of his best performances. Supporting actors, including young Amanda Donoho and Hugh Fraser, are great. Mel Martin described the controversial and wretched wife and the killing of Michael Desan as Werner, a story that was positive with the tragic and unfortunate personal developments of the great game.
