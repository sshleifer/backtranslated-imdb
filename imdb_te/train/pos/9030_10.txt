The film drew me to surprise. My friend told me the film is "chick flick". Boy, he's wrong! This film is a great family appeal, without sex scenes like _other_ movies. Jake Gyllenhaal works in Homer Hickam's boots. <br /> <br /> Science, Upcoming Age, Family Struggles, A Great Train Scene ... This film is for everything. The soundtrack is good, but the score is much choppy. <br /> <br /> This DVD is definitely weight in coal. The replay value is good - I have already seen it many times.
