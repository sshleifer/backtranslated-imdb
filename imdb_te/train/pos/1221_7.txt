For a long time, the film is much better than the Case Bears film. In the last summer, I both looked down and decided that I was wrong. The first good defense is the Bears movie (you may have guessed it if you read my review for it). <br /> <br /> Many are the first, as some people say, it will eliminate any understanding of the first film. I can not think of another sequel that is unequally contradictory (especially with a few characters' sexes and how they met). When I was younger and looking at this, I was very confused and sad. <br /> <br /> The reasons why this film is actually very good (if you refuse from the first movie). It can not think of another movie for little kids with a daemon like villain! Now I'm good at evil campers who want to steal the spirits of the campers and the rescue bears, I'm not a minute suggesting it looks cool where there is absolutely an evil in an image for little kids! It's from Mexico that you like to hear about Santa Claus vs. Satan. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the demon's name is Darnhart and this chick needs help to get the care bears back to him instead of giving him special privileges. Very dark for a kiddy movie eh? And did I mention that Darnhart is very often seen as a whiney VOICED 10 year old boy girl ??? Freaky! Meanwhile some other kids are Bear Care Bears looking defense-a-lot! What happened! The ghost and the baby care bears in the same movie <br /> <br /> Needless to say, everything will be cleared in the end (but we are in a [surprisingly] horrible chandelele's scene before the Darkhart Trap the Care Bears' souls. I'm left to the question, which is a great deal of fictional audience. .
