I saw this film for a few days in a video tape and I liked it even though it was difficult to swallow something (due to its length and stories). I was impressed by the script and the first, by the completeness of this script. The picture takes you in the ride, but it's not an easy, joy ride; It goes through time and different political governments and their impact on the lives of ordinary people. The next film is the next film. Logic, like logic in life, is undesirable and confusing at times, but in the end I think about it, all events and turns are understood. Without spreading over 50 years, it does not try to repeat this story. I very much liked Nikita Mikhalkov's character Alexei and saw some critically unseen breaks. I feel like Aleksei reminds me of films like "I'm Cruel Romance" (Zhestokij Romance, which I really love) and somewhat "insulting and wounded" ("Unizenhni I Oscorbalieni"). I think what was great filmmaker Andrei Konchalovsky before making "less than memorable" films like "Tibgo and Cash" and "Runaway Train" before "Siberia" went to Hollywood. I love them "Kurochka Reba" ...
