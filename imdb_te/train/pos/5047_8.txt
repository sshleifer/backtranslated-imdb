Paxton actor in this film, and to compete in the dark thriller vitantuka mechanic (Paxton himself), his two sons, to take part in armed ax murders, the "slaves", and the "demons" have been elected by God to destroy. <br /> <br /> All of these sons, now raised by Matthew McConaughey, have been raised to the Skeptical FBI Agent (Powers Boothey). It is much better than serial killer features, a twisty and undisturbed story that is a minimalist straight point of the film. Paxton, in the end, will eventually show blood of any kind. Well, most notably two actors ("Spy Kids 2" and "Peter Pan" of the "Domestic Distances" and Matt Wory's Jeremy Soupter). I can only understand that any points can be removed because some people may have difficulty with this stomach. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is a distinct thriller with a good script. <br /> <br />
