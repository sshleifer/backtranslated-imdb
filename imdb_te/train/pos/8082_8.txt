I have seen this LOTR for a long time. I am currently buying for a copy. The work of Baki is very true for the original work. Visuals are rounding and sometimes haunting. <br /> <br /> What are the errors? Occasionally, the image is confusing or cumbersome. The story is one or two times that is slow to a crawl. But, the whole - bought this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
