I enjoyed this movie and after watching it, I was surprised to see how it was in the world of Caitlin Rose. Sexual Abuse and many other girls have been sexually abused and abused by their colleagues and are afraid to open their mouths about it? The teenagers are dangerous and cruel because they show that the film is not right, not important, and fearful of influencing the minds of the youth and fearing to influence this kind of immorality. Tiffany Amber Theesen gives a powerful performance as a victim of rape, and Brian Austin Green He convinces the guy who is crushed between a girl who is deemed to be loved and his close friend. It is a movie that does not reveal it. Memory, and intelligent, is just as good as a movie made for TV.
