When I saw the film, I wanted to give the film a solid 4 or 5, finally with disappointment and distraction. I thought the animation was incidental and everything happened. My A.D.D did not even hold. It's like a little acid trip. Everything is flat, no matter what size. There are many shapes, lines and patterns. If the film saves me, I want to stop the film. But after I finished watching, I went online to read in the film and I had done a little research before looking at the film. <br /> <br /> The real story about Kel's Secret is the original book of Kells. Brendan, a young child, has been mentioned as the greatest book ever written for writing new pages. The book contains information that will help "change the glow of light". Brendon's big stone walls live in the village of Kille. Brendon's uncle in the 8th century, Kels Abbott, is trying to build a wall to place Vikings. Brendan's uncle helps him finish the wall, but the traveler and keeper of the "book" secretly trained Brendan to improve his illustration skills and convinced him to complete the "book" and finish the word. <br /> <i> The whole time I watched the film I thought I did not have something because I did not really understand what it was. I lost part of Irish history. A simple google search, taught me what I learned about the original books. After reading many articles, my opinion of the film has changed very much. <br /> Copy copy of the first few books of the New Testament translated into Latin by Gaelic saints in Ireland in the 8th century. . In addition to the polygraphic and insular script, the book is also beautifully cited in insular art, known for its complexity, complexity and subtle illustrations of a type of early art. The majority of the art in the Kelley book is in art, flat and dimensions are challenged by any perspective. <br /> <br /> The Book of Kel will stand out from other early arts. This is the use of colors too. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kel is very beautiful. I actually thought the animation was flat and boring. It reminds me of the cartoon samurai jack, which also has a flat and "amine" look. I have once learned about the genre of the book of Kells, a mix of the many styles of this book. Brendan's minds include the lines and swirls and different designs. When he goes into his assumption, the circular shapes like the sun, fats, watches and wheels begin to fill the screen. The curtains are made of moving triangles or circles decorated. The transitions are filled with color, and Celtic knots. From trees to floor, many things in this world are shapes or patterns. <br /> <br /> Within 70 minutes minus credits clocking, The Secret of Kells is a fun little story lesson with a little adventure and a silliness that can cause people to be interested (perhaps just children). I usually feel like a quarter-century film about the silver piece, the secrets of Kels' Secret. It seems to have animated with Adobe Illustrator, which is a very beautiful image. But I do not think the value given on Mary and Max is based on 20 films submitted to the Oscar. <br/> <br/> The Wazzank Blob Spot
