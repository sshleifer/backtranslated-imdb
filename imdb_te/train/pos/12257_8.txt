It is the best adaptation of the book than with Paltrow (I also loved one). Beckinsale is not good - they are very good - but the screenplay is much better. Davis is a master of Aston for filming, and the production values ​​are very good. It's not quite as glossy as Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I thought the positions and outfits were actually a good work.
