The thing that tells me about this movie is that the DVD is very expensive. There is a lot more for my budget at this time, or a good example for the film Collier because I'll buy it ... I enjoyed watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes asking price is just a bit too much. It's good for a 80-minute black-and-white, mono-sound film, but nothing extraordinary, cinematography. Here the spy in his possession spills the microfilm after the accidental steal of Peter's purse, as the story (visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket. (Say three times!). Not everyone but Peters reliable character in the film: Widmark, The Cops, U.S. Agents and Communists, and especially Ritter "Mo," an information. She and Widmark are stars in the film. <br /> Peters makes a good job of cheating, but loses his loyalty through the first meeting with "the falling in love" with her. Cinema world only !! It is very bad because it removes the funniest romance from the story. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie noir, but not great, it does not cost $ 25 to $ 25. For that price, the movie is very good in Noir Market.
