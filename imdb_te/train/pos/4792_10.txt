The Straight Story Multi-level search of America's goodness and beauty. At one level walking slowly on the heartland, it's kind of inhabitants, and the amber grain, remembering what is growing and important at the old level (and actively forgetting). David Lynch gave us time in the film and reminds me of a lot of silence. It's a great movie to relax with me for a while.
