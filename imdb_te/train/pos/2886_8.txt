Cinderella is a beautiful picture of beautiful songs of course. In fact, it was one of the best films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I've portrayed all the characters in a wonderful way. You can see the steps of Cinderella and the cruelty of her sweet mother, Cinderella's sweetness. <br /> I think they changed the story a little, but I think it's best. It's a good movie, and I do not think anyone can stop it deep down. <br /> I'll give you 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney film. But it's definitely a real classic.
