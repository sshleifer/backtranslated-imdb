Thankfully as a student I have been able to see "Diagnosis Murder" for many years now. It is primarily about a doctor who handles murders with his LAPD's son, a young physician and pathologist. DM provided 8 exclusive entertainment. What's different from many other police programs is that it has seen its cast and writing quality several times. The lead actors gave good performances and Dick Van Dyke's entertainer roots shone through the use of magic, dance and humor. DM's best features are fast pace, witty script and of course the toe score. It is unfair compared to "Murder, She Wrote". Dim is very high, more complex secrets can be solved and more varied. Now it's gone, the TV is worse. Feelings, family friendly cap shows days gone. Now it's frustrating with 'sandy' ones.
