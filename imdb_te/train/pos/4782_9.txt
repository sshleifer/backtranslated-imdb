Well, it's definitely Lynch directing something else. What a supernatural thing, no violence, no obscenity. However, this is a beautiful picture. It's a bit slower but it's deliberate because it travels an old man's 6-week story (my best estimate of its time). The characters are daily people and therefore, they are believable. The performances are good and the final scene is very touching. It is associated with everyone who has a sibling. Lail and Alvin do not even need to say anything. For a moment they were back in the old days and all the battles were forgotten.
