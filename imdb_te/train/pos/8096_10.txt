First of all, the reason is that people are about to rotate because they can not be "modified" parts of the true story. Well guess what? Peter Jackson's film is not a perfect composition. Well ranting enough. This is a very beautiful picture. The backgrounds are derived from beautiful and well-known Tolkien artists. Half trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers to Hell's Deep War) and moves at great speed. Voice casting is top-notch and see a lot of characters as they can imagine. Samwise is a bit too ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks AWESOME. The film has a great score which fully supports. You have enjoyed good fantasy stories and the hatred that we read (books are also good) has come to us 20 years ago to give the film a try. <br /> <br /> Special note: Jackson repeatedly said of Peter Jackson's simulation fellowship Ralph Bakshi (most of which praised Babick's work).
