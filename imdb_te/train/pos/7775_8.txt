And they are not like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in its room still deserves a better clean, sometimes over-the-top fun. Robert Stoke and Dorothy Malone are their troubled Hadley siblings, and they really took the roles and walked with them. Malone won an Oscar and was nominated in the stock auxiliary departments, with two honors being well-deserved. They can counterbalance that leads to a slight bland. Baacal or Hudson can never be called bad actors, but they both have good parts and are convinced more than they do here. It's hard for me to accept the red-blooded heteroscope in rock hudson when he's here, but it's more of a personal bias than anything else. But the film does not get away from the whole entertainment value, this is substantial and this movie is very watchable. If you do not have some night, I'll see this movie. It is well worth it.
