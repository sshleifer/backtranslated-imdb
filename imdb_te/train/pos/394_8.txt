This is a wonderful return from movie director Susie Hark. This is one of the few films that could be faced with Steven Chau's Shaolin Soccer match. <br /> <br /> Since the opening of the film, <br /> <br /> The controversy with the striking style. If you're science fiction or Chinese martial arts "geek", you love a lot of 3D effects and a huge amount of virtual computer-generated weapons. There, the best performance (as ever) comes from Ekin Cheung featuring "Sky King". He combined with Louise Co (Red), impressed his favorite "wing", which pulled incoming attacks. The action movements of these actors are practiced in every way. Not only is it an amazing action but a somewhat complex storyline. Many critics of the film have complained of lack of story / plot or "walked in random bits and" described as "The Legend of Poo". However, the viewer should not rely on watching the Dragon Ballz and other manga cartoons. Others who have famarialy with "Woo Zia" movies will have an improo appoach. Respectfully. There will be a weakness. That blow that was hit by the enemy at the final fighting scene could make it even more substantial and devastiingly. Despite this, its a must see.
