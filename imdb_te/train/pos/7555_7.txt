Sex Bender sex a bit for x-files. Interesting story, good story, but the end of this episode. The Gender Bender is also the first film of the X-files for the actor Nicholas Lee, known as Alex Chrisake. In this episode he plays a role in Michael's role in "The Kindred". You need to look at this episode in Nick Lee's amazing start. An interesting thing about Kindred's "seduction power". When Marty makes it to her victims, they turn around him / her. Nevertheless, Andrew was not attracted to Scully, as she was simply disoriented and fuzzy, and was not attracted to Andrew. This may be because Marthi has more experience than Andrew. I remind myself why this episode is sometimes bad to portray in British Columbia. The episode is wet, shorter and tall throughout, which is not very fun. Despite disappointing ending, the gender bender is still a good part of the view.
