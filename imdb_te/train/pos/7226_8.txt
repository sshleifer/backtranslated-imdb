The filmmaker in this era is a bit of a bit unique. Obviously, it was originally considered a venue in the world, but it was a very good picture from beginning to end. Peter O'Toole and Susan York are able to make their stage performance silver for the screen and both effectively do it. Anyone who is not very familiar with this type of study of the story is very short and in the way of the story may be put a little through it. All in all, however, is a good picture of Peter O'Toole and Susan Y.'s defeat.
