The honorable feature is Cuba Gudging Jr., his best performance yet. He plays the role of Karl Breisheer, a man of great courage and heroism. He wants to be a poor duck farmer from the South, a Navy diver, but he has problems due to his race. The head of the diving school played by Robert Dinero, a racist Red Neck, despite the honor of the Brassier. The film is consensual with Brasher's almost unmatched imbalances, not once or twice. Exhibitions This image is exclusive. Gouding is great, and Dinio, the best actor in film history, has had his best dramatic performance in many years. Charles also offers another great performance as Theron's very young wife. The film is a little more strengthening patriotism (although it is near PATRIOT) and some characters are just a dimensional bad (Mr. Bobby of Hall Holbrook is just a scary), but the film is rare in today's films. It's amazing and unwanted. A wonderful picture.
