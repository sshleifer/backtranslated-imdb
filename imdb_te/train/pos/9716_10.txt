This film is very fond of you (b) b) To be strongly in love b) To compliment the funnier and witty life conditions and not just the impediments c) Each minute of the film laughs and shouts, and you say "b" and "c" If required, you can identify and enjoy the author's input. D) You love to enjoy movies, love women like kirsted dunst, naturally, sweet and irresistible. <br /> If you meet all these requirements you can rate this movie at 10 points. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And I even managed to cry while laughing for a few moments (I always get smoother, when things happen to Kirsten Dunst)
