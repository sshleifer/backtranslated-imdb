Oliver! The music is my favorite. Music, characters, story. It's all perfect. The director of the musical stage, Carol Reid Broadway, has brought life on screen in the composition of the classic classical novel. <br /> <br /> The change from musical to motion music is not easy. You have to have the correct voices, the right set, the right script and the right game. All the codes for this game are yes. <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in a pleasant old England where a boy named Oliver works to get out of the orphanage. He moved his way to London, where he meets Dodger, Smart Speaker, a group of juvenile offenders headed by the quick hand pick pick jacket. <br /> <br /> The gang leader named Fagin. An old man selling all the stolen goods. <br /> <br /> Bill Sikes by Oliver Reed and his love friend Nancy Oliver, Fagin and his small troops, and act. <br /> <br /> If you're musical or unwilling or not, listen to these voices or you'll be humming them all day. Oliver! Success and timeless art on the stage and achievements.
