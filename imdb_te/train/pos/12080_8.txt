Julia Rose (Nina Focch) agrees to take over as the Secretary of the Rich Hughes family, to get her boyfriend left. Immediately she is transported and transported to the family's estate in Cornwall. When she wakes up they continue to tell her Merian hugs, mentally ill and she is locked up ... but why? <br /> <br /> This is one of the best B films ever to be included, along with "Narrow Margin" and "Face Behind the Mask". (B images have been made with low budgets and larger budget images). It should only be (65 minutes), it's very direct, fast and exciting. <br /> <br /> Fach (a good actress) is basically correct, but Dame may have been very cool and George Mengred is a wonderful (and frightening) villain. Well worth the catching. The best example of how to do a great image in a small budget.
