What a wonderfully funny and original presentation. Casting with hysterical Julie Brown (Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun) is just perfect. Add a lesbian who has always argued with her partner and business partner (Asian restaurant-voc-don "T RUN) Amy Hill (All American Girl-Grand Kim) (a New York-like one including my all-time favorite shows) If you like movies such as Airplane- one of the best moments of the show you will love this series is Cindy Williams playing herself to her dry clean Tommy finds Cindy Williams's film in her quotation.Study Williams makes a vigilant work with a bowling pin-up side.It's great to be able to play herself as Sandy Williams.I was just wondering if this opera had many surprise twists during its short run One day special bonus can be released on DVD with special features Hosted by the comedy series ever seen!
