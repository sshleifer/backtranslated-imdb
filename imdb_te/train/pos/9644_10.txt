I'm going to give it straight away ... this movie is amazing. Alien homosexuals have overtaken American productivity in product quality and story. Most American indie gay films have been impressed by France from high-quality foreign gay movies such as wheat, bad sound, amateur acting, common story stories, and no nudity or romantic lack of surprises. Cinematography is beautiful, thought, understood. The story is adult and complicated (but not hard for anyone), acting is serious and professional. The two leads are excellent, as well as the whole cast. The boys are more than just good looking and there's plenty of full frontal nudity. You follow the entire year of their boys and their conclusion to the conclusion. All the little nuances of a relationship, fall in love, and the details in the light are beautifully displayed. It wanted me more. Check it out!
