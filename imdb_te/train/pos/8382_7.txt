It's great if you like McMahon Sports. Some of these are cheap but robot fights are worth watching. I enjoyed the McMahon field for some time and this film I have never seen about being a pilot of these huge machines is pretty good. If you want to be a generator then you have three and four in the mech warrior and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 steel battalion. At least once seen image. There really needs to be some movies on the same theme. Less reconstructions and more original works. <br /> Enjoy
