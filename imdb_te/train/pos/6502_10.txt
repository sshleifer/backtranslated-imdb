Although it was too short to remember the first performance of the series (just a baby), I saw its recurrence in television in the late 80s, and I was interested in the war and its all aspects. It was my grandfather and my first interests, who first presented my series, and the stories of his time in the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then I've devoured many books and have seen many television series mixed in terms of the rest of the war. British television stations will produce them, with the many gems made by both the BBC and the independent companies, the World at War easy to confirm. I strongly recommend "Nazis - a warning from history", "blitz" and the BBC series about Dunkirk. "Britain at War in Color", with its competing series "Japan", "Germany" and "America". The world at war is the best, and despite its age, it always fails. There is always a new disclosure to keep order, and it will be placed in both World War II, which is done on a large canvas, even if it is possible for a long time and money to produce a single line with every detail. The war in the world can not be physically tuned, but you can say hecks you to do more research - and do not have everything that makes it enjoyable. It definitely worked for me: I now have a comprehensive library of books, videos, DVDs and tapes and CDs. Recommend to anyone with passing interest. It is not difficult to accept that this array is of great quality and programming.
