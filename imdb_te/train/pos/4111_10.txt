At first I saw this teenage teen first, and when the children began to think through their identity. I felt a lot of pain in the sight of a man and his children. The eldest is his mother as a prostitute and his siblings have the same parent (Kurosawa, who has no children with nothing). The man still persuades his father through the unique definition of being his father. <br /> <p> <p> <p> It is a great movie, even if it is not a great Kurosawa movie.
