"Citizen X" nicknamed the "The Butcher of Rostov" story for a brutal and rational Russian serial killer who saved 52 lives from 1978-92. The film focuses on the novel Detective (Ray), which has a hard-fought killer against all kinds of inequalities in self-serving and comfortable denials in dealing with a non-cooperative power. T.v. Produces an HBO product for the film, offers a solid cast, good performances, spectacular spots to the spectacular details, but plays similar to the similar Hollywood fare stylist similar to docoodrama sans. An interesting and simpler dramatization of the story that is more interesting and less relatively less familiar than "Jack the Ripper". (B)
