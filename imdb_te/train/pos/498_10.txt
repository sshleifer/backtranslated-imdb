I was awaiting when this Star Trek displays DS9. Not quite DS9. This is a fantastic display of their own right, although it did not really give fans what they wanted. The company is the show. While the original trek is similar to that, it is the original in its own ways. It makes for us exciting exploration ideas. And one of the basic ingredients that loved the original. Relationships between the band members are another aspect of success. Viewers really paid attention to the staff. Enterprise has promised a lot in this area. Chemistry between Bakula and Blalock sounds pretty good. When sexual tension in a program is often a swearing-up, I feel that the tensions in the organization are going to be very high and tell them to be more typical. I also think when dealing with such races with different races or races, we get some interesting ideas and televisions. Also, we must note the performances, Blococ is very convinced Valkon T'pol and Bakula really have a madness and power of the character that provides a great performance. The rest of the cast also provided good performances. My only gripes are as follows. Theme. It's okay different, but it's a little glittering to my taste. We need a little more grand. The orchestra should not be. It's probably more than a little more electronic sound. And my other complaint. They sell too many ads. They can fix it by selling low ads or show all the two parts. Otherwise we'll end up seeing the last act shows that Voyager one of my complaints is getting wrapped up way too quickly.
