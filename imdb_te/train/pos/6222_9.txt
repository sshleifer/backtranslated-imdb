This is really a great movie. Some of the songs become the eternal classic and dancing through Fred and Ginger is among their finest. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's films are the same. After singing and dancing, the other characters acting in the film. Why are all negative comments about Randolph Scott really afraid? Her love with Harriet Hilard and his film's sub plot, I'll see again and again. He adds to the film and he does not remove it. He has the personality and great smile to win. Randy is in the top ten list of all my favorites. It's great looking at one other than a cowboy. OK, so he is not really a great actor, but many other actors: Errol Flynn, Alan Lodd, Victor Mathew, and so forth. He was very fond of and raised up in some cases. All films of Fred and Ginger have a subdirectory based on other actors to fill the space between music numbers, otherwise the film is reduced by half an hour. I would like to congratulate more people and I thought I needed to stand for him.
