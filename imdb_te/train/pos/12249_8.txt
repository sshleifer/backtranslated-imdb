Old Jane's mannered story is very popular these days. I've lost the number of revisions around. Perhaps the reason for her "raots" is our "rats" on this last date. This TV gives the person who tells the story of the Mini-Series novel. When you think about it, Emma is a beautiful "modern" girl, which can make us feel today artificial to Jane Austen's world. If you do not feel EMMA, I will only say that I will get her self-Emma Emma. It is worth looking to learn. Here acting honors go to the ladies: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. They have a mental relationship with old Jane!
