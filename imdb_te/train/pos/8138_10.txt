The CB4 is awful, but it may have given Cundieff a good idea for it. Spintal tapes are more than anything, since the beginning of the film is clever. Anyone surprised by seeing back in the mid nineties. The shows are played to laugh, but they are very cartoon characters, like Marx Brothers. These guys are real and are slightly different. They respond to such situations in any of us. Well, when we are late to our show hoods gig, or pull guns and beat the record company executive, but you may not throw a tantrum to get the picture. If n (n ***) with H (h) hats you take seriously enough, then you're hooked. Even if you do not really come into rap music, you can rent or get all the costs, which still you will be out loud. Comparing to CB4 George Lucas is like comparing Star Wars to Gill Gerard's 'Book Rogers'.
