When I first came to theaters, I showed a lot of interest to see this film, but I can not go around it. So, finally, it hit the shelves, and I picked it up. I did not know exactly, I plopped the dvd player in the player, settled for the evening in the murder, when the play was pressed. <br /> <br /> * This is the story of Wonderland murders, <br /> <br /> I have been hooked from the beginning and kept the feel of the film all the way to me. To a very bloody end. I was amazed by the fact that before this incident and the actual murders and much more on the previous events. Unlike some blood splattered walls in the beginning, the film was heavily dubbed with the great dialogue and great acting, with the film showing the killings in the end. <br /> <br /> I have personally viewed the best part of the film as I mentioned, but it is a pleasure to watch Bosworth (and just for her, mind you) The killings could not be clearly shown. It was shown in a very dark environment, so you did not see that the brutal bludgeoning Apollo had provided the fossome to sleep. Moreover, the cardiovascular effects were more than enough to cut my appetite. <br /> They do not need to say, they are beaten with major pipes. <br /> <br /> My real problem is Kerry Fisher's brief appeal. I have played a role in the over-religious-religious man, and I will slightly cliche her role. <br /> <br /> That guy was not really a part of this story, but I was not sold and for some reason, Fisher seemed a bit "quite a bit" in her role. <br /> <br /> In total, the spectacular image watch value, even once! <br /> *** 8/10 ***
