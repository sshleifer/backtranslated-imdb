The film was a classic in the 80s slasher style of cheese, which is all my favorite style, which I had to watch when I was looking for free! Dr. Fibbs movies (her deceased wife), Dracula AD 1972, The Golden Voyage of Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me, Maniac, and Faceless. /> <br /> Til Christmas brings you from the people behind and does not open, it's my thoughts ... <br /> It opens the April Fool's Day, where children bunch is the most popular in school - in the shower, assuring him sex, Publicly insulting and giving a face in the toilet (when he's naked!). The coach puts it a stop, but both parties swear allegiance. <br /> Cut the future, and think its high school reunion, or they (bwahahha?). Even though the invitation was that the boy who had just shot the kid, and its April Fool's Day (or actually, the April Fool's day, but the fun starts at midnight), they failed to see the coincidence and school until night school. <br /> They eventually enter the school and start a storm. <br /> They are food / drink and a small shrine for each of them, their lockers and assets, martyrs' locker and yearbook. They also find an old black janitor / caretaker who spends his time, "Oh Euser! Yesser! I do not bother, sir!" Then he is instantly killed. <br /> <br /> The film is going out of the book of foreigners and you have to watch. When everyone learns that they will die, they decide that, except Shirley, they will be better to bathe in the old school rain. However, it drops blood and acid, and her face melt (very nice, your mind) kills everybody else, sex, drugs and martyrs every night. "All we have to do is wait for the afternoon and die in the afternoon!" Seriously, he said what. You can clearly kill only at night. But will they survive the night? Who will live and who will die? And all the bodies are wiped out? Rent, buy, or find this great image to find! The movie is very good, the clicks (the car's debut, Damemit!) And the plain slasser is fun. Not all of them have names like Carol and Nanny and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend you all! And, not to mention, it's a spin-off! The Cutting Class of 1989 was a spin-off from the slazer gem, and the film was started by Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: There are 2 people who have sex. "Talk to me dirty, frank !!" She screams "Uh ... TITS!" "Dirtier!" "Uh ... tets f * cickets teeties booches f * ck.". Work for her and at her climax, the killer power them both of them!
