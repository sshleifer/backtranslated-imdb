I saw this movie from Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin), a night ago at www.afrovideo.org I saw this movie and I did not see anything in the race (I'm not stupid), I accepted the character designs bit bit raw and unaccableable today, but I think that a novel and old American Uncle Remas stories are very, very urban writing Black American culture, right for main characters Stop by and "The Tar Baby" and "The Briar Patch." This is not the big stories, mind you, but blocked by the Americans, cultural icons, and the stories I read, and I love being a white woman. <br /> <br /> The film is a live-action / animated film, Samson (Barry White) and Precherman (Charles Gordon), along with their friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas), from prison for the film's magician-sandy To help escape, but close down a shootout with roadblock police. While waiting for them, Randy is unwilling to listen to his mate Pappy (Scottman Crotchers), who began to tell Randy in an animated story of Brother Rabbit. You know, the animal versions of the Rabbit, Bear and Fox Randy, Sampson and Precherman. The abstract scene of stylized animation and live action footage, a graphic and intricate satire of prevalent generalizations in the 70s? <br /> <br /> It is another good bird film; And should we sweep movies like this under the rug? Do they pretend that they are? Hmmm ... I think it's an insult; I mentioned these pictures and I'll learn about how far we've come from.
