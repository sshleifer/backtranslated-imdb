It's a beautiful picture of all the players that make it look great. It makes you laugh and you cry. The end of this movie is closed every time. If you want to see a great image, this is it. Jimmy Stewart is an amazingly witty performance and a fan of Mr. Mutchessin to Mr. Morgan. The character Morgan variation is nothing short of amazing. William Plei is a wonderful comic relief and some important films and shows. Felix Bressorott Perovitch, a stumbling bumbling shop worker who has the ambition of life, offers a magnificent performance that is to please him as he works. It's a simple story of how the closest colleagues will be made and the simplicity of two people with great enmity on each other's fall in love with no exception.
