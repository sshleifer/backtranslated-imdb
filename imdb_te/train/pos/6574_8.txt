This can be very difficult for some to use for Hollywood production styles. The directing is uninspired, apparently just filming the set set, and the audio quality is bad here and there (rastling of people's clothing occasionally voices their voices, etc.). <br /> <br /> Friends and I started looking into what I was expecting, and the first scene was almost the same. It was very stable and seemed cheesy. <br /> <br /> We have taken over the voice of the content and have really started to enjoy ourselves. <br /> <br /> Even though it's some kind of fun, it's a lot of fun. Give it a chance if you congratulate the great dialog. Also, Helena Bonham Carter is adorable, of course.
