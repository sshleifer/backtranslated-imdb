If you're a T-Rex / Mark Bolan fan, I'd recommend checking it out. It shows a strange piece of Marc Bolan and Ringo Starr, which has a pretty good time to paint some of the scenes not part of the concert, but it is fun to see, knowing that people just know, and when a talented musician shows the concert, both fun and professional Those stones and Isaradam seems to impress the girls. While watching him in concert, there is a rock star job, but you never know that playing some great songs with some good songs like Elton John and Ringo Starr. True, there are a few songs that I would like to appear there, but it does not have anything like what album. I bought it in 2006, but if I knew it came in 1972, I would definitely buy it years ago. A man with a lot of songs about his love for cars, is always a tragic and strange that a car crashes and dies!
