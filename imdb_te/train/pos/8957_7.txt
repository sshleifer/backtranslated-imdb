The 1958 film did not appear for a long time and played the role of Kim Novak in the role of the original witch, a witch named Queenie Horody, and Gillian also Nick Jack Lemmon. When Gillian puts her eyes on Ship Henderson (James Stewart), she is engaged to a girl who is going to marry; Gillian exhibits some magic spells with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then completes the lust and gillian love. The story tells a true witch to fall in love, blush or crying, and begins to prove a big problem between Shep and Gillians, so Nick and Aunt Queen decided to do something about this situation. The great film is a great classic film to see again and again from 1958.
