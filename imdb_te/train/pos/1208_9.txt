Each child is in the film when he can not do anything on VHS, or if he has a cottage around him. <br /> I can say the whole plot correctly, I have seen at least 100 times and say it is a good kid / family film. <br /> <br /> I still have a tape, I have not seen it in 5 years, but I'll be here this week, and I'll be a little child day by day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you have a baby, <br /> <br />
