Exciting developments in the fantastic scenes with amazing spirits, inactivity and Serbian mentality. The film is a great comedy, enjoyable, interesting and unpredictable. The best point in a movie: the characters, the next comedy, story and dialogue. Humor is 'internal development', in rare Serbian films. So, it is the evolution of the attribute, well inspired, sudden and cogent. It is sharp, intelligent and clear. Most movies, unfortunately, are made of humor (a joke look and put in the mouth of a character) or the general situation comedy, pyramid, and farce. Some of the 'art immortals' included in the film. Little work, rarely reach.
