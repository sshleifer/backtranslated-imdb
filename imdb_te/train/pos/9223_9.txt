Many of the Ashanti's 70s movie (1979, accurate). It reminded me of the wild geese (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore in a program in Africa). <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caine) is married to a doctor in Africa and trained pineapple (Beverly Johnson), a beautiful unrest. He is also a physician in medicine in America. While they were doctoring, one day she was kidnapped by slavors working for Arabic slave merchants (known by Peter Ustinov, all the public) called Sulaiman. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is a brilliant actor, and actually plays a role in deciding to do most to get back his wife, but hopeless with a gun and action stuff. He first helped through an Englishman campaign against slave commerce, no one could recognize (Rex Harrison), shortly after the helicopter pilot (William Holden), and later Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik Sulaiman (he has a very serious, very attractive role) has a score to settle down and finds him and goes with David to regain Prana - David on his camel <br /> <br /> Then there is so much adventure. There is morality-question question too. The story's progress is slightly predictable from this point, and some libraries have taken with the plot to move things along quickly, but it is pretty pardonable. Does this question go to Anna Annasas before Peter Ustinov sells her to Omar Sharif? (Yes, Omar Sharif is in the course)?
