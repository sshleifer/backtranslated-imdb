I teach Japanese for an online high school and students can learn about language as well as language so I have cultural activities. And "gong ho" is one of the requirements. Students can buy or rent a movie. This helps to discover that stratotypes or not, other people see the world and their lives differently than us. Many students told me that they enjoyed the film, they are going to have a copy. It is interesting to see if we are valuable in this culture and what is valuable in their culture. I thought I could get a clean-up TV version. I'm not really into the raw language that card workers use all the time.
