The story of obsessive love is so much ticket to his limitations and his premature death as his beauty of a lovely Swan. Talkies were initially placed, PRIX DE BEAUTE walked a narrow line of being a complete silent film - still at heart - and flirting with sound and sound effects. Anyone coming into this audio has a slight irritability, the recorded audio is very thin and does not help at all. In the opening scene that begins on a beach as part of a movie starring the Louis Brooks dialogue, the edited sound platform is heard by the audience and moves the good audience. Except for it, the film is the most common in the film - with little fluctuations here and there, the film is more or less, and vaguely distinct. In a way, an experiment of the film, and in the visual appearance of Sergei Eisenstein's style and in close close closets, it has gone to more pedestrian levels. Louis Brooks plays less than she knows here: she is a jeweler, decides to take part in a beauty contest in a lark despite the angry opposition of her boyfriend. Her character is thirty years old and contemporary; Flapper / Jazz Baby characters are shown on the last screen, with the beginning of women's independence, skilled women represent women. Brooks's character decides to leave her boyfriend (if she later "coordinates" with him) and she takes a little forward to her time. However, there is no belief about the faulty flaw of her character - her boyfriend wants her to be successful - the film leads to the end of the theater. The final sequence appears in Hitchcock's superior suspense (seen by many men) and cuts from Brooks, her portrayal of the screen, and the murderer boyfriend. A chilling effect on the chailing, powerful image of the placement of a "breeaks" Brooks still dead with more consciousness.
