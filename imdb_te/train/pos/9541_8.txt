Wow baby, this is actually some good Asian horror / gore, and a silly extravagant movie. This Japanese method, which reminds me of the smallest of Tetsuo, except for all the blood and the guts except the case, is a strange love story. They can even hardly imagine how this visually dazzling picture would be expected, turning them into part machine, with some special foreign creatures that can damage humans like parasites or I guess the cyborgs. These creatures only make a mistake after they have taken possession of a human being, they will kill each other and eat another. Hmmm, Yum Yum. It is probably called entertainer or called something like that, to add all the fun to the wonderful soundtrack. The film creates a slight loss from the carpenter's "The Thing" in the design and effects of the creature. I must have a must-category for Gorhounds because there is a non-stop carnage and some very good lamb. And you should be for the storeers because you do not need to read subtitles, just one visual imagery is not enough for a mind trip. The design of small creatures living in the human body, like the fetus, reminded me a few of Frank Helenlother's films, another tribute to some amazing gore films with the sense of humor. "Metbell Machine" is great fun for Gorhounds, no doubt about it, and I liked it.
