I first saw these pictures and I have watched the year I have a chance. It's in my list of favorite movies along with some of the classic. No one is saying it is silly or old, ignore them ... This film is for anyone who laughs and enjoyes the music. Acting in other film aesthetic films is not important, it is shining through comedy and acting. If you can watch this movie, it may be light, but it's totally fun. So I know many people hate the black and white pictures, I think they are not really funny, and the film changes their minds. I can not see this film at least by anyone. The only problem in the film is: Fred Astier singing without dance. He may be a great performer and a talented singer but it is not fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. Comedy times gets a bit cliche but the G Barnes and G Allen's vaudevillesque performances can be satisfied to anyone looking just perfect and some easy laugh for a piece. Even if you do not like the old movies, give the film a chance for you to hear any movie that's ridiculous.
