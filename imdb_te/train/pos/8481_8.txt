It is very difficult to rate this movie. As the entertainment value for the 21st century audiences, it has failed miserably. Nevertheless, the history and history of the earliest vocals is an ornament. "Shows Shows" was featured in a review to compete with MGM's hit "1929 Hollywood Review", which still remains intact with its technicolor scenes. <br /> <br /> The intent of the all-star resume is the silent actors of a particular studio in which characters speak, and they have shown that they can be mutated. Nevertheless, Warner Bros seems to have been forgotten and they have many laws and stars in a long-term deal like Ben Turfin, Lloyd Hamilton, Beatrice Lily and a parade band. Meanwhile, their biggest talent - Al Jalson - is not noticeable. He could not pressure him to join the higher wage. Almost every action is overly lengthy and the movie plays like a dozen or similar sequels of Wiattone frameworks. The highlights of the film are the number of pairs with Nick Lucas and Myna Lai with "Pingo Pango" and "Singing in Bathtub", Nick Lucas, John Barrymore, Shakespeare, and Chinese Fantasy "Li Po Li" . This last number is the only part of the remaining image in the Telekalcor, which is really very attractive. Players in these good works have long been Warner Bros. Stars, so that the director knows how to play with their strength. <br /> <br /> This film is an odd point in a snapshot movie history - year 1929, bridge year between two ages - quiet and acoustic ages, and the roaring of 20 and the Great Depression. Two years after Warner Bros. gave Warner Brosers its distinctive urban look, its quiet era stars and star cast to produce stars, the film was completely different. And feel - James Cognie, Jon Blondel, Edward G. Robinson and others.
