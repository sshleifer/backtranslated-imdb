It was dark because I thought this baby was the first care bear film. I always sit and see the first one. As I am older, I learned to like it. I feel that this film is very dark for infants, but when you read that you understand it, you read it and when you read it, you're not dark again when you're a child. <Br /> <br /> This film, in my opinion, is much better than the first one, everything is very deep. It may be contradictory to the first image but you must ignore the first image to see this. Children are very adorable, I've rewired the 'Flying My Colors' scene. I'm singing everybody by singing. <br /> Soundtrack is good! A big hand for Carol and Dean Parks. I loved every song in this movie, I downloaded them and I heard all of them, and I am listening to our start, also called 'reckling'. <br /> <br /> Although I love Carol's songs in the first film 'Care-a-Lott', I have chosen this soundtrack for the first time. <br /> <br /> The animation is great, the two films are fantastic. I sat down and saw it after 10 years and I saw the animation amazing at the time. It's very surprising. <br /> <br /> You do not have to return from other people to say this movie is very good, but it is. I do not think it's a disgust / strange. <br /> In general, the film is about how the care bears come and defeat Demon and Dark Heart. It's finally surprising and again, the Care Bears beat any 'Pokemon movie' with ethical issues. This will affect you. Again the film teaches all ages about morality.
