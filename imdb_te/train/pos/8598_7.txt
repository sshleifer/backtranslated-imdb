At first glance, this movie appears on the Keyer Sutherland series 24 for the big screen. <br /> <br /> President of the United States, one of the racial and secret service agents against time concentrated on a plot intended to kill the agency under the spotlight in The Sentinel. <br /> <br /> Stay tuned, rather than Pete Garrison, a prominent Secret Service Agent, Michael Douglas, known for taking bullet for Reagan in 1981. Will the mind put themselves in the line of a bullet and one goal? But Garris is trapped in the story of murders, while at the same time researching his bits on the plot should run for his life. This was due to his failure in the polyandry test due to his or her porn-banging of the First Lady (Kim Basinger). <br /> <br /> There are shades in Clint Eastwood's The Line of Fire. Two elderly actors, and aging veterans, are the leaders of a historical reference, taking a bullet in their duties. Although Eastwood's film was more troubled villain in John Malkovich, Sentinel suffered a lack of a villain villain, preferring to share the murders in former KGB villains and mole in the Presidency Defiency. With Douglas running from law, he is similar to Dr. Richard Kimble of The Fugitive, while hunting the man with an armed man, very interesting to his fellow agents. <br /> <br /> And today's top TV from Desperate Housewives Stars, Kefar Sutherland and Eva Longoria, are dashed into supporting roles. As a secret service investigator able to take part in Garrison's murder program, Sometimes they leapt CSI's pages with their forensics skills. The cute couple have chemistry similar to the X-Files' Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, but alas these two are very few here. We know why they are in the movie, and to bring their fans into theaters. Moreover, the character of Longoria was unable to move her sexy mama Gabrielle, and here she is in very low cut jackets (Sutherland actually tells her to cover her) and tight pants (owl-fest for fellow agents). <br /> However, the most expensive and robust security details of the world are still pretty, and the daily threats are the most powerful person in the world on the threat of every nutches in life. It's a good suspense and experimental thriller, entertaining enough for you. But one thing, though, is that much like the action sequences, you have a big enough loophole to turn a jumbo jet.
