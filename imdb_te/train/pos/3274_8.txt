One of the three 80 movies in this case is unfortunately not overlooked and unfortunately still ignored. One of the others is Clownhouse, directed by Victor Salvador, that Salva is scary due to legal / sexual problems. The other is the Cameron clockwork, which is somewhat underestimated - not great, but the reviews I've seen are not nearly as bad. The paper house is well worth your time and I think that is one of those very quiet films that will stick in your brain for longer than you might think. I mean, after 10 years I've seen and I'm still giving some rest, but I've seen it 6 months ago something went into ether.
