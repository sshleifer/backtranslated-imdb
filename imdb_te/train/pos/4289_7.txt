I want to have 100% honesty with IWW users. I wanted to see this film for a long time due to poster. Charlotte Gainsborg looks so sexy and lovely smiling? I'm in love with that woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. The film must deliver the expectations of all kinds of romantic comedies or intellectual humor and light dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the IMDb user who says that the film is over-rated; <br /> <br /> My main problem with this movie is the absence of screen chemistry between the main characters. <br /> <br /> "A romance" or a clue sharing is not the same sequence before the climax to indicate that the main characters are interested in one another. Just a moment with the scenery two moments a wonderful awkward (when in two bed) and the audience does not understand about the interest in a lovable love. <br /> <br /> The film still offers very funny moments and there are strong dialogues that support such a duplicate campus. <br /> <br /> I understand this is very difficult for a 43-year-old man today. <br /> <br /> I understand the film, so I accepted the funny situation. Plus, humor is versatile. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gaynesborg's performance is the best line and she has funny lines with Shabat's best friend, some lesbian suggestions, family women and funny situations for her many reasons to watch. Image. <br /> She's funny, sexy, very thin and looks good, and she's a bright and talented actress. Good performance. <br /> <br /> Scoring, art direction, and other technical aspects are good and provide a dynamic look for the film. <br /> <br /> This kind of film should be enjoyed after the happy ending. It's a good example to feel good movie.
