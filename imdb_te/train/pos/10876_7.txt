I was really excited about seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> I thought he had done a good film in Australia. But I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> Never before has this been a remake of the film. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald Sorry for coming to Australia all the way to make an awful movie. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about this film, I thought this title was good (because the chemistry in Scream 2 " <br /> <br /> "The worst thing about this movie is that it's just fine." Who is the killer .. looking forward to a big surprise, but also tailor-killer is not a human being .. It is a terrible horror film changed the original slasher movie. <br /> <br /> Do not look for this film. You are depressed!
