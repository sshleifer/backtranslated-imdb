Henry Fool is a good movie. But this is the right way to follow the film like 'Henry Fool'. Henry was taken very seriously, his 'lies' and his mystical brilliance. The opening shot of Henry Fool is also clearly visible by 'Fay Grim' when Simon is reading his ear while walking on Henry Hill. Over-the-top jokes are more or less meta-jokes (about film and jokes themselves), but the film is somewhat saturated. Moreover, the use of Hartley's use of Dutch angles throughout the film is yes, but it is intentional, and it seems to be forced and overwhelmed, which I'm worried about, and I call it jarring. It's a flawed movie, but no heart or Henry Fool fan should look for. <br /> <br /> Listen to stupid reviews, do not watch it unless you see the first film. If you do not see Henry Fool, the film's intrigue, sarcasm and intellect are completely lost. It's a sequel. It's just dumb.
