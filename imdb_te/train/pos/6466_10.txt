I really loved this movie and made the audience that I saw it in Los Angeles. After this film, many people have been crying and telling how the film is affected. I see why there's such a huge hit in Sweden at home. The film will be masterfully directed and eventually you really know these people and not care about them so that each character is drawn brighter. Music is very natural and the main song in the film is very heart-moving but inspires. I would recommend this film to everyone - usually people who do not go to the subtitled films. Undoubtedly is eligible for Oscar nomination because of the great themes of the film that reflected the image of everyday people in a small-town society. This split is a picture that connects us to the world and shows us the power of the human soul. Must see!
