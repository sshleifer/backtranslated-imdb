This kind of documentaries often have many opinions. The film will take all the opinions and decide what to do with the information provided to the director. Conditions for these poor people to work are tragic, making the film a great way to show the ugly side of sweatshops. <br /> <br /> Mardi Gras: China Made In Made In The World is how small the beads for a celebration can affect many people's lives in another country. <br /> <br /> The English class image, we spent our time talking about sweatshops and how some people were trying to remove them and this film helped rolling the item. It's a great, very informative movie and I recommend that anyone watch it, it opens your eyes.
