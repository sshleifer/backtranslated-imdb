Wow. I saw this last night and I am still recovering from how good it is. The widower of the middle age starts shagging his daughter's shameless boyfriend - a very real feeling of every character (very short of them, a ** holes) and bizarre tale - felt completely convinced. <br /> <br /> And director Roger Mitchell, Anne Reed and Daniel Craig in our friends (such as David Thewlis) are from Notting Hill to this day. <br /> Watch this movie!
