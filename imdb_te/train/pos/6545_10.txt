I really enjoyed this movie. Most reviews are bad, but most critics feel that the film is a play drama. This film is a little bit of play, but the rest is just fun fun and very entertaining. Forget about Julia Roberts, Pretty Woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful young woman and she is more than that. Emma is very happy to see Nancy Drew's role. The new face is good looking. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew may not be based on these books, but the story is still cool. Other character actors and a good compilation of supporting actors such as Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Lee Cook and Chris Kutton. I was amazed Disney did not release this film. Some people may not like this film because it does not have sex, violence and vow. This is a rare family film that is rare nowadays. So take your family and see how good this film and judging is for your self. I can not wait for the sequel.
