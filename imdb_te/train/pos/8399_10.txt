Love Trap is not a small one, it's a full-length movie with 105 minutes. <br /> When I'm writing this, I can talk a bit more about Love Trap. I asked myself that I'm different from Love Trap ... I have responded to this question: 1) It introduces the characters - specifically - never seen before, before the movie. <br /> <br /> It reveals more truth about love and reveals more deeply in the feeling of love, with my humble opinion, than the other US films so far made <br /> <br /> 3) Structurally, <br /> It offers far more timely ideas on the various cultural aspects of the Black Community and beyond. <br /> Over time, people will see Love Trap as a completely refreshing, authentic and sincere and completely realistic work in this era. <br /> Please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate information about this image.
