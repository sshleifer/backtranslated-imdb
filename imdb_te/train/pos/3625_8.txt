This is the best film on baseball ever since Redford The Natural broke our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths have a great story and the screen with a cast that seemed real enough to pull you in their lives. <br /> <br /> 'Australian natal actress, Rachel Griffiths, I know it A native West Texan is better than most of Texas; And Dennis Quaid perfect? Wanbeau, Gunnabba and humorous winner, as the average viewer in the audience, was very mental. This is true. Works on-screen chemistry If you like Baseball Heart Warmers, love this movie. There are essential ingredients for American and Apple Pie. My popcorn became a 'la mode'. <br /> Hey: Buy CD! Music rocks and story is awesome! <br /> Criticisms: I thought I had given Basile Ball another one. But Quaid has taught us all about the role of the character and the heart. Saint Rita and nuns are a nice decoration, but they really can not open around and find them in the closed story around them. A small length. The value for each minute in the last analysis. <br /> <br /> <br /> "
