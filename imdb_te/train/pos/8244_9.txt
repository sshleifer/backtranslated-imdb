Loved it! What do you have? - You've got your suburbs, your family got you, your family's problems, you faced your social confusion and you're on a fine retro-50's next meal. You are not asking more. <br /> <br /> Broadcast is awesome. Carrie on Mose is a perfect social ascent housewife. She has two wishes, and a criminal conspiracy. Every fellow dream. K'sun This is a nightmare trying to as simple as possible in the nightmare, and is really great as something is unsuccessful. He's the real screen presence. Very photogenic and natural. Without naming all of them, the rest of the cast is amazing. Henry Jerzy, like his own personality, is suspicious of suspicious policemen and minor variations. Bilado is like the Konna Fido. Best Actor: Gibson directed the title role in "Braveheart". My feeling is that his William Wallace is close to the real character. His fido is still available. <br /> <br /> The great and spectacular satire of small, morality, values, social fantasies, feelings, rises, uncertain times, and compensation adjustments for impossible situations. The real reality show.
