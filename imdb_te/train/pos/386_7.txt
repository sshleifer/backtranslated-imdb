The visual art of Suzuki Hark has its peak in the film. Unfortunately, Ecken Cheng and especially Sicily Cheung (I screamed when I was watching), it was very bad :) I looked at it anytime. This movie is a real progressive visual section. When I first saw it, my jaw dropped steady and I thought I was never seen, but how can this be done to complete the legendary world of historical Kung-fu novels? ! <br /> <br /> But alas, Sushi Hark has not improved much in the writing section and does not help either childhood (the crazy and overly lengthy description of the bad guys is not his obvious invasion). This slows down even further, the film is a very bad cast. They decided to use "hot" popular Hong Kong idols as the main characters, but unfortunately for both historical Kung-fu epics, both Ekin Cheng and, especially Cecilia Cheung, are not entirely classified, because such characters are not the top circles and the mystery. <br /> <br /> In the 1987 version Adam Cheng Chu-chow and Brigitte Lin were endless. <br /> I am with Zhang Yi-Mau and Tsui Hark troops, with Zhang's maturity and story-telling poetry ...
