This film is a rare treasure. The Shirley Temple's career is just the beginning, but the rare sight of how our society has changed. You need to understand, some of the things that are related to us today are considered sexual, then thought to be innocent. For example, parents of children in the movie, as well as many parents who have taken their children to watch this movie have seen it only as adult children. Most people do not think of looking sexually attractive children, there are more than younger adolescents than young girls. For them it is not sexual. It's in the front of the Internet, TV, and so on ... Many sex crimes are not publicly brought. Occasionally the boy is whisper about "funny uncle." But it often came. Yes, very sad. But today is very sad, because I can also see this movie as innocent and funny as it is meant to be. When I saw Shirley dance and I met the boy, yes I was shattered. I will remind myself that this time has happened! Those kids do not know what sex is. Parents know, both are in the movie and who are looking for it. The idea may not have entered their minds too. In the later adult view, there was no sexual anguish when playing at Shirley's house. Today's children also enter the beauty contest, many worn for the three young men. Even though the child is just acting. I do not blame a child who wants to act like an adult. Or older movies that it displays. In all honesty, our media has done so many things, ill and wrong. This is sometimes better. But I really believe this movie is not one of them. It gives a rare form of innocent mentality.
