I do not waste your time, this film will wash on ice. ' It still does that reviewer, which may have some sort of innocent charm. If you like other 'whistle' series films, this is a must watch. <br /> If you have any role in the previous series entries that play Richard Dix, I do not think this film is good. It's very slow, and the plot is simple. <br /> <br /> But acting is pretty cool, as well as lighting and dialogue. It's just not in force and you're probably going to figure out exactly what's going on and how through the way all the way through the end more than just come out. <br /> <br /> The 'Whistler' series is semi noir, and there are more important than the character, mood, lighting, camera movement and angles story. But this film is not noir. It is very light weight and Hollywood is innocent. Richard Dix's role in previous movies or his ladies is not good. <br /> Still, I would recommend this one for at least one view. I saw it at least twice, and it was enjoyed twice.
