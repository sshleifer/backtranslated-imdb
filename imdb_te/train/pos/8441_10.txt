Anyone who liked the series would have something to watch this film. Of course, you do not want more. I loved each character (detective) a performance. They left a reason for another movie with the fourth chair. My imagination is of course the Bayless. This is a series of sequences with series. This is the series I wish I lived in. Thanks for the cast for some amazing TV.
