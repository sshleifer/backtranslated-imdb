The movie is very good by Tadanovu Asno of Ichichi Killer fame. I can not really say much about the story, but there are quite a few chaos in me, and overall I think the film is a long time. However, the film has excellent performances in a great fight and is featured in many places, has great effects and a lot of knife plays. In my opinion another tough effort by Tadanob Asno. I can not tell you about the film well, but you can say that the house of Tiger Hidden Dragon or Flying Dogers, short of the Asian cinema suggests you are trying to rent, but if you're a die-hard Asian movie fan I would say this should be a very good Japanese image in your collection.
