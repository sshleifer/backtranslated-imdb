<br /> <br /> By Blake French <br /> <br /> Every year the audience is able to portray images of war, And something producers and writers always come with new and innovative techniques that portray different soldiers in the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("A Time To Kill"), one of the most dangerous actors currently working, has appeared to have had his new play "Tigerland" alongside "The Thin Red Line", similar to a soldier's boots. Written by Ross Klawen and Michael McGooter, the film is much stronger and more surreal than "The Thin Red Line" or "Private Ryan Saving". Although the film's curvature is somewhat diminished due to the dramatic effect of the film, it definitely appreciates us in a new perspective on training young people to the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to know Joel Schumacher's experiences with the army. Are men really this eruption and cruel? I know that there are some of them, but this film sees his uncompromising world in the eyes of the rebels Roland Bujz (Colin Farrell) against the ideas of war. His personality instantly fights with many other characters, his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis) and the other, Wilson (Russell Richardson), who frequently reveals Bose's tension as he intends to go to war. The war shot in the production was not found in the battlefield, but the training grounds of the Louisiana-based teaching camp between soldiers' feelings and fears. The film is specifically designed for war and nothing less. When the soldiers eventually end up in the war, it was frustrating after the evidence from the characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> A typical, rugged, ruthless and unrealistic atmosphere demonstrates using Joel Schumacher's hand-crafted cinematography, special lighting techniques and live sound, filmed in approximately 28 days with 16mm stock and a minimal budget. The film is considered to be a documentary feature of Schumacher's wheat and flown images. This extraordinary style of filmmaking can contribute to the hard core reality of the film, which is very much in use with a coarse language and is probably very disturbing. Four-letter words waves are viewers pound, they're in shock. Pornography has not seriously interrupted the conversation with heart, truth, and emotion. <br /> If anything, "Tigerland" has little appreciation of how much our soldiers are taking care of us. In the early stages of fighting in the country. Such bravery should be taken to enlist the army during the war period, knowing the difficulties and losses. Such thought-provoking ideas are possible through heartfelt performances by young actors who show different practices. The film is not for all the audience, but to see young people before they are in the lead in their army ... and the adult audience needs to see the meditation necessary for such courage. <br /> <br />
