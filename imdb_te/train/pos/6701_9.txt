I really liked the first 2 seasons. Because good characters have disappeared much later. Many of the programs are first slowly slowly slowly coming slowly in the next seasons, but it's absolutely reverse. Genie from the 1st season and Valerie Sabrina's friends from the 2nd season, I really do not care for others, Jenny and Walry are her best friends. I think for some reason, the producers wanted some college friends to be unwilling for some reason, they were very bad for Sabrina. But my favorite episode cat showdown from Season 1 and my favorite episode witch's worst from Season 2, this is a funniest part. I also felt that Libby's popularity was funny but she was always jealous of Sabrina, and never seemed to have a real boyfriend but always wanted to be with Harvey. They wanted me to do much better. I also said in the first two seasons, when wearing a few words in Sabrina in the opening scenes, like in the pilot episode of the witch, I said, "this is not mine" and then she told me what she thinks she kept trying to change something else, but this is a really cool show. But it turned out to be colored and Burney's wife back because it's good at first, because it's fine as ay grayfit is so much like the show. But I still would like to see, but because I saw the next seasons was Sabrina. What I mean about the opening sequence: Sabrina shows a number of different costumes and dresses, like the titles of cast members immediately after the start of the 1-3 start titles on the screen. Finally, Sabrina says that she is some sort of pin related to the outfit she wears and disappears. There are roles in the season four opening set bubbles.
