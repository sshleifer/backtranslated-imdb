It's almost distinctive lynch. However, this film makes Lynch exceptional, which is quite raw and almost impossible. But I believe that Lynch gives a greater sense of reality, which increases the surreal moments. <br /> <br /> However, there are a lot of common typical models: floating camera work; Haunting music; Long (excruciating) disruptions; Hanging curtains; Fuzzy lights that are growing in brightly colored with slow (almost variation) speed; Extreme close ups; Women's themes in trouble; All the familiar characters, dark and <br/ <br /> <br /> The performances are great and can provoke smaller ones that are overly incomplete, incomplete, unnecessary, temporarily disliked characters. As always, Lynch leaves almost everything to the interpretation. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful attempt from the lynch.
