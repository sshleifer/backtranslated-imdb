There are a few movies, in my opinion, that's the only reason I give this picture from 8 to 8 because this is perfect. This tiny B movie is a taut story, well said. I always worried about Alexander Knox, but he got a lot of movies. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who has become a monster. He will repent to everybody. The show is one of the most chilling performances I've ever seen. Since World War 2, actors who have played other evil types in Nazis or movies have been nominated for occasional Oscars. Since I was at war, I think the academy has wished to honor such a performance. But Knox puts it in such a function - a person suffering from his guilt that there is nothing to bother others. <br /> <br /> Marcia Hunt, who plays Phillert Gibbett or Social Butterfly, also has the title of her best ever appearance. Perhaps the Oscar is not worth it, but she's the best in her career. Nothing against her; I often acted in those "little" characters. <br /> <br /> If you like stories or stories about human drama about the fortunes of the drama here, the film.
