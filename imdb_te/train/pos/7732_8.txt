The performances in this movie are fantastic. The conversation is great. Jason Patrick gave this amazing adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel "Kid" Collins. The film is really high on the good film "The Gritters", which is really stable for the Pulp Fiction / Film Noir source. I recommend this film to all movie noir fans.
