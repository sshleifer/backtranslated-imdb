What happens to the rock-n-roll stars in the late 1990s? They started a comeback / reunion tour. <br /> <br /> Story Foo, what do members of a (fictional) 70 stadium rock band members do? <br /> <br /> Tony (Stephen Rhea) Condom is a subsidy on a vending machine while walking to a sponsor's son. Of the famous music festival. Strange fruit split in the 70th year of the festival. The wave of the "retro" of the 70's and the widespread time is right. He left off in search of other members of the band. <br /> <br /> The team is part of the dismantling and replaced by Keith's lead singer and brilliant songwriter. The band is known for its high lifestyle and now they are back in the working class. Drummer, a labeled, bass player, a roofer, and their lead singer still played by Timothy Spall (a wonderful person in Secrets and Lies). While he had a huge building, he did not continue his fortune and had to sell it. <br /> <br /> Brian, lead guitarist, is dead, so the young guitarist is appointed to replace him. <br /> <br /> Some people are reluctant to try the band reunification. When they leave their jobs, they begin as rehearsers, and their managers add their label to reboot their albums. But he wanted to start the tour again for the first time. Hence they beat the club circuit around Europe. The club scene is not that kind of heavy weight, dated, old rockers. <br /> <br /> This movie really starts to develop. The old clashes surrounding Keith and Brian are lagging behind. They are all together because they are searching for a second chance for the best of escape. <br /> <br /> The crazy Spinal Tap II begins, but it becomes a more dramatic picture of the band members' relationships. Even though it is still a very funny movie, it is the struggling characters that are struggling to deal with Brian and Keith's deaths and their own personal demons.
