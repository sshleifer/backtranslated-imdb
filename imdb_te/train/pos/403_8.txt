I remember the trailer for the Legend of Zhu and is a fan of a man Called Hero (my all time favorite), remember the Storm Riders I also decided to see this one. I know that Actin Chen's performance has led to much criticism everywhere but he's my favorite Hong Kong Movistar so far (better way than Nicolas T.) and I am happy to be happy with this movie. This film is the work of art in the final stage from the beginning. I only felt that the actors are true and everything else is a computer generated at the end of this film. They work hard on this and they need good credit. The story of the film is a fairytale between good and evil story of the thrown in the storyline (I guess Ekin Cheng pulls the girls easily) .The story is not too intelligent and deep but watcing an action movie you can not expect. Instead of fights with magical abilities, the fist and the fist were considered a more martial arts act, but it was in life and did not go as you want. And why did they sound supersonic planes in the sky in the end? It's a lot of fun. Zu Legend is not a man who's a hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and is not a bad thing at all. If a company decides to publish games in this movie, I will not suprised because it contains all the videogames. Good work. Please make it more virtual pictures
