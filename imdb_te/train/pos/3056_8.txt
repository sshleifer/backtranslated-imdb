<br /> <br /> The cast in the film is placed in my TvO in my TvOo, some of the industrious workers in the industry, and finally I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film has a taste for Altman-like (ultimately "grateful" person), the film's unreleased independent plot, as shown in its climax. Macy adds splash to a deliberately reduced environment, Tracey Ulman, Barbara Bain (Mission Impossible Impossible?), Without defining John Ritter, and you have all the material for a good film. The script is not clear, free from the dialog clock and attention (especially between Mackie and David Darfman). Suspend in confidence and have fun, this is really time well spent.
