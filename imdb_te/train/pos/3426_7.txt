This is not a critique of the film, rather than a comment on how proud our past is. <br /> I recently saw the Winter Soldier, the Ground Truth remake or the sequel. Since it has a one-sided message like the winter solder, two films are strongly engaged in conflicts based on false concepts, and allow our young and brave (and innocent) to endure the intensity of this greedy warfare. The two films have effectively demonstrated a mechanism for forced and willing killing of young minds, but training is a struggle for the devil to teach the diplomatic and policy skills needed to effectively win people's hearts and minds. It has finally lost the war in Vietnam and loses the war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My only negative commentary is that the film is very simple, it easily emerges in the left campaign. Not by myself, you, but that aimed at discrediting the image and message. A more balanced perspective can speak to a larger audience.
