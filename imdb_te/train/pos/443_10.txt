I first saw this film in the first 90s of the first release. The room with a viewpoint is also new. Enchanted April is too much to offer! I realized that I was very real and terrestrial, and the characters are more reliable for 'normal'. At the end of the film, when I first saw the BBC's Pride and Prejudice product, I felt the same way that I was looking for what they were looking for as solitude, peace, freedom or love. Everything you know so far has been eliminated throughout Italy, they are at risk and are away from all of the heart and oppression. But in the spring heat in April, everyone will loosen and loosen the lives (with Victorian corsets) and slowly rebuilt everyone's satisfaction. A small gem of an image! How well do you know that?
