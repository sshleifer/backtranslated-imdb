If I love this film, I can only see it, that's true. So, I put it on today and hid behind my bank computers. I remembered it clearly, but I wanted to see if I did not find something I had not seen before ....... I did not do it: This is quite true for me. <br /> <br /> Another aggregator "wrote" the ages of the commentators. I'm all for Many of those who commented on "Midnight Cowboy" may not have been born when it was released. They appeared in other films following Jon Woitt and Dustin Hoffman, later in the season. I'm a bad frank: I'm 82 years old. If you know some of my other comments, you know that I am a woman-impersonator at the age of 60 that year and have also appeared in the film - you never realized me and you know what my night club personality is. Do I know very well about the characters in this film? <br /> <br /> I'm shy. If you do not lead some of them, it's your loss - but you have a big chance, but it does not. Most moms, dads, sons and daughters are surprised at you. It has been revealed by a number of actors / actresses from the themes of "Midnight Cowboy". Who should judge? Many of the cities that have grown up on CD streets in many cities will rename the current Big-Time stars, not least bit by the time I spent there. Love, courage, kindness, compassion, intellect, humility: you are human beings, love, courage, kindness, compassion, intellect and humility. <br /> "Tvia" is actually begging on the streets - how can he see his car driving around Los Angeles - how does he think his input gets? I can also tell you about the male stars who stand on the streets and cruise the bars for money. While Nightclub is the world's most celebrated and legend I have worked for over the past 26 years, I have been constantly trying to pick up some big stars from our backstreet, picking up. <br /> <p> It is not surprising today that it is big and small, perfect action in Hollywood and other cities. Wake up and smell the roses. <br /> They were called "Joe Buck", a few "consumers" who suffered his "BOP". Although I saw him in her bed with boyfriend, I did not find any incidence. Believe-it-or-or-not, children have not had their own rooms - one day should tell you something you might be a bit kink because in the master bedroom. Whose business? Hofmann asked for a change in the streets, but "customers" are not a major actor for Jon Voight "Midnight Cowboy" - his actual salary will surprise you. I think he was robbed! No one can doubt the clarity of his role, or that it has starred him for a great work like "Deliverance". He defined a powerful man who conquered his demons and was good for it: commenting on some of the fools in the film. <br /> <br /> I did not find any homosexuality between "Razzo" and "Joe" - one of the first films to be the last of the 60s. Apparently the opposers are incomplete to someone else. True friendship - they have found a very high relationship. At the end of the picture you do not understand that you have wasted your time. "Joe's" shakiness, but unashamed devotion becomes clear. Yes, Vote was an Oscar for this role - John Wayne did not pull, and he was beautiful in his youth. <br /> <br /> <br /> Huffman Hoffman - You expect fireworks. He made them look great. Wayne got his Oscar. Each character in this movie is beautifully defined - if you still want to be around, you are mistaken. "Party"? - Some of the "courageous" young people attend. If you can get it - look like people who try to get into hot clubs - you will see every terrible personality. <br /> <br /> Brnda Wiccaro Society Some elegant women in the glamor of the globe will be trapped in the plot at this time. If you wondered with her amazing performance, thinking of "this is not true", I see today's "ladies" and live in the fringe edges ... and it is worshiped. <br /> <br /> The cruelty "Joe" displays the old man sneaking, unfortunately, a part of life. You can not forgive it, but it is not much different from any violence. "Joe" clearly stated his intention - in that situation, I handed out more money than he was asked. This is one of the scenes in which the movie is interrupted, which I did not see. <br /> <br /> These ignorant people have to be sure to direct this witty cute eye-opener to John Shelselinger. Those who have no part of the screen know who they've created history, and to be honest with its honesty. Perhaps "in America only" can close our eyes to unpleasant situations, and other filmmakers can not make any concussion in displaying it to the public. Not looking at it is not it - give me the truth every time. Bravo! All ......
