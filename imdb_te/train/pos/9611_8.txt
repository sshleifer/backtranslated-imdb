It's a real wonder for my own experience of bulimia, surprisingly intellectual for a TV movie. It is actually well researched, and I can only assume that someone who lost through the same experience has written it because it has all the small details. The characters were very well painted, and performances were great by Mary Winnieham and Alison Lohan. I feel like I like most people, they are unique and intelligent, and the reasons for Beth's bulimia could not be downgraded (some are not "media pressures, we can not really solve ..."). Her mother is not entirely clueless - too often television has a problem that everyone has some understanding and try to tell us that their leaders are the last remaining people on earth ("Diabetes? What is it? Oh, my world is all physician, physician, Explain it to me "). Her mother is a psychologist and is also wise to see her signs. The scenes shot by Beth were not entirely dramatic and sensationalist, and bulimics needed for privacy, and focused more on their outside control. <br /> <br /> When Beth was told by his mother to his wife, I was worried about other people in the room. <br /> <br /> Well, I liked those bits. It's not as good as I do not work well, it goes back to the TV movie territory we know and does not have special love, but I expect it to close. <br /> <br /> "You can also cure your baby's discomfort, if you have money and money with us and live in the United States." <br /> <br /> I can say again that I really like Winningsham. She was great.
