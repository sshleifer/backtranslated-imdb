"Although Jarred Diamond has other pets in the world, it does not have pets, but why the Europeans make a point in the first episode, why steel and why complex machines can be invented". --- The person who wrote this comment did not understand the argument behind this documentary or the original book. Do not destroy this great piece by your simple mind. The reasons are more complicated than these factors. Please read the great source of information. I enjoyed it very much. This book is also a text book in some universities.
