Show older people ??? I'm 15 and I have been looking at the show since 12 years from the Hallmark and BBC 1 on my Sky + box day. I did not cancel it, they did not get the right farewell. <br /> <br /> This expedition, all those episodes, I have seen them, and do not remember that I was unwilling and enjoyed. <br /> <br /> BBC Diagnos Murder and 'Murder She Wrote' - Never seen and intended. However, the characters in Diagnoses Murder are very deep, and the chemistry between the actors is amazing. Really sad day when they cancel this presentation ........
