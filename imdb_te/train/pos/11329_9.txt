The combination of the spectacular black and white photography and the 'Eugene Onegin' plot with a twist made this a real knock out for me. The atmosphere created by a very dark shots occasionally strikes a very bright white shots. There transparency - obviously a traditional holiday, but the faces of the actors outlined the character and scenario in the immediate aftermath - the Chokkovsky opera has been shown along with Eugene Oenigen along with Lensky's Heart Wrenching Aria. <br /> <br /> If the image of a good image for me to take advantage of the possibilities offered by the media, it is often less important than the story and the pictures - that is the last year in Marinebad. Krisana is the same mold.
