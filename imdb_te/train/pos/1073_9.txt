Dark Angel has taken us two sections, "a story" and "entering" as a series, because we are shifting from a very different psychological frame of sopranos. But once we've got a summary of the series, we've tied up very quickly. It's just a shame that just started out good into an amazing category: Dark Angels is more than your average TV series. As the action goes as donkey and rocks kicks, but the mutant of "mutant" characters and social reactions reminds us of the constant prejudices we face (and make) each day. The story set in the future puts motion surrealism and prevents controversial anti-message in our faces (hence "fun" does not destroy those who do not speak during entertainment), but each event and human / social interaction is currently relevant. We all make judgments, we can face our own delusions, but in the end, who are you lying? Are you sitting back and closing your mind or doing something about it? Apart from choosing to fight for survival or justice, this range encourages them. To anyone who has never encountered the question, the series "penetrates" in the pursuit of pure entertainment entertainment. It's very well made and well written than most TV series; I ended it very disappointed before it really kicked into the high gear.
