Recap: Zandalee is a young woman who feels trapped in her marriage to more theater. Thierry himself lost his way past the death of his father's death last year. He was drowned in his work, and Jandale lost the attraction between them. It enters into Johnny, and is once an old friend of Theory, who is artists in exile. But Johnny kept in painting, and just a day job for rent. He will take it on the day of coming and tomorrow goes to its fate. There is an instant raw attraction between Zandalee and Johnny, and they enter into an affair. But Zandalee struggles with his lust and loves his conscience and her husband. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is set to be a thriller, but none of them are not, not Johnny, and Thierry can not fully control the relationships between them. But there is more thriller heart than a simple thriller about life and death, and the threat of violence. The thriller of the heart can not take a deadly proportion, but the threat comes from a different perspective. And it's not really until the second half of Zandalee until the thriller arises, and even though it's laid in the first half of the foundation for it, I can not really illustrate the genre of thriller then. A romantic drama than the rest, but with the underlying currents of other genres. There is a thriving thriller, but it's also a little bit of a sensual romantic kind of color. Because it's all there, which guides the characters and the entire story. Desire. Need, and should. <br /> In my opinion, it is better than its current (4.1) rating. It takes time but the suspense grows better, and with it tastes, is very well maintained in the romantic part. It is always an integral part of the story, it should be there to give the story we need weight, and I never thought there was a need to show such a naked breast or anything. But unfortunately the end comes before the end of the story, and it is dramatically in its own way. <br /> <br /> The cast was impressive Nicolas Cage and Judge Reinhold. But the show was completely stolen by Erika Anderson. The desire is sometimes cute and very adept at acting out of micro feelings, her excellently cage two and Reinhold sometimes go into a bot and become a little tighter. She is very thin for the talent that she performed in Jandail after her career, because I only expect her own choices. Two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some additional edges to the film, such as Steve Basmi and Joe Pantolino. <br /> If you're in the right mood, it's a good movie, <br /> <br /> It has used another end to get credit that really deserves. <br /> <br />
