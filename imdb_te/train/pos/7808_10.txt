This is the image to be seen by everyone. Since incredibly far away (South Africa has been in the recovery road now there are many countries in this situation), since it is incredibly important points, it is wonderfully directed when Delzell Washington is in the best of my career, in my opinion so far. Klein also gives good performance, probably not as spectacular as Washington. <br /> <br /> In apartheid there are many areas where the film may fall, but all of them are avoided. It's easy for good people to portray white people as bad people and blacks, but Attenborough did not. Certainly, there are some white characters who look internally bad as the Captain in the Sveto revolt, but adding extra sizes to all the characters makes the film inexplicable. Some people complain about the length of the film, but I think I need a whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story, which is really amazing. <br /> <br /> The best scene in this film is the funeral of Steve Becho. <br /> <br /> When the whole audience started singing the national anthem of South Africa, it was probably one of the most moving scenes I had ever seen. <br /> If you have not already seen this movie: See. It's not a comfortable view, but it's definitely worth it.
