OK Here's how I do it. Grade movies on 10 parts. Each part starts with 5 points internally. <br /> Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I will give this item 10 points. It has a perfect balance in all the five dimensions. Action is fun and exit. Romance is not overloaded, but still very emotional and moving. <br /> Plot - I give this piece 10 points. I thought I had already told all the good fairy tales. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> This episode is 8 points. <br /> <br /> When the film is very well captured in the sense, I will try to find out what happened at the camera off. <br /> <br /> FX - This part gives you 10 points. They are C.G.I. Less. The mythical scenes are believable. The magical powers are frightening reality. All less and more all, and it all has it! Cast - I will give this piece 10 points. No names and actors, actors are great! Michelle Pfeiffer is amazingly bad, Charlie Cox came to life in Tristan, Claire Danes gave the stars emotion, and I see again and Robert De Niro same again. <br /> Acting - points I give this part. Also newbie actors played their rolls in perfection. <br /> Once again, I can never see Robert De Niro ever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ If the film was a little bit longer, I feel that if they were a bit too long they would have done better with the characters. <br /> <br /> Dialog - I give this piece 10 points. Dialogue, witty and fun <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Sincerely from the whole movie Remember a little piece of music. <br /> <br /> "I give this part 9 points, almost perfect <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ' !
