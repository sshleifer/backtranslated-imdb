D.W. The sarcasm of sarcasm is intended. Griffith's intolerance, Three-Ezes Buster Keaton's first attempt is a full-length comedy feature. Similar comparisons to the intralarance are the same "stories" scenes and the stories of the same story together with the film. Keaton's argument for capturing this style, if it does not succeed in the film, it will be reduced to three two-relayers. Fortunately, the three duets have become brilliantly successful as a comedy and have the funniest events I've seen in any film of Keaton. There is nothing special or daring about the storylines. They set a standard boy-meets-girl-boy-losing girl, boy-gets-girl-plot, but as long as the satires haphazard and mel Brooks and future works of all the genres of this genre. However, I do not believe that this comedy is at the top. No one koetain like Goofy and the adventures in this film are his best. In addition, Wallace Beary's performance as Keaton's rival adds to the attraction of the film. Anybody who feels comedy since the 1920s does not have to look at the film for modern audiences.
