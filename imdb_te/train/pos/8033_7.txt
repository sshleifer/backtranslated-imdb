Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. <br /> I'm not going to military and war films, but it's worth my time. <br /> It's extreme, but it's also ridiculous. Beringer's character proved heroic and honest. <br /> <br /> Zen's character has evolved throughout the film. He was not just a suit, he proved to be a hero and a gun. <br /> <br /> I will end up with a few. <br /> <br /> It did not really take action throughout the film, but I was happy to see it. <br /> It is worth checking out.
