Carmen is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's hard to say that its performance is correct: Antonio Gods, Cristina Hoyos and Laura Del Sol. Their spirits get out. It's a beautiful story of inseparable life and myth; The myth revolves around everyday life. Dance becomes a life and has danced the whole life. At the same time, real people spend their own lives and nobody else will turn into parts of old lovers. The magic continues.
