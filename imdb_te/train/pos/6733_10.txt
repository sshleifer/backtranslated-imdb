As a place for recent surfing movies, I am vigilant without any warning. I caught this treasure to digital cable this week and this is what a pleasant surprise! The vision of 60th Greg Nol has large wave surfers surfing to Jaws from our current Lord Hamilton to Vaye Bay from Mavericks. Hell, I can see the movie about Larry Hamilton, one of the big athletes of this generation - the rest are just gravy. Surfing, combined with interviews with past and present surfing stars in pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious fashion. This is a big-wave story best of all surfing movies I've seen, and I think this is my favorite. Have fun!
