This is a great movie! Many of us have seen Jurassic Park where Chaos Theory is summed up by telling a butterfly wing, which causes tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, the bug is all about (or at least something, this is no spoiler) I'm not sure a religious type and do not believe in predetermined items, destiny, etc, but wondering if this film is really coincidentally? <br /> <br /> More, acting and camera are so amazing, another prove that it is still possible to make a good image without a zillion bucks
