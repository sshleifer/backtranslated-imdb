I do not really agree with how much I love the movie, and I have a dubbed-in-Japanese video version, reading various external reviews of Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics. Apparently, most critics have taken this story as a pre-used minus, which is greatly known as "This is the wonderful One Life." No matter how many times I used it on a great premise, and I'd be glad to see more movies using this special premise - the unsatisfied man who has the opportunity to get the latest perspective in his own life <br /> <br /> I folks and critics of the more intellectual bent I do not think I was pulled into it, but I did not go to movies to criticize them with NatBook And they will throw me into the movies, where they go to me. <br /> If you are in a sentiment like me, you will get a good reward by seeing this picture. The performances are fantastic throughout, and the film is well cast. Excellent choice of music. Michael Cain is a magnificent bartender. Jim Belushi does a great job with the kind of "Average Joe" kind of person who wonders if his life has gone out of it. Linda Hamilton, always amazing, is again the right target is the loving wife. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny" is not "It's Wonderful Life", but does it mean "Mr. Destiny"? "Destiny" is a fun, well made, funny and moving movie that has taken its own rules. I have seen my Japanese-dubbed video several times, and I'm sure I'll see it many times. If something is done "lobro", it will be the same! <br /> <br /> "I must have the courage to my beliefs and give the film nine or ten stars, but I can not help myself after reading all the critical reviews!
