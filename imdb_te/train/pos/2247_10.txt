I'm disappointed at the lack of these surprising and effective little movie posts. <br /> <br /> Jordie Morrow is the man who wrote and directed Ted Demme's "Blow", and his role as Diogo in the stars. ) It is incredibly exciting to have nothing to know about it .. If you have a Netflix account, or have access to a video store that is carrying it ... I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Mola's direction is great and the promise shows a lot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
