This awesome written and well-played psychic drama. It's not really a horror film that is disappointing for those looking for something like a ring or a grudge. Surprising and intuitive attention to the film really surprised me for details on the plot and internally stable work. I also appreciate the absence of Dr. Phil Manoruble or New Age revisionism. Instead of developing an agenda, filmmakers tell the story, say well and let the viewer think about it. Weird diamonds are symbols of symbolism and are awesome. big studios, star actors, big-name directors (it's much better than many of Hitchcock's movies), special effects or "wise" plot turns.
