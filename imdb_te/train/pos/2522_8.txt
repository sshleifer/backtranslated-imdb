I must first confess, at first I did not look good. <br /> Yes, acting is not that great, but it does not suck, all the casting is well disciplined and brings enough power to their roles. <br /> <br /> Although it really merges striking stories, it also displays raw reality. Developing the characters, their doubts and their feelings really came to me and I think this film is key. It keeps you thinking and it transfers all the facets. <br /> It fulfills any expectations for good drama. I would definitely recommend to everyone.
