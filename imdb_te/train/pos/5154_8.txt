As an amateur historian of WW2 / Nazi Germany, I can not wait to come on this DVD. This was the first time I lost it in 2003. I do not want to repeat what I have already mentioned in the past 8 pages about historic errors. A good job was to play the role of "lovely" Hitler. I have a small problem with some of the cast options, not much for their performance, but for their performances. Peter Stormrrr does not look like Ruhm, why did not they make Babzon a hug to wear a wig? And my big complaint .. Most were made with Hitler's spectacular blue eyes, why do not they wear carlisle blue contacts? On the plus side, I thought the actors who appeared GÃ¶ring and Drexler looked pretty. Again, as long as this people watching this people think 1st, history 2nd does not think I should happen too much to hurt.
