I love this movie and have seen it several times in a few years. It gets better with each view. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it's awkward and worse true because it's in those days of inspired life. I commented when I saw it. Here Rip Torn wrongly mentioned. I could not contradict further. He is a painful, Claire Stewart is short and serves as a slave / craftsman. Konkaid hires a cookie (Cook with her 7-year-old daughter), some of whom are as good as Farrell's luxurious Elinar. Lilia Skala's grandma is as amazing as the distant neighbor. A star starca Montana prairie. It's both beautiful and cruel country. There are both extravagant and necessary scenes. There is no special effects here, what you see is real! It also has an excellent perfect music score and a great script. If you look at Hartland, it will never forget. It gets all here 10s deserves.
