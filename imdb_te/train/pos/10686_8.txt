And I'm a Nicole Kidman fanatic. I paid to read and listen to the Moscow phone book, I know when I speak Russian. <br /> <br /> The four principals are excellent, but the film has not done anything without good pictures and good scenes. <br /> <br /> When looking at an image of always disloyalty, this one asks a lot of the viewer. <br /> It's very funny (it's in parts) or scary (it's in a scene) but the director does not seem to know how to go.
