Everybody who is disappointed to see the vacuums and weaknesses of Disney Studios is something to come here to heal your wounds ... Once and for all, a bug brings life's good illustrations into the artificial images that provide more proof of fake "hand-made-Disney-like" drawings (The magical theme of the Lion King, Pokhandhans and Bobby See all the latest structures had been lost forever to Ryu fear.) <br /> A bug's life (1001 for the bodies of my fellow French cinemaniaks!) And you awaken in the middle of the movie, "Hey, this is the production of computer!" If all the flaws are successful in avoiding. The immense effort to show the weakest parts, the ability of its ability and the general form of sets, is amazing 3D bird (close to realism in real terms) ... and technical specifications. <Br /> <br /> The scenery, my friends, is a true spine of motion picture, some thickness! Interestingly, and thanks to the Lassaeire team, there is practically no musical order in the life of a bug. It means the story is richer enough to liberate himself from this 3 or 4 minutes to appreciate the story a lot longer and some children, but most others (the same thing for parents or anime fans, like me). The film reminds me of the really old movie starring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase: The 3 Amigos; It is basically the same background story (an entire Mexican villager who fears some bad guys hires the gunmen (eventually turning into actors), etc ...). <br /> <br /> From microcosmos, most movies are telling stories of insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I think a bug is life's ridiculous and best of all. Mankind's process has been well-received ... and the whole audience is attracted by the Flex (Tilt in France) adventures. <br /> <br /> Big thanks to past 30 seconds in Laser's team. <br /> <br /> It is very strange and good at the same time to see the whole theater caught in error, while the bugs / actors forget their lyrics or hit the camera <br /> Finally, who saw the French version and other compliments Go to dubbing actors who have worked with a great synchro. A bug is a good piece of fun in life, and I think it's soon part of my collection videos (the right to grant the lowest images, it's not a storage room issue :). Go see it and see it, it's an order.
