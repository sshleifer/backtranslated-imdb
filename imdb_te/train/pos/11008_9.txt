You can notice from the stars given by this great movie, 'Before you first saw it,' I never heard before of this film and this week (and late) was a very slow rental experience (which was very great to come) because it was all over. I'm not sure how this film is going to be-I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Norm very good. <br /> <br /> If you do not have a big budget, the film can look great. It has the right amount of plots and dialogs to be very interesting and to keep the viewer in the dark; Just enough. The whole picture is that you (the viewer) is trying to figure out the many turns and turns on the plot. I've given this film 10/10, though looking at some of the shots are pretty fake. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mystical (as always). I showed her a lot of talent. Her beauty (which is difficult) Nevermind, she really takes her roles and does not rest on his show through her sophisticated emotional scene. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Nortom was the first to be a very bright corporate rat, ready to run through any maze to prove himself. However, when he changes throughout the film, it feels like night and day. Clive Owen, Jude Law, or the next James Bond I know for other hopeful fans who hate me for this, but North is enough for this bill. He is happy and culture. He had a great Bond posture and voice. <br /> <br /> If you would like to see a great movie and watch this film -freed at least once, you prefer corporate spying movies.
