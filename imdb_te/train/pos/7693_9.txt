"Good times," in my opinion, a must see CBS hit! I've never seen each episode, I'm still enjoying it. It's hard to tell which one is my favorite one. Also, I really love the theme song. If you ask me, it's good if everyone is in the show at the show, even if everyone wants it. While everyone has always given a good performance, the product design is excellent, the clothes have been well designed, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, even though it may now be seen on TV Earth, I strongly recommend it to catch it in case it goes off the air for good.
