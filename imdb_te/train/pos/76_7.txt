Vincent Pryce's follow-up HOUSE OF WAX (1953), a film that has solidified its reputation as a horror icon, and so does the revolt around the bitter? Showtime though effective. Although remake, the former (technicolor shot) is the best effort; It's a cheap jimmicky (which is another 3-D display) and occasional heroic defects (what happened to a missing bag that's what some of the police station with a broken head), this is enough Grand Guignol-type thrills and the whole camp Offers more than worth (the price will stand two on his own) his intellectual advantage Tailor-made 'Lost' star conjurers who disguised as a creator of illusions hum ming feet of it. Incidentally, there is no coincidence with Director Brahmin involvement? The story is based on two horror titles (starring Layardy Croagger), as he previously drew LODGER (1944) and Hangover Square (1945). Mary Murphy (as Price Immediate Assistant) and Patrick O'Neill (she is keen to be a police detective lover, who also heads the Chamber of Horse [1966], which took just a while to work as a single time). A novel recognition technique adjacent to an interesting side here is the adoption of fingerprints, which is crucial for taking a price break (in the predictable but embarrassing fiery climax), although the continuous snooze of his amateur criminal novelist is at least a lot more to do with it in the long run! Looking at the star in a made-to-measure character, the film gets a good deal of fun? Particularly compact 73 minutes.
