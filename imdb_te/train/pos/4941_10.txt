I believe that many people can not rate this movie because of lack of quality. But it did not follow the standard Hollywood principle. Some conflicts have not been fixed. The end is just a bit more truth to others, but the long journey of great characters and supporters to offer is both provocative and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is also excellent for urban formation and is excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> For 10 of my book, this film is not a simple and anticipated Hollywood script. They took some risks and made some things different. I think it works well, I will try to avoid any direct instructions for the movie because if you look for it, the best answer will not accept the description of others.
