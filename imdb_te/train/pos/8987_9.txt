I recently rented this document, listening to it from IMDb.com and making interest in the premise. I know little about these bands, but I remember that I heard a Dandy Warhols eras ago "even if you're not the last jigsaw on earth." <br /> <br /> An unconvincing thing about this film is that no previous knowledge of these bands is required. Director (Odi Timoner) wastes no time in attracting the audience and introducing people into the film. I drew very quickly to Anton and Courtney and their respective bands, Brian Jonestown Massacre and Dandy Warhols. <br /> <br /> I am fine for this doc, and Willie Timoner makes such a master documentary. <br /> <br /> I also liked how to tell the "story" of these bands. Most of the bands you visit are on tour. The two bands are playing small platforms in the recording industry. Throughout the film, each team strives to be exclusive and unchecked by the protocol. But it makes two bands the same and this is a fantastic way to see how two stages are going in different directions. <br /> <br /> For anyone who likes the film in general. You do not need special love for documentaries, or bands. An appreciation for music can be helpful, but music also takes a glimpse into the love / hate relationship between Brian Jones Town Massacre and Dandy Warhols.
