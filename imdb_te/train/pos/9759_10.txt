I believe that I got this film when I was a little buck. I remembered watching a kid but I never found the movie. I turned on good ol rageddy, Andy, Babbage, Greedy, King Coo remembered. I searched high and low for this movie and not luck. But when I went out of my childhood home, I found out. We've got it again. I'm 17 years old now. I'll see more. Of course all the time. It's one of the ridiculous and touching movies I've enjoyed and enjoyed at the same time. Personally I think they should make a sequel. Mmm, yes sequel yes. Now I'm also thinking about getting the captain bird my body somewhere tattoos fried!
