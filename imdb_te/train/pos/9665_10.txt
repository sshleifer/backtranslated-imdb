Betty Midler in this concert is indescribable. She gives her every time she is on stage. Whether we look at her jokes and antics, or Betty Midler, she moves her audience, whether she has our eyes at one of her amazing songs. If you can not see it (this is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. An interesting thing to see is how incredible she has changed her voice and has not lost its energy in years. She is still "more likely to be" with the "more correct" version of Ross or divine paternity falling out of the soul, where it is just pure and is always heartfelt. I'll spend some time with this concert.
