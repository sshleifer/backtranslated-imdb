If you are reading my review, you have already seen this movie. 'Raja Babu' is one of my favorite characters. I love the 24/7 employee, the brat feeling spoiled on his motorcycle. Watch movies and imitate the characters etc. When I was eating I loved the scene when a stone cracked in the Kadhar Khan's note. Energy Kapoor describes the story of Raja Babu in the banquet table, Govinda's 'Dharam-Vera' makes the sentimental comments on uniform wear. I will paint my favorite scene. 'Acha Pitaji Too Men Chalta Hoon' is not a mere intercourse between two great Indian actors. Its brilliant. This is a cat mouse picture. These actors look to help each other and remove the scene from one another. It's all fun. If you like Govinda and Cader Khan chemistry, it must be a must. David Dhawan RB in my list 'Deewana Masthana', 'Keepin', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Cool No 1 'before the gem of this film. 7/10.
