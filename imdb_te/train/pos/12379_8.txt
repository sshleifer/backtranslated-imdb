When I came to the film in an old theater in Northern California, I was a Waranget. It's as good as on DVD, it's more strange and terrifying on the big screen. Although it's been around 9 years since I've seen it, it's one of my all-time favorite. The noise of noise noise, "they just do not make this em 'em anymore!" If the Sixth Sense discarded you all, this picture is perfect for you! Great storyline, amazing cast of characters, ominous arrangement; Even the soundtrack has a haunting quality of it. I do not see myself alone. A Brownstone apartment is only rented in 1977, you have gas (the price today is at least 10 times).
