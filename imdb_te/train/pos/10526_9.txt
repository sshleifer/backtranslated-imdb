Romance is in the air and the Victorian era blossomed in England, and in this courtesy story, the women are fascinating and elegant in the courageous storyline of society, and the elderly are agile. "Emma", based on Jane Austen's novel and directed by Douglas McGrath, starred in the title character Gwyneth Paltrow. A self-appointed player, Emma Manmathing is very happy with the romantic sense of playing, and she tries to combine the feelings that fit her. After losing a successful match of marriage, she attracts her attention to finding a partner for her friend, Harriet (Tony Cocktail), but her initial effort is less than satisfactory. Meanwhile, her efforts are heartwarming through the beautiful Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Nordam), whose ideas are slightly more durable than Emma in the matters of the heart, and some require a balanced loan. And Emma ignores the heart that is really important in everything, really worries for others: her own. The world goes away and love increases, but Emma loses the boat. Fortunately for her, however, she's just right for her to wait in her wings. Now, she can stop as long as she can. But everyone who knows the true love knows, the things of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant, depending on the smallest thing; <br /> <br /> McGrath is designed and delighted, feel-good image is like the breath of our fresh air. The world of chaos often. It may be a breeze to be tackled about, but in the past, this story is probably the most important thing - something honest - just about anyone: Love. And with pace and timing McGrath's impeccable sense, it all plays here in a completely entertaining and enjoyable way. It's a fun, influential movie with amazing actors, and sends the viewer back to another location. It is light charge, but absorbing; And lovely settings and trials will give you a sense of well-being and serenity that allows you and you to go with the flow and just go with the flow. <br /> <br /> Pallora, best known for winning the Oscar as "Best Actress", "Shakespeare in Love" is both comfortable and right in this style after two years. She understands all things to the British, and it works with such nature and convenience, and it's easy to take care of all the work or be completely ignored. She is very good at what she does and it makes it much easier. She has a glamorous screen presence and a lovely approach, reciting Audrey Hepburn. Yet Paltrow is unique. As an actor, she has a wide range and style - played hard-to-be, hush and a perfect murderer - she can play any part of the game and plays the role that she plays. But she really is with characters like Emma who shines. She is expressive and public, and her personality is very attractive, and she is happy to play with her anyway and enjoy her. <br /> <br /> Jeremy North also finds himself in the role of Knightley, and, like Paltrow, seems to fit this role - it's in the right role; He is much less satisfied than his performance in the recent Italian Golden Bowl. Here, however, he is perfect; He is beautiful, and Niley manages himself in a way that makes him believable and very real. <br /> Like Pride and Prejudice, like Mr. Darcy of Colin Firth, North created a memorable role with his own Mr. Knightley. <br /> <br Emma friend Harriet Smith; And Allen Cumming, as Reverend Elton. Honestly, Collettat and Cummings created the most real-life characters, and the film became an important asset to the overall success. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Greta Skachi (Mrs. Weston), Denis Hawthorne (Mr. Woodhouse). ), Sophie Thompson (Miss Bates), Kathleen Byron (Mrs. Goddard), Philadelda Law (Mrs. Bates), Polly Walker (Jane Fairfax) and Evan McGregor (Frank Churchill). A striking, elegant picture of `Emma 'is the value of gentleness and grace in the world of memory and discomfort of civil behavior. And if it's only a magic on the silver screen, it's good to escape a world, if only two hours per hour, it's needed to restore faith in the human soul. And that's the magic of those movies. I rate this one a 9/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
