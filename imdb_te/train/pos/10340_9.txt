Although this film came a year before I was born, this is one of my favorite comedy films. It was her father's Red Fox who was trying to understand homosexuality. Like most parents, he understands the homosexuality and has these stereotypes of gay people. His son, Norman, has now grown and lives on his own. His father, Ben learns that his son is homosexual, and he hopes his son will change him. The film comes from one of the funniest lines - when he becomes Norman's apartments, he runs a woman's prostitute and thinks it's his son drag ("Norman ... It's You?"). From the start of the film I made a laugh. Red Fox is great. While the content is very stereotypical, I do not find any objections to the way the material is handled, and this is a good end. Highly recommended.
