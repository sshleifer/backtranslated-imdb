Action. Comedy. Suspense. <br /> <br /> Professional thieves are invited to take part in a robbery in a small town in Montana. The initial character of every type of crime history is here. Frank, the master mind. Carlos, armored specialist. Max, explosion expert. Nick, safe cracker and ray, car man. Unfortunately for Frank, he has 2 detective detectives (Ed O'Neill and Danielle Roquck is well shot) and he is chasing him, he sends letters from New Jersey to another. <br /> <br /> Our 4 characters meet up at the train station and from the beginning no one will like or trust another. <br /> <br /> Now Frank is returning to New Jersey by the Detectives 2, but is on foot and is trying to escape. <br /> <br /> A really great movie that really laughs and loads with great acting. Anyone looking for a laugh is a good image or something different
