The first thing I thought about when I saw these pictures: it's not really a movie, at least we hear the word "it", we are not impressed. It is a complete symbol, each of which is a rhetorical meaning. If you do not introduce a formality, religion, and spiritual life, it would seem strange to you, it would be strange, you think it's just a fairy tale ... and unnatural, chaotic. For me "The Legend of Ju" is definitely transparent. And I like it. It tells us in the story about the struggle between light and darkness, the ancient struggle like humanity, and everybody who experiences the experience in this life face it. This film is clearly made by Buddhists. I'm not a Buddhist. My religion and the world are the focus and human is different. But we have all human beings and the same human nature that we can have normal experiences and understand each other. This is a very beautiful picture! And I have more movies like this - I have a meaning in the movies. There are a lot of empty stories that are only too empty to pass the time very quickly.
