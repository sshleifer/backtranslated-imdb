Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed the song 'The Baron', and 'The Six Million Dollar Man' started a fictional series about three supernatural spies. This was my favorite when I was young, and I still enjoyed watching it. Stuart Damon and William Gunt have a clear screen on Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while Lucius Alexandra Basto gave up his role as Sharon Maggred. The late Anthony Nicholas Tremane made it look great. Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens are the best episodes of Spooner's own interrogation 'The Prisoner'. I'm worried that the second series is never there. This feeling has been a lot of life. Are Craig and Richard competitors to Shran's love? If you know about the tremendous champions' powers? Are there any other abilities other than the champions we've seen? We have found, alas.
