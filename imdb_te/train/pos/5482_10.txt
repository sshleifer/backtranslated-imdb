This is an incredible picture. As well as showing actual footage of key programs in a failed revolt, we will give a background image that describes class-divided society. Many riches, with a democratic choice of people, have an option and are ready to use the army for regime change. 'Be careful what you say before your servants' is an open comment. The head of the nation's largest oil company hires himself as the new president, with US backing, and all of these young Irish filmmakers have everything in the camera. Great film that gives education to young people about democracy. There are transparent documents on how to betray the media, how to deceive the media, and how to use it in the interests of big business against the interests of the democratic demands of the people. Rifting stuff.
