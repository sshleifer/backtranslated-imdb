If you ever wondered why they do not make romance with a plot, watch Dream Quest. On the one hand, you should give Armstrong credit for trying to use this strong adult cast to invest in this idea and to keep some name behind it. On the other side, most sexes are clear that the 15-and-20-second dialogue combined with sex scenes should never be why. <br /> This is very good because it's not very good, trying to cut corners. Also, I would like to see more efforts like this. Maybe someday I will see the perfect combination of romance and plot.
