I really enjoyed this movie. It succeeded in some of the movies doing some; I gave family values ​​when it was fun. Nancy Drew look for a heroine and a roll model for young girls for all generations. The little girls I read enjoyed the film and continued to talk about Nancy when I was out of the theater. The film has fewer problems for families and I do not think parents are bored at the theater. No, it did not win the Oscars and it did not perform spectacular special effects or did not provide horrific horror secrets, but it was entertaining to me and it was true to the inspiration of books. I definitely recommend this film to anyone with a young girl (she will love it!) Or any fan of books. Do not be disappointed.
