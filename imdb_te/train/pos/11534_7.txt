Mirage (1990) is a rare rare horror / chiller since 1990, released in the UK "New World Video" label. <br /> <br /> This is a desert based horror film about a group of young friends. Parties in the weekend should be killed by an unknown force that drives the black-and-run black vehicle! The film has some creepy scenes, and some gore are here and there, but I have acted very slowly with low cash budget scales! But the movie is extraordinarily addictive and I liked it, and when I ever fell asleep or off it, it was always a good sign! I almost gave this film to 6/10, but when looking at the steam, some good moments of gore and suspense, good nudity and even the most beautiful lady in the lead female role! I give 7/10.
