I have seen this many times when I was a child, and I am often going to be the "Happy Cat" song. All songs are great, and are actually memorable, unlike many children's music, the songs are not just for the original reasons. The scenes and costumes are luxurious, and acting is very good, it is not surprising, the cast takes into consideration. Christopher Walken is very catlike, and he does not need stupid makeup for a viewer who believes a cat is a cat, or a cat dress. And Jason Canary is so cute, shy and awkward Miller's son, Corin, who fell in love with the beautiful and bold Princess Vera. It is a lot of fun, enjoyable and lengthy films, in which unlike many miracles, the characters are given to personalities. While Paz Coorin has been busy drowning, there are some of my favorite episodes; When everyone dances in a country dance, it's like "all terrorism abroad"; When the Wakeen is in the kitchen, he will dance on the table (he is also a pretty good dancer!); And when Vera Coren told her all the things she used to do when she was young, she acted as a Miller's daughter. Who love magic and fairytales, like to recommend this film for children and parents alike. And this is a picture that you can see together because the wall does not drive big ones.
