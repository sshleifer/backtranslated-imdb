"Pet Semetary" will succeed in two main situations. First, this is a horror horror movie. Only these days are not produced. Second, it's an emotional, intelligent movie overall. If you're looking at cold, fearless, moves and visually stunning settings, great acting, dying and grisly effects; This is a movie you're looking for. A classic now and should really look for a horror fan. <br /> Maybe the best adaptation of the novels of Kings. Events feel a little rushed compared to the novel, but this does not mean that the underestimated picture is not a complete horror / drama accomplishment. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is known as the most emotional and fierce at the same time. The film captures the same feeling because it has a great feel and you can experience a love relationship between its members. Then, everything is happy (technically cheerful, because the title "Pet Sematari" does not provide grace) a tragic event alters the image of the movie, now it becomes very dark. The film has bad feelings from early credits, but after the gauge dies, the movie is very sad, sad, creepy. A baby's son dealing with loss is the thing that can ruin the whole life of a family, and "Pet Semetary" proves it dramatically. <br /> <br /> The epic of the pet seminary does not let anyone feel, but it leads to an emotionally destructive father to give it a shot in mourning and desperation. Sadly enough, myth comes back from the truth and the baby gauge death. The previous encounter with the pet seminary legend seemed a tragedy but this time it is very bad. What will happen with all our American families? Can this tragedy be avoided? What is this with surrealistic nightmares? <br /> <br /> See the "Pet Semetary" to see one of the most touching, emotional horror movies of recent times. You will not regret it. I could not take the actor as my father, but acting was very good. He did not seem sufficiently disturbed when circumstances demanded his frustration. But this is my opinion. Denise Crosby truly gave a great performance and worked perfect as a noble, tender mother. Baby gauge is also excellent in its creepy episodes. * Shivers *. Overall it's a great classic and a disturbing film that touches people's deepest fears ... losing someone you love, a return to the life of the dead, and a feeling of despair. <br /> Definitely ... I'm not buried on the outdoors, a pet semester !!
