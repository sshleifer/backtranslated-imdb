"Life is in the face of us ........ we should try to be beautiful" <br /> One of Belgian's best performers (he sings songs), Tom Burman. A long-awaited film and happy joy of happiness --- is really worth watching --- Flemish filmmaking, and a good piece of work! It takes us in the lives of 8 main characters who live through a Friday and night. <br /> <br /> When they go to party on Friday night, they will be very close. <br /> <br /> It has a lot of 'think' of the rhythmic style. Excellent use of music. It sometimes takes the upper part of the pictures and you feel its power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20 Minutes ???) is a breathtaking visual experience as it painted. <br /> <br /> It's really easy for you when it's set in a very small party with a big party ... it's very hard to shoot. It has been going on for years already in poor times of Flemish filmmaking. Made my day!
