When I was released on a theater in Palo Alto, I would recall this thing and did not expect much. I mean - an Australian movie but finally came to me. Here is a scene. Richard Chamberlain is facing an Australian Aboriginal named Charlie, sitting on a crossroads in a shabby apartment in Sydney. <br /> Chamberlain: "You were outside my house last night, are you scared of my wife?" Who are you? Who are you Who are you Who are you Who are you Are you a fish Are you a snake? Are you a man? Who are you Who are you Who are you "This is a spectacular scene with Chamberlain's beautifully beautiful face filling the screen against the dark, wide-nose, bearded scene of Chabberin. <br /> <br /> The two guys are not different, but the Chamberlain is different, <br /> <br /> The story of Chamberlain's untruthfulness in the mysteries is unlikely to ignore the existence of his lawyer. I do not think it's an apocalyptic story, but whoever has done research on Australian Aboriginal trusts is to get A plus? The most horrific film without stitches or fantastic special effects <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> ? Do the Aborigines? Is Sydney full? Although it is a phantasy, the basic mantle is a little difficult to approve. American citizens have invested abortions with the spiritual power of American Indians, but myth is mythology and a complex or satisfying - more elegant and beautiful, if you wish - mythology is still an attempt to overcome a common, demanding and sometimes frustrating physical presence. <br /> <br /> Charlie's mystic theory further cemented the miracles of Moses in Cecil B. DeMille's "The Ten Commandments", but they are brothers under the skin. <br /> But I do not care about it. The film, which is a film, is very good, and it is important that the director, Peter Weir, and Australian film personalities are prominent. This is the first of the greatest films from some painful pictures, such as "Matta Max", and subtle and dramatic, such as "Lanta". I like the Veer's stuff that looks like I'm pregnant with Nicolas Rogue's enthusiastic fear. Try "picnic on the hanging rack" for an example of how to make really cool with a drop of blood.
