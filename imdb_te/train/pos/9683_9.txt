Spoiler is a great movie about a conversation. He goes through a lot of fire testing to get back his little girl's owner. He learns a lot on his journey and most beautiful birds meet up. If you love birds like my wife, this picture is for you. The film also contains some tragic pieces of tears. Eventually it serves Polly and his Russian friend. It's renting the whole family and everyone is enjoying it.
