When the Paris Burning came, I completely deleted it. I am not a whole Madonna and a conversation phenomenon. I thought it was campy and crazy. How did I make a mistake about this film? After the film was over for ten years, I saw it and I ran out and bought it. It's time and place of amusing and excitement took me back. I felt myself personally familiar with the characters. The 80s were excellent and the film captured the essence of gay culture. What an amazing job! I went to the internet and the original actors found out what I was doing now, but I could not find them all. Please let me know if any of the members of any pornography have any information. <br /> I hope they do another documentary. I liked it
