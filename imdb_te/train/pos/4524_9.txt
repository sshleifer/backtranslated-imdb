It is a very rare example of an image about transstatism (of heterosexual sexes). The film treats the taboo theme, and the general audience sympathizes with its main character, even if not aware of transstatsism. Adrian Poddar is very believable as Gerald / Geraldin and should not forget for this amazing performance. Christopher Mugger's direction is very sensitive, such a complicated issue is poorly packed into a good story. A big picture, an "art" movie, but a little bit, a lovely movie!
