Recently I saw this film for Jake's recent success with Brookbaugh Mountain. I have found that I watch movies that are missing. The film has no expectations, so I lost this movie. It's a gripping father and son story, and it's also an underdog story. I watched the end of this amazing story. This film appeals to all ages. I gave it 10 out of 9 because it gets a bit lower in the middle, but it's ultimately strong. The performance is amazing, the story is amazing and the cinematography is attractive to the setting of the film. Watch this movie! Rent it, buy, see, love it! I know I know!
