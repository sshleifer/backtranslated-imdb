The film is gorgeous. It's true and down to heart, but at the same time is absolutely crazy. The characters are so easy to fall in love, because they have many different minds, but at least one of us can refer to each other. In Canada, we do not have many movies from Eastern Europe, and for the few people I've seen, the Lonares are the best. It's very funny, and magic. If you want to see something new and refreshing, go see the Loners.
