When I was a child I could remember this movie, then I loved it and I will do it now. I have found it difficult to find it in the past because I managed to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday and was over happy and I was only renting as a child. My favorite character Charlie discovers that he is a good dog. The film is filled with fun songs and music. The animation is amazing and the character accents are perfect. This film has always been a tear to me but I think that if I'm a kid I still find that I still like it and I think it's not as clever and lovely as I can find it really into animated films.
