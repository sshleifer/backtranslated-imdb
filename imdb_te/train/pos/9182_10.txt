I love this version of those who love the book Jane Eyre (this is my favorite time, and I read it once a year). Timothy Dalton is looking good as Mr. Rochester, but instead, he does a great job of playing Thornfield's Brooding Master. Zelah Clarke may be at a very young age to play 18-year-old Jane, but when I see this film, I do not think about the age of the characters. The dialogue from the movie is taken almost verbatim from the book, which is very smart. Certainly, this image may seem a bit longer, but it's the only version I have in part 3 of the story. <br /> <br /> I saw this video featuring Judy Cornwell playing "Ant Reed". I was so versatile that I could not recognize her. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: It's awesome to see the original original editing version after making the DVD this week. I'm starting to feel more in the beginning (Gates Head and Young Jane in LoadHood) and lastly, they recovered a lot of things, why do I wondered why the St. Jack's paper slip? Because she is part of her painting from the US VHS version!). Rosamund Oliver was in it ... she was completely cut off from VHS. As long as I told them they could not edit any parts of Timothy Dalton, there was nothing new, but it was nice to see all the ministers in these years of enjoying VHS. Thank you, the BBC (PS ... I would have paid more for a special edition DVD ... maybe interviewing with some stars ... or making of the show)
