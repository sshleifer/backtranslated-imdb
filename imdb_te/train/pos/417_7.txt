The film is accompanied by Wild Bill Hickkock, Calamita Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Caster. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays the role of the Colinist Jane, and Charles Bickford plays the bad guy who sells weapons to Indians and you can not recognize him. The first time that Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together, and the other was primarily set at the same time but at a different time. The film starts with the murder of Lincoln and it also deals with an Indian war. Jane is in love with the Wild Bill and he is married to Buffalo Bill and wants to stay home now. The film also deals with the last stand of Custer and is quite accurate. Gary Cooper is as good as ever and I generally do not like Jean Arthur but I liked her.
