In my life, why did the film get an R rating?! If it's about meat-eating zombies, believe it or not, it's actually a pretty good family-friendly picture - at least if your kids are ages 10 and older. Unlike traditional zombie movies, this is a fantastic sense of humor as well as a traditional sense - though a bit twisted! The language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards the kids (like the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana") - yet some fists scored an R rating! I believe that many children are watching this horrible violence and I think it's only a movie for the audience. <br /> The story is set in a parallel-type world. Fashions, cars and armor appear by 1953, but in this extravagant world there is a fierce recent zombie plague that can lead to "zombie war" and major changes in daily life. In school, children are trained in armed conflict and the father has a beautiful scene at the end of his son's hand and tells him to keep "in this case" in his backpack! For people living outside of life, it is now pretty weird, the people now learned that zombies are not a bad thing! Heck using your shock bandages and trainer, your housework, clean streets, milk supply or your special friend in the case of a really sick person. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film deals with a special family of their first zombie slave (played by Billy Canally). Mom was thrilled and her son would slowly become a friend of the zombie. Dad, on the other hand, is not convinced - he got early years to kill his own zombie dad and he has not yet gotten over this! Funny, abusive and unique - this film is necessary to be seen by a more wider audience.
