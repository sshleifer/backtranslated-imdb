Great image - I liked it. Soundtrack's great editing and use. It captures the true sense of Indian life, but we can all say it. Well the great characters chose some cast. The picture develops all the characters so you feel true about them and you feel like you know them. Some of the soccer scenes are great for the use of Indian music and drums and the direction really works as everyone comes as real and natural. You can not root for Jess in this movie! Acting is really good, and walks and body postures with two prominent women's friends are very convinced that they are a very sociable person.
