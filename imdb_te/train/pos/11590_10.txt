Oh, in the sixties. There are some interesting pictures. By then I was a film director. I enjoy rental movies now and relaxing in my home rather than going to the theater. I saw this little film, "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I'm looking for this movie for years. It's really inspirational. Surprisingly, I finally managed to gather more information from your site. Thanks ........ I was surprised to learn that this short film is an opening for a Disney movie. I do not remember a lot of Disney movie. I did not even remember that it was an early film for Disney. I really show this on TV. Am I surprised if the film has rights to Dave? Available on DVD? This must be seen for all generations !!!
