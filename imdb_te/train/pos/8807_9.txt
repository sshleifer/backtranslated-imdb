It is the last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame documentaries from artists around the world. Documentaries are diverse and deal with all kinds of things, only one thing (9/11) is a background (sometimes quite small). Some segments are weak, others are very strong; Some politicians, some not; Some people are just about 9/11, and some use just 9/11 as universally touching human feelings, emotions and tragedies; Some are important, others are abstract and artistic). <br /> This is a very controversial film, especially for traditional Americans, that the film does not censor anyone. I think these two divisions are really coming back from Egypt as a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber spirit; 50,000 deaths and terrible atrocities from the UK, which ignored Chile's US-backward regime on September 11, 1973). <br /> <br /> This section is the most powerful from Mexico, the death of the towers and the death of the dead to die (you should see it to be believed). <br /> <br /> The final product is unequal, although some sections are almost "meaning", I still recommend this. The film is very difficult to find, because parts differ from all (some are weak, some are very powerful). Some segments are generally rated 10 to 9 because of the excellent and covered issues that are usually sensed (Mexico Segment, UK Segment, Japan Segment, Egypt Segment).
