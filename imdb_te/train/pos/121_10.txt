Critics need to review any class as a quality film. I have seen many acts of critics and have come to the movies in the Matrix style. Europa breathes fresh air, it is not enough to understand or appreciate this fantastic picture of a film with a lot of layers. The older styles of Lords Van Tire filming showcase a fantastic movie and shows that drama and tension can be built. The back-projection effect he uses in this film increases the characters and increases the attention of the conversation they have. In a scene like Hitchcock he uses other effects such as color and black and white and attracts the attention of the girl with a red coat and increases the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is amazing and has a hypnotic effect, focusing on the central characters in the scene again and there are actions. <br /> <br /> I want to talk about the effects but they think you will agree with it. The film belongs to one of its categories and really increases the movie's play. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this artistic Nair movie with one of the 10/10 great film directors.
