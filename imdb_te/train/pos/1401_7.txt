Well, we've got plenty of sex and nudity, but we do not have something to do with serious Verhoeven violence (other than Verhoeven Flicks) ... Oh, yes, it's not intelligence known as Paul Verhoeven for his sci-fi movies. I have introduced Vershiv's characters and they have a sense of humor, but not many Verhoeven films, the film does not have enough humor to fall into humorous literature. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is not a good movie, not a cast or a character, but a fantastic special effects task. The crew actually created an invisible man without the use of piano wires and floating caps suspended by other practical effects (effects on the set). While Kevin Bacon is missing, there are not many amazing effects, while Kevin Bacon is missing and visible. <br /> The meaning of this disappearing man is more imaginable. Here, it is done in the laboratory for the most part. I enjoyed watching Kevin Bacon's bank that was missing and staying away with it, or stole something from people's purses, something like that. But Hollow Man is shown to be good enough to make an entertaining film. Grade: B
