The film was much better than average action cinema and they succeeded. This film has wonderful cinematography featuring excellent mountain ice and heights, which is a very nice stallone as well as a spectacular show, exciting plot and great from the main villain becouse he really shocks you with his bad ways. The film is very weak screen play.The plot and Stollen make an extra special human cries story for this film is not to rank great becouse of all time Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie characters. They chose Stallone's character in this regard as human, but by examining the style of the plot, weaken the enthusiasm. Conversations have been cheesy and negligent at times. Realistic and less "talkies". Another weak point is the unreal shooting scenes. Motion picture makers should be more cautious about how they are shooting hits and misses. Scenes of shooting scenes during hijacking of flight at the beginning of the film. Instead, the villains decided to put a lot of water on the shooting sequence (so the "A-Team" TV series) as soon as the running. Mountain Tops.This film has great potential at all times. Chrisper action sequences, improved dialogue, and rambo / rocky style emotion / decision from Stalin brought the film to a higher level. I know this is not Stalin's fault. Cine director wanted to reduce Stalin's role and was trying to steal the film by taking credit for his direction, which was not great for his cinematographer.
