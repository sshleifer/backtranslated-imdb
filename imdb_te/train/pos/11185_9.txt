Since it's one of the most favorite novels, I'm very happy to see this move. I'm not disappointed! Yes yes, there are some things I choose, but I think this movie is real for the book, and this is a good movie. It seems to have been a bad review for Stephen King films, but it is one of the best. It's a dark story, I think this is why I love it and life is much better than the return of the dead. If you see this film you can make it a big deal and read the book now !! It's a well written screen play, actors might have done a good job (I only tell this for Rachel, and Ellie .. she is so whinny) I liked everyone so much .. and it's very important for me .. it's hard with novel.
