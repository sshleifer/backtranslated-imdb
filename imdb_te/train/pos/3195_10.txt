BEAVER TRILOGYY is one of the most amazing films ever made, without a doubt. A few years ago I was fortunate enough to catch a Q & A session with director Trent Harris at the NY Video Festival and later bought a copy of the Trent website. Let's see this movie that is believed! I sincerely recommend that I search for Trent name on the web and buy this picture from her site. He is the most amazing person to boot. Do not get confused: Cameraman is not Trent in the fictional sections of BEAVER TRILOGYY! <br /> <br /> Sometimes after watching TRILOGY, I have to confess that I probably can not do without a pen version. This is like a try-out version of the "Archie Kid" section of Crispin Glover, and it's interesting as a pen fan, rather than a good video. Pen is pretty funny, though, you can see a bigger actor in this gritty B & W video. <br /> <br /> It's probably one of the best characters of Crispin Glover and I like to see an update on the original Groovine Gary documentary. Once you watch this movie, Gary's nervous laughter never comes from your head.
