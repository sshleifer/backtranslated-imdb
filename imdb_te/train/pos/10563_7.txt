Wow ... what ... a tornado. Of the 30's, I've had plenty of movies for every type of imagination, especially in the early Talks stage. There are painful, quiet and drowsy movies such as "Dracula", and sometimes it's a good rest and sometimes not at other times. This is one of the longest surviving movies, and it is awesome and compelling. Lloyd Bacon, directed by "42nd Street", was the king of the Depression Era music and he was amazed by the sounds of the possibilities of bringing the film to the world, You can not have a full minute or two without music or anyone who speaks. It's absolutely silly! I think it's appropriate for 5 (or a 6, tops) because I have a lot of film because it's fast and I do not know what's going on and what's going on sometimes. The characters seemed to be walking just and running places, just talking about me and perhaps no one unpleasant things. I thought I would just be rewarded with a little headache. I saw that Lloyd Bacon played a major role in "42nd Street", Ruby Keeler, and "42nd Street", which is the best of all. And what do you know? This is the same thing with "footwear parade"! The end is totally amazing! It turned out, hands down, the most fascinating musical I've ever seen. The last part gives us some musical numbers and that, believe me, something that the rest of the film can see. The numbers are blameless! There are three big bits and the second is the most impressive. Suddenly the screen is packed with beautiful and inventive camera work, plain entertainment that made beautiful people forget my little headache.
