I totally agree that "Nothing" is a fantastic picture! I did not laughed too much while watching a movie for the ages! And David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are amazing in this! They work really well together! <br /> <br /> The director is very good and some of the shots are very intuitive. <br /> <br /> If there are only 2 characters in the picture and there is not much terrible evidence , The actors can remove it and watch the film enjoy.
