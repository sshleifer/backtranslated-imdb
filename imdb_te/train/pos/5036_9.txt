Bill Paxton, for the first time, is my first wondrous director, near Aliens, Dark, and Terminator Fame, Felity Director. He hit all cylinders, but eventually there was a confusion, which included the FBI Agent (Powers Booth), which was removed from the thrill and the thought-provoking thriller. Besides, this film is good. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays father. He did not give the first name, but it was not the film's weakness. In fact it supports the film, allowing the viewer to see him as some kind of symbol. He had a vision for a day when he and his two sons, Fenton Meeks (Matt Olliari) and Adam Myix (Jeremy Saver), told the demons that they were ending the world and that demons were to be executed. Demons appear to be the common people they kill, and if Dad just lost his mind or surprised the viewer if he was really doing God's work. There are scenes reflecting the two points that are in line with the confusion and the film will give more suspense. </ P> <p> The story's stories now grow (Matthew McCoahaye) with the FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Booth) very suspicious and exactly the same way. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of twists and has led Bill Bruceston in an amazing way by guessing us without losing interest. Acting is amazing. Two young leaders and Paxton work together, even though they are involved in the murder, as a normal family. I have a dissatisfaction with the role of Powers Booth, but this is not really a big thing. This is a very good picture of faith and family.
