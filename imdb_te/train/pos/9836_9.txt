Even though it's not as creepy as the Cult classic predecessor (ZOMBI 2) I actually like this one good. It is because of the fast pace, good settings and the soundtrack of the cool 80s. It is loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by Lucio Fulzi. Zombies do not look as nasty as in ZOMBI 2 but they still look good. It was made beautifully but it certainly had a stake in the stock; For example some zombies really move slowly when others are as quick as ninjas. Some people are funny when others say funny lines, but are they in line with Italy's horror? There is also a flying zombie head! How about rod? Must definitely look for a gorehounds and zombie fans. It's probably a lot of fans of action fans as well. Also check out the Zombie 4.
