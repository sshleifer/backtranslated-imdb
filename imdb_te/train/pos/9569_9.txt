I mean, Chinese Hong Kong, after the infamous cat captured. Hong Kong movie genres have disappeared. At least so far, and this is what a wonderful picture. I'm going to know a rough crime play, but the first cat. <br /> I recently made it, I do not know what I expected. <br /> <br /> A Cambodian hitman,. , Judge Judge has arranged for the hitman for divorce, threatening to take all his money. It is called in the first ten minutes, so nothing is being given away. After the hit, the Cops spotted the hitman pretty fast, but when trying to arrest him, several police officers and civilians were killed. He reveals the police and is now in the race to catch him before he can escape back to Cambodia. This is a movie that never stops, and gives the audience an opportunity to catch their breath. Yes, it's very violent and intense, so many police are killed because Hitman has proved very difficult to track and take down when they find him. Also, Hitman, who is trying to hide in a dump, finds a woman raped and abused. He helps her and spends herself up, and persuades Hitman to accompany her along when she escapes. I like this movie, like a roller-coaster, with an event leading to another, moving at high speeds and moving, and sometimes the police are as bad or worse as Hitman. Acting is exceptionally good, and location shooting and photography time is breathtaking. There is nothing in this film, not even with an amazing ending. The ending is pretty much unbelievable, and a fitting end to all the action and violence. Yes, violence is cruel at times, but it is a very unnatural crime play that can sink your socks. "Dog Eat Dog" definitely requires more extensive release including an R1 release. Great image, highly recommended.
