I remembered this movie since the age of 12, it's great .. I remember the day I did not see much of what I see again, I tried to buy it but its rocking horse sh * t! Anyhow, acting is a bit grumpy but the story is amazing to consider a true B movie that has been fantastic to see it low budget and event combat scenarios, I should have watched about 20 times. It was a well-made film and I liked the idea of ​​giant man-controlled robots that they had to spoil a creep from "crash and burn", which was the whole pants! If you see your true size-up movie fan then it will be a winner if you make it today .. I really want to see a remake or release its DVD.
