Meryl Streep is a genius. Well, at least one actress. I know that most of the accents made fun for doing roles, but her accent nails every time. Her acting as Lyndy Chamberlain is a source of inspiration. Mrs. Chamberlain, who portrayed here, is not particularly fond of, or better. But it does make Strip's work more awesome. I think she is worthy of 10 Oscar nominations. About the film, as well, there are some interesting things. I do not know much about Australia, but the topic of religious superstition has played a big role in the general public. I first saw this film a few years ago, but this has been clearly and evident ever since. And the Australian press seems to be achieved at the pursuit of overtures and overkill just like their American colleagues. Pretty good picture. A bit different. Grade: B
