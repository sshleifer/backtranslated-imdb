First say that the director has some amazing uses of titles in his establishment shots. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this movie but I got to say next to Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinar is pretty poor. Brosnan is very well in this role, it's really hard to remember that this is the same person. It shows his range and depth as an actor. It's great for an indie film and flooding movies at this time of the year is mainly good to watch all of the movies. I have found that the characters are well made. The twist in the middle of what I think is particularly good. I really liked the characters how come it was. Many times we have really the characters but the pictures in the film that are not walking-stereotypes are in the picture ... I love the different ways of taking this picture. I feel sideways when I think of this film, but I think this is a whole lot more and better movie ...
