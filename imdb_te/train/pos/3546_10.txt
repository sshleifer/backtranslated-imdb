One of the best music stories ever made, producers and directors are not afraid to pick actors for their talents rather than to expect people. The lighting and set are unique, which gives a very interesting effect (this particular name is not cared for me). The dialogue is unique in that the contraction is not used. The film was very well displayed, beautifully played and finished. The real pleasure is MUSIC. The first-stage song series, from the beginning to the end, is displayed perfectly and managed. Also, the music is very original and very memorable, and I think it's superior to many music from the sixties to thirties. It has a lot more original and beautiful songs than most musicals, which may have only two or three. In this kind of film, the director who is not experienced is not bad. Another quality is fresh every time.
