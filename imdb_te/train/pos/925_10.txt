One word: suPURRRRb! I do not think I have seen anything in the network or cable television for so long. Watching this show is a breath of fresh air between a TV schedules filled with reality shows and a boring re-run. <br /> I have my reservation. For all, critics are almost unanimous in crying foul and reducing performance. But over half an hour (by the way, NBC, running for the commercial-free show), I love the first glance, leaving with the feeling of instant love, feels in his guts, true love. <br /> The graphics in this show are very good for finding Nemo and Shrek. Not taking into consideration those movies is not small. <br /> The cast is fantastic. I'm partial to John Goodman's voice, but the rest team is exactly equal to John. Special mention: Guest role of Lisa Kudrow. She has a Jewish streak on the game created by a nursing, fist, and friendly panda. (From Brooklyn to Panda? <br /> <br /> The script is very sharp, inward and adult jokes is very sharp and not ineffective One note for all parents: This is not for children, and this show has never been promoted and it's 9PM The reason for setting is not 8PM, so if you want to complain about the "objectionable context", save your breath. It's Rick's comedy, and it's the father of pride. <br /> <br /> I'm gonna be a stereotype when it comes to them. Yes, they speak German tunes But yesterday's news Give us something new, something fresh, something funny. Nga wrong approach. I have these guys on this show, the creators of the "star power" and wanted to use it. It is good for me. But please everyone already knows by heart. Hopefully, over and over the rest of the show is not going to play the old record. <br /> <br /> In general, the show must necessarily be-TV. Funny, witty, some unexpected twists here and there - this comedy from Seinfeld is not good. I'm definitely looking forward to the next episode.
