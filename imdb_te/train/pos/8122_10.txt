I never saw this movie until I bought the tape last year. I got entangled and entertained. This includes a full-length story in a book or all the things I love about the screen. <br /> <br /> The 1936 view of the 'Future Future' of the 60th and 70th is very exciting and fun to watch. <br /> I must see, and for science-fires alone.
