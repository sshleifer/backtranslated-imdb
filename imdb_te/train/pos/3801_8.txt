It is a CGI animated film based on a French 2D animated series. The series was briefly featured on Cartoon Network, but this year included one of the best Oscar nominees for the best animated film, for most people I had a lot of "huh?" This is the dog with the lion-chu, eye heart muscle tale, gujodo, in the brain's brains, burning their fire dragon along with Hector. Dragon hunters travel the world that offers their services but can not be paid. In their lives Joe goes blind, and comes up with a king's niece fairy tale. It appears to have swallowed all the kings who did not send a huge monster and world rulers, or they would return as the Ashes if they returned. In desperation the king hires dragon hunters to stop the world eater. <br /> Who is this movie under the cover of a rock? This is a good little movie that radar is completely outside except for an Oscar contestant. Its beautifully designed, awesome looking film (which floats in the world and the crazy creatures) constantly goes to me "Wow". The first rate of English voice cast with Forest Whitaker, called Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal shows I have ever heard) and Rob Paulson (think Steve Buscemi). At the same time, there is a script that does not speak to its audience, except in the animated films (not Disney or Pixar), which usually does not use some real expressions. Its all worked well. <br /> Is this perfect? No, some bits will go a long way, but at the same time it's fun. <br /> If you get an opportunity, see it. It was one of the best animated films since 2008, and in my surprising list of 2009.
