Diodeo makes us a little shocking moments and does not take a film too seriously. It's definitely a classic way of a classic way. The film offers a different look in reflections in the barbarians. If you have a chance to watch this movie. You definitely have more smile on your face. It's not as funny or anything like that because it's great because it's the other way to go out, be nice, but not clean, not fun.
