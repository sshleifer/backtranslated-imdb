Sure, the Titanic is a good movie, it's the first time you're looking for, but you have to watch it for a second time and your view of the film will definitely change. For the first time you will see the underlying love story in the film and think: Oh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one to think about this) it's just annoying and you're sitting there watching the movie idea, this d ** n going to sink the ship ??? It's not as impressive as you see it many times. It's not bad to act in this movie, but it's definitely not great either. I was glad that DiCaprio did not win an Oscar for the film, who would he think was Antony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He makes 1 half good film and does not make a film that is less than $ 20 million. And then everyone has no movies with him. But enough, in my view, the worst character of the film. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand is amazing. The director is very talented and I am trying to make a picture of such a size. There is a lesson to learn about this film: There are so many love stories, filmmakers should not add a black love to each picture !!! In the 100% possible, I gave 71% of the film.
