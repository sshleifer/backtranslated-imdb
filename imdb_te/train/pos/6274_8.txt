I saw this movie with a night of friends. I can not hear much about it. I do not expect anything. But after I saw it, I really liked it. Nicholas Cage and the rest of the cast are good. But I have to say Giovanni does not need a little perking performance of RBC's performance. But such a small mistake, it can be replaced. <br /> <br /> A retired car thief in 60 seconds has to raise rare and exotic cars in a night to save his brother's life. The picture is unthinkable. So the end should be a suprise. Do you think this is another, fast car driving movie? Well you are partially right. It's too much. Everyone should take a look at this picture.
