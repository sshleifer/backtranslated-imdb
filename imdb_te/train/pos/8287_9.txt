Kim (Patricia Clarkson), George (Jake Webber) and son Miles (Eric Per Sullivan) go to the country to relieve the winter weekend from Manhattan's bustling metropolis. On the way, they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow. A group of hunter-gatherers come to the buck. Odes (John Sprudecos) did not help at least one of the hunters, but that tragedy killed the horns of Buck. George, Kim and Miles are chopped by Otis, and even worse, Otis will find out where they are. Meanwhile, Miles gave an Indian who had seen a silverie (a type of Indian shape-transferred soul / monster) token. Otis is psychology to get our heroes? Are there wendigos in the woods? <br /> <br /> Where do I see many problems that Wendigo is attractive to the audience? It is often shown by a low budget film, technical limitations. The picture is not too much, and probably all, really nameless creature. For many people it's probably a deadly blow, it has a very vague end, and there are no answers to many questions. If such conclusions are disappointing and you do not like images of what you think and think about what you think, be sure you have a favor and a try. Personally I like movies. I usually prefer some vague. Wendigo 2: Monster Returns, but this is not what people want for a quick and scary flick, as Wendigo's expecting a great fight with some supernatural giants losing at the end of marketing. Wendigo is very thoughtful and poetic than that of the creature of such a creature represents more people on the surface. Heck, the author / director Larry Fessenden, also played the role of George, Robert Frost. <br /> <br /> George comments that the Frost poem, and the frost crisp imagery and the atmosphere, can be triggered by seemingly seemingly important, key to the film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about the film is the complexity. In a way, there are four different motion pictures that occur simultaneously, with a thread from each character. In George's thread, he is not exactly the happiest or most pleasant person in the world, and he has some parenting problems. For him, the film is a realistic, horrific genre, his life is tedious. In the Patricia thread, she is looking for her life and family to rebuild. She is a psychologist who refuses most of her problems, and they go away and get better. In Otis Thread, he is more than his luck than George, who comes to George in his life refers to the last "fracture" in his mental armor. And it is a very important film in the Miles thread, life is a great book because of his youthful innocence and world commentary. But this is the horror story, after all, the glitter of hope, the events of the film Miles poetry explanations give a dark twist. However, when everything is done and done, he seems to retain his memory with a poetic perspective. <br /> <br /> Even though the film is a low-budget, well-implemented high budget targets. Fessenden and photography director Terry Stacey found some great shots in beautiful places, and some interesting slide shows such as Montezage (such as cards, or Indian silver images in the book) were created. There are also interesting traditional mats like Miles nightmare. <br /> <br /> Other technologies are good in the budget. Eventually, the "silverie" performance worked for me and was clearly unclear. Lighting is generally good - sometimes dark scenes are not clear, but it seems to be a problem with the film stock (which may be digitally) or transferred. I think the performances are better and more realistic than most movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, Wendigo is a good movie that tells you to watch without a good movie, preconceptions. , Spend time without thinking about movies you watch.
