This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. I viewed it on DVD, and the disk does not have any special features or menu, but I do not have to worry. <br /> <br /> When I was a big studio production or small film, I would judge on films based on the case, among other things. It's a small movie and I like to apologize for the little things. <br /> <br /> I believe this is one of the most imaginative and original title sequences I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed all the major players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has the most ridiculous lines. The role played by Claire Fours is unrealistic for some, but when she plays the role, I personally realized the real people with emotional issues that make decisions in life. <br /> <br /> It can bring her through the layers of humor. <br /> <br /> This is not clearly a movie in children, but it does not involve inappropriate sexual and nudity. Although the adult language is quite a bit, it can sometimes be very funny. (Particularly, Alan Arkin's character, who can not exactly make the oath.) <br /> <br /> See also the characters that came from known roles.
