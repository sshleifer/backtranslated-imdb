<br /> <br /> The film shows a borderline - on the one hand, those who love others, find those who can not afford. <br /> <br /> Initially, there was a lot of humor in the film, but not many viewers were "getting". Of course the jet lis mask looks like Bruce Lee's Kato - a joke which he is supposed to. A time-bombed man who was stabbed to his heart - the worst? Of course, this is a joke! Would some readers think this movie is so funny? Well, violence for one thing is tolerance to this level is actually different, from culture to culture; <br /> <br /> The Hong Kong audience will seriously recognize the violence, which is slightly more than average for an HK action movie. <br /> <br /> Along the way, the Black Mask is a gathering of genres, broadening them because the meetings are not completely unrealistic. Many people have been afraid to see Bonnie and Clyde, and the bandits of the Wild Bunch will spill blood in this place, as people have been shot dead for noticeable decades. But in fact, when you are painted with fast metal cleansing, the blood is almost perfectly cooled out of the artery. <br /> <br /> The film is a Chinese comic book movie. Spiderman movies are never available to this ghre - but in fact they are confident, they are! Despite its comic-book origins, the film is confident of reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is, elegant, exaggerated filming and compilation. If the film was shot by the producers for the Hollywood-style nostalgia (for example, The Ractor, or the recently Sky Captain film), I suspect it was dangerous. But when it stands up, I still have a lotto fun watching this movie.
