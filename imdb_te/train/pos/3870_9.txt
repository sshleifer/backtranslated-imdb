It's very slow, like a paid attention in a novel, and a novel, as the movie "IS" is very thick, reveals very slowly, a very dense, stupid and complicated film. Although I did not pay attention to the hero, he was out of balance with the rest of the show, the film has some of the best ensemble acting I have seen and the main fees, Senior Phoenix, is amazing. Her innocence and some innocents were imposed on a cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. <br /> <br /> This film is beautiful and unbelievable, and it is very unique about Eric Gatorier. This movie does not show you anytime you do not anticipate. It is always surprising, and despite the length of it, the film never reveals more than it needs. In 163 minutes, it's a mistake in the miracles of the film, I said. It's just wonderful, some amazing, brief moments you're likely to see all year and these moments add up to the end of an extraordinary image experience. Family moments are exclusive, Ian Holm looks good, and Coswettes does not see the movie about the theater from the film "Opening Night" or perhaps Chaplin's "Limitless" films. But, whether it is believed or not, this film is very "less" traditional. I never knew where the film would go, as it has now seen, it still has a lot of possibilities. It's a powerful, very provocative film.
