I did not set too high expectations for this film, which surprised me. The story is sometimes a little strange, but overall it has the credible credibility. Action sequences are good and are used to induce a bit of patriotic feelings of US music. It may not be the best film but it's unusual for Sweden and I want to see more similarities in the future.
