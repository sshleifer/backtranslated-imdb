Carlof and Lugosi - once again together! This is one of the most popular movies of casual fans. It was not the duo's previous two hits, the all-in-horror movie like The Black Cat and The Raven. <br /> <br /> The director, directed by Lambert Hillyir, who directed Invictible Ray, was mainly directed to Western countries, but in the last days of the Laemmles 'reign at Universal, he found this and Laemmles' final horror film, the daughter of Dracula's daughter. <br /> <br /> The two are lightweight crisp, clean-cut fantasies in horror on the marvelous elements. <br /> <br /> As you go wild in the lagoasi the Raven, the Invisible Raylo Carloff's Hammim should say more. One factor of the unsatisfactory story is that the carloaf character, Ruq, is very crazy before he is poisoned by Radium X. It is very similar to complaining that people are about Jack Nicholson in The Shining - he is basically a fool from the beginning. There is no real change. Here it is. Halfway through Carlofe has the added benefit of revenge in his mind. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lugosi surprised you and gave a careful and diligent turn as Rug's opponent in the scientist. , Dr. Benet. Lukasi also has some of the best lines in the film, in which I am with the horror film writer John Soster - "Who was he (Rehq) who touched?" Inspector will be investigated. Lugosi replies hesitatingly, only as Lugosi deliver, "they die". Just as Lugosi could not do so, he could also be more accurate than any actor. <br /> <br /> Carlowf and Lugosi's interactions are great because Carlof's mad criticism has been sharpened on logosy's cool reasoning. Carlofe went on to play the same mad scientists several times, though Lagucci likes more of his favorite characters. <br /> <br /> Invisible Ray is a fun movie, and a real treat for true Karlov and Lugosi fans. It's not a masterpiece, but it's one of the stars' glamor and talent and how this story fills darker, more horrific characters because it's a masterpiece. Always fit with special effects, fantastic and supporting actors by the new John Fulton. Frances Drake appeared beautifully in her Mad Love and starred as a strong woman, rarely seen in classic horror films. At the end of the scene Karlofe was protecting her, she did not laugh out loud, one of the most horrific moments in the film. An amazing, fun movie!
