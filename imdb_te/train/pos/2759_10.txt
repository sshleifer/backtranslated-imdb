I am in tears in my eyes when watching the movie. I really cried and was only once when I saw this movie. This film has a few kicks but I do not really care. When I wrote this I cried and I had some time to see that. It works perfectly and all the product values ​​are good, but really simple and wonderful message for things. We know this in our hearts, but the important thing in life is that it is not always easy to remember only the love of all its forms. Only when we love that we are really alive. I promise how I will sound the sentiment and I'm usually not like that. I'm very cynic. The film has brought me strong feelings of both sadness and pleasure than any other movie, and this is the first film I always recommend watching.
