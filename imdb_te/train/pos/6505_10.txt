<br /> <br /> Theo Robertson commented that WAW did not adequately cover Hitler's growth and WWII after WWI. <br /> Does he lose the first ONE and the Quarter HOURS Volume 8? This period and the previous volumes in the series will show the current conditions clearly, I think. During this period in Germany my friend grew up in a friend, Hitler joined youth and his experiences were very similar to what WAW said. <br /> Channel's documentaries in this documentary history <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> How much is Russia and Britain? How many merchant ships, and how many German and Japanese navy have all the ships in 1941 when the U-boats are drowning? Naturally, I would like to see more military analysis, when the German army at Cannesi pattled out and did not let Mottt run to Rome, but after it was placed around it, , That's it to escape I do not think you can begin to understand the war until you see some of these video sections in "Total War", such as Dresen's fire bomb. <br /> You seem to be trying to understand Auschwitz before you see death camps: You can not close your head - it's very unbelievable. <br /> At the time of the unknown and some of the most terrible cruelty and innocence of Japan, cannibalism, (read the "flybyos") and medical "experiments" are some live diversities of prisoners! <br /> Dave
