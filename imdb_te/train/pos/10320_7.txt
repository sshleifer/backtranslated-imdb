<br /> <br /> My 11-year-old son recently saw this film and he was laughed in the right places and was surprised by the auction sequence. Ron Eli Dock is correct. Cool, calm, almost always in control (and with occasional Twinkle in his eye). Can anyone ask? I never read the Doc Savage book, so I do not know if it's the source of the source, but I enjoyed the light tone and dering-do. Many people of Lord Ark's rides compare this picture, and I do not think it's good. Fear of budget difference (riders must have at least 10 times budget). Doctor does not work on an extensive position that includes savage riders. Special effects also come on people but the story is very fun and humor is right. Social music appears (every time I see this song, I end up hamming the theme for days). The best way to approach this movie is to just have RELAX and enjoy. The superb five and the dock of New York's rooftops and a very funny fight between Doc and Captain Sees have an excellent series of haunting Indian snipers across the sequence. The villain sleeping in a big manger (really!) Is not good. A great day to see a rainy day is a great picture. I give it to 10 to 7. <br /> <br /> Doctor Savage, Dock Savage ... Thanks to the Lord who is here!
