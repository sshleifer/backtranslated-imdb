A Disney movie daring to do something else is given for at least effort. "Holes" is a bug that no one has ever guessed from a Disney movie about troubled youths. Events of the first time did not explain. Flash backlit scenes are really a benefit and there are many mature things that can surprise the viewer. First, I must admit that I had put up a bit with the intensity of the film. But we had to face that situation soon to see the beauty of those movements. Along with the story, it is good to question some of the methods of correcting the film. (Caveman is prohibited to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes to build a character to play the role of learning to read). "Holes" is a smart and beautiful image. Must see!
