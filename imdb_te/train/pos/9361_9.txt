Over me (who was named after the song) is almost exactly a picture to bring a tear to almost everyone's eye. This is a moving story of a lost man (Sandler) in the 9-11 World Trade Center attacks. A few years later, he goes into the old college roommate (Chelley), and he can not even find a post-dramatic pressure because of his family loss. <br /> <br /> Both of their old friendship and the role of Cheadle, Johnson, finds that he wants to get Finnman, the character of Sandler, which has received some help before it's too late. Time. It is absolutely worth watching and after seeing it, I'm positive that the viewer appreciates most of his or her family.
