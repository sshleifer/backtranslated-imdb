Main spoiler !! <br /> <br /> In this film the commentators touch the main theme of "honor" and have many similarities to "Braveheart". <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film has a definitive diversity of abortion. The first character to get pregnant is the villain's (Roth) girlfriend, and when she coolly suggests an abortion, she says it's too late. The shame of her condition ("I have Bastard's bastard.") She will suicide in the very next scene. The second character, Mary, Rob Wife, is Roth's role (at least one sex scene with her husband, Rob) after being raped. As Rob is coming for a final confrontation with Roth, Late, Mary's questioning sources asked her what to do about abortion, a tone of abortion. Rob replies in a noble tone, "It's not a child's fault," and he says what he's saying, whether it's a girl or a boy. I find this "positive life" attitude as part of the hero that is quite Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Roth's character is a bastard and another related theme that someone does not know who his father is. , And there are some kind words for his mother, but she wore a picture of her on the one hand he hung from her neck. Roth (family stability) is the walking definition of mental illness, although Rob is a strong husband / father character and hero though it is coincidental. In the final sword fight between Rob and Villain (Roth), the former pieces are deeply deep across the chest - on the left side of the chest, on the heart. His master and fake father figure (John Hart's character) had a mother's picture and gage in his hand before it was pulled out of the dead Roth's neck. <br /> <br /> I'm interested in the rape scene direction, which is not very graphic but it's off-camera and not indicated. I have seen clearly the surprising facts, Mary is certainly the next post painful stress (as we are now calling), showing the character of a person who goes through a rough examination. <br /> My opinion is that I found rape killing or just suggesting that I found an interesting middle road to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In the last fighting scene, I have to correct the commentator before. Choosing a Rapper (or perhaps a short sword), Rob chose a clamor. Someone really is doing homework in this whole scene. Roth would have been in such a situation, but Claymore was clearly a Scottish weapon. I'm more closely (Fencer and a bit read on this subject) One of the most controversial in any film that does not have this final sword fight: the actors actually try to kill each other - the usual slashes of opponents' blades we see in most movie fights (including the film's opening battles) . More realistic to history, Roth is often used as a thrust weapon, which is designed by design! (Rappers are stuck, mainly a gun weapon with the edges of the main used to slap opponents.) Rob Kellmore is used in elaborate slashes, intended to design. Fight goes down as I hope - Roth succeeds effectively. Roth's weapon (more symbolism) captures him and kills him and rob him with a powerful mascot cut. <br /> <br /> Folks are rare to see this historical accuracy in the film sword fight. <br /> <br /> For any reason, I remember that in 1995 (the year of release) specifically to the US government, it is a disadvantage. Hollywood was apparently tuned with the release of both "Rob Roy" and "Braveheart", and I think the two films were very similar. <br /> <br /> I do not hide hidden messages from Hollywood, and I feel a different perspective on this film for older and more tired film fans.
