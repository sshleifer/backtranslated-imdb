A Chinese scholar who was harshly criticized by the proud, nationalist and warmest policies of ruling ministers around the Emperor in Japan before the war was a "communist" and a life imprisonment. His loving wife, who fully supports her husband and his thoughts, is left alone to protect her family from livestock. The film is a huge statue in the history of humanity in the history of humanity. Sayuri Yoshinaga is not less than amazing in the title role and she has a monumental scandal that did not get an Asian Oscar for best male role in 2009. It went to a little girl with a very limited acting potential. <br /> This deep-moving and very 'human' feature is a must see for 'true children' on earth.
