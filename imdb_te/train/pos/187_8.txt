Marion Davis starred in this amazing comedy "Show People", released in 1928 by MGM. Davis plays a comedy role from Savannah, who arrived in Hollywood with her father (Dell Henderson). Davis is like a formidable beauty dress - an egg that they join. Davis does a job in a slapstick comedy, she is not desirable but it brings her success. Her fellow slapstick meets Star William Hines, who immediately smiled with her. Well, Davis gets job at a more ambitious studio ("High Art Studios") and lands stuffed in pieces of stuffy period. A beautiful but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows the ropes on which she is the most famous Hollywood actress. Davis left his father and good father to his father, but in fact she finds out who she really is. Mario Davis is amazing throughout, she - outrageously - runs a gamut of emotions requiring an "extreme" actress. William Hines has a number of celebrities, including his usual fantasy comedy selfie film, Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert, and other well-known actors, director of King Vidore. This is a silent film that has some "sound effects" because the sound is just about their own. A treasure of the film.
