I think JEDI is now considered to be the most "last" entry in the popular saga, most of which is good. EMPIRE STRIKES LIKE IT'S CODE OF LIKE THIS SEQUENCE AFTER BACK, AND I HAVE LIKE A RUN (and an actor Mark Hamill, also) Lucas Skywalker appreciated the maturity. After hearing very negative things about Ewoks, they are not too bad. I enjoyed thrilling chase inside the woods, and I thought there was a lot of emotional emotions with this chapter. Conclusion (with some new additions, I guess?) Successfully converts all 6 chapters into fantasy's fantasy. Most true Star Wars fans have hated the changes I made for realistic films, but I do not know what I do not already know, and I think he has worked with these six films, Oh, and, wrong - Carrie Fisher looked very tasty in her skimpy outfit.
