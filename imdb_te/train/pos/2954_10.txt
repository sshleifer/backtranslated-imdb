However, the film was critically acclaimed, yet on DVD, in the US, the same year - like Christine Lahti's "Housekeeping". But if you support Region 4 (Australian) DVDs, this little masterpiece should be in your collection. Some VHS copies available on the Internet are still available. Davis has a great story and memorable performances from her supporting actors, particularly Claudia Caravan and the late John Judea. Amazing, or perhaps not, this film and its stars went unacknowledged during the Academy Awards, as well as "Housekeeping", but you both treat yourself - you will be happy!
