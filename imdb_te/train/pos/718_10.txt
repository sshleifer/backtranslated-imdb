Rock 'n' Roll High School is one of the best movies ever! I think it's the only reason why Ramones are so amazing! You can not make a similar movie and can not make a romantic pistol or the Ramones replace Clash, which is just the same. Dee Young, Clint Howard, Vincent van Patten, Marie Voronov, Paul Bartel, and Hal Motors. The whole image is about the whole Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone can see rock 'n' roll high school. No sissy new garbage ... but loud, and fast kind. Ramon is the only kind of thing to do. R.I.P (Rest In Peace) Joy Ramon 1951-2001. Dee de Ramon 1952-2002!
