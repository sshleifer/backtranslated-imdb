Yes, this is a horror film and it was so fun! Although the film is obviously horror, the stories have some light inspiration - there are occasionally some laughs. Sometimes horror films are a little too serious and are overly serious because it's not bad. Because of this and all four stories are pretty good, it is one of the best films of this genre I have seen. <br /> <br /> There is a unified plot house that connects each story. There are four different stories of people who are investigating what has happened to rented or rented tenants. <br /> <br /> In the first section, Denhel Eliot was a writer's block of writer. So, for the change of scenery, they rent this house. Almost immediately Elliott's block disappears and he works on a story about a serial killer. Exciting, shortly after his disappearance, he began to look at his fictional character! Again, mental killer appears and then disappears - it looks like he loses his mind. <br /> <br /> Second, not bad, but it's probably weaker. Peter Cushing plays the role of a bachelor who pinned for a girl friend who died some time ago (although her film was superbly contemporary). When he enters the horror minus museum chamber in town, he sees a waxy man who remembers him as his lost lady and he is both impressed and scared. Later, a friend (Jaws Auckland) visits and he also sees the person and shines through it. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee is a very tough and stern father to a tragic little girl. In most of these sections, Lee appears as an idiot, but you can finally understand his attitude. Slowly, it's very well ended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The fourth segment is silly and is a simulation for the genre. Joan Pertway (the third "Doctor" from the WHO Television series) Dracula is a well-known actor for his films. However, according to him, nothing is wrong with his film and in the attraction of the film, he disables the set to find better items for this vampire movie. It seems like a natural for Christopher Lee who plays Dracula or other vampires a baagile times (some give or take), which is actually quite interesting as he played this role. I basically enjoyed the line of Pertwee when he said that Lee and other recent avatars were all rubbish compared to Dracula Bela Lugosi! Lee can not take this part of the reason! <br /> <br /> The film starts and ends well, has a great deal of work and writing, it's hard, it's very fun and fun. I do not like this movie.
