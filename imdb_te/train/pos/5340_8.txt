Clara Lago is superb in the role of the film about a Spanish / American girl who goes to Spain with her mother during the Special Civil War. It turns out, the mother goes home to die, and she is left with her grandfather. She also has a lot of friends and experiences for a while. Tommy (Juan Jos√© Balestra) is a frustrator for the first time, so they are close. The film is beautifully portrayed and is heavily bathed in soft colors. Carol is yearn for her father, who is a pilot in the battle, and you think love is in the scr If you take a back seat in the film, it will cover the character's lives. I love you. Look exclusively for Clara Lago, who works great as a Karaoke. She is definitely one to see.
