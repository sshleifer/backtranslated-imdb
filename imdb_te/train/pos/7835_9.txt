Last night, I saw this film in a special film theater performed at Nurnberg, which is amazing. I must confess that the original music composition of the cello player and percussion / jilipophone players influenced the mental state of the film, but the film also had the power to shoot the tragic Kniblancan Saga. If you are interested in silent movies or niblonglide, I would highly recommend this movie. The clothes are fantastic and creative, the sets are richer and exotic, and acting is dramatic and breathtaking (unlike the silent movie "tragedies"), I did not see the first part of the duo about Siegfried. <br /> <br /> The story of the film begins after Siegfried's death, and begins to retaliate against her brothers in the Kerhild (the Norse versions of the story). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in German. I have a native English speaker and a basic German knowledge. It's hard to read the subtitles for the first time in German script (so what do you call silent movies?), If you see it in German, you're in your old kitten of "k", "f", and "s. :)
