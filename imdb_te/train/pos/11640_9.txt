<br /> <br /> Hitchcock's thriller is not as serious as it might be. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock people say good people have gone to good films. Hollywood seems to have been forgotten in recent years. It's a thriller, but it's a lot of laughs and always moves to the eye at the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is as beautiful as ever. Sillian Murphy is in Batman Begins. In the old days, there are guys who have always played bad guy. <br /> <br /> We can not see for many days because Hollywood agents suspect it's a bad career motion, but it is good to be bad for Silly Murphy. <br /> The direction is awesome. The story is good, but the dialog utilizes some sedatives. <br /> <br /> "Red Eye" is a fun movie and people have appreciated when opening credits. If you're in for a pleasant surreal thriller, "Red Eye" may be your ticket.
