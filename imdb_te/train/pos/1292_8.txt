Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, is facing problems especially with problems with his parents and brothers. He is lucky to have his own home and his own rules, because his brothers always stole his money and his parents neglected his wishes. In a terrible day, Preston runs on his bicycle; Villain, Quigley, tried to abusive the police and accidentally led the car on Preston's bike. Needing distance from the police, Quigley hurries a check to cover the losses of Preston's bike. Problem: This is a blank check! Preston is a wise boy and decides to have a higher price on that check: $ 1 million! Preston gives things to all of that money, pool, our toys, and a limousine like a building! <br /> <br /> When the FBI and Quigley realize where money is going, these problems begin when Preston falls in a difficult situation and faces many problems. <br /> <br /> This film is one of my favorites in my childhood. :)
