Many people, especially young people, do not understand this film. It's a story of loss when it's about to be alone. <br /> <br /> The role of cheads reflects the role of Johnson Sandler's character reflects Finlayman. Finnman, who felt Johnson caught in his blessing, tried to forget his life in the same perspective. Jada gets an amazing collection of actors and sandal tears. Cheadle has a humorous role and is a great supporter of Sandler. <br /> Here I am looking at the Oscars. Very nice picture. If you ever feel lost and lonely, the film will guarantee that you are not alone. <br /> <br /> <br />
