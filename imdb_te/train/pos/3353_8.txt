The film makes a strong comment about the Italian people at that time. The use of mirrors to enhance the revealings of the characters is beautiful and I can not tell you about the beauty and miracles of Sophia Loren and Maestro. I love both of them. Their way of interaction can be questioned whether the camera is actually very beautiful and naturally. The husband also directs his wife and children in his brief role, but is also a fascist Italian father who loves his own way. The early scenes with Hitler in Piazza Venezia with all the Italians were spectacular and really became a historical film. I agree that I love the movie and that it is not very popular.
