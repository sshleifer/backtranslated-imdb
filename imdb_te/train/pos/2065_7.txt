Fearful cimetry is a pleasant part of some flaws. The first thing about this part is that it is located near the Mountain Home Air Force Base in Southwest Idaho. Season One's 'Deep Thot' will be held at Ellens Air Base and in Southwest Idaho. I'm wondering if Air Force bases are one and only one but they decided to use the real name in the Fierce Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have some good dialogues, plus always. Ed Macham, Zoo Keeper, Cranky, and older school teachers remind me of it. They should have liked the kids at one time, you just can not imagine how. As he should be more attention to animals at one time. I liked the episode concept, but I felt I had some irregularities. If the aliens kidnap humans and get them back safely, can not they take the animal to the right place? And the aliens now have problems with animals returning? I do not buy Mulder's theory of the problem with the space-time sequence. If he is an expert Jane Atkinson starred as I did not work well with Wilta Ambrose. In addition to those nitpicks, I still enjoyed this episode of the secret concept of animal DNA and human DNA breeding aliens.
