One of the glamorous pictures of Gilliam's film, well-capped visuals, undisturbed backgrounds, and manually depressed characters is evidence of the creator's involvement. Instead of a lot of movies (a film maker is a paid actor or a paid name to pay for two different films), you can experience the existence of Terry Gilliam by experience. "12 Monkeys" is proof of Gilliam's own focus and style, making offbeat films for their own wish. "12 Monkeys" are similar themes of Gilliam's concert: oppression / reunited societies, the solitude of the Prophet, disappointment and parallel kingdoms associated with disloyalty. In this film, Gilliam makes the best work of confrontation between the two sectors, using opacity to believe the audience without knowing it. This trend of Gilliam has led to criticism of art-household trends in order to ignore some of the breaks. The difference in contrast to Gilliam and Kalyani is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and his images have meaning to everything. Initially the two types of bathing scenes of Cole were intended to draw audiences unresolved. His bald head is the symbol of uniformity in the future of the head, and he is the world's most recognizable in 1996. This title is a symbol of the creativity of Gilliam, because it understands most of the meaning of the meat to understand the meaning. Moreover, Gilliam's dedicated audience idea and explanation is necessary to create creative imagery to look even more interesting. The film has immense re-watch value due to the subtle details and instructions in the first view. Definitely one of my favorites.
