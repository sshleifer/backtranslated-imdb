The previous reviewer said it was perfect. I saw it once and enchanted me for the second time when the first stream was re-broadcast in a week or two. I still remember some scenes. This set was in the beginning of the 20th century, as indicated in the title World War I. One scenario is an interesting historical note which has been set up only in women in a public space. One of the greatest cinematic moments of all of my moment when one of the women touched for the first time. I do not think this is the "homophobic" story, which is an interesting and tender love story, where two principal women take place. I love to see this film again; I'll buy this when it comes on DVD.
