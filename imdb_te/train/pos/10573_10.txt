The spectacular example of the incredible Busby Berkeley music produced in the early 1930s. The audience is very surprised to see James Cogny in this type of vehicle. Contrary to his "Public Enemy" 2 years ago. Cognizo adds spark & ​​interest to the tireless moving story & plot. But the highlight of the film is backwards with 3 extensive production numbers. Countering with the most dazzling "Shanghai Lill" range, Cagney's counterparty counter with Ruby Keeler on the top of a bar with the first ever conservative "Honeymoon Hotel" number, followed by the "A Shurbal Lill" Sequence. The "Shanghai Lill" number with Cogni is amazing but a bit of a comedy and anti clausticistic "A Waterfall" choreography is "very enthusiastic and superb." If I was director I included the "Shanghai Lill" number 2 in the middle and with a "waterfall", it was talking & the other 2 numbers that came out of the water in the best of 3 in my eyes. 3 Freshs of Cake Production Crystal and James Cognini's presentation included a costume design. To achieve an outstanding musical, a 4 star movie, the ultimate musical, well-looking value, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
