If you're investigating UFO facts, this video is very important. Buzz Aldrin comments by the video's 'meat'. He is without doubt the best in America. The aim of his reports was to be honest and originally trained. Many astronauts from the United States of America have reported some sort of introduction or UFO practice and videos from some missions. At least something happened, which requires more ongoing investigation. This evidence from Buzz Aldrin shows that other worlds are interested in our progress. Like all documentary video to do, this may be a slanted, but it has more information and opinions from an accomplished American hero. They do not come every day. So something that is not interested in some details should not be seen in this video. If nothing else, it's interesting and I would recommend you to be open minded.
