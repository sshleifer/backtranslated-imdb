The film was on my wish list for ten years and I recently found on DVD when my partner's grandson was given. He saw it and was surprised to learn that my generation was born in 1930 and emptied in 1939 and wanted to know more about it - and me. Fortunately I received from him and saw it on my own, and I cried with it. It does not capture emotions, class distinctions, difficulties and the warmth of human relationships (as well as cruelty (spoken and not), but this is accurate! ARP Uniforms, Ambulances (LCC) All Barriers and Heavy Arms Rescue brigades work .I can not make any mistake from my memories And the gas giant Anderson shelter and WVS canteen. I also resided in 1939/40 with the distinction between the village and the trapped in battle, and my own evacuation from London with this product! But the facts are no longer true It is confirmed that John Thaw's acting career and one of the greatest spots in Gold's direction and well deserves the familiarity.It is a fantastic movie and I have already ordered two copies to send to two friends .
