It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with the cast like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rice Davis it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time. It is really a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure, which also captures your interest, with errors. It should always be a big movie for the people who made it. Although it has been in the 90s, it does not have a modern feel. It has the same feel of the old Erol Flynn film. Big Adventure movie is again big in Hollywood. But I'm afraid that these old films never have a feeling in them. On the other hand, it is a real feeling. You can not hate it. I'm okay with the picture of adventure. I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.
