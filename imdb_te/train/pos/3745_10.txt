Most mystery stories follow the standard Hoodunit way: the most foul murder, the gathering of evidence, the possible pips' movement, the red herring sprinkling, and the intellectual showdown between the brilliant Everdoller and the more intelligent criminal settlement. <br /> "Forgotten" may well be disturbed and we can not come up with complicated characters or have terrible actions. It is true that at the end of the three episodes we have no easy answers and some are disappointed in a poorly-packed package, but for me it's a cleverly constructed story with probes, confusing and chasing questions. <br /> <br /> A good secret and product can easily combine without mystery ... forgot.
