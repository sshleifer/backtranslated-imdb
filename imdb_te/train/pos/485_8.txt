'Luzin Defense' is a good film with good central performances, but not much of a novel and a glimpse of filmmaker. Most of this role helped to crack stories. <br /> <br /> Getting lyrics on the screen is a difficult task, especially a difficult one. A novel written in the early 20th century. The film is not deep in the relationship between Lozhen and Natalia. The Natalia controversy with her mother has a disagreement with the mother rather than a dramatic advance in the film. Without the incomplete enjoyment of his extraordinary and complicated personality, I felt that I was suffering from lazhane's pain and eventually tragic end. However, it's a moving and enjoyable movie but definitely not great.
