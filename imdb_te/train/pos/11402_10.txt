I'm still in school and fell in love with the first release of "An American in Paris". I went back to see again the next day and I lost countless times since I saw both the film and the TV. The great music and song of the greatest composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin), and the great man in Hollywood history (Jean Kelly) and feminine (Leslie Cuar√≥n) dancers. Oscar Levant's supporting cast (ever quirky), Georges Gutauri (why he did not make more movies?) And Nina Fach (excellent in the role of the impartial) on their form. The magnificent choreography of the title museum is the use of ballet, scenes of Paris and sounds and prints and post-Impressionist artists. All the Gershwin songs were beautifully performed, but the most memorable "It's Very Calm" (Coron and Kelly on Seine's Shore) and "I Got Rhythm" (joining Jean Kelly in Paris children "Yun Chanson Amerine"). If you love Paris, look at this picture. If you've never been to Paris in your life, see it. But look!
