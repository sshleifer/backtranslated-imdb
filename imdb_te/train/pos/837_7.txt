"The Metadore" is a dark comedy starring Pierce Brosnan as an old-fashioned hitman in a straight-line, happy American married businessman (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico. Despite being a peaceful Julian (nicknamed "noble"), he is a world and ally who has realized that he is really merely a mental disorder and insecure mass, who actually virtually left his pursuit of his chosen career. So on his birthday, he spent his life by the rules and reached Danny, who was surprised by Julian's "traditional" lifestyle. In fact, two men can never see each other, but they want their quiet and self-evaluation to become franker moments. <br /> <br /> The film "This" and "Midnight Run" is completely fresh and original, "The Maddor", the complexity of its characters and the quality of its performance. Brosnan sinks his teeth into Julian's role, looking ages and almost as old. Playing a person who can not make a serious relationship with another person, Brasson is a moment, then true and sympathetic. Humor is never cross or old, so he always keeps it from balance. Kinnear was also an excellent Joe businessman who found that she was pulling more to the dark side, strengthening her relationship with junior. Don's loyal and loving wife, like her husband, was surprised by this mysterious and "dangerous" man from a different world of what he knew. At times, Madd√∂ror has caught something of us and did not run well on its condition and premise. In the end it's a little more light, it's very tough to enter the effect. It is not yet drafting his film, since it was a film adaptation for writer / director Richard Shepherd. Still, the fact that he does not always go clear and he rarely focuses on the two major figures in the piece, for settling for simple setup or easy laughs. 'The Metadore' is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy, hopefully, signaling a new stage in Braslan's acting career.
