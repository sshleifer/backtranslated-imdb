In the WIND, directed by Douglas Cirk, in all the films between the 50s of Sirk's 1956 release - the pure drama. It also enhances the richly developed drama, and creates a motion picture of Cyk's trademark liver color expressionism, the voice, suppressed emotions, symbolism and class scenes. <br /> <br /> The film opens up, the plot of four central characters and credits still rolling. <br /> <br /> Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are both awesome in Hadley's "Children", Kyle and Maryle. He slept around with drinks and women. She sleeps around drinks and men. Thanks to Hadley oil trading, worth two million. Hunky and poor, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is Kyle's lifelong friend and Mariele's dream lover. This innocent mess enters Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall), a slim and attractive young woman who has fallen in the attractions of Kyle, he chooses a phone and arrives in an evening rural area. Mitch loves her very much, but Kyle wins her. They are getting married soon, and Kyle will stop drinking. But the fate is written in the air, and it is not long before a conniving Marylee (who does not "mich", marry or marry), secretly smitten Mitch, confused Lucy and sad drunken Kyle blows. <br /> <br /> Malone is just as marvelous as Maryle Hadley, who is fully entitled to her best supporting actress Oscar. She steals every scene. The stock is almost good, connecting the drama, and subtly and quietly continues to disappoint. <br /> <br /> Hudson and Baquel are more restrictive than they are, but they keep playing with the characters they play. <br /> <br /> What was this play before? Well, many things. The stammer's powerful image of male inability and fear, for one thing. Note the inability of her little baby, oil dances and the ultimate phallic symbol, Kyle's children to be pregnant with the folklore symbols across the circuit film. Hudson suffers from his father's preference, Hudson, who suffers from his sister's desire and his wife Hudson, who suffers from a large men's risk of being more susceptible to the stock. <br /> <br /> These wealth Kyle Hadley still end up at the wrong end of the town, buy cheap corn alcohol as a "bum". <br /> <br /> It's impossible to dream of it, and let them go. Kyle, Maryle and Mitch and others have been constantly referencing in this film, and Kyle and (especially) Maryle desires represent the innocence and simplicity of the youth. In a spectacular dramatic scene, Malone is filled with Marilie's River and imagines her as a child completely, and Michin has always said that she will always be her girl. This is when a huge emotional string struck with a circular viewer. Who dreamed about childhood going back to that particular place? Who was not, at some point, lived a treasured memory? Who Wanted Those Who Can not Do? And Hudson's last film (yes, no less than 10 minutes or less, just close-ups) reminds us, "How far is the distance from the river?" Amazing.
