As a comic book reader, I still see the whole child at heart, and I showed a bit bias towards this film. I mean, there is not a good superhero movie for quite some time (Note: Batman Forever is not a superhero film). <br /> <br /> The Mystery Men definitely thought that the high effects were not tension. A filled action movie, it's a comedy. It was successful on that basis. It's got a little theater laughing, and has been praised and smiled at the last scene. Stiller and Garofo are always delightful, as always, and Ajareya adds a proper touch of craziness. <br /> <br /> <br /> William H. Mackie drives a great man, but Kell Mitchell and fatty Paul Rubens are added to being happy. <br /> Though the sets are bizarre, both Batman and Blade Runner), and some of the jokes are clear, which is still plain funny. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this film. Although it is an all-time classic, the latest Austin Powers is twice as funny. The writing is good, and the cast is great. If you're worried, plan on the knife and pay less, but either way you are pleasantly surprised. I mean, who is different from those who have lost some of us once?
