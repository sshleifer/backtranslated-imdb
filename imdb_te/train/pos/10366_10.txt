An unqualified "10." The level of writing and acting in this Australian film is the best of "old" Hollywood. Sam Neal and Meryl Streep are very good together. Comparing to Strip Line for the Neil line and taken for takeoff - his fantastic performance is still one of the best performances and he's sexy and gorgeous at best, for the intensity of his character. This immersive movie is a psychoanalytic court court that loves the play for any human being, which is portrayed as a very human but uninterrupted. The film has won several outstanding awards in Australia - not only as a great performer and director, but also excellent and authentic Australian native. This proves that people in the world are the same. And, after all these years, people still have the famous steep line, accent and all the repeat pleasure: "A Dingo Moy Baby Eat!" Including "Eline Benis" on "Cienfeld".
