Sentinel mill and clich√© have some sort of suspense / mystery, but some good acting and tattoos are lifted. Most of these stories are similar to many permutations we already have, so how are we left, how good the acting is and how good are the bad guys, the main plate etc ..... so Sentinel does a solid job of content. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland are two good screen bravery and attitudes. Eva Longoria (the first time she saw the screen) brings some satisfying support. The story is completely inexplicable knocking down a bit towards the whole affair, but it deserves slack. If you like the genre, it's worth the view.
