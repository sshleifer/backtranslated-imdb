<br /> <br /> As young youths at the time, Airbolf's "Cowboys and Indians" is a compulsory sight for a generation who wants to have amazing gadgets and wiz-bang blasts. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the rider in the skies: such comic-book technology, a central character, especially a loner and a person's concept of echo. <br /> <br /> In other important ways, they are separate from Night Rider, Street Hawk, The A-Team and other action shows. For one thing, the motive of the series is to help those who need it, but because of selfish reasons for possession of the Stringf√ºhle Hawk Airwilf (his MIA brother, a leaflet trying to find Saint John). Later, in the 80s Cold War context, the darkest edge is through the Serious Serious, complete penetration of Soviet espionage and Central American dictators. Certainly, the A-Team indicates that they are constantly running away from Vietnam and the team, but this is usually done with a light touch, and the plot is rarely the center of it. With airwolf, the tone and direction of this program is the key to the conspiracy - it is diluted (the healing) when the series continues. <br /> <br /> Understanding the Cold War alignment, the stories are quite disorderly and compounded and AirWill's apparently undoubtedly with today's technology. But that's not really point. Airwolf is a fun-filled fun, trying to tell interesting stories without relying on big story scenes, and there is no sugar-coat that is awkwardly assumed to be dead. <br /> <br /> For UK readers, DMAX (Sky Channel 155) has just launched Airworld's daily re-run (January 2008). It was very unsuccessful, but often it was a marvelous success. Set your skype + box for this explosion in the past - we re-tool, re-cast (and unfortunately lowest) fourth season, which was not shown in my UK prior to my hearing.
