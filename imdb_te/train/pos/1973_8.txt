I do not believe in anyone's opinion about the film. It also went to critics. Sure, it's ok and a plus, but if most of the criticisms I face gets most favorable reviews of movies. I enjoyed this movie, an entertaining movie. It carries your life for a couple of hours and takes on a fictional character ... Catherine Trammel. Sharon Stone is amazing in this role, the first one is like her. Anyone who says that she is terrible in the film has the same feeling in the first part, acting as she did in her Basic Instinct 1. Catherine plays with her and her perfection. She is one of the first to be a liners, great. Who can forget when the police told her in the first film, "If I do this, if you do it ... otherwise f ** k get here!" The great scene, and believe me, she does this again. I was attracted to her. I believe in her dress, her cigarette dress, it's worth the price to see the stone's performance. I can not wait for this film, it will not be released on DVD because I can only imagine how good it is. And yes, there are lots of turns, as the first one, including the end!
