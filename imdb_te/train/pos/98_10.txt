For me too, this Christmas special is one I should remember very passionate. In 1989, I gave 2 CDs I found on soundtrack recording and one for my sister and another for myself. This is now part of my family's Christmas tradition, and I really like to see the show, which I remember to hear. </ P> <br /> John Denver appears in a number of Muppet Show, and they have done more than one special together. Here's a good understanding between Denver and his crazy colleagues, which is good for all ages and a lovely show.
