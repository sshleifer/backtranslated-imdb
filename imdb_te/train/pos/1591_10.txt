My mom and I recently laughing off our butts, this show became addicted! I've only seen about 10 episodes, and I'm disappointed that I did not pay attention to this hilarious series before they canceled! The story line is very funny, the characters are really great people (or not, not so great, but they're still funny!). I will do every single episode of Tuio What I Like About You. Amanda Bains and Jenny Garth, as well as all cast, never let me get frustrated! There is some inappropriate language for children and some sexual content, but you can not have too many issues with the parent's guide. This show has a kind of 'friends' kind of eye contact that meets me. I really enjoy it.
