Straight Story is an old man's story, he decides to visit his unhealthy brother living across the state line. He decides to tour his lawyer because he can not drive, and he wants to tear himself up. This film is beautifully described in his journey and the lives he touched along the way. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth's other cast, especially his daughter Sushi Spask and Harry Dean Stanton, will turn to a lovely performance in a small but infinitely crucial role. <br /> <br /> I initially thought that the story of the old geezer trip in the country would be discouraged but I would recommend this to Lynch with all the insights of man's life.
