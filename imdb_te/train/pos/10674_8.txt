I agree with one of the critics who compare this film with the American International Pictures. Basil Derridan is a non-combatant realm of post-war warfare with an honest attempt in childhood offense in England (though without the pity of "Blackboard Jungle"). Cinematography is good for realizing the gravity of the huge housing estate and the loneliness of the lonely one. The estate will look like old prison. "Emergency, Emergency - Larceny - Five Cooler Lollies" - Stanley Baker has been re-assigned to childhood division, as stunning as detective is amazing !!!! He finds the butt of many jokes. David McCullum is one of Britain's top young talents in 50 years. (He played a very different role in another Stanley Baker film "Hell Drivers"). Johnny played his part and inspired him to inspire. Anne Haywood is also very tough as Katie. <br /> Detective Jack Truman is investigating a string of baked attack with one called "Firefly". Just as he finds evidence that has led to progress, he is allocated to the Juvenile Division - the most disgusting thing he thinks is not the proper police work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " He starts to appreciate how young children can turn into life criminals in terrible housing estates. With more participation in the family, he learns that there is a strong connection between fires, Johnny and fearful Chinese youth working for laundry. The local priest (in the extraordinary role of Peter Cushing Hammer horror) tells him that when he was younger he saved some people from a burned building and praised a hero. He felt that the concept of emphasis was to be recovered and useful and that he could light up the fire. The school siege was shot in a very real way and the viewer felt the fear of a child - the teacher runs off (thinking only his own safety) and locked them in the armored room with fear! <br /> <br /> I thought it was really a wonderful movie to try to show some of the social problems that I felt in Britain after the war. <br /> Most recommended.
