In 1933, the film had many cuts from it, because it was for the story content and Lilly Powers (Barbara Stanwick) could do nothing to earn great wealth and power. Lily's father was sexually abused by her daughter at the age of 14, and she grew up in a steel mill in a town with very poor people and led her a father's home. . As the story progresses, Lily meets the man after the man and finally sees a man who has everything and is a playboy bank chairman looking good younger John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr.). And Jimmy did not even come to Lillie's first place, not even for lunch. Most young George Brent, (Coulond Trenholm), co-starred with Barbara Stanwick, and both performed spectacular performances. This was Dorrell F. from 1933. Janak is a great film produced and has been locked up for many years and is recently shown on silver screen. The film is light compared to what we see on Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 this kind of film is very naughty to see. Enjoy
