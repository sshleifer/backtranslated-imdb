You need to watch this movie. The true picture of what is happening in the world I have seen from Darwin Nightmare. Let's see! And if you're lucky enough to keep your city open, instead of looking at the big screen instead of the DVD. Though the writing is sharp and directed, the ideas are absolutely perfect. The Zone Cusack is amazing, and the rest of the cast is very good. It inspired John Cusack to do this movie, and, I believe, he should use some of his own money to do it. It's a wild, absurd ride, made without obviously necessary resources, but still succeeds. Jon Stewart, Steven Kolbert, SNL, Bill Meher also did not show the film what to say.
