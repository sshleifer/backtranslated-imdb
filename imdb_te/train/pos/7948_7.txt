I did not see the original "Incredible Journey" from a child, so I can not really compare two versions. This version tells the story of three animals, two dogs and a cat, whose owners leave the family in rural areas to take a new job in San Francisco. <br /> <br /> This story may have been portrayed as a cartoon, but two versions actually make live-action pictures using real animals. In the next version the human voice speaks by giving animals their own different personality, something that is not made in the original film. (The same device of spoken animals used in other recent children's films, such as "Racing Stripes"). Some critics have taken a smell on the use of this device, but my own view is that giving the personality distinctive personalities can help strengthen images rather than weakening. <br /> <br /> The two dogs are parallel between the majority of human beings, and their relatives in "Buddy-Buddy" films. Shadow, golden retriever, clever, veteran old dog; A young man is a brush, messed up and suddenly. It looks like the Chance Boxer for British eyes, but in fact it is an American Bulldog, clearly a distinct race for its British cousin. Sassy cat is the first and right personality. She is very proud of her status as a cat, and any dog ​​in her eyes is superior to her. ("Cat's rule, dogs drove!"). <br /> <br /> The image from an adult perspective has many shortcomings; Some of the events that have sentiment to it (one of which is one of the animals manage a dragon lion in the river) are quite amazing, and all of human characters are completely forgettable. However, this is primarily a picture pointing to kids, and I suspect they will enjoy immense. Certainly, any animal-loving child does that. ("Greatness" of that movie, which removes such animals' voices, has only professional critics always serve to strengthen my eyes without children's films best guides.I do not doubt that if some professional commentators like James Berardinelli complain, there are many playground conversations <br /> <br /> Photography of California's Sierra Nevada Mountains They can appreciate a mixture of humor and enthusiasm. Runaway pets face danger such as bears, mountain lions and porcupines in the forest, which is a very fun family image.
