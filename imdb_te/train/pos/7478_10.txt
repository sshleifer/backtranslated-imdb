I come from Romania and I speak in English. I want to say about this film that's all my time. It appeared at least 30 times and is looking for it for many years now. It has all the little things I have in a movie, which makes me cry too touching. Describes love and realism and real things about different subjects. It's a lot of this for me, love, soul of a person, he's inner being, and this is what I see in this movie. Maybe it's more than just a movie, a proof in my mind that it really exists and that you do best from every moment of your soul mates. It is far from reality from science fiction, but what if .. If capitalism is disappearing and the economy is falling, will it fall? We're worried about all the other problems and your idea is not on your death bed, the big thing you remember, the wealth, the adventure, the countries you've visited and the people who do not remember you. But true friends and your true love and after you die, everyone will be scared and people will be better and more attention. Watch this movie and it will guide you in the way you like in your life :) From Romania
