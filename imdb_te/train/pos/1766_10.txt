I got free pass to preview this movie last night and did not know what to expect. The premise seemed crazy and I thought I would have a lot of fun-of-the-Virgin humor that makes me very bad. What a great surprise. I laughed so hard that I cried at some of the jokes. This film should be seen with an open mind and a little twisted humor. Okay ... it's not a movie to go with your grandmother (Jack's Palace) or with little kids. The language is dirty, jokes (too) raw, and sex talk graphic anywhere you find. Surprisingly, the film is still a sweet love story. My sweetheart and I both liked it. Steve Karel is fantastic, but the supporting cast (like the office) really does the movie work. The characters all have their flaws, but they also have depth and likeness. Everyone pulls their weight and chemistry is perfect. I can not wait to get the DVD. I'm there for replays and playful lines with office space.
