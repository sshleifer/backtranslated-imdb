This will appeal to more fanatical fans. This has passed the test recently as I have seen it again, which proved to be much better than I expected. Despite being an actor with unnamed stars, it may be a fiery Martin invasion that has ever been featured in the film. Interestingly, Martians represent each classic action hero / science fiction hero stereotype (cool 50 teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and cookie scientist). Have fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> "
