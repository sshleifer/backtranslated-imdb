The fifth part of Hammer's short-term "Hammer House of Horror" series, with the title of "The House Who Blood to Death", is undoubtedly rare in the first five episodes. For many years, Hammer Studios has been a great fan of Gothic horror films, and I have long been watching the series for a long time. So far, I have seen the first five episodes and the best one is still a strong feeling, but the first five episodes are entertaining, and I'm satisfied. If the second and third parts are ridiculous and for their ridiculous and dark sense humor, this fifth entry is one of the top five truly truly true horror. The episode begins when an old man murders his wife from unknown motives. Years later, William (Nicolas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davis) move home with their younger daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). The second episode directed by Francis Megah is much better than his average previous entry, "Growing Pains" (Episode 4), and distributed to great performances by most unknown actors. The film is good in terms of cinematography and score. A solid piece of "The Blood to Death", will provide you with items that my fellow Hammer-Fans want to see in a short horror story. The film offers a creepy atmosphere, real frightening moments and intelligent twists, and is ultimately breathtaking and entertaining from the beginning. Overall, it's good for Hammer fans.
