The Legend of Ju, as I have seen, is a very interesting story. Most of the people who do not like me do not see myths behind. They were looking for something like Star Wars, and it was not. Joseph Campbell, I believe, I liked this movie. There are many metaphors and mysterious meanings that average viewer can neglect. All of us are the swords of the sword. We all have to go into some blood cave in our life. We all have to face our own insomnia for some day. Some of the story was said to be a little confusing, and some of the actions took a little hockey at times, but the other points of the film were easily made. I can see again. I do not know if there is a difference between The Legend of Ju (which I saw with English subtitles in Mandarin) and Zu Warriors (dubbing USA version.). Audience, it's really removed from this movie.
