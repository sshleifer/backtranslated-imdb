Cassandra Peterson created Elvira as the television host of night horror films, and the character was unexpectedly proven that she suddenly found everything from beer sales to Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show. In the late 1980s she gained popularity, and the ELVIRA film, resulting in Dark's MISTRESS. <br /> <br /> The fly weight weight of the plot. Television horror film hostess dreams of success in Elvara Las Vegas. When her great aunt dies, she goes to New England, hoping to provide enough money to get the estate back to a stage show; She was disappointed that she had inherited a low house, a poodle, and an old book. It happens that all the description of the town is puritanical beyond that, and she goes everywhere and arouses righteous anger. It also happens that her great uncle is secretly intended to keep an eye on an evil warlock and "old book". <br /> <br /> Some teenagers, stud muffin, and disgusting women have disagreed. <br /> <br /> No one is blamed as a cinematic artist, it will stop now. But Cassandra Pietersen is able to finish off with a brilliant talent: the creativity of a lustrous, sexy, and sharp comedy, with a lavish humor, dancing like a ringmaster in her fickle circus and often self-amusing jokes. Witchcraft craziness from a FLASHDANCE disaster, she is less than wildly entertaining. It is very unusually entertaining, and the end of the film also manages to create a substantial suspense. Elvira will best save her evil uncle and day? <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVD is okay, the bonus material is a bit less on the way, but if you are in the mood of something silly this is sure to answer a desire. If you have never seen it, you're going for a treat. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon reviewer
