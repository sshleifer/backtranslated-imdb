The emotion between the two main characters that they seek to find their relationship is strictly one-one based primarily on physical attraction. And there is also emotion in the inner workings of his / her mother's troubles dealing with the family of Matthew - and there is no disturbance on their relationship. But the answer to the problem is that leaves a lot of things (unless I'm just too dumb to pick them up). Why is Matthew in a mental hospital? What led to the breakdown of boys? And flashing between current and past is a little harder to follow at first. The main reason for renting this movie seems to have some homoerotic alternative thrills, or some male nudity enjoy. But it is less and unsatisfactory in the love story or character study.
