According to the director, the film is popular in Asia. It is very difficult to get these Mattes Helge movies seriously as these films are painstakingly painted. Almost USD at all. But it's lovely to establish that Mats Helge finally completes something called an Action Cinema. Ninja mission - I think - all of his directing is one of the best movies. Some special effects are very pleasant. This is not the "B" or "C" image. It is a "Z" movie - but enjoyable and fun "Z" movie!
