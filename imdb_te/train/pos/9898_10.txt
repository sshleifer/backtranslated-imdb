I assume that my 10/10 rating is for fun factor and decided to "slaughter high" before you see it. Yes, this is a simple revenge - many years after-a-dirty-punching story, but how do you like some of the things they're taking here? <br /> <br /> Well, if we disappear, I will say that this film is nothing new. Well, it does not pretend. This is the sort of image that the characters in "Scream" are possibly viewable and has contributed to the rules of how to live a horror film. After all, who do not like to suffer people to do these things? Obviously, this has a sort of reaction, as people punished those who took the '60s. But still, you like this stuff! So, with Don McLean apologizing, this teacher did not sing for the king and the queen!
