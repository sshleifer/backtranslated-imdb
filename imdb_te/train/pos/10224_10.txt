... and I understand. <br /> Not all of this (after all, each image has never been created!), at least, obviously, I know most of them. <br /> This is the thumb protocol with IMDb: Sometimes movies are rated very high (for example, Cannes-Kompattion-called "Oldbay", known as "Oldboy") may be really bad. But rarely worth a picture is actually rated below 6. This picture is worth looking at most. <br /> The truth is, I will give 10 in protest. The film is not perfect. Its true rating should be 8 or 9. It has some acting flaws (especially Belafonte), sometimes revolving around the script. Nevertheless, all of us great directors here, Chen John Cadar, have directed two of the greatest actors of all time, Zero model and fantastic performance than Zero, Ida Kaminska, Poem / Ethical Tour de Force. Couple in heaven! The film is not thick on average viewers, but the useless director who gave us "The Street on the Main Street" (beyond criticism) <br /> <br /> Some silly IMDb rating system "American Beauty" Angel Levine "is better than that. <br /> That's not it.
