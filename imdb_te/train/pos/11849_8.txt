Only ALL animation if this is great. It is classic because this film is two common elements: story and character. The characters in the film are pretty personality. I thought all of the characters, and the human-animal relationship in the film works perfectly. Beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation did not work well in any other movie. This is a great image for kids, and adults who want to travel a classic hero. 8 out of 10
