These three caution bears are my favorite of movies. Once again, I liked songs. The big problem is that many people oppose this story in reality. The bears have come to see their "cousins" for the first film recall. This is not true until the relatives of their relatives learned of their stomachs. In this story, cousins ​​grow with bears and have tear signs. It's not a bad movie because it's different from a long time. I thought Darkrart's character was the first Nicholas after bad. But at the same time I thought it added a sort of balance to the sweet of the bears of care. I learned mixed feelings for the rest of the scene, but even in the end we worked hard. And of course I loved songs. My likes are growing and ever-younger. Care bears have always had good songs. Ten stars for better picture.
