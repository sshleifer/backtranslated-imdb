Charleston Heston wore a dress, James wore to Francis but not to wear a traditional waist cloth with Mark Wahlberg. There is no Tarzan. Linda Harrison first wore a bikini in 2 Planet films but Estrell Warren just made a splash - her hair was always there. Tim Burton has watched this Simeon Saga and can be seen by the audience among the audience. Even the Holy Helena Bonham Carter would never get her dress out as big dresses. She looks beautiful but looks all the love stuff anxious & a little bitty kiss at the end. The only references to the introspeople but planes but the intracellular species between humans and monkeys - intercourse inter-sex sex between robots and humans but never provide - as artificial intelligence. Lisa Marie is the only monkey who can be sexy. The film is thrilled with the trio of three great actors Tim Roth, Mrs. Carter & Paul Giamatti and they are fun to watch. The superbly made (a specific Oscar) makes this 2001 hit summer movie of clothing, sets, and music.
