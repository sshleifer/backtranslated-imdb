Shortly before the shogunate lost a big battle against the monarch who sought the return of the Emperor to the throne of Japan, the film was a wonderful lesson on Japanese history at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Cats (also known as the original jatocchi) is Ijo okada, four hottokiri (= human slayer) Bakcomatsu. He is a simple samurai that loses his wealth. If he wants a good life, he will be a retiree of Tachey Hanpei (the Tautsuya Nakada = Sword of the Rionois's Door). Hanpayi is an ultra-nationalist politician who kills many high-profile pro-politicians in order to achieve his political goals. Izzo Okada follows his leader, questioning what they really are doing. As long as he has money to go to his whore and drink and spend. Akada's murders are more brutal in the film and he has a reputation based on where he goes. <br /> <br /> <br /> This is an amazing film in the life of a typical samurai that is trapped in political affairs and is simpler to know what will happen. The first time he has betrayed and tortured and always changes his thoughts and opinions in life after having talks with Sacomo (a samurai who rejects violence). <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Oko Okada. <br /> <br /> Shinto Cats and the rest of the crew gave a wonderful performance. Each actor reaches their role. Very special and fast knife-fighting ... faster than many of the movies these days ... <br /> <br /> Check if you have the chance!
