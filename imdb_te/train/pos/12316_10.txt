Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark's Chinese Chinese Story Story, a beautiful and romantic love story, not just one of the greatest vuosa pia films ever produced, as well as an undisclosed drama art form that is part of every cinematic lover's collection. Hong Kong Superstar Leslie Cheung was a passenger tax collector who spent the night in the temple. While in the temple, he must cut the reincarnation of the body and rebuild the ghost of the devil, the beautiful ghost Lit Sin Scene starring Honey Voi, The Tree Devil and the lovely Joi Wong <br /> <br /> This film is not about good things enough. Pacing is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and a feverish ending should have a lower chance of breathing. Chemistry really feels for the viewer between the amazingly tragic Joey Wang and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ends too quickly). In fact the total acting is so vibrant and full of life, I would say this is one of the most fun-looking experiences I have ever had. The credit goes to lots of voodoo sworn Yin in his role. Burning hell that has been disturbed by the vicious aggression bent leads to some great moments of humor and traditional HK drama as his over-the-top man. Excellent presentation with eye popping colors, lush cinematography, and courtesy of frantic actions of Ching Siu Tung out of this wonderful film. Find a copy anywhere. 10/10
