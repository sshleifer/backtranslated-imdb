When you're trying to throw too much of the person who creates a movie, your little fear will usually be seen when you are scared. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> Eric Eatbari performs excellent work on the spirit of twisted justice and helps to convey complexities. <br /> <br /> In this marvelous short film, the young man can give great performances to his father, but Eric's performance is definitely a show steer in the story. I would definitely recommend this system system system.
