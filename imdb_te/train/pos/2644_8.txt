I do not know why I was so cute about this film, but for the first time I watched, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield or a war-drama, but I'm really surprised when Windhoield finds his baby. He knows that the boy has green eyes. To be honest, I have not seen these pictures over the years or shown on TV for a while, but this film is somewhat of a man's odyssey with the pain of war. Winfield shows the sympathetic and heartfelt character of a person who lost his memories. There is an underlying message in this film that he is looking for the last cloth of human morality after the war and after the reality he encounters. Why this movie is not yet DVD or video is a secret for me.
