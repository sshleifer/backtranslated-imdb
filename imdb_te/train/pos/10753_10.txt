For those who say that this film deserves anything below unflaunting grace that does not show it, I disagree. It's a wonderful documentary about the surprise day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to rate this film. I examined what was made of the documentary. The courage to shoot the film is very important. When the moment was over, two brothers broke up. They continue to brave brave document without knowing their own and each other's safety. It's not my answer to make sure that it respects the video to shoot the tragedy or to respect the magnificent and fantastic firefighters lives. <br /> I do not know children over 30 years old. <br /> <br /> I submitted 10 cheerfully. To summarize the natural emotion that provides real life. You can keep your kung fu junk. Romance is beautiful. Action will never reach this level. This film, from 9/11, is seasonal that it does not glorify itself. It's not a sneak peek. It is unclear what many of the films on the screen are obscure part of the lion. It has a class, calm, material, and day record of America's modern face and world. It speaks about things that the camera can not escape. <br /> <br /> This film is a tribute to the announcement of itself by the name of America's free and beautiful name. <br /> You can give me a little bit of the film you show, the real people's natural stomach and dysfunction. I love "The Godfather" but "9/11" is a different kind of film forever. It is art without question or question. <br /> <br />
