I saw this movie in Rotterdam IFF. You can question some of the manufacturer's decisions - such as choosing a mockumentary form for such sensitive and terrible thing - but this film definitely hits you in the gut. Especially the last scenes are almost painful to watch. I hope it will deliver the desirability.
