This is not my favorite WIP ("Prison in Women"), but it is one of the most popular films in sub-genre. It was built by Roger Corman, who has already produced some WIPs. The film tries to play with the formula set up. The film takes place in the USA Jail, not as in WAN movies as "Banana Republic". I'm not sure if this is a wise decision, but it's an acceptable change of pace. Writer-director Demi lost his job and digs in new ways to always show a familiar visibility. In fact, he is slightly more ambitious for his own good. The filmmaker creates some surrealistic scenes that are proud of the boundaries, but it is fun to see how much of the movie above your ankle-in-chains film is difficult. But do not worry, Dem still works in the parameters of sub-style. There is plenty of nudity and violence, something that hardcore fans will be satisfied with. The picture is a little slow, but it is quite entertaining. The cast is good. Roberta Collins is a WIP veteran, so she does not need intro, and the owl like Barbara Steel Wheel Chair-Bound Crazy Warden. But Palm Grier was seriously missed.
