Kolchak perfect entertainment. Great stories and great actors and nothing else to lose weight. Darren McGavin gave him a powerful performance by pulling audiences along with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDavit McGavin give great support to only the two leading actors. Some spectacular guest stars are fun and episodes of fun - Eric Estrada in the Lerith of Terror, Phil Silvers in Horrors in the Hills, Antonio Faragos in The Zombie.
