I'm sick of the whining people about Ewoks! True, they are not always the best thing for Star Wars, but they happen and act! Moreover, they are very beautiful, and I do not care if they are sold. <br /> <br /> This film always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end is not good. I'm excited for the Phantom Menace because it suddenly throws the whole story's attention from Luke to Anakin. In the end, I love how he is revealed - no other way is resolved. So if you complain that Vader's helmet is deleted, it may take some time to think about it. It's very effective. Wader, who has been hiding behind a mask for 20 years, finally revealed himself as a sick person. He is not a complete machine - he is vulnerable. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the casting director should be able to choose good actors in a new hope. They are all right. They are unreliable characters. Hamill is doing a brilliant job with the development of his dramatic character. Fisher makes a good job as a female role model (I mean, come! She even killed when Jabba was killed!). Harrison Ford - Do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> Music is once again good. It is very touching and important when you choose the character background in various parts of the image. Luke "No!" Jumps out to fight with his father in the outstanding climax and last battle. John Williams is not the smallest of a genius! <br /> <br /> Episode I because this episode has a lot more meaning because of episode. I can not wait to see it in the theaters (I waIT ???) and <br /> <br />
