The story of "A woman from nowhere" is very light and Eastwood spaghetti is far from the west to the right: a mysterious stranger begins to enter a town in a kamana town. Opening credits and music also have a spaghetti feel: Sergio Leone and Enioio Morricone are proud. <br /> <br /> In this action, a substantial amount of gunplay, some good, some predictable, in a Harley of Saki (Ryoko Yonekura), and in the location somewhere in Japan , And other spots are somewhat hokey, but it's a lot of fun overall. Rioco feels his guns and performs with Abbomb and gives thugs to them. Her performance was not as challenging as she was a physical challenge, but she has done very well. <br /> <br /> If you have a Ryoko Yonekura fan (which I am adoringly) and / or I would recommend the movie too, NHK play, "She shows her acting skills like Oshu." Girls with guns are "a fan of the movie and it is repetitive There's something I can not say and describe about "girls with guns" like "La Femme Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight". Ryoko is just icing on the cake, as well as having a beautiful gal has gobs.
