People from any political ambition should take time to watch the film in a nationwide and especially political scene. The film is called "City Hall" and with less imagination, its collection takes place anywhere in the United States. It's just going to open in New York. Here we have the story of a prominent politician named Mayer John Pappus (Al Pacino), with a big effort to have the knowledge of the main metropolitan city run. His right hand man is the brightest person than the deputy mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), who is associated with his guru and both seemed to be intended for a high office. City Dill and Mayor points to everything in that direction, until the police ignites the inquiry led by Marybet Kogan (Bridget Fonda). Corruption law enforcement officers such as Judge Walter Stern, who judge a six year old boy and a political officer, leads a clear cover by political payments and city corruption involving Union leaders like Danny Ello who played Frank Anselmo who is questionable to death. (Martin Landau) and Paul Sopati (Anthony Franciosa) were deeply involved. There are party officials such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Swiffe), who works for New York's Survey Office. But it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy who took the job through dangerous shooting. Be sure to become a great vehicle for Cusack and become a classic Bet Nominee. ****
