<br /> <br /> When I came to the film, I saw this film for the first time. I recently saw this film and it still has my memories. Many of us have seen movies when we were young, and then we have to catch them while looking at them. The film is actually an example of the illustrations of the 80s. Keaton is his best, all actors actually did a very good job and Ron Howard was very good at stimulating the story rather than forcing the story. The pace of the film is fast with some slow spots and seeing cars from the 80s is very funny. From the 80s I loved seeing the ugly pacer again. The film is great for any comedian and 80 movie lovers.
