Anyone in Palmount, Dave made him completely sidelined. <br /> <br /> Paul had this connection with me this morning about the scene. He took Vegas, three planes, a car to a set, and he beat it. He rarely needed to use the sugar cane. He was in the trailer about my bathroom size. <br /> <br /> He does not know that he can do it. He then saw 6000 additional squads, paid 7 bucks. He came to life and they shot the scene for two hours. <br /> <br /> Paul is a great man, although very liberal. True talent.
