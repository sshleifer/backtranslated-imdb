This film is very difficult. The hero of this film (and author and director) Simon Guyast - a man with "agenda." He created a fake magazine featuring the Swain Interview of Los Angeles - actors, models, and musicians - believe their own surgery is odorless. With a clever dialogue, Zucovic succeeds in this work. Sure, the budget of this film is probably he's paid for a used car, but this film works very solid and well written. Edward Munk's 'The Scream' is to be nominated for a variety of awards, for anyone who can recover the silver trishbin image in the local coffee house. Give this film an opportunity to make a single car since 1986 and listen to what it says ... this is called 'car'. Bravo, Jukovik, Bravo!
