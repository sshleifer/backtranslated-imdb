If I saw the pilot of this program, I rated it 10. I immediately hooked into this gorgeous new world. The next episodes have not lived until full promises, but I hope that I'll be watching and that's fine. Product values ​​are fantastic and acting first-rate. I have a lot of interest in that premise and because we are experiencing two different shows, I do not mind that I do not seem to be align perfect with BSG. Both Esau Morales and Eric Stolts both returned in my life (weekly weekly), both of which were missing. This requires some idea from the audience, which is always a good thing. You need to cover your head around certain aspects of the show; There are things that do not appear, but certainly gray, literally and figuratively, plot lines, characters and, of course, in a variety of fantasy worlds. We know how it will end, but is looking to ride a lot of travel.
