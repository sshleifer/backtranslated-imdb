First, this is a wonderful series, but we have a James Bond effect. The new casino royal takes place in 2006, the first time the 007's first adventure, Do No (1962), the first film with Golden Eye, Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench, before making her new Bond, How does she start from the age of two? This is more or less "poem" license to thrill. If we want to entertain ourselves, we have to put our heads a bit. No, the new Star Trek film does not have any of the original electronics of the original series since almost half a century ago. In the 1960s, communications were fantasy. (Now we call them cell phones) and slip lights instead of buttons. OMG, do you think from 400 years now, would they have been perfect for Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard? <br /> <br /> But, to try and make some efforts, let's look at the creation of silens just 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. Where did all the silicons exist in the original land? We know that there is technology for random jumps through space. Well, one of the Cyclone ships fired at Capricorn aircraft, or a sunspot or a vessel, loaded with human-visible cylons, not only to jump through space, but also a thousand or ten thousand years of torn ship. They were colonized, and they discovered a "ragtag" in search of the legendary Caprica to repopulate themselves and ultimately destroy themselves, but find themselves a livable but unpopulated planet, colonized to become human beings. Time paradox? Of course. What's the first one, the chicken or the road? Who cares? It's fun!
