I always liked this John Frankenhammer movie. It's not another thriller by Elmore Leonard's good script and Frankenhair. His attention and attention to the smallest detail cause all the variation, he rented porn actor Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make a case of its last good film, Roy Scudder. I always said Robert Treber gave me a wonderful performance. Clarence Williams III got all the promotion with his scary performance and he was also fantastic but I thought I was standing Trebor. Frankenheimer may not be proud of the film, but it appears to be full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs and real porno actors. What can you say about an image of Margaret drugs and rape? A guilty pleasure to say the least. Vanity has a real nonsense character and Kelly Preston looks very young. A classic extortion thriller that should not be forgotten.
