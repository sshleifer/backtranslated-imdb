It's been a long time since I saw this short-series and I'm happy to say it has survived the test of time with its memory capabilities. <br /> <br /> For most of the parts of 'A Perfect Spy', the simulation of Lekker's best novel is, in my opinion, the top-swing. The best of its best is the musical voice and the master of screenplay, I believe in Tinker Tyler Soldier Spy as a filmmaker with Alec Guinness a few years later by Arthur Hopcraft. <br /> <br /> The actors are very good, some amazing, like Alan Howard's Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally's Ricky Pym. Peter Egan likes to see his face changing with every camera angle. The timing of the clock and the characters 'physicists' discoveries have been made very confident. So far I was amazed at how old Peter Egan was when filming. Magnus Pyam's character, a young actor named Berdicott Taylor, is known as Peter Egan, the most visible from most of Afraf. <br /> <br /> Enan is convinced only when the lesson is dramatic and he must be mentally "upset", ie cry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do, She is part of the skin underneath, but often she exhibits an amateur pet that turns into a strict cookie diplomatic housewife, Mary Ping. Rudigar Waggag Axel is spectacular, amusing, contrasting and bright. <br /> <br /> The British view of the Americans is clearly visible in some dry-looking scenes. When the Yanganges came out with Bo Broml (the head of MI6), the American fragment was filmed as vacant hoops, many of which reminiscent of many words from the dictionary, American Jagon and Psycho Abbas, most of English's delicate slander. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness are expertly combined. <br /> <br /> Legazare has a knack for a combination of different elements in his stories, and Hoopcraft has captured the wonders of the original, grieving, extreme, and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The exact product (what?) and the best yet is the LeCarMark methods to reach date or television. <br /> <br /> All recommended for all spy thrillers lovers and specially absent fans. DVD is available from Acorn.
