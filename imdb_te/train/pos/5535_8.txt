The first film of the film will show a mountain peak in the early autumn layer, and my idea is: "It's very beautiful." And this goes like this: The pictures of landscape and animals that are a series of romantic pictures, each detail of them perfect. Even the girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. It seems old and distinct, but it fits a story of silent beauty, which takes place between the life and fairy tale between Diane Fossi and Lee Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute. The film's serious persecution, a simple, slow story, just an actor and rarely has any special effects, has shown a strong magic. So I realized that these parsimony would be given in the last minutes, suddenly two extra actors (the adult woman and her son) were suddenly introduced. Another error is music, which is often inappropriate, like Hollywood and sometimes inappropriate: I can not bring English pop-song with French mountain glory. I went to the film with my two youngest daughters, but I also recommend adults to congratulate this kind of film. Obviously, not for everyone.
