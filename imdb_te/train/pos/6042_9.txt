While running from movies to rent, I picked up Freebird. I saw the first part of the work to see everything else. Fortunately, it really warmed up, and the movie was a bit too much. The whole half of this film made me smile and laugh time. <br /> I say - all of the actors have heavy European voices, so beware that you are in trouble. Voices or their cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, I have to order a copy for my own collection.
