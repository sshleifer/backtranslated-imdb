Supreme Court of Anarchism and Unlawful in Elk Hills's Paddock Hick Hamlet. The town's adult tough, cagey Vietnam veteran Aaron (an amazingly strong and engaging performance by Chris Christopher) and deputize a number of his fellow vet buddies to clean up the point. When Aaron and his brutish friends take control of Elk Hills, this project will move them to remove all bad things. It's up to Aaron's good-and-good brother Ben (played by compound Jan-Michael Vincent) to keep him at a stop before things go too far. Writer / director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Point Blank") Armitage dismisses the contemporary Western winner of a lavish, overwhelming, unfortunate and nasty destructive redneck drive: he has a rainbow, no-sense tone, pace with skillful and vague Everything, and the stages of enormous action scenes with considerable muscle symptoms (ch An exciting explosion climax is particularly strong and confusing). The first-rate cast of familiar B-featured faces is the main asset: Ben's Sweet Hottie Girl Friend Linda's Victoria Principle, Felicia Mayer as Flaky Saloon Singer Little Dee, Brad Dior, David Doyle's slimy bank John Carpenter's film Regular Charles Nam Wets, Anthony Carbone, a supreme casino in Cybers In the end, John Steadman as a folk old diner owner, Paul Gliesen as a strong strong arm shake-down bully, and Dick Miller as a talented piano player. Ethical: Do not employ other people to do your dirty work. William Crozager's slick cinematography, Gerald Fried's cheerful, harmonic Hillbilly blue gross score and rich raw violence added more serious entertainment to all these unfairly neglected little betrayals.
