Winter Days, 28 December 1986, rented a movie at two bored at the age of 14. "Humm, Police Story, Interesting Looks", "Who Is This Jackie Chan?", "Never Listened To Him". Two hours after watching the film, in a daze, we wanted to know more. After 16 years (and the JC movies are very strong in the pocket from collecting!), I never liked this film. Okay, my "first" (Canonball Run is not calculated !!) JC movie, but it's a wonderful spot I have a soft spot. It's all classic JC elements, action, humor, action, heart and aCTION! Some comments say that it has been made, which was done in 1985, of course it's up to date! But then Jaws, Casablanca, Singh in the Rain and the Godfather !!!!!! Where does Hollywood action happen without movies like Police Story? PS set standards, many scenes were stolen for use in other films. If you really appreciate thoroughly you should see in the Widescreen, if you do not miss the movie too much (yeah, he does not really come off the bus going round the corner!). If you are not already, see this movie now !!!! <br /> <br />
