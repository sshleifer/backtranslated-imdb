I usually look hard to take Loretta Young, too much regarding his mistakes and too much ladylike in the wrong ways. But in this lyrical franc bourgeois romance, and her spencer Tracy playing Parrot with a slight self-esteem, she is live and honest and irresistible. This is a weird little movie that is mostly played in a room in a room in Hooverville, and an unprecedented and yet romantic and ideal recession. Tracy, playing a storm, is an awful racist and bully harsh "normal guy" by today's standards, making the rough edge of his character soft and almost attractive. Marjorie Rambau and Glenda Farrell have had a good support from her (never before she has ever been), and the screenplay of Joe Swirling is modest and efficient. But Real Heroes Always Liarred Closeup, and Borzage who liked the true love drama in Young. If you tell him his character of clapping and knowledge, she is very good for this guy, but she is very agile and convincing, you watch contentedly play a satisfying ending in their story.
