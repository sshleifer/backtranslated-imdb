<br /> <br /> The film will reveal all the clips and then reveal some of them. Painful evil (Downs Syndrome!) Actors. Terrible massive self-important dialogue. The shots that are shocking but will fall flat. Jarring editing. Pointless plot points. <br /> <br /> A kind of smear is encircled in Myassma with discontent for audiences and vague mental courage. <br /> This is exactly what it's designed to do. For the past two years, a happy caricature of the painted images of the corrupted teenage trust-funders to show to their parents when they are asked what they are doing! "What's this?" Received its Cannes Award, commentator Werner Herzog came up with a rumor that it was originally said to be a sarcastic piece of his own films! He blasted at the information. <br /> Today he refuses to discuss this incident. <br /> Let it look and smile, it's classic for humor for many years to come.
