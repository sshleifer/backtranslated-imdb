It's my favorite series of Scooby Doo at a young age. I have the edge of each episode and the villains have put together creative ideas (and very scary and reliable). Some of the best episodes include "The Left Neck in San Francisco", "Twenty Thousand Screams Under the Sea", "The Gaulle, the Bat and the Ugly" and "When You Wish Upon a Star Creator". Do these episodes if you've ever been. This series "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" Although there are other episodes that do not seem to have the same edge, this series is a bit of a mixed bag. And "Redemption of the Scooby Chief". As it was the series before, it was very well put together, interesting storyline and brilliantly drawn. As it is told to everyone, it was much better without scrappy do. The story is disturbing and disturbing the story.
