This is a very simple but very exciting movie. There are moments that I can see when Cher Best Award is awarded to the Academy Award, but there are other times when I think Glenn Close does not win for Fault Attraction. However, Oscar and Golden Globe win, and BAFTA nominee Cher Loretta plays Castor, a simple woman with a low salary now asked to marry Mr. Johnny Comerie (Danny Iiel). She promises that he will return in a month, because she is sick and understands how much she needs to have her family to attend. When Johnny's brother-in-law, Rani (nominated by Golden Globe Nicholas Cage), they have a relationship, and there is love for the moon's scene (where the title comes from). Olympia Dukakis won Vincent Gardenin Cosmo Castor, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globes as Rose Castorini and Perry as John Mahoney. It ends without marriage for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Roney are happy together. It was nominated for Best Director for Best Director for Oscar for the Writing for the Screen, and Norman Jason (in the Heat of the Night) and Best Picture, Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Score Original Screenplay, and Best Motion Picture - Golden Globes has been selected for comedy / musical and best screen play. It ranks 96th in 100 years, 100 crores ("snap out of it!"), Ranked 17th in 100 years, 100 passes, and is ranked 41st in 100 years and 100 Laughs. Very nice!
