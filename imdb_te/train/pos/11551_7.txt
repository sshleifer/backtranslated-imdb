ODD COUPLE (3+ outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Many people like Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are always the perfect "Audi couple". Their magnificent work on television since the mid-70s has been a huge water symbol for television ... easily surpassed the stage and screen versions of the story. However, how can Jake Lemmon / Walter Mathau be wrong? Matte Oscar is a good slab. If you have seen Tony Randall's marvelous performance in the past, it will take a little bit of use as lemon felix. The script is fine ... perfectly the best of Neil Simon. (I will record here that Neil Simon is perhaps one of the worst, highest rated journalists of the American Theater). The storyline is linear: Felix, a neat distraction and a newly separated Oscar from his wife, a slab that needs some help to save money on payments . Their lifestyle turns into many marriages, which ends in some fun tussies and spates. Fun and some great one liners.
