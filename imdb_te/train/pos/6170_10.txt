Last year I saw this film at the Duos Film Festival. It's a great, warm novel brought to the screen, beautifully directed and directed. More than anything, it reminded me of David Lean's paintings, its ability to handle the complex story and its ability to create powerful visuals that impacted you at two different levels. The best film I have seen over the years.
