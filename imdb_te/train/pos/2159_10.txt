First, the remake is not good, because the Japanese community is different from us and initially plays a major role in this story as described in this story. It adds humor as well as the warmth of this film. There is a slew of various supporting roles / individuals. Everybody is part of the film's make-up. Today's "gross-out comedies" are filled with the depiction of the comedy. You may still be laughing out loud. In reality, in real life, you do not have the choice who will go with work or school ... The film is really emphasized and shows that people can easily overcome the small differences of natural. Needless to say, it makes for great subtots and a lot of humor. It is the story of the story that actually contains the story, and the best of it. There are some behind-the-scenes articles, but in reality the main storyline is supported. Really well written movie. Dancing is great. I'm a fan of any movie with any kind of dancing, for that aspect. However, the film goes beyond anything else, it is originally fabulous and is written about dance in Japanese society. <br /> 10 to 10.
