I thought the film was really pretty cool. I enjoyed acting and it moved along well. The director really realizes the story he is trying to say. I had to look at the big budget that is coming today, obviously they have so much money to throw at it but it is very visible. When you see this movie for a small budget you need to take it into account when looking at it. There are a few things that can be good, but there are a lot of budget related. This acting is fine F / X and stunts well. The stadough couple is a man who has played a camera. And the boy who played the kid. These films have retained LA work and this is correct.
