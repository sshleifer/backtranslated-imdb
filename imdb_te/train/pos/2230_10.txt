I'm looking for the name of this film for years. I was 14 when I was confident that I was on TV in 1983. It's just about a young man living in a plane crash and I can remember what's out of Amazon. I remembered that I was looking for her (family) and knew how she was taking care of herself --- I'm reminiscent of the fact that she comments this story and knows that she has bugs under her skin. I never remembered this movie and would like to see it again - if it's the same - if any of you have a copy, can you email me at the horse chain? 4hire@hotmail.com? I'm really interested in achieving a copy to see if I actually read the same movie. It was aired in Thanksgiving (US) in 1983, and I'm going through my own problems and this film really influenced me. Thank you in advance!
