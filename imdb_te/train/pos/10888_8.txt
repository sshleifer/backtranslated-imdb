This is one of those small Christmas films for everyone. Our Scrooge Ben Affleck decides that money is not enough, so he rented his family, which he considered his family member. Also? <br /> <br /> Now, Affleck is a hunk, and this fun, if you can not manage them, so if your kid can not handle them, As we walk from time to time through OMG, we remember when we recall ... if he had some neuroinfectious disease in the final stage of the ensemble. But Ben's well-suited to all because this old oracle keeps hope, well, yet we have hope for ladies. Fortunately, Katherine Hara, James Gondolphini, Christina Applegate, Udo Carr and Josh Jackman - keep this shadows-side-ozzy-and-Harriet Christmas as a cheerful, comfortable and warm. <br /> <br /> This movie is kind of you can jump and popcorn, and when you come back, everyone wants to back it up to show what you are missing. Happy picture, after all, and you leave feeling good about life, love, family, christmas and chanel. There really is something for everyone.
