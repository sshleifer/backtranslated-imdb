I recommend reading the book before I watch the movie. The book won the National Book Council Award in 1978 and the most gripping reading (pun intended). It's not too difficult to read often that is not read, so do not be afraid! The book seems to capture more of a desire for relationships and the movie becomes more meaningful after reading the film. Growing up in Melbourne I really relate to this book and movie. Very few Australian female writers have been in the 70s, so in the urban city of Australia during this era or class it is very little recorded about women's life. This is a valuable part of the history of Melbourne. It's a shame that it's the sort of 80's soft porn movie document. Please do not read the DVD jacket as it is too far away and the other reviewer mentioned, it does not indicate what's all about the film. Only those who rent the movie based on this explanation are disappointed. Keep in mind that the film was created in 1982, so they do not expect Hollywood dramatics in the future. I love it. It's great looking at Noni Haleharthrst in this role, it sounds like she is a nobra and it is good to see her acting, because if you are close to my age, you'll remember best for her stunts at Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knows she's hiding this talent? This film gives you a completely new impression. A classic Australian story!
