I caught this at a screening at the Sun Dance Film Festival and was in awe of perfect power to have this film. We examine psychological effects on our soldiers, hoping that they will save our country and take care of our government with respect. According to the film details, soldiers in the boot camp of soldiers were "killers for their country" and placed in wars and later effects after they returned home. This killing is related to human mind. It remembers soldiers and criticizes soldiers rather than other movies, instead criticizing the system that is not ready to meet all the physical and mental needs of undesirable ones. The film is powerful, moving, emotional and thoughtful. It is called a call to arms by supporting our troops by supporting our stickers and by going to parades, but by actually supporting them by supporting them by actually listening to them and ending their health and well-being. <br /> <br /> The best film of the festival is, **** / ****
