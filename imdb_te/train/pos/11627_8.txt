Lisa spent a hotel manager or owner and her flight to Miami. She ends up sitting next to a murderer named Jackson, who said that she had a family's room or her father had died. <br /> <br /> This is a great suspense film, as Lisa has been trying many ways to escape this strategy arranged by Jazzson. The whole storyline was great and I thought they had spent some time on the plane. <br /> <br /> Many of the films have a chance to make the film, but other cinema is good too. <br /> <br /> Because of heart retention, I especially liked the end. I did not know what was going on and I was amazed. For me, this film is just about to go.
