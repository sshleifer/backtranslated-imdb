There are two things that I love about Elvira, they are twice as big as she and she covers them: she is intellect and her talent. It is the best thing to show how well she is or how she should be treated. Mortisia Adams and Anna is a mixed clone of Nicole Smith, she really receives an estate of an occult cousin and realizes that she is truly the heir of the occult. Comedy in the film is the best thing about it, but it can be very scary and cool. It is a campy fare like the fleeing heroine who travels and slips on the riot mob or her heels as too bad horror movie references. She is my favorite part of using her fabulous assets to break the chains of keeping her locked in the cemetery. With the end of Brady's ending ending, the Las Vegas Act at the end looks great for this kind of film.
