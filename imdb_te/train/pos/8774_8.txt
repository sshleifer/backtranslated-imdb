In the late 1800s, San Francisco was pleased with the local "battles" (boxing) co-worker and drunk Jack Carson (Walter Lory), working at the poorly dressed Errol Flynn (James J. Corbett) bank. One day, pretty Alexis Smith (like Victoria Ware) goes to "Comstock Bank", where Mr Flynn works. Flin is taken with the elegant beauty of Ms. Smith, which she provides for her withdrawal purse. <br /> <br /> Flynn's good deed (actually, pickup attempt) is a complimentary member of the Snooty "Olympic Club", which Smith is conveniently a gym (with boxing devices). However, Flynn's ignorant manner, and practical joking (he turns men in parallel bars) will irritate the "club" members. When visiting the English Boxing Champ Club, members try to get Flynn to fight. They are hopefully flimsy to Flin's defeat, but Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> For the first time, producer Robert Buckner placed a good package for Warner Bros. and director Raul Walsh. Buckner is sure to achieve success with the studio's amazing "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Unfortunately, this story is positively ridiculous. There is a "Gentleman Jim" - the story of the original James J. Corbett's autobiography "The Roar of the Crowd". But, the film should be fictional. <br /> Flynn is a very famous man; He easily withdrew the script, and in the early 1940s, should be recognized as an outstanding actor. There are a lot of Flynn's characters (there are?) Great shows neglected, and this is one of them. Smith watched his feminine curiosity, deflecting his emotions to the viewer. Director Walsh sees smoothness smoothly and fiercely. <br /> <br /> Avon Hale (as Pat Corbett) is a non-stop acting wave to ward off a treasure to drive Lone McCollister ("Paging Mr. Corbett"). <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
