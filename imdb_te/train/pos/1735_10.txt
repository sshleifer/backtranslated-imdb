US Civil War from the Franco-Prussian War, Great American West, San Francisco its worst, ballet, opera, videideville, stage coach bandits and a Chinese junk. When you want to get any screws on the plot, it does. It's excellent, taken in the tongue in the cheek. The role of Deckar (where Anna Mary - Naat Salome, her dance character) relied on the work of Lalama Montez, the mistress of the prince of Prussia, and when he gave her the crown jewels. She escaped to the west of America. Arizona has a town in which "Salome, where she was hit," was based on the historical fact that Lola had played the role of Montez Salome. The Russian superiors who come under StageCoach Cleve and her charms are not historically accurate, nor can I assume the Chinese intelligent person with Scottish accent - but my favorite is the one that is breathtakingly beautiful throughout the Camp Classic and DeCarlo all the time.
