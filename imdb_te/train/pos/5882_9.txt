In Mexico, the film is broadcast only on PayTV. Dietrich Bonnoefer's life is a true example of a good person, especially about the good German. The conversations between the Tukur character and the Nazi prosecutor are especially interesting. A real thought war: Two different Germans believe in faith there. Bonhoeffer is a very complex man: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman and great intellectual; Ulrich Tucker Banoeafer. I recommend this film very special, this difficult period for the planet. We do not know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer's life and legacy in Mexico, this is a great job of forgetting the hero.
