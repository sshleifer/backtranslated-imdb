The third contribution to Karlof and Lugosi goes away from Po and goes to the field of science fiction serials. Carloff invented the images of the visual history of the universe by capturing the rays of light by his telescope in the Carpathian Mountains. Janos Rukh plays the role. <br /> <br /> Dr. Benet pulled Ruck's theories into an apro-chemist in the past, demonstrating the existence of an unknown radioactive element where "Radium X", where thousands of years ago fell to Earth in dark Africa In a meteorite. Karlov joins the expedition to prove his theories, but Radium X is a tricky compound - it measures mountain ranges and short-term blindness. The rook is blindfolded, though, and poisons itself, that old-fashioned break-trade rather than shining in the dark! Dr. Benet makes a counter-active look for radiation, but the poison combination and patient ships are suspicious to Rukh. <br /> <br /> He is fraudulent, he wants to take part in a trip to Paris, including his separated wife, in death of his radios ... <br /> <br /> When we see the dead man's murderer Carloff!) And the Radium X device is used for symbolic statues representing the record members. <br /> <br /> There is also a touch of James Whale in a cockyany landslide in Paris. <br /> <br /> The invisible ray movie is very fun at the beginning of gothic. The film does not have pace, but it's always absorbing. Carlofe had a little bit of his performance but lugosi was fantastic. This time, along with Lawn Chaney Jr., with Universal Lawn Chaney Jr. used the primary storyline in Man Made Monster, at which time Melos is more mad doctor than Lewell Atwill Lugosi. The invisible ray is a cheerful and clever little picture. Probably not as other universal horrors, but it works and is fun too.
