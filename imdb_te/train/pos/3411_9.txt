It's easy 9. The most striking role in the lead role in his career is Michael Serrault, an outstanding French and serial killer, performing as an amazing, yet unbearable work featuring Dr. Petitot. <br /> <br /> He is reliable at any time in the film that he has not completely disappeared behind the character - it is only the best to achieve this feat, and only a few episodes are the best when they do it. The whole story (the true story of 20th century France) is very powerful and very dangerous - it makes for a very strong picture of a long time recalled.
