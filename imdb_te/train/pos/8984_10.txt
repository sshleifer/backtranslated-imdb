In my parents' direction, I saw the movie through movie channels for the first time. It's on Sundance channel and just started. I especially loved 60 songs and BJM (Dandis Alright) was alerted. Everything about Brian Jonestown Massacre is unacceptable to me, from the music, from Anton and Joel's personalities. My parents walked and decided to look up their faces as I was seeing the first party sequence when everyone was doing lines (great). <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite films because it introduced me to Brian Jonosten massacre.
