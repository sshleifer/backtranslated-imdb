The motion of the film is very beautiful (Olly suffers from "Hornobabia"), a film that is a fun and enjoyable film. This is much better than the one they did after the film - this is the film Laurel and Hardy produced by the last Hall Roach. In fact, both of these are missing loses all the chemistry, losing entirely of their films and playing for their portraits - it's not saying that Laurel and Hardy have never made the movies. <br /> Stan and Ali work in a horn factory. This sounds pretty funny, but it's not. Surprisingly, with all the racquets, Olly has a nervous breakdown and the work must take some time. The doctor (James Finlayson - in his final film with the team) indicates a sea trip. However, they do not like sailing and Stan has an idea of ​​renting the boat just attached to the dock - then they can get all the sea air without all the trouble! When they were in the boat, a dangerous escape criminal criminals boat and they all unexpectedly set in the ocean. Fortunately, the part of this film is really well and ultimately works very well. <br /> <br /> It is not a great full-length Laurel and Hardy film, it has no annoying and disturbing musical numbers (like the devil's brother or as in Babes in Tailland). Moreover, there is still a good amount of physical comedy - almost no one can see after this film. This was partly due to the decline of boys' demeaning health (and Olly's growing navel), and part of it caused the overall loss of later films.
