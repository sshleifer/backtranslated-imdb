There were a lot of discussions about "psychedelic Western", but it was really low in the genre. It has a well-known name for the stars, but it is a good film director. Stewart Granger loses his British safari hunter stereotype, who plays the venerable buffalo in the West. Robert Taylor (in contrast to the typical young man jumping up, the role of Taylor is also middle age), who kills the buffalo, and pushes Granger into business with him. They are hired by two big actors, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblin as their skins. Graham is haunted by a buffalo he has killed, if they are gone, if they are gone, if they are gone, the Native American lifestyle will suffer very well. Taylor immediately reveals a positive side, but this is realistic, rather than a dimensional solitaire of the modern film, created by nerds and dorks. He is insecure and requires human companionship. Still, he will not stop at the murder. At the end of each other is trapped and frightening end. Mental effects are well depicted what they are doing.
