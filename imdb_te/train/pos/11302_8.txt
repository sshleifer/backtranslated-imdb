Oh, those false Italians. In this case, this novel is not the first time based on an image on the subject of the source without permission or knowledge of the author. Of course it's not something that is usually Italian but most of the early days of the film have been completed, mostly because they often thought they could get away. James M. Cain's publishers were able to continue the American screens until 1976, although the film became a bit of a classic known. <br /> <br /> The American version of 1946 but it's a great movie. It's not very low in the movie, it's a very strong story, it's a mysterious and some great characters and realism. This closely follows the novel and is more like the other movie versions of its story, which is a distinction set in an Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Make a film about life and real people in Italy. This early play has always been a very realistic concept and so you'll see a lot to watch. Unfortunately, the film lost its power at the end of the film, which began to drag a bit overlapping and folding into the film. This image is easily ended 15 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> However, I do not have much disadvantage to say about this film. It is great to be based on equally great and strong source material. Lachen directed Viscotti, the director of the great and memorable Italian dramatic films, has been a very spectacular direction. <br /> <br
