<br /> <br /> Now that my movies are greatly appreciated by stories and dialogues, but now, like the Moon Walker, there is a lot of flaws. /> <br /> This film is no more than the most entertaining Michael Jackson's announcement. In the film 'Myr in the Mirror' he goes through all the high levels of his life, starting with a sickly video listed in his life's successes, bits and bumps, and then in the really entertaining segment he is a funny music video for the bad 'and' speed demon ' Manik stop-motion while driving from fans, and finally hare Follows the adventures of MJ dancing against Lu. If you believe some, that stop motion is not bad. <br /> Then 'leave me alone', and a great video for the main feature directly. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is ridiculous. Very ridiculous. Michael is going out of a building, and then thousands of troops will be shot and killed. Then we hit the flashback, showing that the MJ and the three children fall on the underground cave. 'Big Big' (Joe Pesky) is a villain suffering from a plan to get every child in the world at the 'narcotics' (no specifics are mentioned) at a young age. MJ and the little girl he got caught, then chased ... yada yada yada. The plot is not really important part. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> It's cool cool sequences, where MJ changes in a car, then the robot-spaceship, and the wonderful 'Smooth Criminal' MJ is wonderful for anyone . It has its greatest achievements, and some cool little bits and some very good special effects (especially robot / spaceship sequence), especially if you can find out about quid in eBay, but it looks like. It keeps children calm for two hours, and there are more than 20 monmings that have children.
