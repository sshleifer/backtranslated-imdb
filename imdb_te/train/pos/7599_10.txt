The last thing shown on the front TV is imaginable. You could not guess who will die or find something, but lost you could not guess what. Every thing is very surprisingly amazing and it's not really a mystery because it's so many secrets but because everything is so great it is nothing like it before. I literally become addicted to it. Art is the standard work of art. It gives you something to look forward to each week. It's intellectual. In the surrounding beach is calm and warm and the forest is very scary. These characters are intellectual in each of them, especially on the island. These characters are very dramatic, and their deaths can not be estimated because they have a lot of secrets that can do much more and affect many other images that are dying along with them.
