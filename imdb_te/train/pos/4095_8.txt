Now my friends, old films like "La Bate" ("Beast" or "O Manstro") will only be made in the old continents :) We see in the picture: horses are dirty sex, numphomannic kind of gorilla, non emotion and ruthless, sometimes Valerian Borovik ( The Director) shows us innocence, sexual violence, rape and loss. Brutality. Its amazingly cinematic experience, full of bizarre and grotesque scenes. I would recommend this film to all fans of Europe who are shocking. If you like it, I would recommend "Orlof Against The Invisible Man" and "Alternate States".
