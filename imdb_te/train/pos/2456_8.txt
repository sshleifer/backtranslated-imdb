My expectations were really low when I went to watch this film, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to see a boring teen-flick, but the plot was interesting and well executed, acting somewhat convincingly - especially from Melville showing his talent in the film. <br /> <br /> I think the audience deserves it. It's a picture, which can be seen by the whole family - probably not small children since it has some rather tough scenes. Your family loves you against the traditions, and about a film about the problems that occur. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is like "Bend Like Beckham", but I actually think the film is good.
