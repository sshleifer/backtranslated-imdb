I rented this for my son who had recently been interested in 9/11. He did not know what kind of a kindergarten at the time and outside. I liked what I said "the documentary." If I have a picture that I recommend to look at 9/11, it will be one! You generally see the movie with the actors. No one knows this movie. Also, you will see a movie related to 9/11, you hear about both lost fire-fighter or their lives saved by people. I did not think it was anything! I rented this movie and added it to my collection! Very well done! My heart goes out to 9/11 victims and families!
