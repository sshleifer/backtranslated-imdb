I am in "Christopher Ree Generation", who is still the best actor to play Superman but does not stop me from enjoying other actors in that role, and Chris, who is at the top of a nice bid to hit George Reeves, is a bit shorter. It does not stop me from enjoying this film, it's going to happen a lot. It requires an image, beginning, middle, and a plot with the end, plus all the parts are cleverly written. The film is a feature film in both acting and storyline, with a movie Nair something but tights. The story is exciting and meaningful, this is a movie that is not much pre-free. The film was filmed for 12 years, and we should not wait five years to see if Hollywood's fame is to come to the development of the film ... The film is polished and talented, directed by Lee "Roll'" Shoemel, both for speed and efficiency Is famous for directing. It slowly slows technical limitations, while actually creating some creative tasks, creating a camera in a boom on a truck and a high move and passing fast Superman's perspective, a few moments of George's work and a long shot of animated Superman. <br /> It is now available on the DVD as an extra feature of the first season of the George Reeves television series. A DVD value that owns its own right, including its original image, is icing on the cake. <br /> Give Blood Now God Bless You!
