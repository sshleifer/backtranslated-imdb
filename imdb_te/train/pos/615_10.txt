This is the essence of the fairy tale! The villains are completely evil and leaders are refreshingly holy. Danes, Dinero, and Pfeiffer are amazing, a new actor who plays Tristan. Outstanding performances, pleasant magic, funny and dramatic, and accurate fairytale make this film absolutely fantastic! I am suitable for younger children but not suitable for older audiences, are delightful delicacies! The previews will not do justice to this movie! My fianc√© and I are very skeptical, but I took a chance on this film and hope to get somebody in the fence about that movie.
