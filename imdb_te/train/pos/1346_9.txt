The British Film Institute made a documentary with Martin Scorsese as "Rette" in the top 100 films of AFI. <br /> <br /> I am a huge fan of movies and proud of watching movies. But I'm comparing my statue. In this fantastic documentary, Scorsese runs the viewer through several stages of American history. It is divided into several sections, such as Western, Gangster film and Noir. Bouncy enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is a great tour guide as well as an excellent professor.
