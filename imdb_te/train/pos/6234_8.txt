It is my favorite time Fred Austerir and Ginger Rogers film. The conversation between the two is very beautiful and funny and very clever. The film has some of the best tracks recorded by both of these; I'm putting all the cues in One Buttet and let's face the music and dance. I remember it correctly, so I always have a special place in my heart (I'm sorry for Sentimental Crop * P but I get a woman) so I get 8/10 from this movie. Choreography is awesome and makes it even more beautiful in Lucille Ball.
