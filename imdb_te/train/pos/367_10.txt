"Purple Purple" is really amazing. It's nothing, and I do not think I'll ever be there. It is the emotional response of the viewer and the roller's cost of pain. The actors are flawless and directive is amazing. I totally liked it. I'm never happy with the film. It is beautiful, the best way to explain it.
