I found this a fascinating adaptation, very agile and fun finish. With the exception of a couple of major flaws, the cast is excellent. I had to make some comments back earlier - Chinna Phillips is a terrible evil as a teenager. At the age of 27, she is too old (and yes, it displays), and there is no singing "chops" for Broadway-style music. Vanessa Williams is a good-enough singer and, for the non-dancer, she is right. However, she is not Latina, and her character is perfect. <br /> <br /> Sweet Apple's Conrad Birdy's Fan Club is really glittering - with the special splendor of Brigitte Day and Chiaara Janny. I normally enjoyed the performance of Tyne Dal√≠, but I'm not usually a fan of her work. Finally, Dancing Shiners is a riot, especially the dirty three in the bar. <br /> <br /> The film is for the whole family, and I highly recommend it.
