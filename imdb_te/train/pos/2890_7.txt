12th Animated Disney Classic is a reasonable film that is told by a simple story. Even though it is small, it has reached a spot on the Disney Classic list. <br /> It's not Disney's masterpiece, but it's satisfying. One of Disney's "simplest" writings, yes, but a certain magic and magic (old Disney is very popular). This is an important film for keeping Disney in a delicate situation. If this is a failure, Disney does not have animated classics. <br /> "Cinderella" refers to Disney's first animated classic ("Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" style of fairy tales, although it is not clear where the story is going, but it is based on the story by Charles Perrault that it is nowhere in France. /> <br /> There are plenty of favorite characters like Cinderella, Prince and Bruno. (Dog), Jacks and Gus (Two Main A Fairy godmother (fairy, she is absolutely funny for a fairy), birds, king and grand duke. <br /> <br /> Jacks are very smart and fun.I love his voice and actually have a quality like mouse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Trimine (stepmother) is not as favorable because " Sleeping Beauty ", Prince Philip was inspired by this Prince. Because she was cold, jealous, bitter and ruthless. Her daughters (Anastacia and Derrigella) are no better than her. However, stepmother is not as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughters. Cinderella, the main character, is not with them. Cinderella is sensitive, kind, beautiful and lovable. By the way, I think it's much nicer than the one that gave her cute pink dress fairy godmother. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (cat) is ridiculously detrimental. He walks his nose in the air as he walks, makes him happy with the haughty and snobbish facial expressions. Amorous mother is very fond when he comes to personality. He always agrees with Cinderella's step motherly attitude. Lucifer has the right name because he is such a demon and a cat. Yet, there is nothing annoying about him. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is simple but pleasant, not the best of Disney. <br /> <br /> James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Elinar Audley, Verna Feltton, and Louis van Routen have the most talented voice actors in this regard. <br /> <br /> While it is common, the film has a good deal of art and its good details. However, the King's Palace is a fantastic masterpiece, truly majestic and huge.
