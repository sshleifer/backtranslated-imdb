OK - you want to test someone of how comfortable with their adolescents and the pesky and maniac changes thirin - then get their immediate response from watching this camouflage doc about the kids making suburban 80s social horror flicks. More than any film that has never been seen, the film is completely human, with no different sexuality and ego, is somewhat frustrating, the kind of youth characteristic goodness that distinguished the fearful adult world that nobody has ever known to be harassed from quirk madness. Mini-giant Darren Stein is attempting a deep understanding of his success and suspicion of being the patron of the perfect child's world. He does not always look good in himself and others - but shows what age can be improved and restored. What is the change without reflection I love this movie.
