Basil Rathbone is an unexpected humorous chemistry, when a fun enough musical, what's stuck with me about this film-the composer, and Oscar Levant his assistant. Rattbaugh's role appears to have come out of bed without help, with a high stardom, distracted artistic type (such as the most frightening villains from his well-known characters or the more logical Sherlock Holmes). And that help Starbuck, played by Oscar Levan with his usual drill humor. After appointing Crosby as his ghostly songwriter, Rathbone introduced him to Starbucks, "He's going to make my idea for me." Levant responded, "Ah, it's just part-time job." Of course this ratbone, who fretting too busy about falling from his next hit song (or over) goes right. As another reviewer says, Rathbone is very funny! There are not many opportunities to showcase his funny talent.
