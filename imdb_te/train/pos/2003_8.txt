The main problem of the first "Vampires" film is that none of the characters are sympathetic. Carpenter learned from his mistake and at this time used a preferred vampire hunter and attractive vampire. The Lady Vampire Una is definitely the coolest Vampire after the Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately there are some good things like a cool slow motion restaurant scene (Why did Carpenter not use this much ??) This film is not good anywhere. I would like to see the vampire vampire in action and at least feel frustrated when at least one long dance directed line of action (eg within the city). "Los Muertos" continues at faster than its predecessor, which still drags a little in some areas (somewhere near evil as "vampires"). <br /> <br /> The climax of this film is not as intense as the "Vampires" eventually. <br /> <br /> Many of the above mentioned are "Los Murtos" not exactly a bad image. It is generally enjoyable in good entries for the genre. It's not an intriguing Dracula remake (like almost every other vampire movie there) or a brilliant action entertainment like Blade II. <br /> <br /> You really want to see the third installment of the Carpenter, but this does not happen. <br /> <br /> The spoiler warning end is very predictable. Una must have been away - the film was extraordinary.
