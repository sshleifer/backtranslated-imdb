This film is topped in many ways. Everything works well here; Casting, acting, script and cinematography are all first-rate. For the filmmaker, the moving, violent story of love and human liberation. For film critics, there is plenty of sharp technique and technology merit. There are some tactical blunders, and discussions on the boards, if the CIA agent has a tough form with the training coin that ends with no realism. However, I do not end up with the CIA Agent's cynical approach, but I'm ending with the fact that Crese praises his soul to the Ultimate without taking into consideration the consequences. Christ Himself, as Christ Himself will be supernatural by His sacrifice, in fact it is practical meaning or not. In any event, I congratulate the Cresc√© of dealing with traditional bourgeois morality and removing one of his research quests for justice that would give the bad guys herself and the liberation of the innocent. <br /> <br /> If you are attracted to the film, it is worth watching this movie. An excellent soundtrack, great writing, flawless cast and solid performances across the board are transformed into this top-100 (or better) film.
