I received a DVD release of this film, which was released with English subtitles when it was a holiday in Norway. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed and powerful. The 'frits' who plays a major role miraculously reflects the tragic events surrounding him with painful accuracy with an open face. <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the film, mental health issues have problems and this suggests that the cruel headmaster refuses to attack the boy and that it is his own father. <br /> <br /> Fries refuses to show respect for the headmaster; <br /> <br /> He is standing on his ground and repeats 'Liar' because he is under attack by his colleagues. <br /> <br /> The films that are weaker are the only teacher in the clich√© flower power 'book that uses the' friendly teacher 'trick. Apart from this I'm sure the movie you will really enjoy.
