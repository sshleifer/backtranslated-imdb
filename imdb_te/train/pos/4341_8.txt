Do not have any problems with parents? <br /> <br /> Parents have no problem solving. But laughing in the film, the comedy is well and the drama is well done. <br /> <br /> I always liked Paul Riser and Peter Faulk, and I was concerned that their star features could be too large for a small movie, but first enchanted from the scene. The son is a man discovering his father's discoveries. And the hard work, sacrifice is the perfect balance point of Peter Falk's monologue about the father and husband. Without taking that scene, the film is much less visible and the role is less. <br /> Well, Paul and Peter!
