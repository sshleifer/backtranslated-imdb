I have not rented this due to almost all bad comments but did it anyway. I thought it was similar to the dark waters which I liked. The only part I dreaded about the ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station. They made funny and the dialogue made me laugh but it's not comedy. It's unnecessary because the movie has made me a bit offensive. The rest of the movie should be a horror or suspense film. The make-up is good and I have seen the worst movies in this one way. This is a simple story with reliable acting. It's not horrible or gagi movie, but I watched after seeing or looking back. The other movies on the DVD are all look good on the previews and I'm going to check them out.
