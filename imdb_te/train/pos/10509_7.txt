I did not read this novel, but I understood it was quite different from it; This is the fact that I really enjoyed it, which is really not my style, which leads me to the decision not to continue reading the book. For reading the single word of Austin's writing, I can not really compare what's in my work. I can say that almost every line of this dialogue is wise, witty, and well distributed, as well as the comedy in this is the largest source. This made me laugh too loud, with perfect British and verbal material. Spot-on in each acting show, and Paltrow is a complete wedding casket. The letters are well written, credible and consistent. I have made them both very frustrating, but at least I feel that some people are thought to be funny, it will come again and again, and it's not the first time they're honest. Editing and cinematography are excellent, and everything is totally gorgeous. Plot and motion is good, you will never be bored. It really ends up in the * obvious way, but the audience likes the likes. I can not say it does not make me entertained, it's done from start to finish, and I can see it again. It has a short language. I recommend this to a fan of romance. 7/10
