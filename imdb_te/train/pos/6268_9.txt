Carter Wong plays the role of a great leader in the quest for a hygienic book, which seeks ultimate revenge on him! The motion is very good in this movie and there are a lot of fighting scenes in the film. Flying glyotins appear to be bad and the main villain has no problems using them. Even though the story is not strong, the action is fun and attracts you to the end (I thought you had a sequel). <br /> <br /> Camping and darkness, it's great ollal Kung Fu !!
