This is one of the humorous, tragic and most accurate films of psychology that has been shot over the 45 years after the Balkans. All the common characters and contradictions are combined with such anger, sadness and love, that crying or laughing is impossible to decide more correctly. The accuracy and timelessness of the images, however, make for a great image to see if one wants to understand what a little bit of its picture is put into the former Yugoslavia mad. In fact, no diplomats dealing with this film should try anything until the film is seen, and its Twin * Marrotta Trace PokeCooki * I'm one of the funniest films I have ever seen?
