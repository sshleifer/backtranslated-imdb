When I first saw this film, I was very young to Riemenberg. But I saw a second time 7 years ago. My sister had to see me. It has recalled my whole family now. We'll quote at least once a day. I love this film completely. At this point I'm laughing. Sure, it's about really, really not responsible for millions. The whole point is that there is still humanity lost in what we see in this movie. And he is ready to give it all for love. I highly reflected this film for anyone who wants a laugh. Very laughing. If its poor, sweet, and if your an image buff, it will truely change your idea of ​​"funny". See with your friends group or your family and I promise that you will never be able to talk again with some power lines over your head. It will make you laugh in the coming years. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see my family's favorite movie. But this film, I feel, made us closer. I know I'll do the same for you !!
