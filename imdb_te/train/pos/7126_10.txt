The film resonated with me on two levels. As a child I was evacuated from London and planted on living uninhabited guests in the country village. The experiences I made when I escaped the bomb (listening to a dark night on the first night) and enjoyed life in London, I lost my family and was worried about them. Tom is an old man, whose wife and children are both dead and lives in a small country village alone. An old man whose children are now married and have been away without living in another province, and I'm just a little alone again. The mother of the boy and child raising is a religious scandal with very odd ideas. Since Tom grew up with a deep love between Oakley and this young man, Tom is looking for him and finally saves him from odd and dangerous situations. By the end of the story, there is great tension because of some form of government, and it seems that a person who has developed a loving relationship with him will lose.
