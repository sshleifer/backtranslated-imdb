Starfucker (which reads Starrack in my box) is the most amazing movie I have ever seen. I thought this is one of the best films I've ever seen. Why not 10? Nothing is sure. Why Jamie Kennedy proved to be one of my favorite actors in this interesting form of dark side of Hollywood. I forced some others to watch the film and admitted that it was the best film ever.
