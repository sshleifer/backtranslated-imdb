When I was on CBS, I saw this jolly small movie at the age of 10/11 in 1979. I do not know this is in a theater. <br /> <br /> As a young child at the time, it seemed a little "girlish". <br /> <br /> The clock scene called Gazooks is a bit of an occasional worry for the daylights tickles out of everyone but you overtake that sort of thing. <br /> <br /> When I found the blockbuster video back in 1995, I had to look back again! I liked it despite the fact that I still looked a bit "old". <br /> <br /> I think the other reviewer here is not in VHS. <br /> This is where it is. At least on the DVD, at least I hope. I'll share with my kids some day! Here are 10 stars, which is still a great children's picture. <br /> 09/08/2009: Finally found a VHS copy !! Hooray!
