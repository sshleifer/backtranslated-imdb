If you enjoy romantic comedies, you will find two 30-year old singles that fall in love when the American League pennant is satisfied. On the other hand, if you are waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, then you must avoid it. This scheme meets girl friends, girl guy meets friends, and meets girl parental scenes. A girl girl meets the scene of a pet dog. For course in the course like this is all equal. However, I enjoyed it and they delved into the process of making the decision as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is actually a bit quirky. Answer these questions; How quiet it is and how much love to drink that quirk? The characters are very interesting to see that work, because the deep down (if we accept it) has all the quirks. Barrymore has done a good job in his role and the Fallon Sarta surprised me - he was good. I am rated as a romantic comedy from 10 to 7. Add a point if you are a baseball fan or engage in romance with one another. Add another point if you're a Red Sax fan and remove two points if you're an Yankees fan.
