I want to see a resurrection in the seahundi series with a Teach today, which will bring me a child's enthusiasm. The black and white TV grew up and Seanhot with Gunsmoke was my hero every week. My vote for a rebuilding of a new sea hunt. TV requires change of pace and it works for the world under water adventure. By the way, there are many movies to watch tv and many opinions. So my belief is what I have to say. It's nice to read some plus points about sea hunting. If my poems have 10 lines, I doubt it and need to leave me, if so, I'll do that.
