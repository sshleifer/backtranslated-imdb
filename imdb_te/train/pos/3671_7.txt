Peter O'Brien, director, has seen many people from California, the film seems to be the right way to deal with people trying to invest in Canada's economy. The successful novel "Moon Lantern", written by a Canadian writer, became "Flight to Bogota", which did nothing with the original image. <br /> <br /> Michael Bates, who is engaged in what is happening in Iran, serves as a catastrophic major role. <br /> <br /> The film is too big, it seems to be the case for the final product saved by the producer Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who produced the film documentary film in Toronto, the episodes of the film were eventually transformed into a cohesive film. <br /> <br /> The process of filming is happy, and acting is generally good.
