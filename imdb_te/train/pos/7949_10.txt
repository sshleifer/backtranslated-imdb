<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Incredible Journey is an important movie in my life, because it is the first film I've seen in the cinema in my hometown of 4 years old: Housework Bound. This story is based on the Sheila Burnford novel and can not be written as a brainless lossy clone. <br /> <br /> Basic story: A new husband in the two dogs and cat's happy marine family gets a new job in the city and sends animals that have survived for a few months and temporarily move to San Francisco to temporarily move. The bonds between the children and the children they will look are especially strong, and the shadow is a heartfelt such as the Golden Retriever and the Sassy Himalayan cat kids, a young and happy-lucky American Bulldog Chance, with less anxiety and a little bit of retirement (as part of his voice-over, a kid Explaining, taking to an animal shelter and him Family). Important storyline. <br /> <br /> The three pets are widespread and dangerous wilderness (the way to the wilderness wilderness settings), the adventures of the escape and direction of the direction. While family and Ranch hostesses are suddenly concerned about the disappearance of the animal, they face many risks as they expect to reach home. Conversations between the three animals and the happy lines (see - memorable quotes) and the great heroes, the heart movements that grow between the main characters during the storytelling, the sassy's pride to cross the river without wet causes, falling into her river and a waterfall, loss of the depression felt by the audience). <br /> I can not see any narrative and the journey they're taking, including the lost girl in the jungle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The shadow breaks into a pit in a triyard and finds that his leg is hurt and finds it hard to find and learn. Up, tired, and then chans him to climb him, telling him how important it is, and he should not be thoroughly dismissed as to how far away he has been. <br /> <br /> When this scene (brilliantly made) is unchallenged, moving to the final scene when motion and sassy return home, but Shadow is not visible somewhere. Then just seems all lost, he looks slow, and meets back with the family. Chance's conclusion at the end speaks about the adventures that he has developed between himself and his companions on the go, and how to find out what really happened to his home to go to his home, but how the other two holds as well. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I do not read Sheila Burnford's book, so I'm pretending to know the difference between the book and the movies. But all the family members see the movie, and the toots talking animals, the older audiences understand the plot line well (as I saw when I saw the movie again after many years of watching). <br /> <br /> The film is a great masterpiece in the film, and if you do not see it, you can go out and get it. <br /> And avoid the sequel (see my review for Homeward Bound II!)
