I'm very sad to have loved this show and I felt it came back too much, but only two stupid weeks. That's terrible. I hate how I never find out how everyone ends. It sucks. Takes you back! ABC is a supervisor and stunted performances such as Atonot but does not give time as good as Six Degrees. If they complain about ratings, it's probably good because it's probably a bad slot because it's really good, what I'm saying and looks forward to. JJ Abrams delivered, he is awesome, I wish ABC can trust him enough just to complete the story. I loved the whole cast. I could not wait to see how everyone met someday at once. Everyone's story is now incomplete, and I do not know if Steven and Whitney are together or with Carlos and Me. I see what happens to Laura or Damian and everyone else. It's really a donor.
