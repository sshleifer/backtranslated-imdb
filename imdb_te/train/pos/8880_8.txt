(Some) life in colleges. <br /> <br /> When I go to colleges in Southern California and have a lot of species hanging along with them, there are also artistic licenses that you have seen in the film. This is a school for racial unity, equality etc. because it's fun and I can say honestly, it's there. But when they are out of class class, or when they are looking for class, they (students) will sleep with people of their own race or ethnic origin. Is it bad? Not really. Everyone needs a feeling of belonging. But when one of the schools I attended, the school paper wrote, "We must try to hang out with all the other classes of students and learn them." <br /> You're creating your own dissection. <br /> I was sure that racism was one of the schools I attended. Once there are some signs of racist organizations that hold leaflets around campus talking about the Aryan race's glories. <br /> <br /> Luckily, the young Caucasian man went on and started shooting during multiculturalism collection. There was nothing like the incident in the film. <br /> <br /> I hope and pray that nothing like this will ever happen. > <br /> So "Higher Learning" Overdone Dramatic? Exaggeration? May be. Is it "mark off?" It depends on where you go or where you go to school. The racial nature of races is their own. Minus for Hollywood exaggeration, the race thing is pretty home to me.
