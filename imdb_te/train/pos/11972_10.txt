I grew up watching a full house as a kid. I stopped watching it for years, but two weeks ago I started looking again. Now my kids will see the show and they like to see it as well. <br /> <br /> My kids can not believe DJ in this program, and I am the same age. These are good teachings that your children can learn from. There is no drugs and no violence on it. Also in children, on the program, they can always open up for the help of their family for the problem. The message is that children should now receive a day from TV, turn to your family for help, not to drugs. <br /> <br /> Now I have to look at programs like a full house instead of half a tumor on TV on TV. <br /> <br /> You love this show because you laugh it out and it's going to land. It talks about real life issues and family matters. <br /> I'll learn a lesson from performance 10.
