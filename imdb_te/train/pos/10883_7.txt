This is surprisingly above average slasher, that is enjoyable and well made, some good gore! All the characters are good, and the story is very fun, plus Molly Ringwold played a very annoying bitch. I bought this in a pawn store for 1 $, and it's surprisingly worth, and special effects are pretty damn good for the budget, plus I loved the mask worn by the killer as somewhat creepy. Even though I have beaten and predicted the killer, it's ultimately very fun, and all the characters except Ringwald are surprisingly pretty. It was decently done and written, and I felt very creative and original at the same time, plus some of the death scenes were quite impressive. This killer is not mess around, and I enjoyed it, and slasher fans (like) really enjoy this movie, plus the beginning is really very bad, filming them! This is a surprisingly above average slasher, that is enjoyable, and well made, some good gore, and I think the watch is well worth it! Directing is good. Kimble Rendall is good! Working with solid camera work, keeping a creepy setting, good angles and a fast moving speed. Acting is great! Molly Ringwald plays a very good role in Bitch, and hurt me as she forgot, and after all she wanted to be the heroine, she was fine at the end, but not much, I was surprised to make this film, but she did a fantastic job! Frank Roberts is amazing as a killer, he has menacing, creepy and a hell of a mask, and does not mess around with this guy, he is amazing! Kylie Minogue plays a very good role in her small role. Jessica Napier is fine as beautiful and other heroine. The rest of the cast is good. Watch value is great! *** in 5
