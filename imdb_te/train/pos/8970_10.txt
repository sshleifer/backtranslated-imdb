The film made a little research and found a website, which in fact is an inner joke about homosexuals and Lesbians' post-WWII Greenwich Village world. Except Stewart and Novak, war and witches suggested that alternative lifestyle. John Van Druuten of Stage's play is clearly familiar with homosexuals and the Greenwich Village. Because I was in my 5th or 6th grade, my parents took me to the first theater that I saw in Bell, Book and Candle because I thought this was sad. It's difficult for me to have a movie that does not have horses, machine guns or alien monsters and I want to be bored. But, Jimmy Stewart took Kim Novak on the building of the Flatiron, pulled his hat back and the camera went to it. The incredible George Dunling's love theme grew, and I had a sense of what I felt like suddenly fall in love with it. I was surprised at the first emotionally romantic / sexual love when I left the theater. I am sure Kim Novak's fierce, not only adolescent boy who's fascinated by live gaze. It's contradictory that a gay parable is able to pacify the sexes in most of us. I am now at the end of my 50s and have seen yesterday evening and fifty years later I saw that hat touch. . .
