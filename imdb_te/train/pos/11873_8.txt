In 1983, director Brian De Palma decided to portray the progress and fall of an American gangster, and he decided to make a film through an incredible gameplay by Olivier Stone and a slightly impractical work by an unusual cast. This resulted in one of his most memorable characters of "Scarface" starring Al-Skichino. The story began in May 1980, when Cuba Marill opened the port at Cuba, and allowed Cuban people to join their families in the United States. At that time 125,000 left Cuba, free grasshoppers in the United States, many honest and hardworking people and thanks to the opportunities they granted. But that's not all. In Marilotos, Florida, there were about 25,000 criminal records and fewer than the peaks of Cuba's prisons - the criminals who freed and wanted Castro to retire. Although Al Capone was considered Chicago nearly fifty years ago, they also gave an opportunity to America. And one of the most prestigious ones is the Donna Montana (Pacino), known as "Corkcorda" for his colleagues. <br /> <br /> Now, Montana wanted to come up with the idea that he was excluded from the yoke of communism that he had just wished; And from the moment he escaped the boat in Florida, he determined that he had it all. Wealth and power - It's a dream of Montana and he has done well, he started fittingly in favor of a man named Miami in the name of Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). Lopez, a brother in a Cuban's cousin in his memoir, has his brother in Coupe, who spent far more than his use of Castro, eventually ignored, and now Little Havana, along with Montana, all Cubans escaped from their boats, Their papers from the government They awaited. And in the shortest sequence, Monta√±a Lopez's brother sees a vengeance and sets the stage for his own entry into the underworld of America. <br /> <br /> The wealthy businessman Lopez Montana and his friend, Manny (Steven Bauer) with the right connections, keep them back and hold them to work. On his day, Cappone may have illegal trafficking by his treasury with illegal profits, but Lopez is the modern day and it is more profitable: cocaine. Lopez takes Montana under his wing, and brings him back to life, but once he gets tasted, Montana is satisfied by any way, Lopez finds it fit to throw his way out and wants to be a course: 'on the top. 'With a cold-blooded, iron, Montana, he decides what he wants to get out of it, whatever it costs. But before it is over, he will realize the price for his dream, and he will pay; But for a brief moment, he probably finds himself like the man. <br /> <br /> In the eyes of Dee Palma, he lives more than Montana in Pacino and he does it beautifully. He influenced the slang (he invented it - and he did), to the body language and attitude, he earned it, and it convinced Montana and did much more. Some of the actors (de Nero) can play the role, nuance and style. This is not exactly a sympathetic character, and you are instantly associated with Montana on a personal level. But even though Pacino's screen presence is harder to engage with him, it is so strong that it makes him fully engrossing role. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance as well, in the role that put her on the way to glory. Elvira, a woman who has become an integral part of Montana, is Pfeiffer's subtle and poor, which gives any sense of the bottom when influencing the cold and distant external appearance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] <br /> <br /> Supporting cast Mary Elizabeth Mastrotonio (Gina), Miriam Colon (Mama Montana), F. Murray Abraham (Omar), Paul Shenar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein). The most recent and highly acclaimed 'Traffic,' and 'Blow,' and 'Wild Bunch of Pequinapy', de Palma's "Scarface," actually has a climactic scene criticized by critics, certainly the American gangster saga. A lot of violence has been suggested than graphic, but the film still has a margin of realism that is somewhat disturbing. But if you are with it, there is a lesson to learn. And as many lessons in life, the most valuable is often the hardest to take in time. But the gift is always worth it, and it's way with this picture. I rate this one 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
