"Basic Training" movies have an appetite for hunger, so it has a very low notice when it was first released. It seems to have a well-deserved second life on DVD / VHS. <br /> <br /> Tigerland is not uniformly great, but there are some horrible roles (especially the role of NCO, Lee's full-maternity jacket, to return to Erme) but Colin Farrell's main performance is instant stardom. Charisma is a character to burn and get an actor.
