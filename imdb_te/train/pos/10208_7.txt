We rarely see such small comments written by IMDb artists. Is this lightweight dark comedy dull and enjoyable or something missed? <br /> If you have some incentives, you will see again. For French it was "Le Boutement de Isles du Papillon" Serendipity? Rule? Perhaps it is an event at the end of a series of random events. We all have this (which is called life) but when you look at this, you are "random" more "fated." Feel like it might begin to get the feeling. The film may be mainly small, depending on a major lifetime decision on the accuracy when some of the leaves of Lettes fall on the back of a truck or throw a stranger of a pebble. These events have caused other events ... well you get the picture? Dominoes. Your imagination should really be expanded to accommodate 30 letters and 6 inches and accept the remote possibility of this scenario. And what I feel is a diagnosis of life is like life. <br /> <br /> We agree that these writers / directors will combine these unrelated events into this narrative and be a fun story of the lives of these French citizens. If you have two hours and you're looking for a strange escape, this is where you need to do it. Or you are recovering from the surgery and do not go anywhere, it will force you to cure your secretions. <br /> <br /> "Happensstance" does not come down as an award winner, but it must develop a cult. <br /> Soren Kiereggard attributed the following: "Life can only be withdrawn, but it will go forward." If you see many details in your own life experiences (when you meet your first love, the perfect gift, your final auto accident), you will find a series of random events that lead to it. <br /> <br /> That answer! I forgot to bring the existentialist to explain "Happenstence".
