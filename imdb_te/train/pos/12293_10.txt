This is a fantastic movie, which is not available on video / DVD, but is a kind of treasure that can only be caught by rare film shows. The film starts and ends with two lovers who begin with (they happen in the middle of a long time, and they are not in one place at this time), giving you a close feel and feel and everything is right for the world. If you have a chance to see this film, then do it. I can not wait to see it again, and I wish I could put it in a normal release.
