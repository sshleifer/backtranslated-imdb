<br /> From this 10 I would rate this rate 10. <br /> It just provides insight into what I can understand - surfers surf because they want to do it; Something like surfing does not matter; It's not temporary - it's a lifetime surfing for people who are buried in the movie; I never surfed, but I love surfing the movies, and seeing many. The film did not teach me what the film did. It flows well. Interviews are the best. This is very interesting from start to finish <br /> <br /> In summary, this is as good as the documentary I have seen, so I have to rate it in terms of it. So 10/10
