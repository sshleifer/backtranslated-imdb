Go to Thailand for the last experience before two adventurous teenagers, good friends, uncles and before going to a college. It seems like a pleasant time for an exotic land tour, until they meet a glamorous stranger that tucks them into Hong Kong and puts them in their luggage drugs. They are caught by local police and justice in Asia is very different. <br /> <br /> This is the main storyline for "Brockdown Palace" and that's fine. The film does a good job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt judicial systems of the Third World. In fact, the filming is beyond jail, because prison conditions are often worse than what has been shot. <br /> How well our judiciary is, it is more natural than the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story was damaged in the film. Total escape effort bogus fantasy. The guards or audiences are considered to be the full-fledged headheads, although everything that visitors can not find by regularly checked guards to make sure that friends can steal money for a bribery in a Brolo jail. <br /> <br /> The closing question itself is also a question of questioning how Alice (Claire Danes) is in the backpack. Did she agree to transport drugs? We are guessing. The film is intriguing to not imagine girls' innocence, but if one or two girls are confessed, the film will not be complete. Except for this significant error, it is good to end and the results are unexpected. <br /> <br /> Performing by Claire Dans and Kate Beckinsale is great and very well done. The actor has a large number of overdered and hype dance. Although her role did not quite mature (although she played a role), the film grew and the conditions became more horrific. Beckinsale, in contrast, flies in his brief career in radar, suddenly shines as two boots in prison. Her best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman has acted as a lawyer. His hypocritical and different style is an asset in films like "You're We're Sleeping", but he is a third-world legal advocate for leaving the two innocent girls out of paganism. <br /> <br /> The visitor's interest in Thailand is interesting, but I do not want to go there. <br /> <br /> Overall, the entertaining film has not broken into parts by incorporating some ridiculous scenes. I gave 7/10.
