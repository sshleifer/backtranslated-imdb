I really like this movie ... when I started looking up I thought I was pretty bored soon, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie and I have seen it a few times now. The characters were incredible and I said again that I was in love with Brian Austin Green (Beverly Hills 90210 for the first time). If you are his fan, I would recommend this movie, but I agree with another comment that was earlier, and the end was disappointing. I'd love to come across a little different side! However, the good storyline.
