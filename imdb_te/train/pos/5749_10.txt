I warned you that this comment has a lot of bitter quality. <br /> <br /> The movie is very meaningful after watching the film. <br /> <br /> Despite this tragic tragedy, the film has sympathy for my life. Scary. <br /> <br /> You do not know how clear the film is when the people in the scenes like this film and how they respond in their later lives. <br /> This is not a fictional writing; <br /> <br /> Although it is one of the best movies I have seen in my life, my clause states how good the movie is. <br /> <br /> But I refused to give others the opportunity to make it a source of excitement to another's soul. You can never ever experience or experience it anytime. I know for a fact, you will notice it because it is my soul.
