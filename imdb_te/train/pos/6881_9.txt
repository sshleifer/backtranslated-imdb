How bad is the movie that contains Curtis Mayfield's song? It's not! The Groove Tube is a range of skatelogical block-out sketches from anyone who has been delighted to the Olympics since 2001. The ugly, (coco clown, easy lub recipe) fraud (for a long time "the dealers"), but the lows are also funny. Ken Shapiro's manic dance down to the best Manhattan trail is best of all (this is Shapiro, Nat King Cole singing Just You, Just Me). Certainly dated now, but the grove tube at the time, is rarely shameless and crazy funny. Ken Shapiro made this little cult hit, then 7 years later the bombing of the Christmas Day, the modern issues (I enjoyed it) and since then, unfortunately, nothing. (He can play drums in a jazz group) The Grove Tube remains an eternal explosion of positive energy, after 26 years after my initial view I still bring real pleasure!
