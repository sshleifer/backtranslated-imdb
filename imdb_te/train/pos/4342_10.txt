This film did not really surprise me, something like that is good and good. I thought like this: "Paul Rizzard wrote, huh ... let's see how we'll do it ...." I'm in Peter Falk. I congratulate Colombo. Although I was a big fan of the show, I always liked watching Peter Faulk. <br /> <br /> Peter and Paul appearances are quite natural, and I thought it was a fly on the wall. They played each other, and I practiced with practical pleasure! <br /> <br /> I like this movie. I want to be on the phone on the phone and tell him how much I enjoyed! But I could not find his number. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies I do not think of or about where it is or where it is unknown to anyone. It just came and I thought: "E, why not? I do not need to see it if I do not see it ..." and I love it!
