A stunning image with this stellar cast and some great acting. I'm never watching thrill. I especially love Danny Glover's character and Kevin Klein's character, Simon and Mac, with Brunch featuring Brunch. Kevin Klein is such a natural and his habits are effortless and you can often see what's going on. SO is its very true image. <br /> <br /> One of the most powerful scenes in the film is the cinematic start of the film when Sim's coming in the scene where Mac's car is broken. The film also has a strong message and is contrasting with the stereotypical message that a guy who pretends to his audiences is a person who preaches his guts. Instead of actors' emotions and situations, they provide the best possible message without the use of words. Finally, Mary McDonnell was always very intelligent.
