Dr. Mordrid is one of the rare movies that is entirely under the radar, but is absolutely worthwhile. It really reminds me of old serials from the 30s and 40s. I like to watch movies ... but judging by the output of Moon Full Moon is not enough to satisfy the distinctive audience. It is unfortunate, because these kids can be a heart potter-style magic fest without em, and unfortunately the children are discouraged. Jeffrey Combs and Vivate Nipper are both great - I do not believe if Shri Nippar is not in an A-list film. No, seriously! However, this is a shame because Dr. Strange's license has no bucks because I think it's the whole kiddie phenomenon.
