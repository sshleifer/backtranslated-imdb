<br /> <br /> The indefinite small Stephen King Shaker. Dale Midkiff and Denis Crosby's limp performances are much better, but there are still stories about the mystery storytelling. The old Mimicak burial ground, Rachel's paternal grandfather, and Jacob-Marley-Victor Pazosov never really had any co-existence, and the films were confused and overwhelmed. But some horror movies are really perfect, and it may not be in other places, which is willing to shock. `Pet Semetary 'is actually one of the most recent horrific horror films, with its murderous zombie baby and Zelda's most sensitive character. It's politically incorrect, it's trivial, it's inappropriate - and it's never going to be in the heart of 'safe' horror movies in mind. Fred Guinea's finest performances and add to one of Mary Lambert's witty directing, and you have a strong satisfying horror movie - even with the end of hockey. Highly recommended for fans of art. 10 to 7.5.
