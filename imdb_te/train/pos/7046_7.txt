In the War, Inc. we will now find a logical extension of the current outsourcing of all combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you're familiar with Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater controversy, you're already half the house that you can completely perceive the latest piece of Kusak. As Cusack is looking forward to reaching his latest goal, he is acting as a corporate huntman known as Brand Houser, who found himself in Trevivia, on his trade show in his newly opened country. There was an anti-founder journalist who played Marisa Tommy, who was interested in it, and practiced with a high-pop pop star starring Hilary Duff. We are introducing the past of Hazer, a tragedy to follow him and a corporate assistant named Masha Dylon, who actually runs his entire operation (and played ridiculously by Jon Cusack). While a few moments deal with the attack on the top, you are not always the moments you expect and the small tougers often wonder. Great performances are all Prime Ministers. Duff's accent comes and goes but she does a very nice job and she goes a long way to disperse the Disney film. Tommy is funny but poor, but in every scene of Cusack they are in every scene. To be fun, they give good stuff. The authors make good sense of the script with turns and turns and visual impersonations to make you deductible along the way all the way to the imagination. In fact, the conjecture of the ending puts me more like ratings, and this can lead to the expected end. <br /> <br /> If you want your comedy wide and physical aspiration you will not be able to keep the whole movie interesting. On the other hand, if you like noodle comedy and wider satire, this is for you.
