"A shot, not a kill, is no exception." You must see if you are marines or snipers. Two big thumbs! Great storyline, great camera work, good play, action, details and more. The real thing is pretty close. But this is not an image to break and delete editing errors. It's fine 99 minutes better to sit back. This plot has some depth but this film is not really about what you think. Looking sniper lifestyle and action about it. Sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good foxes, but the first is still the best overall film. Tom Berenger plays the role of the sniper's life, playing his role. Death is all about dealing with. Watch for sniper fans.
