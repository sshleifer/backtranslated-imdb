After reading the reviews for the film, I started looking at it in my mind very doubtful that it was really good. However, it is one of the best films I have seen for so long. The majority of the reviews I read, were very hard to follow the complex plot. And in some areas you leave chaos, because you've missed a lot of conclusions that end up very loose if you feel like your kicking. It's not that funny (actually, it's pretty dark) and it's not too intelligent to see parts, it's not like "lock, stack ..." or "snatch" scenes from different perspectives (and, one of the best scenes in the film , Jason Statham spent five minutes on a lift for himself). It's similar to the two films I mentioned, it's filled with memorable characters, especially Stevem, a magnificent performer in the lead role, and Ray Leota, who spends most of Spidos, but a great performance no less. Once you have spent time, after thinking about the movie and seeing again, you have really started looking at all the symbols and references created by the movie. I think it's fantastic, and Guy Ritchie is a director on his game.
