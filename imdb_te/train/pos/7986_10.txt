This is a wonderful, heartfelt picture. Current Reality in Current Latin America ... Kidnapped, Corrupted, Cruel and Greedy Police Officers and Mercenary Trouble Against The Innocent Victims. Denzel Vashiston gives me a very moving performance in my career. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. Relations between Washington and Finnung have been well written and filmed, and I believe every minute. The cast is amazing, Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke are always great. Wallen lights look like a different actor for me. I loved to see more of them. Authentic spaces are awesome. Camera work is interesting and different. The cast includes a number of prominent Latin actors, which are more interesting to people who are familiar with the Latin American film. I highly recommend this film.
