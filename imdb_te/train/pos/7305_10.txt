A phenomenon began in 1978. John Carpenter's "Halloween" release surrounded people to witness the evil of Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> STORY: After 15 years of murders, four friends (all of them) come back to their hometown to beat the people after the night before the Halloween (and with their boyfriends) escaped from the hospital before the night. He murders 3 of them silently and silently. He does not speak. He walks slowly. <br /> <br /> One of the friends escapes only after saving Dr. Loomis (Michael's explorer and physician) <br /> <br /> Halloween has a reason to work well. . Simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, and we do not know why he killed, and he scared us. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> John Woodreni wrote and directed the film. He builds unsustainable tension throughout the story, and sometimes we can not see that scares to such a degree. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's horror and well-acted. It is also mysterious. Michael is not a force, a human being. <br /> <br /> The sequels around Michael and his "History" are very much focused. The film focuses on unknown fears. Maybe this issue is amazing.
