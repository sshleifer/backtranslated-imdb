This is not quite the sort of image that John Wayne calls. He plays a person who works through words and inspiration rather than a diplomat. <br /> <br /> For open-minded, patient and watchful, this film is a great depiction of the secret part of history. <br /> There are two plot stories. The big story is for internal construction, isolationist Japan and the outer, expansion of the United States when their interests conflict. The small, human, storyless tale of the barbarian (Wayne) and the debut of a posh jeeshah and the mutual respect and love dislike. <br /> <br /> The film is very well done and all the actors play their roles. Two main characters are made perfect. John Wayne is like the Townsend Harris, fulfilling his correct mix of integrity and negotiation with the Japanese. Ico Ando is also excellent as the title Geisha, beautiful and delightful. The interaction between her character and John Wayne is particularly well documented. These two people (as shown in the picture) were behaved. <br /> <br /> The script is well written. It's not all the Pompocity. And the actual depiction of the events that took place. The characters are not real "people" who are not real self-conscious from history. Further, the confrontation of cultures and interests depicted with great skill and subtlety. In fact, the conservative, traditionally powerful, isolationist is increasingly compiled in a switch between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron, the growing conflict of new, increasingly powerful nation from Japan and the ocean. The wine complained that the ship was cut off by ship landing in Japan, and the ships could not carry the vessel for water. Baron responded, wanting to leave Japan alone. Wayne's character replies that Japan is at the prime junction of international shipping, and there is nothing more than a group of high-profile group of teams to the country. A realistic summary of the two countries to see themselves on the right and to see them incorrect. Reflections throughout the history of conflict between two self-righteous people with controversial interests, reflecting the ongoing and future recklessness. <br /> <br /> The cinematography and nanography of Japan in the nineteenth century, is amazing, just before the rapid growth towards industrialization followed by Shatabdi. <br /> If I'm a fan of John Van or if you get the chance, I would recommend anyone to watch this movie. Find out this is not an action movie. It is an interesting place of history and representation of time, and a slow-boiling love story (most of their surprise) dominate the personal lives of the two main characters. <br /> <br /> The film can be seen in its merit and allow you to sink in its story without even saying it in advance and you will enjoy it completely.
