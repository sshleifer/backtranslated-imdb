If you do not see this vague little attraction, you should find it. This is the story of a male, fighter Sad Sack (Fred McMurray), who attempts to reach any branch of the Army 4-F every time. He has a Maya Lump course with a gene (Jean Sheldon), but the gene has more spots than Mac Marry, it's time to serve at all times and at all times than he wants. It's beautiful, delightful, and pure fluffy, and you do not like it but to help. The plot is a Disney movie, especially the two stars (McMurray and Sheldon), both of which have produced many Disney films in the 50s and 60s, but they do not. No need to say, it ends all well, and the viewer is good away.
