"The Good Earth" is a great movie you can ever hear. There are a lot of disasters and events, but this is an emotional love story. All of these take place in less than two hours, which are small by today's standards. <br /> <br /> Lewis Rainier was surprised that he received an Oscar for such a limit. <br /> She basically has three emotions: loyalty, hunger and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Asian and Asian-American performances are great. <br /> <br />
