For the first time, I enjoyed watching the small film "The Cure" by director Ryan Geoffrey. <br /> <br /> Many young filmmakers (I am one of them) will have a hard time with cinematography when Indy starts now. We see that the output we imaged our targets or not exactly the same. But directed by Young Director, the film is well on the screen. <br /> <br /> Music is the key element of the film, which helps a great deal. <P> <p> It is difficult to describe in a woman's heart, her desire, her fear, especially small. But still, I'm not a voice fan, especially when you go through the story instead of movie shots and cuts. Some of the narrative is my personal feeling of some, my impression is that the narrator has tried a bit too hard. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a small picture, able to view the input from the director well. Way to go, Ryan! <br /> <br /> Greeting from China, we look forward to your next page
