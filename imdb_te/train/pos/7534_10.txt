I was totally disagreeable with other reviews.It is mainly negative.I got the chance and was happy in this film.Good.Yes really.It found no mistake.There is no time.The script is original.The songs are all liked and convincing.Marcia Brodie reminds me of Smart Brody Bunch . This gas can really work. The setting in the Australian Outback is accurate. Incredible scenery. Great soundtrack is called Paul Kelly. Bless Gode Paul Kelly. Cranberries Here I also saw this film twice in less than 24 hours. I'll see it again.It's interesting.This is a thought.It's better than nine-tens, which is called Hollywood blockbusters at this time too.It's backed.It's a beautiful picture.I found no mistake.Check it out! My first review!
