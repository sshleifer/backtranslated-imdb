This is a good feeling because someone commented. It's a glorious scene and Luciano's strange-filled voice! I have seen this film many times and again this afternoon. I forget how much I miss Nesun Dorma Pavarotti's singing and I need to get a CD! This is a great movie when it's fun and repetitive in the afternoon. Eddie Albert is a bit prime and prime as agents, but not all agents are anyway. Italian rural is beautiful but nothing is the balloon ride tops for perfect viewing. If you want to play Olivier ratio, this movie is not for you. If you like fancy and some amazing music, watch this movie. Just have fun!
