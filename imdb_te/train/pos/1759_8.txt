I'm not sure whether the word "serious comedy" applies to this film and I do not even know whether this can be applied. In the last few years, comedy theaters have been filled with cinematic theaters. <br /> <br /> I felt that these requirements were not "fierce ridiculous" films. <br /> <br /> Does the 40-year-old Old Virgin fit into this guild? In the end it is up to you, but in my opinion, this is a very funny picture. You laugh very much, plus this provides a social commentary through some great characters and situations. <br /> <br /> There are more than 40 years old virgin, do not exactly fit these features, one of the characters in the movie, especially men. <br /> <br /> The story, as it says, about Andy, a shy, silent guy, collects action figures, sees Survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and his favorite band Asia. <br /> <br /> Cull Andy's colleague is at SmartTech. Andy believes Andy is a psychologist until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a sexual misconception but yet he has to get what he wants opposite style. <br /> <br /> David is another very exciting person who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Many young people from 13 to 21 have already seen this film, but I really do not have an age limit to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> You can not see it and enjoy the social commentary from the depths and depressing independent images, going to your video store without resting, commenting slightly. <br /> <br /> It's DVD bonus that you really see from bottom to bottom.
