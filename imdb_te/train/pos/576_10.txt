I like that this movie is a real connection to the island that came from the same wonderful, casting, location scenery, story, direction, and everyone can truly imagine being there, and you can imagine being there, a wonderful actor of Robert Redford and now the same director, Norman's father . Witty words throughout the film are great, and as soon as it's released for release I bought the movie, it's very clever. It is sad that it is sad, and if you cry at an image it should be good, and this is perfect, even they are two little boy who complimented the piece of Norman and Paul Only wise people and children often leave me out of praise The stars that see all of them are a large number of the whole movie These kids are superb and should they appreciate what they did, do not you think? It is true that the whole story is very fascinating and after all of us was shared with someone's life.
