Sarah Silverman dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talented, dark and devil. I have read the other 'comment' on this program, as well as the message board stuff and the message. There is no danger of appearing in TV. T.V. for a lot of money, time and work. Will be kept in the production of the show. Sarah wanted to be stupid because this performance was stupid. Sarah wanted it a childhood because this show was childhood. I think jokes are great and the theme show as well as other music numbers are wonderfully hideous. It's a lot like the Pee-Vee's playhouse for America's Future Pornstars from the Valley, the smile of twenty-something glue on the cheek. The cast is awesome. Scenes and action well. I hope this program will succeed because I did not allow David to continue with her performance in Comedy Central. Who is playing the sister of Sarah? She is not in the cast list on the show's home page. I love to see her standing. Does anybody know about anyone coming shower dates or DVDs?
