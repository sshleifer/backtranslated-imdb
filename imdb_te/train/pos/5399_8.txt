Gosh's last great film of 1960. A definite stylist with a great sense of his imagination combined with Shantarro Katsu (Jatocchi Kirti) to produce this disastrous indictment of gentle-minded nationalist allegiance. <br /> <br /> The word "tranqu" (heavenly judgment) is the word for the emperor to kill enemies or "traitors". Katsu makes his character 'a manipulative politician with patriotic pride, with a simple minded faith. <br /> <br /> Anyone who questions political leaders is called a "mole" and is targeted for murder. <br /> <br /> One of the finest photographs, many shots are excellent tones of form, color and light. Combat sequences are often and very bloody and cruel. Blood uses the ghosh for his films. Gorgeous and upset. While the personal story is easy to follow, the historical background is complicated and this time in Japan is a basic history lesson can be very helpful when you can fight through the film without you. Some of the flaws for the film are the music track, the length and the kutsus occasionally wink the scene. He is the pioneer for an image of an anesthetic scene but has a definite description of alcohol. <br /> <br /> Dabbing is one of the great Chambara films.
