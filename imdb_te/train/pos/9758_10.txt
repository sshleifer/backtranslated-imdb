Personally, this is one of my favorite of all time! No, I'm not 10 .. I'm 30! I own old, original VHS that I bought from a rental store. I have seen countless times. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining movie for children, but it's a witty image for adults. I once saw this movie .. Not clever. My eyes have opened things I never noticed before. I'm strongly encouraged, outwardly and somewhat submissive ... I wish I could remember all the things that I had noticed specifically, since then it's been a long time. Rest assured, there are tons of things mentioned throughout the film. If you get a chance to see it .. Not cryptic .. you will not be disappointed .. In fact, you will probably feel happy and warm. <br /> Stunning!
