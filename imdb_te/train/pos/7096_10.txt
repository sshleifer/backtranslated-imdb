I had the privilege of seeing these images before at the preview screening, and outside the theater I was facing camera staff from the local TV station. At the time, the words that escape from my mouth are "awesome." <br /> <br /> The story is witty and thought-provoking, and acting is the first rate for all.The principal is the first film directed by Terry Gilliam that there is no hand in the credit. After struggling with his longtime "Brazil" with Universal, Terry achieved what he wanted most; "Terry is a talented artist and every shot is a beautifully painted painting that is carefully constructed with decision and confidence, and it is only the justice to be raped in his efforts to convey a feeling. This image of the Universal Collector's Edition DVD is just a  ్భుతమైనది, అయినప్పటికీ బోనస్ లక్షణాలను చాలా పెట్టెలో పెట్టలేదు. ఇది ఇతర విషయాలు, దర్శకుడు / నిర్మాత ఆడియో వ్యాఖ్యానం మరియు "ది హాంస్టర్ ఫ్యాక్టర్ అండ్ అదర్ టేల్స్ ఆఫ్ 12 మంకీస్" అని పిలవబడే చిత్రంలో ఒక ఆసక్తికరమైన మరియు చాలా ఆసక్తికరంగా 90 నిమిషాల డాక్యుమెంటరీ కలిగి ఉంది. Looking at some creative weaknesses in the filmmaking, preview screenings have been properly tested, and the team is beaten with feelings of self-doubt and despair. Fortunately, for all of us, they decided to change the film very little and made it a huge success. <br /> <br />
