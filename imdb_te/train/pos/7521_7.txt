I have a vague idea of ​​being Bettie Page, partly due to her performance on Playboy very late (obviously, when she took her photo and her Santa hat), she did not know what she was doing. Co-written and directed by Mary Harroon of American Psycho, the film removes the key parts of her life. The South Wife of a church walk has some bad experiences and leaves them behind in New York City to look for better times, where her modeling, and much more there. Soon she is underground pin-up sensation, so slavery is apparent (and the title's "cruel") attribute is attributed to her. Actress Gretchen Mole portrays her, and although she could do this woman's soul as well, the film was really a success. She is not a simple character, sometimes her thoughts of morality are questionable ("Well, Adam and Eve are naked, are not they?" She twice commented). Apparently, filmmakers had gone out of the next few years of Page's life and dropped photo shoots for Jesus in a period of time left with her. <br /> <br /> The dramatic Betty Page is not much more than a kind of bio-pick that has been provided by HBO films, although this time a movie is being released. Herron's links were best over her "questionable" positions, over-the-top throwing of her photographs and starring in the hilarious films of whips and chains and leather uniforms. The otherwise common nature of this film adds a much needed comic relief. There is a government investigation into 'solvent' from such photos and underground magazines, which is not the story behind. But there is not much time to learn more about the page and her complexities or her relationships or sex and fifties, just learning more. It all seemed like if the horn was much more white and white photos were progressing as it all really gave the black and white look and went along. If you're not very familiar with Betty Page and maybe it's probably a fan-catching look.
