If you like serious laughing pain, watch this movie, and Bruce damages his fellow newspaper. Deleted scenes are invaluable. I do not know why they did not include them in the original movie. Since the movie is 101 minutes, there is no time. Morgan Freeman is an outstanding actor who has long been neglected. Jim Carrie needs Meds!
