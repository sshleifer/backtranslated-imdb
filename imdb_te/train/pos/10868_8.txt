I always thought this long and boring talking-headed static filled with full of static interior, dude, I was wrong. "Elections" is the most attractive and thorough thriller-drama, which takes a deep and realistic view behind the origins of Triads-Richwals. The characters are constantly on the move and it is still possible for you to feel the suspense from certain decisions and characters' goals, even though you are always an outsider as a viewer. In addition, Johnny succeeds in creating some real rich images due to McKee's composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts. While any action is rare, it is still surprising to illustrate the brutality of cruelty. A more thoughtful movie, and I like a little bit of acoustic guitar score.
