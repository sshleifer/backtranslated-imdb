This film is the weakest film in the original Star Wars trilogy, for various reasons. Whatever the flaws that have been achieved at the end of the day, everything happens. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie, depending on the quality of its quality 2 highs. <br /> <br /> Here is a picture of the film, which is very stable with the other 2 pictures. I left most of the producer Gary Kurz's departure. The first 2 movies were dirty and lived-all technologies. On the other hand, rebels in "Jedi" also came out of the shower and cleaned their uniform powder. This makes the film a little less formatted. Also, the creatures are mostly muppet-like and cutesy. <br/> <br/> <br/>> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " And in the places where the "Empire" created a whole new experience, "Jedi" returns to the places of the first film, for the alien worlds of the swamp, ice and clouds.First we return to the desert planet Tatooine, and then we see them face another death star (maybe the emperor new anything Could not think ... but you are Luke Or Kasdan), and we have this "Ehms", they are made of Mattel Teddy bears, cash in a recycled version that is considered the biggest vacuum-fight at the end of "Star Wars", which feels lazy. /> <br /> The most unfortunate feature of the "JD" for me is the weak performance of Han Solo's character He is the first two movies Is as impossible, by the time he is battling the screen, is trading with a linear droids. "True Empire" instead, Han still loves Luke liyaku disheartened - "his kingdom" mugisinatle, she rejected his love. The whole thing is very positive and it is clear that the solo character is not true of his being protected because it is not part of the film's central story. Ford, for his role, does not have the style of boredom and his previous performances. This is the 1990s Ford performance, and the movie "Top" is boring and watching. Fisher is clearly visible for her role in some scenes. Lando, an interesting character introduced in "Empire", where we act as a tactful man in the area where we live. Hoolley gave an interesting development in the role of Luca, able to make it new or interesting with his character. Probably the only major actor to be paid attention to his film. And the script to be affordable gives him a lot to do than other characters. Really it's his story and other characters are only part of the package. Ian McDiramid is doing a wonderful job and emperor. <br /> <br /> He is the first in the film (at times when he is in new films). <br /> In terms of visually and effectively, "clean" is hard to find fault. Jabba is a very influential animatronic character, one of the most elaborate ever-built. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is based on the success of these fountains. But in its own case, it is a brief amusing episode and IMHO is the highest of Lucas's next productions.
