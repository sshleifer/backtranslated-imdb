A sentimental story with a sentimental sound track. This is a young girl who is rich in green parrot Pauli (with a voice blocking). Parrot thinks and speaks like a man and gives him the help and advice of his continued companion. <br /> <br /> Parrot is definitely a star of the movie. The bird binds the mood in a very remarkable and expressive manner when it is bad and desperate at times. The synchronized voice is also very well done and you believe that this clever little bird in a minute or two. <br /> <br /> Initially, her father gave a bird to a tribute and the next scenario is the story of Paulie's continuous fighting story over the years that reunited with his wife. He is one of the most memorable scenes when he enters the evil enterprise and is encouraged to spy on people using an automatic teller machine. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is predictable, but let's see who the person likes it. Anyone who loves this picture of the kids and puts a bird in a bird will be pleasure in Paul's antics.
