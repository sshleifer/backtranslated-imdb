I saw this movie when I was a little girl. I enjoyed it every time. Graphics are now a little cheesy, compared to now, but back in the 70's was great. I saw in the original Spanish version and thought it was amazing. With my friends - I remember my Christmas with my family. <br /> <br /> If you talk to a child / kids and Spanish, bring them up looking at this old-fashioned version of "Santa Claus". Who is different than what was used today, but who said there was a way? <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. It teaches children good versus bad. If I have English subtitles version or this is an English one, but Spanish is the best. Have fun and happy holidays! Feliz Navidad!
