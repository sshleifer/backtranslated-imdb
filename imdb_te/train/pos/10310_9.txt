Cast: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston I first saw this movie. I mean, what a conceptual moral. Jim Carrey like God? <br /> <br /> The film is rarely sacred, but it is not great, it is not even holy. Yes, Jim Carrey had some powers of God for a while, but he was not God. Confused? <br /> <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is a journalist named Bruce Nalan lying on his luck and feels very unsuccessful in his life. He lived with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Aniston) and can tell from the bat that they love each other, but the relationship moves too much. <br /> <br /> Then Bruce Anchorman, who was secretly stolen by Ivan Baxter. Bruce shares his ideas through television, and Bruce shares his ideas as he is willing to shoot it down and is perfectly suited to remove him. <br /> <br /> After that, Bruce received a page complaining about God. Shortly afterward he was so tired to call it, so he responded and Omney went to Presents Building (Hay). Where he meets God (Freeman), who is the boss, electrician, and the guardian of the building. I found this highly amusing. God is the Boss, the Electrician of the Holy Spirit, and Jesus Christ. Think about it. Boss, clear. Electrician, the person who keeps everything running. JÃ¤nter, the man who cleans up the confusion left by the world. However, Bruce is quite suspicious that he really met God, but when God gave Bruce his power and he gives a shot when he gives a shot when playing God. Wonder why. Abuse of abuse for personal gain and abuse of officers. <br /> <br /> In Hollywood, Bruce finally learns his character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The film is not accurate theology, but for Hollywood, it's definitely a good effort. <br /> <br /> Many people think that there are so many attempts at this film to be challenging and challenging. I congratulate Tom Shadik for his efforts in this film. <br /> <br /> In this way, the idea behind it. <br /> Bottom: 3.5 to 4 (value or two value)
