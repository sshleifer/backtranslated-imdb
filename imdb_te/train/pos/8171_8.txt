<br /> <br /> Dentist is actually a very good movie. I will review this review. Acting is not always the top, but the thrills are good and the story is good. Plus you see Linda Hoffman's boobies. I'm not an expert in this field, but it's fine in the direction and the plot makes sense. Corbin makes a great creepy dentist. It makes the jaw sharks what makes it ... ish. <br /> <br /> It has a clearly limited budget, but they are able to do what is best, and are well developed by those characters (calculators). <br /> <br /> End.
