<br /> <br /> New York I Love You is a true spin in a romance that explores intelligent, funny and sometimes shocking situations around man's most powerful emotions. <br /> <br /> With Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawk, Shia LaFouche, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others are big, a real ocean. <br /> They do not tell who the storytellers make in the wise and interesting ways. Brett Ratner, Shaka Kapoor, Natalie Portman, I mean - even though both sexy and funny, the film is just going forward or not romantic comedy. It also has serious stories and notes. But in my opinion it's fine. See it for yourself and reply to my review, I want to hear what others say.
