Although The Notorious Bettie Page is well acted and filmed, Cliffs Notes version of Betty's biography is fine. The film primarily worked with Irving and Paula Clov, along with his brother and sister team, who produced the most famous photos. She is not detailed in her life after leaving her religious reincarnation. Richard Foster cited "The Real Beetie Page" as a source, but later it is ignored in Betty's subsequent years of mental illness and mental illness. The narrow perspective of biography is debated, but Benite's fans and "citizens" are probably more interested in his modeling career, so they get. <br /> <br /> The film is well-received, Gretchen Mole reproduced the image of Betty and confidred the sweetness of her photographs. In recent years, the character plays an innocent role in Betty's interviews. <br /> <br /> In this film, Beti has come to know the actors and outfits rationally. <br /> <br /> A supporting cast is also played by Chris Bayer and Lily Taylor Irving and Paula Claw, as David Straightener as Estes Cafeteria. The film was misinterpreted by John Willie, starring Jared Harris. John Willie never met Betty Page and did not participate in the photo shoot with Klaws. <br /> Despite the quality of acting, the film is a depth of depth. The story is very difficult and we really want to know Betty. Like most of her photos, it's just a picture. This exaggerates Betti's identity. Her photos are mainly found in New York and surrounding areas in a narrow market of underground and cultural publications. In the late 70s and 80s and her repetition of her Betty Page (her name is usually written), she came up with a real fame. Betty's great exposure (apology in the plane) is on Playboy, appearing in the January 1955 issue (Christmas photo displayed in reverse in the movie). <br /> <br /> This film is very well done. It can continue to interest until the end and displays many fine shows. It hit Beddy's most points in life, but most details do not ignore many details that it gave too much depth. Keep it off. It's rather sudden. Nevertheless, this film is definitely looking at someone who is interested in or even in a time frame. The soundtrack was great, really pulling the viewer into the 1950s. If nothing else, the film is a performance for America's booming sexuality and its puritan predecessor. It is a peek in both a man and a woman for both men and women.
