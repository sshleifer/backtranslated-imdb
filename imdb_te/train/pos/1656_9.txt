"Thieves and Lyers" will provide us with a very natural picture of the corrupt levels that force the Puerto Ricans to influence and make it harder if they do not have the impossible options about their and their loved ones' life. The cast is fantastic, some non-professional actors; An excellent option that increases the level of reality in the film. The photography makes the movie intruder not infiltrating because it should be in this kind of picture. The script binds the intellectual and attitudes of "boricus" in a very deep way. Sometimes it's like watching a documentary! You look at the movie that looks like a secret entrance into the real Puerto Rican community and keep it from appearing. I loved it!
