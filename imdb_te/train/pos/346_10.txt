What a wonderful picture! It's very scary, great acting, well written, nice plot turns, interesting characters, very good direction, and a surprise that left you with a smile on your face. This is a popcorn horror film that is not appealing to frightening fans, but still (still) is one of the best thrillers out there! <br /> <br /> 1) Actor or actress starred in it. </ P> <br> <br> Know what, they do not want to be like a scam. Everyone said, "Oh, they screw up!" Like. Well, if I did not make a mistake, the other images were also screwed up! In fact, every horror film had been copied earlier. However, the screw is a good image. But, still ... stop comparing and enjoy what it does! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
