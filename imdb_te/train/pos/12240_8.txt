If you are the sort of person who is looking for a realistic movie or a strong and incredible plot, then this picture is not for you. No - you hate it. However, for those who love sweet, slightly screwball comics, this small picture is good looking. <br /> <br /> Tony Randle works for IRS, and he needs to file a very good farmer with income tax returns. Although he tries to persuade them about the intensity of his tour, everyone in the family is surprised by the company. They emphasize him and act as one of the family ... and his daughter Debbie Reynolds has plans to hit him. It really is all about the plot. But this film gets high marks for a fun script and good acting. From the end of the 1950s has been great.
