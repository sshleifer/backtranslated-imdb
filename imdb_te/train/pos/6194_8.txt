Henry Fool surprised me. I did not expect it as well as entertain and as well amuse, or strongly, like that. Fay Grim continues to be surprised in providing a solid continuation of a story that feels it does not need to be. If the viewer is watching the first 20 minutes, it seems to be one of the best sequels for the excellent Indie film. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed that part of Jeff Gold Blum is too small, but I'm happy with this little run. He was convinced and delighted that the agent was Fulbright. <br /> <br /> The film is very happy with the film. For example, I'm glad that Henry realized that he was not really a loser (at the end of the fool), and that's actually a genius ... And it's really lovely pen's stroke. <br /> When they finish the trilogy I think they will do the third thing. It looks like it's missing. They should give the Ned Fool grim the right and Liam should make sure that his father is ready to confirm the amazing change for his mother, and that he is very close to himself. In fact, Fay assumes that he is stopping his son from the most important facts from his son. It feels like there's a need to do this. <br /> <br /> With more action, this is not an action movie yet. It's more drama and intrigue ... a mystery, types. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
