There are many things that are not quite right, but it is disputed to whom and when it is not so important. <br /> When they started playing Bruno Koschmider's KaiserKeller, I was actually the most blatant freedom of the facts that I felt as I was moving to KaiserKeller after playing in Indra. <br /> <br /> Although I am biased in favor of the version of Sempinti 20 Pete Best, if he is a story adviser, he will call shots. <br /> <br /> Even though this film is not such a luxury product in the film "BackBeat", I also agree with Sempini. <br /> <br /> The film is very accurate, and it has a much better script with more deep characters. <br /> <br /> Bryan Epstein is "only queer-tight" to learn that he has learned the band along with Gary. The band went to the cafe and said, "Corn-flakes are millet." Stuart Sutcliffe purchased his bass guitar but could not play it, so in my favorite scene he had some bassis, he had previously been back to Impressionario and was captured rather than caught. It's rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br /> Well worth looking at.
