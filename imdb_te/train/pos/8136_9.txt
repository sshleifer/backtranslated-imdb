This film is a great documentary. It follows the rap group, NWH, made by Ice Cold, Tasty Taste and Tone Deff, by Gangster Rap Highs, Lose and their special way of returning to the highest level. With women's difficulties, eagos, cops and whites, the band gangster rap will reach the top of the world because the movie goes to the top of the documentaries. This spinal pump is a very good reason for everyone's favorite documentary, but if I'm in the right mood, I think the film is just as good. <br /> <br /> Although I have no interest in rap music, culture or anything related to it, I love this film. . Screenplay and songwriter Rusty Kundeff showed a great likelihood of it and it's an insult that I have not seen him from a black hat's fear. <br /> <br /> However, I have spent a little more time with you, and I recommend a black hat fearful for you to laugh quickly. <br /> <br /> "Do not watch whites in their eyes? <br /> <br /> Have fun and enjoy the movie.
