Pinjar really leaves one memorable and one of the few movies that makes you think hard. Division set in India, this picture shows the true reality of India's split. A painful woman who does not have the way to go to Urmila gets complete marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional role. Her liberty, personal identity and family honor were removed over night for a tragic land dispute. Manoj Bajpai is just clever that she regrets. There are several moments in the film that brought a tears. The picture at points is deeply painful. Partition scenes are some of the backbone cooler, and Urmila's patience and survival are both great. Women lost freedom to women who gave freedom to women. A great image to be given credit for wise characters and storytelling.
