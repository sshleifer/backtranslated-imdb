Well, at first I hate to comment on this but I seemed to stand up for this film. <br /> <br /> Previously, I thought Bend It Like Beckham was not a deep image. Century. If you are looking for a country that you are looking for. It does not mean that it should be artsy because it is a standalone movie. It's good that you feel good and you'll be happy to see it, and the two things are added to the hands. <br /> Second, "Halle Berry in Monster Ball" is not good. This film is not required to be honest. This is a family image. If you do not want it you can not be honest in this movie. <br /> Lastly, this is a very beautiful story. I think well and it is fun to watch. If you want to sit and watch a good movie when you're done, it's true for most of that culture. <br /> <br /> If you are looking at something with deep thoughtful plot and big dramatic scenes it's not for you. <br /> <br />
