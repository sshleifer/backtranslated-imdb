Mel Gibson's Braveheart is a magnificent achievement, but it leaves the sour taste in the mouth. Rob Roy, on the contrary, is slightly polished, but this is a very good movie. It is a historic film featuring timeless themes with real historical values, while Braveheart presents a gross and unpleasant comtem Virgin glass in an ancient story. What is the cast of this film? Liam Neeson acted as a hero, in the role of a baseless fall back in the Phantom Menace (water-covered). This character is heroic, but it's not a great fight or a devil lover. Even more amazing man, he commands the screen. Tim Roth's Cunningham, unhappy but intelligent, and John Hurt's morally bankrupt Lord, against him was chosen by human rivals. Even the acclaimed Rob's practical wife: Jessica Lange: Even stronger and noble, but 300 years away from a modern heroine, it should not only be. It is not the most original movie you will see, but its own criminal record is the courage, and strong performances make you pay attention.
