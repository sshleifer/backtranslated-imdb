I would have seen this movie twice now and I loved it! Although the performance is great and although it is a "like your voice", I do not think the plot is never boring for people who love those things. It has some great lessons and we can show that we can do something if we try. A wonderful picture. I see a long time coming. While Britney Spears writes this book, it is very truthful for real life, not only falling in love, but being different and struggling. Why is the main girl in these films so beautiful? Do you really think that if you really are her heart bad or average, Holly will meet the perfect person of her dreams? I doubt it ..
