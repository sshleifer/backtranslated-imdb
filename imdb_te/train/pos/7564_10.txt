In my style of work, I have occasionally contacted by independent filmmakers trying to promote the film. When I can, I look at these low-budget images and often think that they are going to Hollywood's future dogs. Shortly after, good movies still have a genuine hobby and desire to be remembered as a possible movie industry. The short film Broken, directed by Alex Ferrari, is a real surprise and second look. <br /> <br /> After 20 minutes, Broken attempts to tell a compelling (but surreal) story of the back story. Audience fell in the action between the audience without any clue what was going on. A young woman (Samantha Jane Poley) wakes up from a dream to hear a gun, abducting her from her home. When she wakes up, she is surrounded by a group of mercenaries who appear to be at home in a comic book. These nasty boys and girls are much bigger than life. They are all guns and swords. <br /> <br /> Here the kicker is a low budget movie but it does not play as one. From the beginning, the concept B R O K E N has been shot, edited, and produced by experts. Quentin Tarantino appears to have done on his day when he is with the Wachowski brothers. The film is sharp and nice, it looks great and it looks bigger. <br /> <br /> In this small film, acting is much better than what I see. Pole and Paul Gordon (head-killer, starring Duncan) were well-chosen. Two of the few characters in the film will be until the film is taken. There are no special effects, no matter how good the film is saved from bad acting. Fortunately, Polly has been told to give real fears and Gordon is going to get out of the real psyche. <br /> <br /> The problem with B R O K E N is only 20 minutes. The story ends with a Twilight Zone Twist, which feels a bit contrived and it is very subtle. Looking at it, I felt like I was supposed to have some epiphany, but it was a feeling that was much more mundane than I thought. The film tries to become one of those puzzles that leave hours of talk-talking to the local coffee shop, but it becomes unsatisfactory. <br /> My ranking: 8 out of 10.
