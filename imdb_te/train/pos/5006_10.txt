When I was doing surfing in 1965, I recall these special things. I had never heard of Barbra first. When the show ended, I thought, "It's probably the best thing in my life that I can ever see in my life." 42 years later, that's true. The talent displayed here is great, so I'm honestly awesome. <br /> You can talk about all the super stars, which is the greatest of all! <br /> You can do it, she can. Comedy, patos, lazy seduction, folk, barbra a storyteller. Her ability to remove her attempts is myth. But this happened in the beginning of the special, and she helped to create the legend that quickly became. Despite growing up to such a short period of time, she has fulfilled her promise more. But they are very early. There is no disappointment in seeing this.
