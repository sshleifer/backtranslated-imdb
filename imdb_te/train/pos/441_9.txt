This is a delicate picture about the search for some pleasure in everyday life. It should be seen as pacing, camera work, emotion, pursuing musical score and pure image of the film. It is not immature or emotionally sustainable. The only error I could see about this film is that it is not even more technically detailed in the film version. It is a tad-ao, technicolor and very good sound format (made in seventy millimeters.). The impact of the beautiful Italian villas on its residents was even more dull and small fascinating moments. Beautifully seen and heard. It still draws attention as a sweet moving little picture. I can not see it when it comes on satellite every time. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br> <br> /> <br /> <br /> "It's a film about middle age and people who choose it, which is deep and careless for the viewer to lose the heavy hand, see a sitting and it will impact you." If you did not get it, you could not live enough or something else was wrong with you .
