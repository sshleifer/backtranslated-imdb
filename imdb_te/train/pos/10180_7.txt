It is very difficult for Indian directors to compete with films such as "Luggen", where 11 hexacode and castrated males protect their villages and half of them are Idiots who confirm. "Devdas", the weird, futon of foreign returns back to Oblivion, with roles driven in endless corridors who do not care for their feelings or sentiments-they are rarely reddish-clad and animal. But to make a good movie, you have a tight-rope walk to calm down the front benchers, enchanting questious gospels with split skirts and Dishham-Dashum disputes. So you can connect with the director who wants to say a story of the Leonin village head considered a violent film in his own words "defending his village" or a very male to a female audience. There are a few actors who express anger and sorrow like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). When Nana Patekar allowed you on her campus and laughing with her loyal fans everybody threw at him, look at the politician and see him. At the same time his daughter is bathing her grandson. India. Nana Patekar is an older actor of the ethnic disappearing in Hindi films. The film is a critical part of the storyline with the song & Dances being thrown out for horrific violence, and the films are not sold. These changes are for "Bollywood" faster. All said and it's a good movie.
