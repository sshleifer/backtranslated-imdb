One of the Oscar-winning films for their annual monthly Oscar winning films, the film is finally fortunate enough to catch the film in Turner Classic films. <br /> <br /> BEDNNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS is a sequel film for easy success before Mary POPPINS. The film was a big success and an Oscar winner (best actress of Julie Andrews). Like Mary Papins Bidcoblues David Tomlinson, in which he is in a role in learning about journalism. Best mix of live action and animation. It was not in the past of British history (1912 London's Edwardian - Georgian world, which was the summer coast of the summer of "Dunkirk" in the summer of 1940). It is also in the Old Reginald Owen, where he is General of the Home Guard, and in the past he was the Admiral Boom in Mary Papins. Owen's last role. <br /> <br /> Home Guard Sequences (not too much in the picture) The British series DAD'S ARMY WAR dealing with the problems of the local home guard in the early years. It was also suggested that the appearance of three Rallin children who were war orphans from bomb blasts in London during this period. The Scottish number and Scottish female assistants appear in the outfit, including various members of the British Army (on Portobello Road) and Indian Caribbean soldiers (and still full of metal drums!). /> <br /> Surprisingly, all of these. But for the biggest plus Angela Lansbury, Ellentine Price is finally her performance: her only real musical lead. In the notable acting career, Lancebury never came to the real professional musical role offered to her in MAME as Aunt Mame, which came shortly after BEDKNOBS. (Her brief little in the GASLIGHT with a BALLOON BOYS, and the Dorian Gray film with Little York BIRD, and - all of the best support and final recurring Harvy Girls at the end of the GASLIGHT in Acechus, TOPEKA, and Santa FE). But here only she plays the female lead. <br /> <br /> When you hear her singing with David Tomlinson you can understand what we will miss when we can not play Dennis Burnside. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is pretty good, relative failure increases during a lifetime. In fact, in the Paypins their Edwardian ancestors (Cindy O'Cullaghan, Roy Snart, and Ian Wiegel) showed more interesting features in their roles (particularly, a witch to Lancebury), just surprising wastes (cutting scenes) in the two scenes of the MacDowell film The local vicar is the unanimity of witchcraft He also had a large part of his possible role as an enemy, and he was attacked by John Eriksson as Germany Officer at the end of the film, which he was more powerful than he expected in the British rural areas, and the formula for Lancebury and Tomlinson as Sam Jafe's magic. <br /> <br /> For animation, two sunny under the sea in a lake  ేశాలు, మరియు క్రూరమైన సాకర్ మ్యాచ్లో ఎప్పుడూ డ్రాగా ఉన్నాయి, టాంలిన్సన్ రిఫరీగా తరువాతికి లాగి, అందంగా తీవ్రంగా వివిధ ఆరోపణలు మరియు scrimmages లో banged. నేను డిస్నీ స్టూడియో యొక్క ఉత్తమ పని యొక్క అందంగా జరిమానా నమూనాగా చెప్పాను.
