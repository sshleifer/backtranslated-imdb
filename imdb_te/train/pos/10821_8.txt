I saw it after I was released in '56 and since then I saw its final scene. If it is recited to 'High Noon' then it is appropriate and the answer to the apposite. A stronger message to "Town Comes" than a single personal heroism of "High None", as headed by "String". In this theme, 'Conco' is one of my other all-time favorites, the exceptional precursor of 'The Magnificent Seven'. Both Sinatra and Conrad gave impressive and exciting performances, especially the cinematic shift kid's brother to become a savior from the bullying town. I only hope that all friends and family members will have the opportunity to experience the experience of my love for the film.
