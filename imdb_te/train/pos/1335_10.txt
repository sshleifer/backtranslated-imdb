These three stars have been re-selected in this controversial film after the love triangle story of Her Dil Jo Pyar Karega. If the film is not controversial with the value of production from Bharat Shah, the film is thought to be a hit. Here the director duo Abbas-Mustan did a very different and unique job compared to their previous and direct ventures. They considered Bollywood's breathtaking. But they have proven that they will be able to play a romantic family play in the CCCC. <br /> <br /> Salman is not involved in a single action scene when he is raped in Preeti in his apartment. <br /> <br /> The film has almost all the standards and songs, stories, cast and shows. It is necessary to make a film hit. But for Salman's fan this is a surprise gift from him. Why? For a long time he has been performing roles, where he has a scene to show his public body and show La-la-la around. Her character is really impressed by the great young businessman who has no nonsense nature and general attitude. It was wonderful after Madhuri's prostitution by Preeti. She also has the right attention after she is thinking of her life. Her facial expression and body language became more attractive, and she focused mainly on her. Her role as a pregnant woman in Kaya Kehna has never been in the heart of her heart. In fact, this is called improvement. Then Priya, Raj is very innocent and helpless wife only depends on him for a good result. The main ingredients are in the hands of her, so she does not have a powerful effect on the story. <br /> Finally, the main element of the story is rare and unique. It is not entirely impossible to find such a surrogate mother in this era of virtual world. Probably, most people are going through this big world where they are kept secret. Thus the CCCC's script writer revealed the truth of what is happening in the daily life of others. But it's still a doubt.
