It's not the best Bigfoot ever done, but it's the quality of nature that has been highlighted by recent trends in nature, the science fiction channel. It's some action, some humor, good F / X and Bigfoot. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of b horror / science fiction, if you want a solution, it is good to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is better than what you find and is not enough to direct. . Lull a bit expecting the characters to be "advanced", but know how to pick things up. If you are watching DVD, you can skip a chapter or two.
