<br /> <br /> I'm excited from chess. I am with a chess since I was 6 years old. I am very keen on the central role of the film. The character reflects a real chess player called Kurt von Bardeleben, committed suicide in 1924. He became known for his game against Steinitz, where Steinitz played a beautiful combination. <br /> <br /> Instead of resignation, he walked out of the tournament hall, despite the social incompetence of the main character, unfortunately, sometimes a treat of more intense Grandmasters you have received in chess tournaments. The chess is a very big sacrifice I can imagine, and you can sometimes end the imbalance in other areas of life. The main example is Che's Legend Bobby Fischer. <br /> <br /> In this film, a Italian championship match was played between an Italian Grandmaster and Luzines. Format Knockout, which is actually a form of the administrative body of the World Foundation, is only 2 out of 128 players from the final. But this is a cloud knockout - it also describes a realistic format, where the winners of each group play with each other. <br /> Before the postponement, the position also makes for an attractive chess puzzle. In fact, I completed a YouTube video about it, to explore an innovative combination - enjoy! Best wishes Tryfon http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM
