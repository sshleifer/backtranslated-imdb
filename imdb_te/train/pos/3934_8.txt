Young Mr.Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful picture that captures the myth of one of the most revered people in American history. Henry Fondo had a difficult job of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time made him a man to take care of the people. It's probably the best performance for actors. See how he can stop a loser-mob alone. Brady is amazing in the role of an ordinary farmer woman. The last part of the film plays out in a courtroom, and there is only negative thing that I can say about this film. A lot of the characters from the judge have been given a lot of folksy ridiculous lines that distracts from serious investigation that is handmade. But I'm used to this too because humor is a Ford trademark. The supporting components of Ward Bond and Donald Make are great.
