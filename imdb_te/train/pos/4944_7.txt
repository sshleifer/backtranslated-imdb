There are a lot of things in this movie but there are a lot of meanings. She thought she had what she could do in her life, but in reality it was not true, she found herself when she met some of the research personnel for her next job. There really should be more kinds of movies like this, even "mature" (by the way 13) and I'm still not as old as I got the idea and position of the film. <br /> <br /> I had to confess that I was thinking about watching another movie. However, this is in my opinion: Do not think you can get a better life. After reading all the reviews and after watching the trailer, I made a decision on this matter, yet the movie will have a lot of action. I recommend to watch this movie for having a good view of the film, this is a good end.
