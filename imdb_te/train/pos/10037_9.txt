The ship may be sunk but the film did not !!! The director, James Cameron, rewrote this spectacular picture from 'The Terminator'. One of my favorite scenes is 'The Dinner Table' Scene, in which Rose family and friends meet Jack after rescuing her. <br /> <br /> "There is a connection called 'MOVIE STUFF', but this is a good movie item, and we greet the mother and her eldest children from their husbands' wealth <br /> <br /> The film is too long but it is wonderful! Good story and good flow Good actors !!! Let's see if you want it twice, its value is valuable !!!
