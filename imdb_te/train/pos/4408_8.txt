Taiwanese director Ang Lee, whose earlier films 'Sense and Sensibility' and 'Ice Storm', came to the American Civil War for its latest feature. <br /> <br /> Based on a novel by Daniel Wudrel, this follows the exploitation of a group of southern guerrillas known as the Bushwalkers, with their Norman counterparts in the backside of Missouri. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of vicious action, but there is tension put on young men who have fought the battle vision - many of whom are fighting against their former neighbors and even family. Jack Rodel (Tobey Maguire) Such a person, or rather, the boy, only when he reached Uranus, was only seventeen. He was the son of a German immigrant, but instead of becoming a member of his nation, he traveled with his lifelong friend Jack Bull Chies (Skeel Ulrich) and Bushhucker. Although he is not willing to participate in the assassination of his ancestors and unarmed men, he is confident in this cause. His friend Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright), a black slave, freed by another Bushwalker and battled to the south. <br /> <br /> Lee maintains this item with the Ablom, in favor of the action and this film will actually give the battle reality - long waits of boredom and waits to intermittently with occasional flashes of intense terrifying fighting. <br /> <br /> Magarer and Wright are both courageous and dignified. Irish actor Jonathan Rice Meyers is particularly chilling as a cold-blooded killer, Schuyette Ulrich is happy and proud. Lee never wanders from the reality of the war, but his actors do an amazing job of showing good that it comes from - the growth of friendship, the display of courage and the vastness of the oppressed people. The devil ride is a beautiful and deeply compassionate movie, which is often barrier but always moves the audience.
