I had a perfect 10 rate in the series for the best and consistently high quality story and character development for the Series 10 final episode! <br /> <br /> The final episode of the "eternal" episode of the 10th season (which is obvious) Asghard is suddenly, incredibly, and very quickly fashioned in fashion, leaving me with disbelief! <br /> <br /> To the end of the series in the series, it is clear that most of the heroes will be at least one season in the beginning. <br /> If they did not return to the SG-1 movie in the future future, they quickly accelerated these stories, unveiling the two Starrart SG-1 franchises. "Clearly" a very good description of the extinction), I think the fans are deprecated with poorly clean-up <br /> <br /> The poor end of a brilliant intellectual science fiction line.
