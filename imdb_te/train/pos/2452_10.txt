It's a good show, I'll find funny. Finally there are bad Latin stereo forms! Â¡Gracious, Sinar Lopez! I love this show, and I started looking at just about three months ago. The whole concept of a Latin family TV show really amazed me. I am surprised that Latino has a good shot to stay on TV. This presentation is probably the best one I've ever seen, it's funny, heartfelt, heartfelt, and good.
