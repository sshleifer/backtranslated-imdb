After seeing two pictures before, I came to the contract with Altman. Before, however, I always labeled her film as "boring". <br /> <br /> The "hetch" is very small, very questionable and not printed. In fact, I do not think it was ever issued to VHS. Why? When all of these crappy movies come with all-day DVD releases, this is left for a good reason? Honestly, I have no real issues with this film. It is, for the most part, consistently amusing and funny. Almost all scenes are of interest to the mystery of some of the reasons, which are excellent dialogue or miniature performances. Here is a real skill. <br /> <br /> Paul and Dully's magic of paws at the bottom of the Pale is pleasant. <br /> <br /> You try to find a forgotten little copy of this gem. It's not perfect, but getting out of DVD releases is much better than a lot of mud out there. Hell, I'm happy with a nice VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> It's often on the Fox movie channel, but look for it.
