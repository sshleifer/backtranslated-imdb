I saw Drugs Years in VH1 and I love it. I think it very well reflects the history of the drug and in particular it is the strongest message of all kinds. There is Woodstock, Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison, there are many examples of drug use and drug abuse. This will cover the timing and consequences of drug use in America in good and bad ways. In my opinion, this documentary is well done and I like to congratulate its creators because it is better to play on TV these days. I'm looking forward to DVD release. You must see! This picture is amazing - BIG TIME!
