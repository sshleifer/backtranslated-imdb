"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of those amazing old films about house pets. Together with other animal films such as "Old Yell", "Napoleon", "Flop" and "Air Bud", there are great movies of its genre and generally cinematic movies. <br /> It's not just a picture about pets. <br /> Can this be just a "remake"? It's very good to "remake"! <br /> <br /> This is my first teen year (when I was 12 years old) with the heart. <br /> <br /> This is a family picture for the treasure. It's emotional, thrilling, adventurous, exciting, entertaining, humorous, lovely, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, heart-stirring and sometimes dramatic. <br /> <br /> It is one of those films to smile on the faces of those who appreciate these films. <br /> <br /> There are no features in this image. It has a well-thought story, pleasant characters, wonderful and relaxing instrumental soundtrack, spectacular scenery / landscapes in the magnificent Sierra Mountains (Oregon). Speaking of Vistas, not all the mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunsets ... Finally, all the natural wonders of nature - really full panorama. <br /> <br /> The main characters are good actors, well-developed and well-acted. Robert Hays is a kind hearted father, Bob Sewer. Kim Grest is good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren is equally good at Hope. Kevin Chevaliah is the youngest and most beautiful brother Jamie (his form actually reminds me of Kevin Corcoran's "Old Yellar"). <br /> <br /> When it comes to our fourfold pals, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow is reliable, wise, mature, beautiful, caring and loving old Golden Retriever (brilliantly voiced by Don Am√®che). Chance is opposite the American Bulldog, Shadow. He loves negligent, crazy, impatient, anxious, clumsy, happy and playful (voiced by talented Michael J. Fox). The opportunity still does not stand. Sassy is the essence of the cats image: elegant, independent, very confident and self-proud, with a typical cat attitude but a specific cat charm. Sassy is Seal Point Himalayan Cat, one of the most beautiful cat species. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends, the great "actors" of nature: Ben as Shando, Tassler and Tysi as Shots. <br /> This is an underestimated picture, but classic with its own right. This continuity is less obvious. </ P> <br /> It should definitely be in the top 250.
