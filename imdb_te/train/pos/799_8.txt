He is a philosopher and manipulator; In this case, the attorney (and murderer) played the role of Tom Cana√±o. <br /> <br /> Catherine Morris is a victim of Anne Mary Fehi, but initially the victim is the victim. We should be sorry for the situation, but many women (including Rachel Ward) have been bored simultaneously after seeing her suffering. <br /> <br /> She has a troubled episode that really helps her self-esteem, and Copano actually killed her psychologist. <br /> <br /> Copan's mother is a guest character with Olympia duukis (amazing). All in all, an interesting story is based on real murder, and because you want to read the book of Un Rule to get accurate details. 8/10.
