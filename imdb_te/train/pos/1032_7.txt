A message is a picture, but a good one. Outstanding cast, top-to-bottom. That Betty Davis plot is interesting back story! Many negative reviews (which are associated with some of the negative comments about the angles in the US, where the screenplay / playwriting is being stolen at the United States) is very preemptive about Germany in WWII. <br /> <br /> Theatrical and movie making, and acting styles vary over time and of course not 70 years after this particular film should not be made. Yes Casablanca is a better film (I guess), but despite the same year, the Nazis have a love story, mainly Casablanca. The love story in this movie takes the second seat in the spy story - a big part of the thriller. Both have a lot of cheesy accents and a great number of fantastic characters. Children may be a bit tedious and edited
