France-Belgium-Luxemburg Trilogy (French "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" in three heavily published countries) Who does not know Largo Winnch? After 18 years after the first comic book was published, it corresponded to the line of novels, which was adopted on the screens. <br /> <br /> For the first time - and failed - a TV program fails, the truth begins. <br /> <br /> First of all, most of the fans did not come, the aim of the film to receive not just the comic book series. There are some important parts, characters and no actual actions. The film offers an alternative and more advanced version. As a 1st class fan of the comic book, I had to admit, I was amazed. Actors are good, so there is no illustration, yet it looks very fast. In this way I would recommend this film to those interested in economic / political thrillers, but I'm not a substitute for the James Bond or Jason Bourne series.
