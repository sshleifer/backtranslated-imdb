It's unlikely to be the best comedy of the year, some very random and plots holes. But we are talking about a hitman and a white bread seller buddy, so some changes should not come as much surprise. Brosnan is a wonderful person in this role, James Bond (he is a wasted character). If he can maintain this kind of quality, I hope he continues to do comedies. Greg Kinner is also the brilliant man of Brosnan. I've read some negative comments about Hope Davis but I thought she was a very good idea as a mousy housewife on a dark side buried deep inside. Brosnan was cooled by his way and there were lots of good chuckles like some scenes dead I was almost smiling. My father (consultant) almost lost when Julian described himself as "facilitator". Like "Grosse Point Blank", another hitman comedy, humor is very dark. If you are ready to enjoy yourself.
