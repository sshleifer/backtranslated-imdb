It reminded me of a more severe level of spinal top. This is the band's story of reunion tour, but the things that are between them are not harmonious. I was especially impressed with the performance of Bill Nighy as Ray Bill. You have forgiven him, but he has a perfect spirit about him. It's your favorite band wrinkled, old and curious to see if it's a great movie.
