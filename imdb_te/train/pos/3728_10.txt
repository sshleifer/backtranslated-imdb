Never heard of this film, it saw on DVD. Great image, this is a perfect example of working with each cast member. There is nothing in the Hollywood film with older old overheaped actors. No performance has been removed from this movie. Recall the military experiences of my own post Vietnam War. It was centered on people who sent to the fight. Although some have volunteered for service, they are depicted by characters and emotions. They are ordinary people, some are not just cut for military life, I remember some of my experiences - I can not take little to military life, but I can never forget them - in touch. I highly recommend it and then think about that serving in Afganistan. A trip to basic training, those drill sorgants are not people in the morning and maybe they have "sensitivity training" HA! HA! HA!
