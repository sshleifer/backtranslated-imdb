Along with the Darkwing Duck it was unfairly canceled. Disney is in a recession from Tarzan and requires a show like this to re-track Disney. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings are perfect for the voices of Louise and Baloo (sounds familiar?) Theme is tuned to the theme itself is catchy. In all the villains, great on their own greatness, Tony Jay Sher Cohn stands out. Lewis and Baloons are very similar to voice overs in the Jungle Book, which is not a bad thing. In fact, it's very inspirational! Animation spot, and the script has many years of introspection that animations are not intense. Get this glance back! 9/10. Bethany Cox
