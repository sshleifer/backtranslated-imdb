Goodnight Mr. Tom is beautifully portrayed and beautifully realized. This book is not completely reliable, but should it be? It is not. John Thaww mesmerizes as Tom Oakley. His transformation from gratitude to carriage is well realized, making it more reliable than the screws in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, it is Tha's finest hour. As he enthusiastically adhered to by a young Nick Robinson, he was shown to be totally convincing one of the victims who had been abused by his mother. The script and the music are made worth buying, and you also see tha playing the organ. Amazing! The most moving scene was discovered by Willy about Jack's death, after which Scarletina died of talking about his deceased family who died. Buy this, you'll love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
