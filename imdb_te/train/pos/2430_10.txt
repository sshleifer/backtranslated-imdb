This Casper Friendly Ghost from my childhood, and I have to watch it on YouTube (thanks to YouTube for YouTube); After that I loved this little one and this is one of my favorite Casper stories. <br /> <br /> Starting with a short story of Frank Galop's storyline. Until we saw Cumber sitting in his cemetery and reading it. Each ghost grew from the graves to "bo", and Casper left for the friend's quest. But when trying to make a friend, anyone watching Casper will run away. The poor Casper is sitting on a lag and weep; Beware of him until a little fox comes. Casper and the little fox is fast-tracking and he quickly named Ball Ferdin as well as his best friend. <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdin's relationship are placed in a tremendous plight, but Casper does not keep a close eye on Ferdin while playing a hidden game. Ferdin hides a hunter and two of his hunting dogs try to kill the little ferries and Ferdin runs as fast as possible before he gets out of breath. When Hunter fired firefighters at the Casserier Notices, they were trying to kill him and flying in the direction of the hunter and the hunter Ferdie left alone. And the hunter and dogs are afraid of Casper. Casser shouts to Ferdin that the hunter and dogs are gone and everything is good. But Casper finds Ferdie's body moving and asks if he's okay. When Kasper looks at Ferdie's death, he is suffering from pain, because he is "the only friend in his entire life". Casper returns to the cemetery where he buried Ferdinand and made him a mausoleum next to Casper's tomb. Casper is suffering from pain until he sees that he has resurrected himself as a devil. Ferdin laughs Casper on his cheek. The candy screams for pleasure, because he is reunited with Ferdin. <br /> <br /> Overall, it displays death in a family-oriented cartoon, even though it is astonishing and disturbing.
