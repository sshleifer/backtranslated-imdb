Sit here, all the folks who say that the film's weak link is Ramon's Amadas but not for the irritating harpsichordist. Rock and Roll High School is located around the Ramones. Anyone can see this and Joey Ramon is getting a kick out is obviously a wet sheet square daddy-o eating bean seedlings backstage in an attempt to keep him in handling the situation. Ms Trogar, white mice bursting, hall patrols ... instant classic. <br /> If you do not like the Ramones, you do not know Rock and Roll and you are not eligible to see the Rock and Roll High School.
