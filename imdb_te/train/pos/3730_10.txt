If you want to watch a movie and want to see it, then Tigerland is a picture of you. I love this film from top to bottom. The film-perfect scenes appear to be true; It is almost like a documentary with a play in real life but with drama. Boy, I tell you ... the real drama they actually "fought" in a scene (listen to DVD is not its obvious to listen). I see this picture as a group of depressed young people who are trying to escape an unfortunate fate, after seeing the private Ryan saved, I know exactly how to feel a "unfortunate fate" and the men in the movie. The film "Crossbridge" was "Stand By Me" and "Private Ryan Save." What do men do when there is a "hard tension" in real life? Some men go to Verdi, fists, some men, some drugs, some drugs, sleeping with some random to sleep, try to eliminate the love of their life, try to drink some of the pain, some people feel guilty dukataru from buildings or bridges, and others can feel very sharp Fiber, they broke down physically. The film is all in despair with emotional emotions. But it's not a disappointing movie, its realistic, its very humorous movie, the flawless and funny bogey (Collins character), and there are five top actresses in it; I will tell you what they have for them! Engaging in scenes, battle / action scenes, perfect scenes with appropriate music; The film has everything, I said: from top to bottom. Why do I pay Tigerland heavily? The best thing about owning the film is "The Best Picture of the Year" in the big bold work on cover, and it definitely comes with nothing short of that. Keep the rare gems coming in Hollywood, 10/10.
