For the first three seasons, Sabrina has a gem on TGIF (and later, early school afternoon). Each episode has a maniac, folly and fast firing, which has occasionally surpassed the awkward joke. Melissa Jon Hart expressed great talent for her facial expression, especially for her physical comedy. Her two aunties, like "straight men" or straight two witches, had great comedies and regular chemistry with Hart. Salem, speaking cat, can do anything in the mad scheme of interest, and he can laugh and can be laughing as it is a talking cat. Sabrina friends surrounded social experiences in school, including the usual "bad cheerleader" and "absolute prince". The most interesting and unique aspect of the program is the ability to mix pop culture (e.g., bands of the era, Jerry Springer), arbitrary human condition / morality (e.g., the importance of friendship, the spirit of Christmas), and the similar forms of magic in the magical kingdom Literary representation. Unfortunately, like many other shows at the televised age, the show struck its peak in the first three years, making it to the high school with Sabrina. At the beginning of the season four, going to college suddenly deteriorated at the usual quality of the show, especially the authors chose to introduce Josh as Harvey's rival, and the key players to put on skinny excuses for Ans Hilda and Zelda. The last season in Sabrina Pop culture magazine was undoubtedly disappointing. However, finally, Sabrina (especially high school years) has a unique entry into a hybrid scenario with magical elements that rise above tiresome fare derived in the genre each year.
