The very best reality show ever made. The first two seasons (matter only) are in Hulu. I challenge everyone to see the first three episodes of Season 1. I guarantee you finish watching the season. <br /> <br /> Anderson Cooper is happy. Locations in Europe are excellent. The games are mentally challenging. Interactive 5. In one episode the player is disappointed by another player, "I'm trying hard as I can!" Equally frustrated, "not necessarily." <br /> Do you find yourself?
