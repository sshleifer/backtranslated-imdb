Baghdad's Thief is one of my favorite ten films of all time. It's exciting without gore, beautifully portrayed and art direction is not flawless. Casting is not improved. Rex Ingram I believe in genes. And the essence of evil is necessarily captured by Conrad Whey as Zafar. <br /> <br /> I would watch this film at least twice this film ... it's not always tire. This film is a bold moment for all ages. Baghdad's Thief My words will jog for even more innocent moments ... For the first time I saw it and the US. Conrad Weigt was a great actor, able to continue this underlying "evil" in "Casablanca" a few years later. And with Justin and Dupree again in the code, "The Four Feathers" ... I believe in a great film!
