The first series of Lost began with a bang ... literally and slowly reduced the pace. It may have stopped some audience and the people who see half of the people are frustrated or confused. <br /> <br /> "Acting throughout is amazing but why 5 series' plan ... why ??? This means there are no answers for at least 4 years, oh well, I'll be watching if it keeps the tension and conversation flow.
