<br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this film contains a real spoiler, but I play safe, so do not read this if the movie does not see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> I spent a big part of my film life without my acting. Such people are _sung_ leaders of the film: blows, draggers, on-air directors, lighters and writers, textiles, etc., and the whole thing to at least the least extent from their opinions. Most of the actors are self-absorbing for nuts and absurdity, the film is very good, but you should work with the actors to figure out the movie is a real life drama! Possible spoiler warning: In a great scene, two actors, two actors, _discussing_ how another person actor, personal actress, totally _discussing_ to 'out of script' and they make lines, practice and criticize them <br / > Since its appearance in the film '91, it has become especially fashionable on TV. But rarely anyone did it well.
