'De Groot' is an excellent Dutch thriller based on the book by Tim Craub. One of his books, 'H Goudden E', was transformed into a great Dutch mystery thriller, 'Spurlos' ('The Vanishing') in 1988. <br /> <br /> We have seen a man, and then we learn from his name Igon Wagger (Fedja von Hut) coming from an airplane in Thailand. It is clear that he is smuggling something on the border when he chooses to direct and direct these scenes <br /> <br /> Let me see how Ego is dealing with a lady in Thailand, both of whom have never done it. <br /> <br /> Frequent flashback and flash forward Egon and Egon (where Eric van der Horst plays), axel Ini captures (benja brujing portrayed by the child). They are friends, sort, and to Axel (played by Marcel hensema adult person) we learned how nerasthudayyaro. Igon Egon college goes in and settles down with a woman. During this time he sometimes met Axel but was not really willing to do anything with him. <br /> <br /> The picture is chronologically. It shows Egan and Axel as children, teenagers, and their mid-thirties. But from time to time, as I mentioned, the film turned into children and back to back. <br /> <br /> "The big caves" <br /> The name means 'cave', which means that the cave happily ended the movie, although it is not really happy. In the beginning, the ending is amazing. The middle part of the film is fun and the first time we forget our attention, only to come back to that time. It is a happy ending of the film, though it is also happy at the end of the dramatic end.
