Pakeezah has a very interesting history (it is documented in the 'trivia' section) about how it came. <br /> <br /> Kamal Amrohi (The Director) seemed to be conspiring to examine, while at the same time he intends to secretly complete his work. <br /> <br /> The pucks run on metaphors, poetry and visual appearance. The result is that emotions are hard to come out, which may not be too real but it is very effective and affects the viewer. <br /> <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari Nargis and Sahib John are owned by her. Other actors like Ghulam Mohammad (music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (backing score) and Joseph Wersching (The DOP). Their music and cinematography are going to get you bonded. <br /> <br /> A classic in the world of Pacheja world cinema. It reveals new layers every time you see it again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets in the film, giving us all the presents.
