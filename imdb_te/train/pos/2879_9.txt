Dory fans are not - Dear Cinderella does not turn a pumpkin at this special edition DVD midnight strike. One of the most enduring animated films of all time, the Disney-fame adaptation of Gary Bryms Grimm fairy tale has become a classic in its own right, some memorable tones ("A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes", "BBBD-BOBBIDI-BOOB," and Title Song) and some attractive cute humorous relief. This persecution Cinderella, thinking it's going to be a ball designed to find the right girlfriend just the right sweetheart it's loved, but it's the perseverance, animal friends, and a fairy godmother that we all know the story - the famous slipper (click for the big picture) Well make sure the facade is the right thing matters. There are some amazing scenes with pure animation - for example, Cinderella reflects bubbles drifting through the air - and across the design and throughout the design. It is a simple story with comic businesses, particularly those of Cinderella's rodent pals (apparently dressed as the hawks of another famous Disney heroine) and Lucifer, a mischievous cat. This is a simpler and more fun work than the more animated animated films today, bringing the voice of King and Grand Dukes, which makes it simultaneously interesting and more enjoyable.
