Funny. Sad. Charming. <br /> <br /> This film really moves me, but "Shall We Dance?" It is very rare. It was fulfilled that was left with kindness. One of the best experiences in my movie-viewing history is the gentle humor combined with occasionally depressing grief. <br /> And dance, Oh yes, dance. If you are not a lover of art or you should not walk one step further, the steps here will keep your breath away, and you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can. It is totally mesmerizing, the pictures of Suzi'ma (portrayed by Kozi Yakosho), filling the steps when he first dances, and the humorous, child-style mood. And yet, this film is not entirely about dance, but about the sensibilities of human behavior and feelings. <br /> <br /> A cowardly person who has learned to express his repressed feelings by dancing is a beautiful dance instructor and a personal development of every member of the wonderful supporting actors who recreate his love for art. Pain. Emotion. All love and little lives are here, with the emotional strength and kindness of the culture, with the delicate feeling of beautiful Japanese watercolor painting.
