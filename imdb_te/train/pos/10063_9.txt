The shooting is fun and the environment is very realistic. I changed the concept of many complex moral and social abuses of the China-mainland 1930 as well as more fundamental human questions - I thought I could get real sense at times, in the traditional Chinese theater and street living paintings. It seemed to be the best to experience. The underlying role played by Buddhism is probably the most real form - in its manual and its philosophical issue, perhaps the most effective I have ever seen in the Chinese film. The cast was great. The pictures are memorable. Acting is strong enough. They have enough wealth to congratulate the vehicle of expression.
