I think it is a good movie; I feel a very Maltese film by the scene and atmoshpere; I feel that I do not feel sensitive (sensory result, not a purpose); I feel very natural; I think that is humanity; I think it's interesting; I do not think the actors have ever thought of me ... they're not dirty acting (they are Sean Canary & Co.), the film is not a block buster, they're like a movie ... the ordinary PPL will work ...; I think the film reached its intention; I think I've made things feel (or feel them again :)); I feel I'm not aiming; <br /> I really enjoyed it.
