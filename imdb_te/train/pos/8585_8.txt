The captured US Army tornado's inspired story will have to prove his innocence to avoid the hangman. Paul Ricker fires a friendly at a coup in Korea, which is ultimately a spy spy and endeavors to prove a military court. <br /> <br /> In the classic court drama vein, "Sergeant Ricker" is a very well-designed secret, the turning point and direction of director Kulak's persistent momentum and effective stories directed by outstanding actors. <br /> <br /> The film was originally created as a television film in 1964, with a number of "name" actors and some action sequences. Dilman, spot-on as a suspected defense attorney, repeats his role, whose attitudes are sometimes a supporter of Ricker, and a little distant wife's personal plight, playing through the Vera Miles. <br /> <br /> Marvin's interpretation of Paul Ricker's role is a simple but dedicated person's portrayal whose main character is Peter Graves' Prosecution, and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton. He has challenged the reversal of the judgment. Marvin changed from the apathy to his resignation altogether, giving it a fascinating decision, highlight of this kind of small-scale play, persuasive, often intense performance. <br /> <br /> However, despite the obvious darkness, "Sargent Rucker" still remains a tade, compelling test, you can not simply suppress a book. Highly recommended.
