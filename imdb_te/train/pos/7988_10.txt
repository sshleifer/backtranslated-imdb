I've been disturbed by my family and friends for my tears on the movies, and they were disappointed when I saw it. I cried many times but I was not sympathetic to it. I ached for this man when I was ached for the family and he tried to redeem the only way he could. Denzel is as wonderful as ever, so Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I did not even recognize; He was not gracious for years. They are not historically accurate martial movies (tornado !!!!), but my husband is not looking to recreate the movies, he has now seen this movie 5 times and I'm going to see the DVD again for the tape and the whole time I'm looking up.
