I thought that the first and only time I saw black was the only time that appeared on TV in my TV in 1989. Christmas Eve and my father and I had been watching in the room before we went to the room all of the midnight service in the village church. I'm at a very young age at that time, but I do not know who was more or less afraid of the yard yard at the entrance to the church that night or my dad! This is a very creepy movie but there is a fact that I do not have much to keep track of a sound that plays in almost every Hollywood movie setting in each of them, so every creak, thump and bang expand your head further There is no disturbance. Another factor is the fact that the jump factor is bouncing in the room so you do not see what you hear and what's going on. <br /> <br /> A wonderful ghost story, I have not seen anyone, with all the drama I reject Tbin and believe that the BBC has removed it (only for my knowledge) only one performance!
