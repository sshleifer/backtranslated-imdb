This film brought tears to my eyes; As John Roberts really finds out how to get the hearts of the audience, directing this fantastic picture, life will be seen through Paul's mind and hearts. We will learn from time to time, with the help of sensitive and talented directors like John, even small individuals like Pauly have a heart. I can not stop my tears, but the film is very happy. It's great, and after thousands of movies I've seen in my life, "Polly" really influenced me very much. This was the second film that really turned me up after "Ugly Duckling".
