Every now and then a picture is frightening or frightening, but not generally. Most modern horror films fit this category. <br /> You do not have to send those stories to the pressure and adrenaline by your veins. They are really scared you to the level you have ever experienced. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is such a movie. Most filmmakers will be frightening to take too many risks. But almost all the work. "Halloween" is awe-inspiring in its simplicity, and is totally terrifying. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Larry Strood (Jamie Lee Curtis) plays a few kids for Halloween night, a madman is a madman after fleeing the mental institution after being murdered by his sister unhealthy 15 years ago. However, the madman, then known as Michael Myers, kills the local young population and finally comes after Larry. <br /> <br /> You know, what's wrong? Another bleak slasher filled dumb teenagers and gobs of gore. <br /> <br /> "Hollywood:" I think James Berardinelli is perfect in his review. "Because of its title, Halloween often combined with all the other brilliant films in theaters that live in theaters. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, while Halloween was considered to be the father of the modern Slaser generation, it was not a member ..." He has a point, reasons. First, it is apparently terrifying, but most entries in the teen slauss style are dumb-fest (most recent argue that many are cheeks, but most of them fail). Secondly, there is almost no violence (most of which is bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence is not equally fearful, and relies far less on it (actually, the body number is very small). In fact, it is arguably not a horror film, not just one day but a single film, not by the very standards of most deaths that cause more cruelty than every gorri and late. He rely on fears of fear, and skill. Third, the characters can make some stupid things (sometimes seal their fate), because they are dumb they do not have them. <br /> <br /> The characters are real people, so they fear that the characters are too dying, and they are afraid because they make a mistake. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is one of the main reasons why it is so scary because it's easy to believe it's true. It is not difficult to swallow this movie. There is no supernatural, no ridiculous creative plot items, or "inventive" murders, or whatnot. Instead, all set pieces and camera work (save the opening scene) are easy. Carpenter just set the camera in place and said action. <br /> <br /> Heart films Most horror films, all of them need to be scared, horror films are probably the most difficult films. It should be perfect and ideas do not work twice. This is a hit or miss game since they've repeated all over again and again, especially if you say all the good ideas that are not carpenters (I'm not). <br /> <br /> It's acting is a plus point Not a movie about these horrendous ideas is not a film about dramatic, controversial characters. , Which is no longer the role of the story, but the exception is the one who plays the Shape, or later called Michael Myers, which requires no one to be afraid and to be afraid to kill, but it (even harder to keep people from asking) But the guy pulls it off, and the result is horrendous. <br /> He is the director and co-producer and co-wrote of his songwriting score. The cousin and his next film "The Thing" support this statement, while The Thing is not as scary as "Holiday" . Unfortunately his success dramatically declined, because big money bait for low freedom once producers "recognize your potential." This image is good, it's not without errors. The famous opening scene is frightening, but not too scary. Many panic attacks do not work for the first part of the movie. It's not bad, it's not a good reason to be afraid of "shape." Fortunately, the carpenter uses this much time to create a relationship between characters and audiences. There is no proximity to this relationship, it is sufficient for the purpose. We grow to know the letters, but it is not painful when they die. <br /> <br /> When you come to the Hollywood night, the carpenter will throw things into the high gear and stop you until the end. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" may be flawed, it is slightly more. It should look for someone who loves the most horror film, and scary movies. However, be alert, the film will scare you to live!
