Last night I saw this film on the cable and was exceptional. It's less and less key that I like most about it, but deeply heartfelt. Henry Thomas' (he acted as a child in ETA) was impartial for performance (he was considered a few words man). David Straiter is an excellent silly villain. And surprisingly (we're talking about a Hollywood production here), a baby works as a main character, but one person does not have to work or lines, but only (and it's bright). Thomas's mysterious relationship w. E.T. The film's main character; His bond w. <br /> Then there is music - Ab, no music! Gillian Welch's lyrics are fantastic and the overall score is the music of beautiful hill country. <br /> <br /> This film is a spectacular atmosphere. I highly recommend it.
