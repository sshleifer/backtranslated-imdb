<br /> <br /> When I bought the DVD on DVD a few years ago I saw the first dragon lord. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I've always found the storyline a bit confusing. This film, after all, is a love story. <br /> <br /> It seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scenario. <br /> <br /> Well, it's no longer in an extended version. The old "original" version begins with a huge barrel-hike / rugby sequence, a new ending sequence in extended version. The dragon (Jackie Chan) is hanging around his house and appears to be like training and singing whenever his father is around. <br /> <br /> Other sequences are also shift or longer in an extended cut. When you look at a lot of angle. Pacing is also good and overall it works well. It's like a love story and does not ask questions about why it ends dramatically and dramatically as a general version. <br /> <br /> I refer to everyone who is a Hong Kong movie, looking at the extracurricular version of the plain Jackie Chan and seeing how the film was originally intended (or I thought it was meant, they make it and see some of the scenes) I'm totally new Jackie Chan, even though it's a lot of scenes I have seen Khan turns.
