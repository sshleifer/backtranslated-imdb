Even if you do not know much about Ireland, "My Left Foot" (especially Daniel's Louis's performance in it) you have to love. He plays the role of Christie Brown, who is suffering from cerebral palsy. Hence, he was very disappointed in his life. Though they are trying to warn people about something, they laugh at him. He has control over his body in the dark: his left foot. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan have done well in collaboration and subsequent contribution: "Father in the Name" (but "The Boxer" is unnecessary). "My left foot" You will feel in many ways: sad, optimistic, or another. Nonetheless, Daniel Day-Lewis gave a lifetime performance here. Great image in every angle.
