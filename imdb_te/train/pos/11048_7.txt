I did not think this movie was too intelligent, it seemed like what it was like but enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Although two other French films, the Tidokk and the Lost Children of the city recalled, this is very original. /> <br /> Set in a jail cell But do not let this put you off, this film goes far beyond the many multi-colored blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Permanent 'Black Arts' Making the front and very good feature some incredibly believable! <br /> <br /> It is good to fear some gor.
