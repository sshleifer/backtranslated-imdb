This image is amazing! While funny and entertaining, it is also deep and eye-opening. I'll see again again. Bruce is an unhappy man in his life. He has a job and life, but it does not think it takes him to bring happiness. Bruce is bitter, unsatisfying, and reiterates that his life is not the way he thinks it. As a result of this state, Bruce loses his job and accuses God of everything he thinks is wrong in his life. God comes to Bruce and grants him the divine powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he always wanted. In the end his life makes him happy ... what he expected from an exception. In the process of getting everything done, he really loses a person who loves him. As the film unfolds, Bruce finds that the real change in his life is not in the circumstances, but he realizes what is actually there. The film is inspirational and deep. This strengthens you to see your life with deeply humble respect for the fact that if you really care, you have more blessings than you can find in your life. As my wife said, "will anyone ever be able to be happy for anyone?" And in my humility addition, "We are not lost and we do not care what we're trying to learn."
