Great acting in Gretchen Mole. This is one of the best biopics for screening for a while. The majority of Betty's younger life will be covered, which also maintains a largely centralized path to lack of biographies. There is some lovely and awfully funny subtitle in dialogue and acting. This film is a wonderful break from the dir. "American Psycho," and I think it shows through her best work to date. Oh, and like a cinematography, I give this film 100% in the movie dip. It's amazing how they removed the 50s with modern images. D.O.P. The speeches to a lot more enjoyable around. I would like to see what i would like to see: 8/10.
