2054. Paris has an ether with people and drifters flowing across Fritz Lang's metropolis at several levels in a clear tribute. Paris separated in ultrasound and DNA. And in the blink between the surveillance sweeps, a beautiful young medical researcher is kidnapped after leaving his sister in just a seedy nightclub. Investigate a strict police captain. Dark corridors, shady areas and film Nair's most hard-boiled single source lighting feature, shown in black and white, comparisons to Sin City are compulsory. But this story is more indebted to Massian Shiro and William Gibson than Frank Miller, most technical surveillance, near-invisible stealth attacks, and cruel super-corporations most of the lands, such as guns and cars. The film has never created a doom-filled atmosphere in Gibson's cyberpunk view, with its technological-heavy margins appear to have their own ministry just as they are scared of industrial units, but the director is not necessarily the future Paris of any Utopia and the future science. And the police procedural plot line unfolds as we have taken into the darker recession of personal ambition under the shiny veneer of the Corporative PR movie of Avalon Corporation. The motion capture process used here creates a look somewhere between B & W comic books and next generation rotoscoping, and is attractive or inappropriate for your tastes. However, a great visual concept is displayed here, and the future Paris is filled with small details, which converts both Spartan and Barock. Worth a look.
