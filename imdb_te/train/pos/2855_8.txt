Comparisons are comparable to an entertaining and realistic film, Non-Stop "Run Lola Run". The film was quickly developed into a chase sequence, where viewers will learn about three main characters through flashbacks and daytime sequences. Chase is not like the fastest climax, but it's a lot of fun going on. Letters grow in the "run" and forget temporarily their frustrating lives, forget about the "macho" characters and finally why they are running in the first place. As a "clarity" for the characters in the "Fight Club", the characters of the film as a way to separate ourselves from the false values ​​that allow us to create society. <br /> <br /> Getting their run out serves to taste life from an unrealistic perspective, and all three processes are in the process of clarity and happiness. <br /> <br /> Instead of learning from my appreciation and their experiences, the characters returned to those false macho characters that I thought would have escaped from their journeys. <br /> However, the only real problem with this film is not distributed outside of Japan.
