This film is a fantastic picture. My opinion is top notch directed from acting everything about it. I know Mr. Garfield is in the blacklist in 1950, but his other films are in the video if not better on DVD. In that case, why is not it? A friend would have it off to TCM's off but it would be great on DVD. For special features they speak with a historian about war history and if Mr Schmid's wife or son is still alive, they can be interviewed. Anyway this is a great movie and I highly recommend it. It's never a color if it's always hopeful. It is my view that the film will destroy the overall impact of the film. The battle scenes were quite realistic until 1945. Mr. Garfield has done a wonderful job of playing the role of Mr. Schmidt. Although some actors were tempted to overcome a part of Mr.Schmid's disability, he understood it correctly. I would expect this film to be a tribute to Al Pacmid's courage and other naval forces that sacrificed to us a day in World War II.
