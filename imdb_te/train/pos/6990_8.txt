In the 1940s, Bela Lugushi appeared in the low budget coolers for Monogram Studios, and The Corpus Vanishhes is one of the finest. <br /> <br /> The young girl is kidnapped and killed by the relatives, and extracting them from their bodies can make old-age wife a young man. A reporter and a physician stayed at night in his home and were responsible for the bride's death, the next morning they report these killings to the police and the mad scientist dies soon and dies after the death. <br /> You have almost everything in this film: scientist assistants are old hug, hunchback and dwarf (her sons), Bela's house, thunder and horror passages. <br /> <br /> Bepa and his wife find that they are sleeping in the coffins instead of beds in the film. <br /> <br /> The Corps Vanishhes has a look for Bela Lugosi fans in particular. Very fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 out of 5 stars
