I was happy to catch this movie on late TV lately and it kept my interest in the whole picture. This amazing creepy, yet mysterious looking English home, bad looking decorations and weired furniture and rooms that make you wonder why you want to rent this house or own it. There are four (4) stories about this house, and every resident of the house meets all kinds of problems. You notice the beautiful lake and pond around the house and also sing the sweetness of the birds, but you do not let that fool, it is horrifying all over the place. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", one of those living in the 80's and Christopher Lee, "The Curse of the Chrisson Altar", and his youngest daughter Chloe Franks, (Jane Reed), is a wonderful exciting story, for some reason his daughter loves to read witchcraft books! If you like to surprise creepy, horrific and suspicious movies, it's filming you!
