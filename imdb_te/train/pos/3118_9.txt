In the trilogy of Bourne's movies did not see the previous two, I was a little reluctant to see Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> This is a very thrilling experience and I do not understand what happened because the first two films did not see it. It is easy to understand every part of the story and fall in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before joining the break! I do not think I've done such a wonderful, and gorgeous movie, especially an action movie. Since I usually shy away from the action and thriller movies, it's such great for me. Ultimatum is one of the most attractive films, credits roll your attention for the first time in the last minute before the roll. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is just awesome in the role of Jason Bourne. I heard a lot about his great performances in Bourne 1 + 2, and now, this amazing actor has another in his list. <br /> <br /> Stunt has been dealing with style - Everybody has done amazingly and I am amazed by the impression of this film. Well done.
