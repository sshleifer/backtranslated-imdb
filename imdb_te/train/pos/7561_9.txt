<br /> <br /> This version of the movie I have seen is about the blockbuster rent, but it's one of the words. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny as hell. It is also true for bone. If you ever spend time in Hollywood or around it, you will understand the humor. Otherwise, you can not 'get it'. <br /> <br /> The story of two people in the business until the end of the breaking point is a rare gem. It is a drama, but Deer Hunter comedy is a play. <br /> <br /> Loren Dean is superb, always as a supporting actor. Jamie Kennedy managed to catch her own well. His performance is very impressive in pudes scene. The only downside is Carmen Electra but we can not have everything.
