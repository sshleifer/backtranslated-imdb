I can not believe some comments on this show! The show is just genius! Certainly not tried it and did not follow true, but users always do the same things as wanting to be stuck on us again. We can not have a choice to sit back and enjoy a new time. The style is not as realistic as previous previous "Scooby Doo" appearances, but it is not supposed to. With the title "Shaggy and Scooby Doo get a clue", any episode of this title claims that the entire beloved cast of other motivations will be actively reacted. And somewhere in it it is said that they'd be solving secrets, and they can not even stand up to the demons, so why they? I've put some long-term plot points on a scooby-do show. They also run jokes, clumsy high-jinks, chase scenes, quick-change clothes, standard hawk hog and Scooby snacks. I am really happy, because this program is there, because I loved it. I've been away for a while and have concentrated on two main characters and a villain. I am very happy. <br /> It's certainly ridiculous. Definitely it's different, it's supposed to be. It's no matter what size you have to make a smile at the villain, and the successor on all the penetrating lice of cheer for idiot robotic butler. You're running a "Robbie-Row" joke. The whole thing is just so well put together, there is one thing I think it's wrong. Writing, acting, animation, all the top notch. The title music is awesome (when my computer dramas get "CLUE!"), And the background music is just gripping.
