The film is looking at visual beauty and acting alone, but there is also an interesting cultural subtitle. Women and performers (both working together to play a collective role in both of them) have suffered relief in China. This creates a relationship between an aging street performer and a young man who has succeeded on local culture. <br /> <br /> The problem I had with the film was just a soundtrack <br /> <br /> An unsatisfying summer action film is a welcome alternative.
