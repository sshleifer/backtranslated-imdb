This is definitely the classic classic Embott ASPID ELSE for John Abraham. This guy is an awful actor. Comedy, drama, tear-jersey etc. <br /> As he appeared at some time, Priyadarshan also learned this, pretty much jumping as a monkey to his anger. <br /> He's only the most annoying tid-bits of a noticeable error) that's otherwise a playful movie. Hummama, IMO will then come up with the best comedy in Bollywood. Like the hangman, Akshara Kumar is a brilliant screen player and a dialogue comedy on the sides of the course. This is probably his best performance to date. He is the best comedian in each award program for the shoe-in. AK always looks good in comedy, but takes it to a different level here. Body language, facial expression and he provides each line. It is a genius display. While the Pack Theater goes for nuts for a whole length, I do not think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for Bollywood film here in the USA. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala is a "main" heroine. The incredible HOT + Beautiful Girls 3 stars that I thought would have done a very good job. Pretty sure they are making all their debuts. Paresh Rawal is strong as usual, although his routine has been worn out shortly after. Rajpal Yadav is his distinctly annoying man (his over-the-top act in each film). There is nothing to Rimi Sen. <br /> All in all, definitely a dekho value. I'd say FUNNIER than no entry, and it says so much. <br /> <br /> They chose a little more than just John Abraham. <br /> <br />
