We will follow the adventures of the two main characters, as in the film, always engaging. But C + J is a sex juice to go back to a jerky trip to early childhood, and these alleles appear in their cardiovanity as well as at the time of finding hormotism. There are many people who have sex with badly bored or unwilling partners, even if they have their deepest un-pc behavior, and everyone is laughing. Like C + G, they are all rebels against the innocent in the heart, terrorism, bourgeoisie, and captivity. As someone commented, I wanted to know about this 2 and the reason for most of the tour is the humorous and very small tragedy scenes (not on their door), which made me miserable but with a sweet taste in the mouth. I dare to say that French only can not get away with movies like this. And their genius is part.
