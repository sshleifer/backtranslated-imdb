The story of historical drama and age involving free citizens of color in New Orleans in the former Civil War. When you learn about the main characters, the steam begins slowly and the real action begins. This is not just a story about black women's exploitation because it's free people. They may not have the rights of whites, but their destiny has more control over their slave ancestors. Young people and women in this story should choose their own about how to live their lives, live in anxiety or optimism, and contribute to their society. I enjoyed the characters but my favorites were Christoph, Anna Bella and Marcel.
