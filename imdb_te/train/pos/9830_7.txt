No one really understands the logic behind the Italian zombie-flix number, but ?? Honestly? Why do we bother? Every single movie in the series "Zombi" offers a lot of fun, nasty gore and gratuitous shocks, and despite all the difficulties that occurred during the "Zombie 3" shooting, it is no exception. The film began as an interesting Lucyo Fulzi project, which he hoped to further extend his "Zombie 2" success, but it was Bruno's matte product with more bugs and abduction ideas from previous films. The screenplay is inconceivable and has ignored every great idea from George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" and "The Crisis", rarely repeats, and acting appearances are really fragile and painful. Yet all this one moment does not upset me because all of the amazing over-the-top gore replaces everything! On a secret military base in the Philippines, scientists have completed bacterial combat virus "Death One" and are preparing for transportation. After attempting to steal the virus, the infected corpse of a terrorist is burned and contaminates the entire population of the tourist village near the zombie-ashes. The last group survived to fight with the hippocampic and inhuman strong zombies and soldiers in white overalls who received instructions for killing everything that was killing areas. This film can be compared to Umberto Lenzi's "Nightmare City". Really bad ... but entertaining with very fast action scenes and many very creative zombie mad conditions. The undead birds are original, for example, and the whole zombie birth scene as well as deserted hospital looks good. The infamous flying head scene is made up of it and it's not nearly as awkward as this cheesy and fully pleasant Italian zombie movie belongs perfectly. Recommended for fans; Negative reviews do not mind.
