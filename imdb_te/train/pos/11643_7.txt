I enjoyed this presentation, but the design required some work. First off, good features. I'd like to see how this presentation will take us through the daily life of a slave as the producers do what they will do to make a slave to show us how to get their lives. After that there will be an intervention, and then it will be the result. Intervention is not confectionery-coat and sometimes the result (often short-lived due to time constraints) is a negative result. This improves positive results. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about the performance is the camera work quality. This cameramen is surprisingly good and stable for photography given the reality that does not take advantage of scenes anywhere and grab reaction. <br /> <br /> This is really superior to written recordings like "that shield". Photography is very frustrating. In one episode, sometimes it has two different and unrelated cases, which will be included during the show. You suddenly get caught in the story of a slave after you threw into another story. Suddenly you were caught in the story that first came back to the slave ... or are you? You have forgotten the moment you belong to the personal person on the screen. This sustainable flip-flapping between addiction is really addictive because the show is completely combining two unrelated interventions! Once I was marketing B.S. I heard that. The reason for this poor design is: "The changing scenario for another addiction allows viewers to realize what they see." Kindness. Apparently it happens because they have two cases that are not big enough to perform a two hour because they both mix together. By combining them instead of giving each half an hour, if they are interested in a case, it makes the viewer view the whole thing (and commercial advertising). <br /> <br /> I have found these "blender" episodes very painful, but I only told them to record episodes containing a slave to a Tvino, but it was easy to record all of them.
