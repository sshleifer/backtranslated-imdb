EDMUND LOWE (somewhat reminiscent of Warren Williams), moving with a brisk pace and running a little over an hour is an interesting little mystery nice cast heads. <br /> <br /> Douglas Walton is unlucky with Jackie (Hypnotism, Someone?), and a supporting support for suspects - Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Freda Inescort, Jean Lockhart, Jesse Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner. As an additional bonus, Notte Pendleton is a diminutive detective - loading art deco set decoration for fancy interiors in the rich house. It must be a set that has been used in the next film. <br /> <br /> The plus side is not too complicated. This is suddenly clear to Detective Philo Vance - who then has a final clash with the murderer, which gives the film a five-minute suspense. <br /> <br /> Fun in an entertaining manner.
