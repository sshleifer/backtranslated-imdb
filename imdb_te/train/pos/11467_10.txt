The best film I have come across in a long time. The best film of this kind (school shooting) was not only Ben Kochio (director) filmmaking. He still painted the young actors who attend high school. He filmed it into actors' own rooms, and actors used real parents as their parents in the film. Even actors are filming using video conferencing, using conformers. (If there is one word) but there are some slip ups, such as call firing (?) Land Rover Range Rover (or similarly, it's been a while since I saw it)
