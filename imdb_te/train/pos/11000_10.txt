Do not do justice to the film because the film is going to come to the film with hope. <br /> <br /> These types of images are treated as the same type of character. It involves a spy thriller, noir, bits and pieces of action, science fiction, and cyberpunk a fantastic storyline, twists of brain twisted stories, and beautiful cinematography. <br /> <br /> The comments here are from the good and bad ways of other movies. <br /> As they say, each story Crisis from Shakespeare, so you will experience it in the past, you are going for the hell of the ride. <br /> You can stop your disbelief at some point, and the set is always reliable, with low budgets and somewhat cheesy visuals (read: elevator). <br /> If you are looking for action, you are turning around. Away. This is pure psychology. But if you want to sit and dedicate your life for 90 minutes with a novel film experience, do everything else now! Look at this movie before it's cool!
