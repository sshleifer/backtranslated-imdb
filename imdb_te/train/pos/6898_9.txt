It's all about fun in French and a very simple hero in funfun La Lleepe, but produces a very brave hero. Played by the wonderful Gerard Phillip, dashing teenager belief in the curvaceous Lollobrigida foretells - especially that he is married to the daughter of King Louis XV! <br /> <br /> Will La Lao be contacted soon? She is also in love with Fanfan. <br /> <br /> Film is a quick paced and very funny moments through good knife fights, kawalkades and other exciting action sequences. Directing is probably a weak factor, but the image is very light and I can not give such insights into a second idea. Noel Roquette, who tried to steal La Loll, looked for a big tradition in French films, reciting himself as a frustrating figure, and laughing in La Lille's hand! And what a gem Marcel Herrand megalomanous and lava driven King Louis XV! It's not all: many beautiful women in a movie I want to return in France and set in 1952! The film may have come out that year, but its verb, cheek, stunning commentary, pure photography and memorable Gerard Philip make sure to have a fresh look and feel. I would not hesitate to specifically recommend it to my grandchildren alone for anyone who loves movies and swashbucklers movies! See this!
