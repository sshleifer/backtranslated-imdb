This is the second iTen Fox film I have seen. <br /> But realistic actors are young Israelis living in a small apartment - Noam (Oiad) Nolar), Lulu (Danina Pretzer), and Yellie (Alone Friedman); And Ashfrof (Yusuf 'Joe' Sweid) is Palestine that connects them. <br /> <br /> "Rub, how many posters do you have, or how many conflicts are there for you peace, war is not ending, and many years to bring the two sides to the table." They want to go for any reason, but there are so many people on the Israeli side here and here in the US, all of these are not necessary and peace. <br /> <br /> When you look at this funny and charismatic movie, it's in your mind and it does not go away. With strong feelings of emotions and inspiring vengeance, the tragedy always happens, and it is in the city Friends / sex as the adult version. Not the surface. This is real life, and it's a beautiful thing to watch.
