Before I begin, I must indicate that I know the editor of this film. We have never met, but we belong to the same fans (messages that came before message boards), and we talked on the phone, which is why there is a partiality here. When the film returned between the 50's and the mid-90's "rat pack" culture in the mid-50s and 60s, the film was one of the original rat packs from rat, and this was done in a similar manner, a flop. Moreover, this is a complicated flop. I believe that Rolling Stone's Peter Travers did not misuse this (he reconsidered a mixed review). I do not think that this is a great movie in the world, and I'm not a fan of Right Pack, or "Cocktail," culture, I think this is worth seeing. For one thing, this looks stylish, and moves right. For another, major performances are good. Richard Dreyfus was detained here as surprisingly here as a gangster on the head was coming from a sanitarium, and was a dolge for him. Jeff Gold Bluff goes back to silent contradictory performances in his pre-blockbuster days, like Big Chile. Ellen Barkin is the only film in the movie, but it's fun. However, this is not a great image; The dialogue is mostly created by pankas, and most people do not work (such as "Ben's Zen" speech). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle McLockan are awful here. Still, I've got fun, and if you like gangster movies, you might be too.
