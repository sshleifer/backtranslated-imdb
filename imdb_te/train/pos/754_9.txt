If you do not have it there, then unfortunately this film is beyond compassion for you. This is an insult as I mentioned, because it is intended for realism, even though some of the actors are acting. Let's face it - in real life, we can not say things in a perfect or perfect way, even if we understand. In this sense, it works. However, the film does not apply to our "known" actors, especially Jody Foster (originally born). The fact that other 3 girls have not been achieved only adds to the story - the pair plays a glue that struggles to keep close to their friendship, which is also a clear concept of death. <br /> <br /> Even more so close friends, some people are deteriorating. <br /> <br /> It's not about the party, it's not about sexuality, but these 4 girls and even young Adams before they go the world alone. <br /> <br /> You are your life, you will feel this movie - it will always mean to you, it's not of any age, or you're in an era of grown up. We know these girls at school, or those who know very little. We all know the irritating virgin, wanting to hold on to half the childhood and desperately wanting to grow half and think it will do for her. We all know the boy-crazy one, the fashion plate hates her fear of her vanity world, fear her acceptance. We all know that the party girl, they are sad about her sad home life stories but her ruthless exploits. And we all know a little more sad because all "mother figure", a little more real, slightly grounded, knows what she is going through. Maybe you are one of those girls. <br /> <br /> In this film, maybe at some time or another. <br /> <br /> This film is really embedded in every man's head with the fragile time, needs, pressures, femininity, childhood, world and loneliness in life, every aspect of a high hill. What item do you have to hang out? What do you do on the edge of the topic of how you want to catch? And how painful it is that everything you know is good? The film is about to hang in childhood, and how to walk is to be walking. If you're there, you know ... and I love this movie. Aching and smooth work. The best part of the captured women.
