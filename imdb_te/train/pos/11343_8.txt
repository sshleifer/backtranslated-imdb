In the late 70s I had to remember this thing in TV - it was with me! It's lovely, loud, colorful - a great child's picture. I recently put some friends into a party - naturally they thought it was mad and thought I was suffering from illness "somewhere to meet the pubs." But - its pale clean play. <br /> <br /> If you have a split of banana and are in your 30s, the body will be rebuilt on Saturday morning. <br /> <br /> Puff thought himself a little worse - he managed to escape everything he did! Quality TV movie - like me, if you are into the metal of death - you'll love it!
