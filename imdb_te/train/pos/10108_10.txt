A perfect classic !! Directed to be flawless, acting is simply amazing. Words for this great work are small. The most accurate picture of Mumbai Police <br /> <br /> Omit Puri is a stellar performance, Smita Patil, given a small number. All actors made their best and cinematic races excited in every moment of you. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a police (Om Puri) who started his career as a sincere person. Eventually dying into a killer. The first attempt at Bollywood was to bring back the scenes and disclose the fact that Mumbai cops were discouraged. Kudos to the Ensemble !! <br /> <br /> After the film, Police releases Police Nexus with a criminal-politician for killing Bollywood films. This film is really a trend setter. The trend has dominated the Hindi film scene for more than a decade. <br /> <br /> The film became a moderate box office hit. <br /> <br /> Must see for intelligent movie fans.
