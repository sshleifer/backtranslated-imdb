The best comic book film made up of Dick Tracy date. The same feel as the comic book in the film, the color scheme is real. Batman rang again, dropped, reached again and fell again. Dick Tracey has the real power of being, both adults and children can enjoy. Good guys win over evil, without blood and gore to get the point across. Al Pacino makes an excellent job for his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprais and Madonna is a well-known sleepwheel. But as with Clyde Borrows, Dick Tracy is just two of the best jobs, Warren Beatty. It can not wait until the DVD is on April 2, 2002, and my tape is wearing thin.
