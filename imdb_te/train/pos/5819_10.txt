I liked this movie since it first came. I am nine years old, now I am 27 years old. I must remember playing a video game in Sega Genisys. I am very happy, my son is willing to show this movie. He likes Michael Jackson and I know that I love this movie when I'm a kid. He first saw him though he was younger. I can not wait to get it on DVD! I hope it comes out on DVD! Let's go out on DVD! I'm dying to see again !!! Well my comment I hope one day soon I'll get to view this movie again. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite short video is the bodger!
