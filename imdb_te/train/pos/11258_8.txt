Spoilers! Classic 70 Sex Worst! Swedish Gull (Helga) The film is great. She was beautiful, but what really got me was sexual. She has a large amount of sex throughout the film. Her best moments are her, mum, stimulating. <br /> <br /> Also, Dr. Julia (sister of the film's faint male view) is also very interesting. Although bigger at the age of 12 than Julia, her name is unclear to her and her sequences (especially the scenes with the silk sculpture and black skirt). I also loved the main hockey scene where the bats removed her. At the same time I do not know if I have ever seen a sexy yet sexy yet. Classic stuff!
