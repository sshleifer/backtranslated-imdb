Most people out on DVD are out on DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (From Borders, Wow!) Although it's very painful to have this wonderful presentation on the Boxed DVD, I have shown the same "" Extra "(director commentary from Shawn Cassidy) to the pilot episode) and the episodes they put on TV. Components that do not show before the implementation of the science fiction channel are set in the box but are loaded on the final DVD. If you buy a DVD set, they will be viewed in the real order and you will be happy. <br /> You need to switch the DVDs of your player and out to see the order in order, but you will be happy. <br /> <br />
