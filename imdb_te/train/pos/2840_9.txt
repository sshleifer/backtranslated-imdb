I saw this movie screening and I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed playing the sidewalk pocket, it's good to watch Rachel Bilson and Hayden together. I think the camera is a direct result of their time with their chemistry camera. My favorite scene is so far (surprisingly) a piece of Bretner Rutner ... I can say that without you being too far away, you will be surprised ... <br /> <br /> The old couple were good together and the idea that they spent a lifetime really received. <br /> <br /> Chris Cooper and Ethan Hock segments are both surprising pranks, which resembles the experiences I enjoyed at the big apple. <br /> <br /> If you already like the city's fondness, it's a great place for all movies to make a special date. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next in the cities I love.
