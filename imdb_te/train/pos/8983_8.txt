The windshield was shot in the car, and someone was playing their latest song, and no one responded by voice over. I was amazed how to do it. There are many scenes in this movie, and I was surprised to see how a camera got there. If the Warhols had a BJM post-party scenario is true, it was not a deliberate exploitation of Max, it was a complete fabrication, but if it had a purpose it made me uncomfortable. I thought about how the footage is in this film. Taken at the facial value, we all believe that (tortured) genius is a good image.
