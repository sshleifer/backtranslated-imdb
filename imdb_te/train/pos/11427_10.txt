In my mind, I saw that life in French colonial Africa was like what I expected in 50 years (at any time "my" generation) because I liked this film. But I was really quietly enraptured by its quiet paging and excellent ending. In the last 5 minutes of this movie, notice what happens to you. I never enjoyed the "adjustment" of an image. I'm "wow!" When I realized it ended. On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the bed !!
