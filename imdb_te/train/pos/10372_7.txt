ROLL is a wonderful little picture. Toby Malone is an 18-year-old boy (well guided, soccer) in soccer. Maloney's cousin takes him to the night before his big game, on an adventure with several gigs and turns involving two exercise bags, a drug lord, some tough bikers, some cops and some prostitutes ... and the film will be on the side of the characters, no gymnasium The contents of, and even gender is a key biker. Its parts reminded me of the lock stock and the two smoking bars. <br /> <br /> For me, before seeing the ROLL ROLL, I supported three existing opinions. Those opinions: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. <br /> The country and the cities are beautiful and it looks like a cool place for the holiday. Some of the best filmmakers in Australia. Cinematography is especially impressive in the ROLL. <br /> <br /> I loved stylized colors and lighting in many scenes. Australian women are hot!
