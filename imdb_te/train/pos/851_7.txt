Pierce Brosnan is a favored aging for adolescents, bulls and fraudulent foil-about booze murderer Julian Noble, who returned to his last martini and a furious self-imitation. In his job in Mexico City he meets Danny (Greg Kinnear), a straight-Denver suburban businessman in town to make his lifetime deal in a hotel bar. Despite their completely different personalities and Julian's raw and progressive comments, they become friends. <br /> <br /> Director Richard Shepard, directed by Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, has revealed that Pierce Brosnan did not write the film, but I can not imagine him without him. He has a real talent for comedy and is more than just James Bond or cold war spies. At the glossy hotel bar (amazing sets and beautifully photographed) the scenery really is a weird piece of acting skills. This scene lasts for about fifteen minutes, and although this is probably carefully scripted, the two actors are increasingly thriving, but they are a great success! It almost feels like a new measure of acting on the screen. Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel's Thinking in MEAN STEETS include one of the most subtle underpinnings of the finest and many genre combinations and actors' own type (especially Brosnan's James Bond), and you're one of the most delightful of recent Hollywood. <br /> <br /> "If the film is just a steam after an hour, I can not finger on it, I've enjoyed this much enjoyment, it's very fresh and original, with some speculative use of sets and lighting, and there are some suggestions for Sezoon Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville: Other characters do not give much more, but this film is something new It makes it almost impossible to mix all the traditional genres with the most entertaining flawlessly fun and most fun. <br /> <br /> Camera Obkkura --- 7/10
