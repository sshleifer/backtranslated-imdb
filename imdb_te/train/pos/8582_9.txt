Love the characters and the story line. Plenty of action is very funny. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carr√®re gave great performances. I have experienced the courageous and humorous interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Souharland is a very fond of, and surprisingly sympathetic. All three actors are my favorites and made for a special treat in the film. A good addition to my extensive DVD collection. I highly recommend this film. If you like ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, L.A. Confidential, The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and, The Whole Nine Yards ... You like this movie.
