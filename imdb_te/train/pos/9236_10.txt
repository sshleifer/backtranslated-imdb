Suppose all of the people, the original Battstery series, even for all the original Battlestar sequences, all stars, stories and arts, left the mouth-messed from the original time. Like Adammo and Durke Benedict Starbuck, Larran Green was great, like Adama and Richard Hatch, but I can not say pretty like Katie as Starbuck. <br /> <br /> "Wait for Heaven, then you have Battlestar women, you can not compare with them, But it is not comparable to the beauty of Jane Seymour .Larta sponge says that Cosophia is fantastic .A rainbow is difficult. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine if John Calcos has six numbers? Thank you for listening.
