I saw my last day in this festival, and I was very happy for those two days. Poem, moving, and very surprisingly, funny, it's own strange way. Directors working in this style can find true courage and humor in a real-realistic world, looking at the performance of a very rare, valuable or satisfying balance. Deals with both improved, and fully controlled. The filmmakers really digest their effects (cassettes, malik, loch, alman ... common suspects) and discovered their own unique style, but if you want modern directors in this tradition (Lenny Ramsey, David Gordon Green), you're in for a real treat. It's a fantastic picture, and I hope to see more of it. If this picture is in the festival in your city, go! Go! Go!
