As I grew up in the sandy streets of Detroit, MI and having friends who traveled to New York balls, I fell down to life as a house member. I joined the House of Days. We have adopted the same rules for most houses, but there are professional crooks that can increase and bind credit card fraud to obtain excellent jewelry and clothes we wanted. A bad queen called me a secret service and learned how to make checks and driver licenses and cash in them in seventeen states until I went to federal prison. But I have learned so much from these queens in this film and I recommend that you see it. In Detroit houses and the criminal activities that we have encountered can be read as to how I grew up. My book, Identity Schemes are available at Amazon.com or at the Identity Schemes dot com. But if you believe me, it's better than burning than Paris because it was made by 2005.
