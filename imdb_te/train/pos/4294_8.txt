I saw this gem in this sold-out house as part of the Hamburg Film Festival, when I left the film yesterday afternoon in the eyes of the audience. And the tears were broken. The film is happy and there is no other way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you do not know, If the situation is needed, it is a serious clown and extreme. The show is entirely up to the top, but it needs the story correctly and it has done well. The great Charlotte Gainsberg is also great, and the mother is also a very strong show. The character of the sisters was script-wise a bit more detailed, but there was nothing else about that anguish. I saw this film when drowning in the rain outside the Hamburg. I would like to release these pictures from France regularly in Germany. But distributors do not seem to mean that this country is made of good French films. I can not wait at least to find a DVD that gives the subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?) Because the movie I need at home to see it many times!
