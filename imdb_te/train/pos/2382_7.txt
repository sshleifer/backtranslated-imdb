For a long time, 'The Menagerie' is my favorite 'Star Trek' episode, but in recent years it has been obscured by 'City on the Edge of Forever'. I used to be a 'zoo', the then-current Trek hero has a more hard-core Star Trek with this fascinating back story. I still think it's very ingenious Jean Roddenberry merged with the original pilot into the two-part episode. The idea of ​​being a battleground in Spock Court is a clever man, as the 'new' part of the story Kirk and some others (and us) are more likely to see the pilot. If you want you can poke holes in the plot. For example, given Talosians' mind-control abilities and captain Pike's condition, why do you need to physically bring back their planet to pike? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and the Commodore Mendez ... without having to think too hard about the details and enjoy ST's two-part.
