A head-to-head cop accidentally kills a suspect suspect and then covers crimes, but he must deal with a guilty conscience when trying to solve the murder case. Andrews and Tirney's film Noor are working effectively with their previous collaboration with "Lara". Andrews is a full-blown policeman who is trapped in unfortunate situations. This act is more like a tough police captain, including Melden, and Thainy's protective parent, better than Tully. Hutch's rich and fruitful screenwriter's screenplay is taut and enthusiastic, and Preming creates a great atmosphere.
