Maybe there was a serious fear of hospitals and medical issues, but this one came under my skin (pardon the pardon). This piece is brave, not afraid to go up and they are satisfying in terms of revenge movies. Not just to find our feeling of sympathy for a lot of sympathy towards the screwer and "screwee", I really feel lingering and feeling loud at some Jununures which is a rare and joyful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like me. Some recall the "Hellraiser", but be grateful for the simulation. This is a huge hand that many viewers do not consider, but once a little bit and I get a little bit more. This piece brings it and does not appologize. I liked this very much. Do not look at eating pudding
