This film has a transformation experience for a group of young people, and it has become the viewer of the experience watching it. Some movies have also surpassed this series and I can think of any other movie - documentary or play. I both laughed too much. Yes, it's about DMD and available travel; On those issues alone, it is a valuable venture, but it's more. It's about friendship. Every day you live is living. And it's a great, fun, adventurous storyline. That is why God created the movie! Watch this movie !!!
