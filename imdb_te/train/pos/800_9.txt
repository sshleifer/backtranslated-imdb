I could not be more thrilled; Eight years ago, in 1983, I was going to see a star wars movie at the theater! The best day of my life is going on. At that time, my only Star Wars experience was some HBO shows of Star Wars. <br /> And boy, that day I delivered to my less complex eyes. Japan. Big Rebel spaceships. The Empower. A light green light! Wow! Since that magic, I have seen this film hundreds of times. I can not even make a perfect estimate at this time. <br /> <br /> In fact, in a Star Wars movie, there are a lot of "bugs". <br /> <br /> In 1977 and 1980, millions had their magic. In May 1983, I was with me. And this is my star wars movie.
