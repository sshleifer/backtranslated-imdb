I lived in those times and I was impressed by the program's epoch. I think Afro should deal more with the American edition but I think it will cover a lot of the program. It is suddenly hoping that sitting in the T-Block, not going to your families' home, it is not burned. I played the role of vet back from Jerry O'Connell's war. I went to school with the boys who came back. Some have changed more than others, and others have changed very much. It hurt me when someone commented that a problem was not adequately covered or not sufficiently entertaining. Live through it and then make comments. I thought the film was great and it made everyone doing a great job. Memo Lane down (sad and good) Thank you for the trip.
