Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is just on the edge of the youth, has some strange dreams that she can affect her in real life - especially she has a boy named Mark (Eliot Spears) who meets her dreams. <br /> Very unusual fantasy with some really horrendous moves. Although it is about a young man and a PG-13 rating, this is not for children. Also, if you hate to avoid fictions. <br /> You are directed by Bernard Rose with a beautiful music score and some nice, horror jells. The only thing that prevents it from a great movie is Burke - she is not a very good actress (this is surprising she is the only film) and it hurts the movie. <br /> <br /> It's just great for everyone. <br /> Spears is very good as Mark; <br /> <br /> When the sleeper hit was released in 1988, Glenn Headley (the British voice is very good) is great, since Anna's mother and Ben Cross have been frightening and sympathetic. This is very bad - it's very good.
