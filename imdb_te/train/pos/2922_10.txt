The film divides all the people into 2 groups. It's joke and they do not know. Usually they are attacked by unknown ones. The film has a humorous style and charm, since it is unparalleled. It's a great comedy .. and a great love. This is the exact date picture. A good picture of a good heartfelt laughter. And if your perspective is too confusing, perhaps this movie is not for you and you may need advice. In the early 80's, Paramount had never seen the film's light on DVD on the shelf of the film. Yet they believe that the Urban version "Honeymooners" is a good idea. My romantic comedy films are never released on DVD. The other is Jean Wilder's "The World's Greatest Lover", which ran from the beginning of Fox's 80s ... and, from "Justin to Kelly", is in almost every video store in the country. There is no justice in the world. Perhaps this Bash will take those who took the time to "Enjoy Justin to Kelly", I'm sure that they watered enough for "get". Sometimes people lose their sense of humor ... or sometimes it goes just as old and they get funny satisfaction in the reconstruction of the "Full House".
