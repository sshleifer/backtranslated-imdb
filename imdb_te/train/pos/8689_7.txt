Perfect cast for some person drama. Simon is dead but is out of the way. As he saw there, German avant-garde was exhibited in the form of vacant spots by the composer Werner Henz. Simon was haunted by his death, he'd seen on the other side to comfort through the support of death people. His girlfriend attempts to capture him but fails and decides to follow him after his death. Very lovely and moving, deep psychic, but a bit slow and boring somewhere.
