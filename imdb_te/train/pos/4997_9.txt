It's a great movie for a fan of Hong Kong action movies. From the small plot, weak drama and comedy criticism bits, the film is filled with gun fighting and martial arts action. Entertainment is me from the beginning until the end. <br /> <br /> Hong Kong action is strong with action director like Corey Yuen. This modern action movie is highly recommended !!
