The perfect place is the fantasy film. The children's team must unexpectedly go back and come back, but they certainly do. Family is not a picture if they die. Then it will be sad. You will need Kat Capsa, a leading female Golden Globe performance, but unfortunately, she or Lee Thompson has achieved a success. That's bad. I can not say enough, this film is great, Lee Thompson-Lord, a sweet girl in the film. This film is absolutely fine. <br /> Sorry, it's better than Star Wars. Star Wars is so high rated and the Space Camp is so low rated. <br/> <br/> <br/> 10 / 10- 0r probably 11/10. Not good in mathematics
