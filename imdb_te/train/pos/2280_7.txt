Hard to classify the image - maybe it's an avant garde spy thriller? Mother Night is a very good Vannagat novel, and certainly one of his simplest novels to turn one into a movie length. The original book adaptation is very reliable. The "indie" approach is more effective than funding a large Hollywood studio on how this film has been built. Nowadays, an intellectual novel like Mother Night is always suspected of getting green light from big Hollywood grindhouses. Usually it's very bad, but not in this case. Mother Night is a solid direction and solid cast. Nick Nolte has had good roles as he grows older when he is older, and still takes on a wide range of different characters with "every man" personality. Sheryl Lee is always beautiful and great. I mean she is better than what I came out of the entertainment industry. Even though the TV show has become a minor phenomenon, as the dead girl (Twin Peaks) is the first time you have a low air time, the characters are not a choice. Anyway, the film is totally enjoyable and you do not read the book to understand the movie. In fact, today's terrestrial political facts can be deduced, and some young viewers are totally confused with little knowledge of history (I'm talking to you, fellow Americans, students and much less geography, history, and the Lord knows other countries!) .
