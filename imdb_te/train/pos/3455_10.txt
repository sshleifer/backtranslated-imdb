Steven Spielberg (24) had already directed two amazing episodes of the 1971 series called "The Psychiatrist" featuring Roy Thimps. An episode is about a mentally ill 12-year-old boy and a stronger teenager (Clue Gulager for his best performance) who die of cancer. Both episodes are fantastic, visually emotionally complex and adult than anything else on TV. The creators of "The Psychiatrist" Richard Levinson and William Link created "Colombo" and created its first season. <br /> Peter Fawl was the first rank, experienced TV directors such as "Colombo", Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smith. Faulk admits to Sparkberg after seeing as part of the Clue Gulaghar episode of "The Psychiatrist". <br /> <br /> Steven Bochko's "Murder by the Book" script (based on a Levinson / link story), and he tried to produce a million dollar feature, and also felt that he had little money to work. <br /> <br /> The episode of "Colombo" is very far away and uses a sound track and background music more easily than the other "columbo" episode, although the series is always used as top directors. Spielberg maintains the great Faulk and Cassidy without having much humming, but the two actors are still very fun. Spielberg also has a good assistant from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Kalbila. All shows have freshness and vitality over them. <br /> <br /> The only episode of "By Don's Early Light" episode is "the Colombo" episode with Patrick McGohan (directed by Harvey Hart). <br /> <br /> This episode of "The Psychiatrist" and "Colombo" suggests that Spielberg is technically not developed as a director. He was great from the beginning. A "fighting!" The DVD's commentary of the 1962 episode guest star Albert Salmi in which Robert Altman says that this episode is pretty much as good as ever. Perhaps the same is true of Spielberg.
