Shinjuku Triad Society: The Chinese mafia wars are likely to be distributed in the West outside the film festival. Why? Do your sensors take a woman in the stomach and see an elderly lady cut off her eyes or rape her ill (or to enjoy the victims) to talk to men and women suspects? These are some of the obstacles in store for the story audience of this ultra violin cops and gangsters. It was banned for years as a Disney cartoon in the UK for Clockwork Orange. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see this movie? YES It is an amazing and emergency view for Asian movie fans. There are surprising moves to show what's going on in the world of these characters. If you want, make sure you're Dead or Alive (except for the DOA course except the hype). Mike, who is at the same time working in Takashi Kitano, is great for Japan. At the Film Festival, Takashi Mike is the best chance to watch the movie outside the Retrospective. If I do not ban hunting for the Hong Kong version on the web, I'll come out of that country.
