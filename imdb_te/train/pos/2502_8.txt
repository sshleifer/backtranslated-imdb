This picture was astonished at me! I can not really hope to hear about the hight of the gate! I would like to see this movie because someone told me that there were some serious action scenes in the John Moo Woo style. I'm very careful when I say the most! There's just a director who comes close to his brilliance when it comes to just being a John Woo and til work today! The fact that the "Moon's Child" is a vampire is more convinced of me! How can you go wrong with the vampire blazing gun! Guaranteed and interesting sounds! The pace is slowly the first thing I have noticed about this film! It takes time to set mood! This movie has some good Hong Kong style action scenes! But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It's a play about friendship and fidelity! The focus is on the characters and their interaction! Pop singers are doing a good job in acting as Hyde and Gate, and are incredibly believable as friends! I only have a similar problem with the plot! Explaining what is going on sometimes, it seems to be a film some years ago why it should be crossed! Example: When a member of the gang dies (most dramatic moment) Alexander Wang Kai (Hyde) sees blood in the attackers! Nine years after the caution and explanation, nine years have passed and many friends will not be together! Even son without proper reason (Alexander Wang) and show (gaat) have to kill each other! I know this is going to add some serious drama! It is very effective because actors but sometimes it does not feel forced! The film does not like the film without the flaws of the plot. It is difficult to explain why this movie is so wonderful! But it's just! The whole experience you get is heartwarming and honest!
