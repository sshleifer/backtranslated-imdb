Akira Kurasawa's Swansong: A Closer Mark he wrote in a screenplay that he intended to portray the story of his autorickshaw Schugoro Yamamoto, who left a brilliant career in the movie 'Akah Wa Mitita' ('The Sea Is Watching') which featured Akira Kurasawa's film. <br /> <br /> The story, set in 19th-century Japan, analyzes the women's lives of the Geisha House. The man in life is to earn money by pleasuring. This house maintains an old couple named Gentilal and is an enchanting group of women who know their trademarks and be proud of their careers. Every Geisha's life has a reason to divide. Oshino (Nakiko Tano) supports her family living in her neighboring village, and Kikuno (Missa Shimizu) has good and bad customers with stories of her upper caste. Ocean learns that friendship with the endangered samurai, falling in love with a delicate garden, not marrying from his caste, and abandoning his pleasures with the Ocean as his promised marriage. <br /> <br /> The heart of the ocean is easily cured, but it emotionally and physically supports kicuno and other cures. <br /> <br /> A beautiful samurai Riosuk (Masotsi Nagase) enters Oshin's life and develops the first reliable and dedicated relationship with her. Kikuno encircled by problems, decides the old humble love of an old man who wants to marry her, and determines whether she is great and abusive with the customer. While looking at the ocean and storm Geisha's house and street destroying, Oceanine and Kikino sit in the ceiling and wait for the rescue promised. The ending of the story is one of sacrifices, love and devotion. Seeing the sea and taking care of true love. <br /> <br /> Kajo Okhura Photography is breathtakingly beautiful: night shots with bright lanterns and colorful Geisha interiors calm and turbulent with the repetitive moments of the sea. Acting is a bit of a filter for the Edo Art, but the characters are well-formed and the story is credible. Certainly not Kurosawa is forgiven It is a distraction of the Japanese music track in authentic practices as a distorted Western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera sounds except in solitary periods. But ultimately Kurosawa's effect is enough to incorporate this film with a dazzling fantastic brilliant dream of preserving its prominence on the global film. Grady Harp
