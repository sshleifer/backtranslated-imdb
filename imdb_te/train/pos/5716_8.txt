I did not see anything in Japanese Grudge-Films, but I really had this feeling. I rarely get scarred when watching movies. The impact and the sound are enough to make me look like I'm scared from the movie, but it's a rare thing for me. But I was scared from the grudge. Because I did not expect anything when I saw it. I did not expect to be scared. I do not know anything about it. This is probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> It is undoubtedly an image that you love or hate. Many people can compare to Japanese grudge-films, but I do not believe them, but I believe it is not right to compare any images. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, so many say. I do not agree. This story is small, and intentionally done. The story-telling techniques used - for example the broken time frame - will be done in full. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the image you see or hate. It's easy.
