Surprisingly good early attempt from Alfred Hitchcock. One of the only original films that Hitchcock himself wrote, the film shows the structure of the most famous stories. Carnival Champ "One Round" Jack begins with an exciting boxing tournament that loses a competitor from the audience dealing with a professional prize fighter. The film slows down to develop those characters and introduce the love triangle between Jack, his girl and professional boxer. The rest of the film, a time for the heavyweight crown, is a dramatic structure to rebuild the two men. In this early film, Hitchcock also shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop slave. A band that bought the box by the boxer will pop up the image as a symbol of his faith. The film's only major television show was the art of painting the boxing competition in 1927. As a result the final match is somewhat atypical. The story, however, is what this film is doing.
