<br /> <br /> If you meet The Matrix with The Truman Show, what do you get? The creators of The Matrix say it is 'Anime inspired'. From watching this trailer to the trailer, you can see where they have taken the plot. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, the film was a set of pictures in Japan, which really shows. Clothing, music and words (in the recent English language version by AD Vision) are all as they are lifted straight from the era. <br /> When I look at the matrix, I think that the world is not true. . It's not really 1980's. It's actually like the 2480s. After the nuclear war, the ecosystem of land (or "ecological prime minister") was destroyed. We survived, where the conflict continued. After the departure of all planets (or "biospres"), people began to live in megasons - within cities, through hypnotism techniques and the Truman Show-Esque hallucination, they believe that they are back in the earth, in the most memorable time of the 1980s. When the young shago gets a mysterious sophisticated motorcycle, he leads him to learn more than he knows ... The Garland (a bicycle on the march), a weapon from the 2400s, is the military to flee from him. When you learn more about MegaZone, the war comes close to home and there are also divisions between military and computers, even war megazon ... I apologize if those points appear to be spoilers. <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> In this film, emotions are much higher than the Matrix. You believe that the war is really happening, and what he invented is that Shago is really scarce. A Uber happy movie starts with the image of the cold 80 and what becomes a tragic story of war and unreality. These characters are not actual cards, cardboard pieces that encounter the bullet-time in Madrix. In such a conspiracy, and the feeling of people suffering after being trapped in a war is indeed. <br /> <br /> Animation is pretty impressive for that day, and the quality of the film on ADVision DVD is unbelievable for its age. The artistic style is beautiful and the symbol of the traditional anime is very cultural. There is a lot of violence and blood, and there is also a sex sex scene. <br /> <br /> The Matrix can be seen as 'no end', <br /> <br /> One of the best themes I have seen is, of course, the best. <br /> <br /> I would recommend ADVision DVD, which is excellent in English language, and the film does justice, and can buy an artbox for holding two sequels when they are released, which is the same voice cast. <br /> In all, MegaZone 23 is a magnificent image, and is highly maintained that it deserves to be, and should be important in any anime fan collection. Heck, even my mother enjoyed it.
