This beautiful story coming to an elderly son, one part of all the things he has left to learn from love and to get out of the house, is sharp and moving. In the Western world, we are probably in a strange state of society, with the family of the lost family. The story is pretty, sad, sometimes funny and comic. There is a realistic feeling that we can no longer see in our western films. <br /> <br /> The film is unusual, when the movie progresses, it gives the impression that it is not nearly acting, but ordinary people are a documentary. Making this amazing direction and film. <br /> <br /> Does this director like to watch more movies.
