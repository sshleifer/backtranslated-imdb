Any Way Wind Blows Tom Barmons (who knows as the 'Deus' front man of rock architecture) is the first film. Completely filmed in Antwerp (Belgium), the film begins on Friday morning and sits up to a dozen main characters' day events. <br /> <br /> When the film ends, you have a lot of things to think about, and the lines of many stories remain spacious. <br /> <br /> In this movie (the whole instrument) is the sound track, socks off. In most scenes, music really enhances the normal atmosphere and makes it really illuminating to see in certain parts of the film. <br /> <br /> Director did not hesitate to use video clip techniques, and his main characters danced in the best soundtracks I made. Delayed late. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is great. Camera angles and colors are well selected. 'Dresses' are very hot and too 'seventies' too. <br /> <br /> The thing that I liked about the film was subtle, surreal, very dry or dull. <br /> << (Though not comedy comedy, it is not an alternative art), it makes the audience gazing and sometimes even stimulates laughter. <br /> <br / This is another director's not the end. I saw more Tom Barman movies in the future because I have a good time. Cheers.
