The slow but pretty-mounted story of the American Revolution. Griffith's story-telling is much less than in his earlier historical mythology and his work is fully integrated into action. Lionel Barrymore is a pure swine, Neil Hamilton poor but agile and Carol Dempster .... Well, Carol Dempster is wrong with Griffith at this time, but the pace is slow <br /> <br /> The trivia of the film is the first time released 2 hours But not more than 90 minutes. However, the dvd release is slowly placed at the fps rate, which increases the tension and takes it back two hours. <br /> <br /> The Patriot is good enough to tell the story than the sound version. In Geoffrey's finest league, the wine down and the broken blowsom, a wonderful way to spend a few hours.
