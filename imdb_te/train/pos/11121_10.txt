One person who has seen all the seasons, I can say that JG constantly surprises me. U Believe yourself, after every little gesture immediately saw him transmitted from the mental disorder throughout the seasons following his belief: u He is a good actor and he can get into a pirated skin. But after seeing his eyes open and struggling for his life, I almost mean he could feel "made" the belief he was going through us. As soon as I hit him through the show, I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys are definitely among their generations and more. But nowadays they're old or dead (Brando) and they're making little movies and their shows are "lightweight" than they used to. He can not wait to see Gondols in other films that give him a different role. Can u recommend me some of his old movies give him a memorable performance?
