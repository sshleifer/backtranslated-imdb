"Silverlake Life" is a documentary and it's plain and straightforward. Actually, it's like a home picture, and if you want dramatic brightness, look for something. And it does not mean a tearjerker. But I mean the positive ways. It affects the lives of each and every one of the two men who love each other and the AIDS. It's not hard to say whether it's a fine picture, because I look for other ways to respond. This is a really appreciative film, indeed one of the most admirable and honest documents I've ever seen. These two men have excellent loyalty because their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. This can be a hip-and-heart production of holo-wood productions in AIDS. These men made for this film, one of the best reasons to create something. "You Are Sunshine" sang Tom Mark and the good thing that makes him feel good is the real thing.
