I see again rivers and tides today. It's a second time in two days and yes, I'll watch many times I need movies. Yesterday I was stripped of the paintings of the works and the works of Golds Worthy. This morning I threw coins and I received 29 unbelievers (water). Golds has a relationship with Waters Water, hence the title. I received the 5th line conversion, which was moved to the # 7 Army. Blake's art has a battle. I always wanted to see the film again. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews online from the SF Examiner. The critics have loved this movie, but the comments of Golds Worthy have gained the joy of the film. He'd only had pictures and excellent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Now I see this today. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought Andy Golds wanted to vote for Wired World King. Today I get a little bit of pictures and listen to what he says. Can I enjoy the film without her commentary? What he's doing goes beyond "art" what he says. I think water, time, stone, change, and on and think about him a savvy man Lao Suu or some avatar. His work / words are like some zen. <br /> <br /> However, the film is only shown in the Bay Area (clearly). A Trend Setter. Go to your local cinema and tell them, you do not need to book a movie from faraway places. It is known as rivers and tides. <br /> <br />
