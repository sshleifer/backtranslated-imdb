Have you ever been or have a pet with you, by thick and thin with you, without you lose, and who do you like? <br /> <br /> Stunning, wonderful family image. If you have a soft place for animals, your age does not matter. I used to watch this movie whenever I was a little boy, and now I was at sixteen, and I did. I can never make a decision on a favorite character, and I do not think I can do it too! I love the three animals. Conversation is real and flexible, like a loving but controversial family. I love the chans, and in the end he finally said he had a family. Cheesy, yes, but remember that this is a family picture, and it's full of that role. Sassy has the perfect dose of "sympathy" and Shadow is the perfect leader / role model for the young man, the adventurous opportunity. <br /> <br /> When the animals are kept outside and interacting with them (that is, the salvation of the molly). Every moment is an incredible soundtrack that gives more emotion and a feeling of heart beat. I give this 9/10. Compared to cats and dogs and babies (and may be even better estimate).
