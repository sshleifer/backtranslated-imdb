I'm wondering no one ever thought about doing this film. The horror background is often the most effective when used in real life discomfort as a theme. And no one (except Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors) went to the dentist. <br /> <br /> This plot revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstein (Carbin Bernsen), a dentist. Now we do not play with a full deck to begin with our beloved doctor, but by jealousy and an obsessive-compulsive disorder he begins to destroy those around him. <br /> <br /> Hollywood stylards Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzhnah, its witty and well-written director and director, is closer to what we see in the role of Michael Douglas in Feling Down. A great flow. <br /> <br /> Now I believe that I will not work with this film from Karibin Bernsen without a completely spectacular performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> TTKK's Bottomline - a fun movie from a great performance from Bernsen, with some of the shots (pun intended)
