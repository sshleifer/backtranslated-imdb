Sergio Martino's The Case of the Scorpions Tail is a lovely Giovanni from the beginning of the early seventies. An explosion on an airplane was damaged for money in a million dollars in a decade but an unreliable wife. This money is then cut off by a black dresser and a series of murderous murders. <br /> <br /> Scorpion's tile plays a mystery element written by a very jealous expert Ernesto Gastaldi. But, being in a geo, the murders themselves are memorable and well displayed. In fact, the violence in the film is strong in places-particularly graphic with broken bottle. There is no doubt of violence, to move the geo-genre into a more serious terrain. But the brilliance of the best images in the genre is replaced by good score and attractive photography. Bruno Nikolai's music is reminiscent of Avian-Morte's Avant-Garde script in The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, but is strong in its own right. The film has helped photography in London and Athens, where Martino managed to enter Parliament Houses and Acropolis respectively. Some inventive camera has a lot of work, the use of slow motion in an order that runs towards the door that is prowling behind a woman is very effective. This special scene was a killer hawk with a knife with a knife that was influenced by Martino Dario Argentino's Crystal Plumage, although it was also a killer endeavor to remove the tube with a knife's blade, argon in Surgia. <br /> <br /> Martino's image is influential in its own right. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The performances are good and the productive values ​​are good (although the plane is exploding, we say, somewhat less-budget). NoShame DVD release is good. It includes English and Italian language options, which are a real bonus. However, the English subtitle option should be a quick reader to fully appreciate. This film and documentary covers two additional. If it's a small point, the DVD release is a valuable addition to any GeoLo collection.
