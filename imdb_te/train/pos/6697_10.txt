I remember watching Sabrina first when I came to TV in the UK in ITV1 when I was 13/14. I'm 24 years old now, and I love it when I first saw it. "Show children" but still do not care for me to see a small stick from some of my friends! lol Caroline Ria "Hilda" is my personal favorite character and later Morgan also became another of my favorite characters. I remember that TV station Nickelidon spent a lot of time watching various special programs honoring Sabrina in the UK. I love Melissa Jon-Hart, she's great in "Clarissa All Viris", but it's very good in this regard. I was cut off when they decided to finish it! I hope to be released on DVD in UK here soon - I'll be the first in line! lol x
