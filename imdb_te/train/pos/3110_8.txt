The third and last part of the Bourne trilogy is a bit less in the story section, but it connects with extensive action scenes! <br /> <br /> The director and star (Damon) have agreed that it is difficult to find the story in the end, because the end of the second film is very much ... modern story-wise. How did they come around it? Action scenes, once, but they're also another thing, which I can not reveal, because it's a spoiler. If you look at the picture, than you'll notice! I read that the adaptation of Burne books is exactly the same for all three films.
