I saw this presentation for the first time, and I thought it was interesting. I see, it looks like Sarah revolves around, looking at the role of the world ... she turns around. <br /> In her performance, she is racist, raw, useless and highly self-centered. I could not get her first and took everything at face value. Then I saw her movie, Jesus is Magic. I worked for Sarah Silverman primer, and I think 'any language' will explain to me when she speaks. She is like Marilyn Manson, working hard to give us the feeling of horror and imagination, but it's not an attack, it's a statement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] <br /> I've suggested that I understand smart people, your inertia. I like the 'smart' programs and still do not see Cobbler's comedy with your enthusiasm to this day. I'm getting good feedback, but I can not get it. <br /> <br /> The creators of this show work hard, each episode is not only loaded with dialogue and plot, but songs, or dream sequences, product numbers. These people do not have to fill a time slot and do not please the advertisers, they will appear in a program to create the best show they can put together. If I predict the future of this show, I would say I would go out of arrest development and freaks & geeks. It will be canceled before and broadcast live on fans' hearts and DVD. But take heart, SSP creators, your audiences are there, and we'll watch them as long as they are able to perform the show.
