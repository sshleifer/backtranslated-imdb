Emily Watson's Natalia is the most romantic and romantic main character I have ever seen on a screen. She is the Queen of the film beyond all doubt. Or, was she transferred to the king? The internal leader of the battles of chess games and families for control, power and success is amazing. As the chess master's in the movie, the director is playing a number of simultaneous games with our mind at the same time, but all the leads are made of prime or small designs. At the beginning of the 20th century, Italy's lake district has been a wonderfully portrayed of costumes and costumes. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of intelligent scenes and I can not tell them all. I recommend the time frame to watch this movie twice a week, maybe one week, because you can not capture all the poems in a 64-square and multi-dimensional framework in one saga. <br /> <br /> I do not read Nabokov's book, but reminds me of Barry Levinson's The Natural as another lovely poetry game I've read, to try my own similarity. The ending of the Bernalard Malamud's fatalistic book was fully supported by a Romantic Impressionism called the American. Well, the director made a good by meshing Russian and Italian morality and a backdrop of mores brilliance in the evenings. Here are the real story games zero-sum; The two winners are the winner and loser unless draw. But in life, and especially in the case of our immortal souls, we are limited by those limits and conferences of life, and we break others into our soul. <br /> <br /> Sacred love by Emily Watson's Natalia allows us to simultaneously increase its gifts. <br /> <br /> It can only reduce the barriers we have created by our fears. <br /> This is a fairy image (10/10).
