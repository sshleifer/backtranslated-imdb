What a fun picture! If you're a Gaillo fan, Red Queen Kills 7 times is a real winner. First, it is difficult to make a mistake with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfot in Giovanni. Both are amazing - especially the wide-eyed innocent bouchet of guilty ridden woman who feared for her life. The scenes killed by Red Queen Kills in 7 Times are especially crowded and many fans are delighted. One of the earliest murders comes unexpectedly and gets a really good start movie. The killer, the Red Queen, is one of the most over-the-top and interesting looking murderers I've ever seen in an Italian film. 70 sets and fashions are excellent. In fact, all visuals are interesting with the red Queen laughing across the bridge at night one of my favorite moments in the film. I have my interest throughout the twisted plot. Finally, Bruno Nikolai's score may be the best I've heard from the composer. <br /> <br /> I have two problems with Red Queen 7 times. First, the person responsible for murders is very easy to spot. If you see more than a couple giants, you will not have any problem finding those behind the murders. Second, as soon as it came to a little quickly, the result is a little confusing. I can not say for sure every platform I do not need, but I'm losing to explain it all. The second view may just be clear.
