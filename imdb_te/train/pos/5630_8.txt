Marjorie (a fantastic and inspired performance by Farrah Fouset) prevents her in the car from her car in the car with the malicious cape rapist Joe (she feels frightening and James Rosso's intensity). However, Joe steals his bag and finds where Marjorie lives. He pays a fateful day for her visit. After the degradation and mental abuse of Marjorie, tables in Marjorie Zoo revolve and hug him in the stove. What does Marjory do with Zoe? Director Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Musstosimone have provided a tough, embarrassing and often disturbing morality story that will cause extreme brutality and traumatic abuse. When Marjorie sees only the zoo as "animal", Joe certainly realizes the objects. However, the film declined to make its excellent credit Joe just a wiley one-dimensional creep; Instead he was a gruesome real and ultimately human beast with a wife and kid (especially a stereotypical confession of Joe's). Favet and Russo are the best of Leeds; They get passive Terry, Alfred Woodard from Diana Scarrid as the perfect Patricia, and good support like Sandy Marty's sympathetic police officer Sudo. Curtis Clark's active cinematography and J.A.C. Redford's sheriff, skin crawl score increases the most significant claustrophobic tension. The real powerhouse.
