Fourth Man (Paul Verhoven - Netherlands 1983). <br /> <br /> Gerard Reve is based on a novel, which works best as a thriller. <br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven is generally proven to be something very contrary to critics and I think he I'm always trying to prove that he normally underestimates his audience and adds his story in vague way, so that he will soon be different from the original idea or story and forget about the need to watch the screen It is not clear what he described in the "Fourth Man" with the theme of sex and nudity (though it is not), but he feared that most of his movies did not come to the audience and hammers home. Story, sexy or full frontal naked <br /> <br /> When you cope with Verhoeven's pretty clear satire, it has some mysterious motion twists and turns, All of the good performances are round, the most entertaining thriller with Thom Hoffman and Zorro Krabe. <br /> <br /> Camera obscura --- 7/10
