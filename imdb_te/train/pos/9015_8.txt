In the beginning, this one is from England, so, I have 98% chances to be brilliant and very good movie. I have never heard of this movie before. From the minute I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, and I said to myself: Oh! Here comes the feminine version of my left foot. I'm right, but I'm wrong too. Both films are very differents because the mistake. My left foot is John Ford Alike movie and I turn a little ugly by playing a disabled person in the 1990s Daniel Day-Lewis in the 1990s because it's a Chaplin alike movie (it's funny, but Chaplin in the great sense of drama that brings tears to your eyes.) The reality is with great feeling. Here, the very beautiful Bonham-Carter did exactly this, but with many feminine emotions. The story is well written and very clever. For me, Miss Bonham-Carter gave a piece of great female part in the 1990s, in Emily Lloyd Breaking the Waves. Gee! And look at her eyes! She has the most beautiful eyes from the Yabina Ralston, Louis Brooks, Michael Morgan and Ava Gardner! She has a real talent as seen in many other movies. Look at this one, you will not regret it! And Branagh is a very good job!
