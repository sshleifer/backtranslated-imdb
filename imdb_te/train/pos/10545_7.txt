After watching the cube, I loved the work of Vincenzo Natalie. Natalie seems to have been trivial enough to take a storyline, and it rarely moves like our humorous towers. Instead, he manifests their stories in natural ways, in fact, you can be sure that the cube will try to escape people or in any case, empty space ... nothing! The statement was readily hooked. It seemed so easy! Take two characters that do not like anyone, and send them to the world where there is nothing. Natali makes this so that you forget the existence of a place where there is nothing but the logic. In fact, nothing the world becomes a satire in the film. <br /> <br /> It may be a good time to indicate that the trailer is very misleading. As I said more than a trailer trailer, I'm really fortunate that this movie is more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> By looking at this movie, I've now laughed again, but the person who misleads the advertisement can be totally confusing. <br /> <br /> This film is a feeling of being in some praise. It's a genius concept that has nothing in the world, and two intelligent minded characters to put there two characters, who work philosophy and their surroundings, but idiots who have absolutely no clue where they are hell! Another strong point is the cinematography of the film, it may not be the first! Every wall, north, land, south, west, uphill, just a white plane and depth of understanding will be wrong. It is difficult to determine where to place things in the miss-n-scene. Cinematography takes place many times, but most of this is kept in the camera, so the two letters, or the one object and one character, are placed in the foreground and background, allowing the depth of the depth. However, the film is lacking in some areas. The film is relatively small, though, the sooner the world's innovation becomes too dull, and you want to get some variant on the platform. We can argue that acting is once again questionable. These two characters are in a sense, different, so we have no sympathy for these characters anymore. However, on its flip side, chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough, but there is something missing. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I do not rank this fully enjoyable film! Thinking that another training fiction is a horror movie trailer does not let you filter. It's more than a comedy! It's really worth looking though, for the whole feeling!
