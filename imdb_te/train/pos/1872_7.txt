Without getting to the original theater release, I was not surprised by the film because it was surprised when it reached the DVD of the talent. <br /> <br /> Dinzel Washington directed to direct jealous other films about the same theme as the more accomplished directors that have nothing to do with the first and full production of the direction. The film has a very professional look. It shows that Mr. Washington has learned a lot on the other side of the camera. He will bring a different angle to the film. One doubt, Derek Luke is the best things film, without a fine performance. He is an actor, with no guidance, no doubt. His troubled young man is very truthful, in this time of his life, suffering and suffering, for now, suffering for a bad hand life. His anthem is in the worst time of his disappointment. <Br> Primarily very good and pain is a man's fine picture, but no one looks at the side of his character. /> <br, Antwen is sent to Dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, in a very clever, somewhat suppressed manner. Because the angw inside Antwone, this man wants to help him, miss the opportunity to open himself, but because of the restrictions placed in his office, only have three sessions and then his patient is to eliminate. <br> Things work to persuade the doctor to work with Antoine. Antwone's past details are revealed. He suffers abuse Ms. Tate, his pet mother, is cruel, to say the least in her hands. The attempt at an elderly lady's home in the home of sex abuse is a bitter taste that he had with him throughout his adult life when he spots with his shame. <br /> <br /> Anthony Cherry, who suffers love at last with him, is the patient who is ready to make him a different world through the love she and support she will give him. <br /> <br /> The main performances are a very good fact. Denzel Washington Dr. Davenport also has his own problems. He was not happy Comber. He can help Anvon, but he can not help himself or his relationship with his wife. <br /> <br /> The talent in the film is amazing. Joy Bryant makes a fine cherry. <br /> <br /> Antoine reunification to his unknown family is a bit pretty and sentimental, but of course, a good actress Novella Nelson. Finally, Fisher believes that he will be happy, and accept a piece of the film.
