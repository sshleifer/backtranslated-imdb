Although this film is the best, it will be completely removed. This film, without a doubt, should be considered a modern classic. Movies with depth (chicken flicks, you should - I blame my wife for this) and I'm sitting in the back and relaxed where the hollow is ridiculous - there are basically two types of movies I like. <br /> <br /> When the film was released, my friend turned to me for this film. Looking at me somewhat deeply, he told me, "You got to see this movie, it's just a kind of film." I was insulted, and I started watching. I know they mention a million times as Ramones, but when you see them really, I said, "Hey, it's Ramones." My friend replied, "I do not know they're the real band." <br /> <br /> This film, now for a while, must be seen for the fans of Ramones - or someone in that regard.
