If you're sad that you're not getting a movie on DVD, perhaps you're looking for 'Delirus'. How often do you laugh in retaining comedy routines? I'm still very young to see Richard Pierre in his great time, and I know that Eddie Murphy's 'Deliarius' and 'Raw' (never funny) have gained a big part in her inspiration. Now I'm older, and Murphy later saw Paroire and many comedians, and I'll find two things: Everybody from Eddie fell in love with Eddie Lovely Richard. That huge difference: Eddie's original, funny, provocative, watchful? And much more. He never saw. He is all that we need. Eddie Murphy these days are boring and old? But once he is the greatest fortress ever built by The King, and 'Delirious'. One of the most ridiculous events of all time.
