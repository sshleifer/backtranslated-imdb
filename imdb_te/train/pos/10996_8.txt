Who can see a picture, look at Lucy Liu and are not happy. That woman is amazingly beautiful & talented actress. Finding a few days now is a very complex combination. And Jeremy Northam. I heard his name plenty, but he did not really know him. My advice to Hollywood: "Use him more". <br /> Now about the film: I saw one of my burial shifts. I do not recommend anyone. It's complicated and mysterious. I can not believe I'm still seeing the end coming. I'm not for any reason I'll spoil the hole image. <br /> Now I want to vote for this film. I loved the dark mystery story, the actors did a good job and I was working with the directors (actress) in the past. This kind of thing is not a big audience, it's also very dangerous. You know what to do, I'm gonna give this work 8 cause everyone should see this. Then again, the cause of 1 point reduction is always the place of development.
