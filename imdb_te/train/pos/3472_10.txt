<br /> <br /> The film is good (though only in TV). I do not really look at the look or accents difference, so I`m really not comment on that. This performance was very memorable for me and said, "Remember me, this is a movie, this DIDN`T is really happy." I sat down and knew Harris, Quinn talking, that John and Paul were talking about this meeting. When Paul went back and forth easily, the comments and fires left by John were perfect with his character (especially in the restaurant!). Both had actors and excellent job and I was surprised to see this film. This is a bad experience for any Beatles fans. And prepare some surprises!
