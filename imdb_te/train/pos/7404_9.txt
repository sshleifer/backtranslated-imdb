Shower [Jijoo] saw the Australian premiere at the Sydney Film Festival. The program stated that - a perfect pleasure - touching away, amusing, dramatic and poignantly meaningful. I could not agree more. I hope the rest of the Festival films will come to this standard entertainment program and I think more Chinese films will be shown in Sydney in the next months.
