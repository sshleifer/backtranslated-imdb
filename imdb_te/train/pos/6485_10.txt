World War II is one of the best documentaries about world war. <br /> <br /> 24 episodes are the same as those of the war and the countries involved in it. The first part tells us how Hitler came to power and built one of the world's strongest military forces. They are on military action taken during the war, and the Holocaust is also counterfeit. One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. You should see all this. Perfection! <br /> <br /> <br /> "
