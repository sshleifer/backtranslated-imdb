This series is "something different". Sometimes the European series is less accurate than the USA, but at this point the authors have reached the right target to create a blend that works smoothly. It's all great, Edel & Stark is great: great theme, smart, witty, always well distributed lines, amazing theatrical timing has shown all the stars and beautiful shots of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It is fun to see how it works in the field of justice in the countries other than the USA and once the "experience" of dealing with the way in the old Europe way. Kudos to all cast and crew for a good comedy to watch in the upcoming years in the upcoming years. Watching the series in German is super.
