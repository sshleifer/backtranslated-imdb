Dina Durbin, Non Gray and Barbara Reed In this Universal movie, "Three Smart Girls", Dina Dubin introduces audiences in 1936. It also starred Ray Milland, Mitch Auer, Charles Winniezer, John King, Bunny Burns, and Alice Brady. It's a lovely story about two young girls. Residents of Switzerland, along with their divorced mother, are again married to their father (Vininner). Without helping him in ten years and their mother loves him, they boarded the ship with the help of a home / nanny who decided to stop marrying. "Priyas" (Barnes), with the help of her mother (Brady) with the help of a gold-digger, arranges to introduce her to a wealthy count. It was created by their father's client (King). The man he chose is a full-time drunken (ayur), but the girls mistake him for a real wealthy calculation (Milland). <br /> <br /> It is not a claire or overly sugary, with some good performances, such as Award, Milland, Burns and Brady. Young girls are beautiful and do a good job. Natural actress and pretty-trained singer focuses on young durbin. In fact, her voice as a teenager is a teenager - she has more notes, because she later puts more weight in her middle. <br /> <br /> When you see the father played by Charles Winnierer, he does not want to see his children - until he sees them - "Il Basio" and needs to know them. Barnes as golden-digger is golden, but the mother of girls appeared there, so inference is probably the younger, the more attractive woman the old man seeking his youth. <br /> <br /> Universal Durbin is here to build a big star - she has the last shot in the film. Ray Milland is still paying his dues at this time, and it is also a surprise to young and attractive film fans. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and of course, it's stardom for the sequel and big deal.
