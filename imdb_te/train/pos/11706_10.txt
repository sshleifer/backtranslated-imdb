For all the critics on this page, I have to say that this image is valuable. So it happened in 1972, so what. The film is in the same fashion at its time. People who do not study culture for decades think this movie is a cheese ball. Compared to the modern array, the 'left back,' (now made for our time), it looks cheerful. However, the only positive part of the film is fashion, which has been in the past 30 years. But. The message sent in this movie is very powerful, and carefully preserved. There was just too much to say, but I refused to tell. (It's scary to disperse) so go out and watch this movie! If you do not like the message you are sending, you are having trouble, it requires some attention!
