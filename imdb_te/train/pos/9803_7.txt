This Batman film is very good as Batman and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero's Batman cover, but it is equally good for Batman cartoons Batman Beyond the Movie. The film is good for the same reasons but the other is good but the other one is good. It's good for the cartoon effects The voice actors are Kevin Conroy / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong Barbra Gordon, Eframe Zimbiist Jr., Eli Marinetal Robin. These villains are good people like Bathroom, David Ogden Stairs, The Pequin, Hector Elizondo Bonne as Keira Sedgwick. So I'm sure you have been disappointed with the batman's Batman mystery. So rent or buy Batman's mirror for Batman. That's great. <br /> <br /> Total score: ******* Out ********* <br/> out *****
