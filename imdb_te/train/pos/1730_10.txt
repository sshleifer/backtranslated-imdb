This eternal silent gem tells the true story of a POW escape during WW II. The performances are fantastic, especially Anthony Steel. The film works at several levels: cerebral, emotional, visual and literary. The conversation is very intelligent and the rings are very truthful. In fact, an exceptional all-around authenticity puts the head and shoulders in most battles.
