<br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to create this television movie. The phrase I made with "TV" was unclear to me. Production values ​​for TV movies are much lower than professional film studios producing values. This is good because this version of "Christmas Carol" should be released in theaters. This is my personal favorite of all of the "Christmas Carol" films because each item of this product has the highest quality. Yes, the two ghosts scouted by Scout are small on screen glitches, but there is at least one missing picture. <br /> <br /> Scott Scorsje is a stellar performance, he is a pleasure to see. In fact, I would not be appreciated that I can not imagine a performance in this film. Dressing, position shooting, and mesmerizing in the background of winter. Music score is lovely and heart warming. Solid direction, flawless cinematography, and reliable scripting; We will be here what one day considered a holiday classic. It really does not go around enough to be a classic, but remembering my words, one day soon. The film became an annual Christmas tradition in my home, because it would have a real meaning behind Christmas: Love, Selflessness and giving. Selfish, greedy world, my family and I George c. We lose ourselves in Scott's "Christmas Carol".
