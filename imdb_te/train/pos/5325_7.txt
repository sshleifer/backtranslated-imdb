The purpose of the film about the Beatles is that no idea can be realized by the original historical Beatles idea. It is better not to rebuild in the past, but it is not best to create an illustration that works best in other available beetles. This 'Beatles of Birth' brings us to the usual story without any extravaganza. <br /> <br /> * Beatles-Graduates warned that some were not as accurate as they expected. The beetles can be seen showing the songs that have already been provided. The Beatles also feature "Ask Me Yi", "PSI Love You" and "Do not Bet Me". Beatles-Graduates If the Beatles in this movie only performs songs in Hamburg, young viewers may no longer recognize the beetles they have learned. In fact, "Johnny B. Goode" and Stuartliff's "Love Me Tender" will be placed in the Hamburg Rippertier. <br /> <br /> The boys playing the Beatles in this product appear to be the original, and the film is still very accurate and the film makes a good look. The guy who plays the role of Lennon is good and the rest of the band is not bad. Brian Epstein is great and the moment the moment is the most memorable scene when he captures Pete Best from the band. As a bonus you get to see the original Cavern Club in the movie.
