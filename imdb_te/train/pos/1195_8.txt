I saw this film twenty years ago. I still remember the film, especially Robert Taylor performance. Because many critics think of him as a great, almost disappointing man, Taylor thought he would bow down as an actor, because women liked to see his films only because of his films. However, the film proved to be an interesting actor. In such a long life he did not get enough roles. This is his best performance. He is truly absolutely trusted in the villain role. From what I read, he was a very hard and easy guy in real life and fought enough for these kind of characters. He basically does what MGM has given. This film proves that he can handle different and difficult characters. The other thing I remembered about this film was the role of the annoying Lloyd Nolan. Nolan was a great actor but this character really exacerbated me. The final scene of the film is with me these years. This image is definitely worth a look.
