You can do a lot of cash with little money. Blair Witch has proven. This image is supported. It is more than a sitcom in length and complexity. However, it is also delightful in a budget as it has John Cl√©si as Sherlock Holmes. The highlight of the film is Arthur Lowe, who is honest, male Watson, his thickness and clearest Cleism's quick-minded wit. If you ever read it anytime, it's a quirky laugh or two.
