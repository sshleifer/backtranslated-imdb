I love this show, it is sure that this is the winner. Jessica Alba does a great job, it's about time we have a kick-ass girl who is not kind of cutesy. The whole cast is amazing and all episopes have a good plot. Everything is well crafted and thought over. It took some time to get together, because it was not a bit contaminated. It's a great show completely.
