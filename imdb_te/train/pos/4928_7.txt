The release time, the fear in the thriller 'Streets in the 1950s' is rarely surprisingly surprising story. The corpse of the mysterious illegal immigrant was found and no public surveillance from a public health inspector found that the corpse had a curve of the bubonic plague. With the current drama of the world today, this film will help to make this movie look reliable today. The cast and crew are blameless. After Richard Widmark starred in Jack The Palace in Knight and the City in his first role, Paul Douglas starred in the film and the young (and rather beautiful) Barbara Bell Geddes. Overall slot-free, non-professional actors (the director is the typical of Kazan) fill in the remaining slots. Elia Kazan will direct, Joe Macdonald's films (he later joined Richard Widmer with 'Pick Up in South Streets' in 1953) and great Alfred Newman scores. Almost everyone involved here are doing well, though 'fear in the Streets' is very rewarding watch. Especially for film-nair enthusiasts.
