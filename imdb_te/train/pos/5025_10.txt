Man, some of you are cold. This film is artistic genius. Instead of searching for messages or searching for messages in your reality, why not understand why it's a work of fiction? A story. Entertainment, for God (not with no intention). It seems to me that many people are critics of film - and they do not do well. I am impressed by the film directed by Bill Paxston and I'm going to personally contact him personally. You know, if you're trying to analyze the heck from the possibility of the story, you can enjoy that movie. Me and all my friends!
