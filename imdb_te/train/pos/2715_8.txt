Q.E.D. It's a brilliant TV series and it's really quite a few worth a schedule for you! I suspect TIVO and recording devices would be much better than this 1981 did in this era. I'm eagerly waiting for its availability on DVD! Other television programs such as The Wild, Wild West, The Barkets and the Adventures of Briscoe County, Jr., all of these together with QED, have a very intellectual quality. However, this does not happen - the dialogue is witty and actionable. The show ran for Mastermund in the UK and it had some feel of the BBC, but it was usually in the era with better production values ​​than the BBC. <br /> <br /> When I started this nineteen year early, and there was a lot of time to make time for television in my life. However, my dear mother reminded me of Q.E.D. And we want to sit on the phone and watch together. <br /> Really, Q.E.D. A sad loss and, if it could make the same quality and values ​​today, I would love to see what made up again.
