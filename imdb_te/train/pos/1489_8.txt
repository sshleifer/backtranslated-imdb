Overall the picture is OK. <br /> <br /> I think it's better than septease and I think its story is better than gabber and its sentiment value. <br /> There are some scenarios that can cause my perspective. Yes boy (Muksin) I agree that his performance is very good. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> However, Nina Simon's 'You Me Quitte Pass' is truly "" Meenakan "my 'Bull' 'Roma' song. <br /> <br> I love the song. The song is both. "Me Me Quit Paw" and "Hujan". I have downloaded the song. <br /> And salute to Yasmin. The ending of the film will hit me again. <br /> <br /> I feel I am eligible for the International Jury Grand Prix at the Berlin Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I give 8.5 to 1o stars.
