I suck at the inappropriate boob hints, I'm just going to write a plainly flat (no pun intended) review. I love Elvira, "I'm not going on-shoot-the-present-to-impression-to-impressionist-jodi-fester-facetical" way, but I think she's rocks. The film is played only as a 50's horror film, look for "anxiously moving the ankle" to learn my purpose. Any relay shining in the movie is the absolute charm of Elvira (or Casandras). I saw this movie at the age of 8 for the first time and saw it troublesome times. I actually look a little bit less to wear a copy of the videostore version to buy a copy. <br /> <br /> Another great performance from EP McGarg (Chainid's Tour) is that she never deserves to be eligible.
