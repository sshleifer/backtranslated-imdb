The campus may seem goofy, but Murphy's character does not take seriously, makes it easy for audience access and modern-day hard-boiled child abduction. Wonderful cast, particularly Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis and Murphy, are in comedy / action with his 80-year-old peak. There are some great F / X, too surreal scenes and very original plots. Often ignored in the Pantheon of Murphy Flicks, but this is worth a look.
