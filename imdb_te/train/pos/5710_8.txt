Sensational music of Rene Clare. If you want to see where the songs are to guide the story first. This is the story of a hungry young artist who has learned to win the lottery as his creditors call him. Unfortunately his ticket was in his coat of his girlfriend's apartment and was handed over to run ooy exploitation, oh but ... it would be. <br /> It's a light and foam dialogue story (many people believe it will not happen until Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). They are a kind of film that can not make any film, and are rarely done while doing it. This is a sound from the start of days like a film after five or six years. The camera moves his camera as Busby Berkeley is also doing (Berkeley must necessarily have a staged dance number and two filmmakers unjustly comparing Clarier's camera through "real world"). Its a fantastic little picture. And its a beautiful image that makes you smile. <br /> Sorry, I can not say more. Its just a good little picture and really all you need to know.
