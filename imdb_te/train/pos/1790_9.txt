I loved this film and it's an excellent example of family accident, romantic love story and a very sad story. Everything is very accurate and wonderful about this film. It is a great blend of actors and actresses and some laughs and the film deserves to get many awards. In a beautiful scenario, though I connected the film with The Notebook and The Family Stone, it is more fraudulent, sad and clever than those pictures. This evening, a young man tells a love story of her youngest childhood and her two daughters are with her while she is not right. The back story says back strongly and I was incredible to sit on my seat edge. I really want to know all the characters and in the end, I want to see again. This is truly a kind of a kind and an amazingly sad and intuitive acting and plot to figure through how wonderful it really is. All shows are surprising and the picture captures your attention from the very beginning and will always go. I enjoyed it, and it was so happy, it was a really astonishing picture.
