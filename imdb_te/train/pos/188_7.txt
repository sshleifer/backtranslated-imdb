I'm a huge classic movie buff, but going to silent movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Davis, in particular, shows that her morphs from a little girl from a little girl is as elaborate as a starlet she takes a bit too bad. <br /> <br /> Show people are some of the biggest actors of the silent era of a fast paced movie with an amazing array of people. The film immediately caught my attention and forgot it was actually a silent film. (I realized that I did not make much sense, but it happened.) Actors are very talented in their professionalism. Some dialog cards are needed. It's a fast, interesting movie with two of the best actors of the silent era. Combine in the satire of Hollywood and show people in 'Must See' list for all classic movie fans.
