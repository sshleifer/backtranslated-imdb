I'm a Belgian and has grown in sixties. There were many US series (original language with subtitles), and Batman was the first one I was interested in. Unfortunately, Batman is "very scary" because it feels very violent. Geez, compare kids get to see the days of innocence in that series compare. So from my 60's over-protected moms I had the chance to see two or three episodes probably! I was disappointed I started collecting comics and bubblegam cards (still got to them!) To replace it. I've also got master rating slides ... I got a wish to see the deadly crusader. <br /> <br /> After years, I finally got a chance to see a run back in eighteen and I enjoyed it amazingly. I watched as a child and cheek acting in the tongue escaped me, but I understood that at the age of 17. Yes, I have now seen them and occasionally Internet posts episodes because the DVD did not release (to my knowledge). <br /> <br /> "In the evening I came back to Bat Cave ... It's very pleasurable, and jokes inside." Adam and Burt would be happy to see this wonderful movie in every TV movie. Congratulations to the people who produced this great craze "dinner" ... I'm going to see again ... all the Batman fans have my suggestion: see it! Give it to the tailor !!! BUY !!! I do not think this was never intended to estimate the rate of 9/10 ... very well done!
