I have seen this film literally 100 times more ... it's filled with entertainment! Powers Boothe will give a stellar performance. I do not always think of catching "intensity" such as actor Shitner and Lieberman as a fan of actors like William Shuttner (Implus, 1974) and Ron LeBman (Academy, 1981), Jim Jones! Most I'm worrying, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... This film captures his best performance !!!
