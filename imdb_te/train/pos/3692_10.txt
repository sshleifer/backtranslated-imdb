Two days ago I saw the film in a small independent film in Paris. It's my last evening in the French capital and the best I can afford. These twenty episodes illustrate the effects I have collected in Paris in the heart of the newspaper without drifting into a kits or sentimental Schmalmt. Each episode is filled with surprise, strong emotions and suggestive images, and each small-film is directed by good little story rules. I had this kind of film a lot more than the storytelling two-hour drama with the director and story writer's character and everyone succeeded in their work. These stories were carefully selected in the case of an arrondissement and the overall flair was perfectly expressed. Each episode has appeared from a different ankle, a different topic, a different style and still twenty stories in the harmonic orchestra of movies. Based on the fact that the most outstanding purpose with an episode film concept in my opinion is the overload, just the other way may vary between the risk and the big variety of moods: Melan of sadness, melancholy, pure pleasure, depression, anger, anxiety, curiosity or hobby Provides unique freshness and harmony. And do not forget that all love thing! Love between characters, love between characters and Paris and love directors and actors / actresses for this project. I do not like to go to episodes, but most people should highlight their range of world famous actors and actresses around the world and this scheme. Some played their roles, some were completely broken up and some were interacting with the characters that they had previously associated with their own country, so the latter was given through the film. All in all I definitely recommend this great collage and looking forward to its release on DVD.
