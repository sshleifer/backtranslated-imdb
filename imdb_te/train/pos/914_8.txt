Vivah is not classic. However, Hardcore Action, Betting Baking Special Effects & Complex Plots (none of these are Bollywood yet), it is good to see a simple picture like Vivah. We will be traveling from a couple's first meeting to their last wedding after some moments and test moments where some of the story is familiar. Nothing, nothing less. Much of the music is not in the same league as MPK or Hahk but neither does your jar jar. I have two songs - Muje Hak Hai & Dun Anzane. Milan Ahi Aad and Hamari Shahi Hamid. Shahid performs honestly & demonstrates a lot of probability. He's good, but he's usually "cool dude". Amrita plays the role of a small-town girl who is very sweet and thorough. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas have excellent support and the rest of the cast makes reasonable work. Suraj is direct but easy to direct. The main flaw of the film is slow, which can test many young audience's tolerance. But all in a good, clean, good family film.
