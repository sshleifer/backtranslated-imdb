This is the 53rd film I've seen as Idi Lupino Director. I think this is a good image then one. This is a girl who is going to marry and she has been sexually assaulted and everyone is talking about her and not talking about her, so she flees and is taken by a family. I think Leonard Maltin's review is just 2 and 1/2 stars.
