It is not surprising that it is a good movie, if you come from the same director who has completed "Candyman" and "Dear Immortal". Ironically, "Piperheras" I have never heard of it yet, and should be one of the best movies of the late 80s - this is in the hands of worst films in recent decades. (Not talking here about Iranian or Swedish "cinema"), but it's just great - here's what some people say (they're "fantastic acting", like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that neatly ends with a brilliant way of connecting all the loose ends together. These unanswered questions will probably leave consciously, leaving it to the interpretation of the person and there is nothing wrong with this theme. "Pepperhas" is an efficient use of the film and some of the horror's extraordinary compound, sounds and music. I'm not your typical movie clich√© ultra-shy-but-mysterious-clever social-banned girl in the central character, but a simple, simple kid; Very refreshing. I am sick and tired of writers who describe their childhoods as their illnesses and their screens, and if anyone watches or reads, nobody cares or reads, if the character has a good potential in the background. The "intimate" (for most storytelling) scene with Anna and the boy is a bit of both in ambiguous discomfort and amusing - has the most inspired feelings - she was just 11, but it was shot in 13 or 14 Burke. I do not know why they did not upgrade the age of the character or get a young actress. It is clear that Burke is not the youngest. Why do the directors always star older than they are playing, so dull reality, I never know.
