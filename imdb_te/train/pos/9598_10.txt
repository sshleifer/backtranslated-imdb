I've tracked the tour two years ago on the Internet - I just saw the movie !! No ride! And finally a trip to get to know Darius Weims! Such courage, intelligent, funny and talented spirit! And a crew! In the eyes of a crocodile in Darius laughing in the city of Paramita, he is awesome in his eyes, a few rapids, the excitement of rafting, wassabi a spoonful to eat, and the phone call home, and always - boys will be boys . Let's see this movie - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. And Crew members are evidence of the younger generation. They got a new wheelchair for Darius; They have entered into access issues; They took Darius on his life tour; They touched many lives. By raising awareness about DMD and promoting funding for research, this film will help Darius Goes to achieve West's final goal - a cure for the DMD.
