UK newspaper reviews focus on realities, and reviewers Toby Young learn when the journalist is based on these real-life experiences. The key word here is "dependent". <br /> <br /> Sydney Young joins the prestigious mess magazine in New York, where he finally tries to gap it after Gaffe before it becomes Right Wright and Making It. It is selling him, and there are some serious points to portray the journalistic integrity. However, they are not exaggerated: the main ingredient remains a centralized comedy around Sydney's abuses. The script is a stupid, well-meaning buffoon at the same time that the author has a cake and that's a smart, moderately bad skill author that eats it in Sydney. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges maintains Sydney editor very efficiently, and Kirsten Dunst is controversially anonymous because the conflict is never a complication because Simon Peg (like Sydney) Miss Fox, and I leave my wife, Selling goods, selling my goods, and buying a hand. In the case of Mag Fox, I can only say this. Take your plane ticket to stay with you. In fact, I'm a 56-year-old English accountant with fat, and you can not be so lukewarm, but it is in the table anyway. If her career is so short, it may be thought that Megan Fox is definitely a bit less, it certainly feels like actress: but she's some kind of expertise and very sexy. <br /> <br /> Miriam Margolis and Bill Pietersen from the UK, supported by a variety of veterans from Guillia Anderson and Danny Huston from the United States. <Br /> There are many laugh-loud moments, and I smile through the way too much. As always, F-dialogues make it look as though it is not really necessary, at least one of these is very funny.
