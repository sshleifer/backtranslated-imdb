Nathaniel Hawthorne used to say that his failures were more interesting than his achievements. I believe that the same comment is in line with McDonald-Eddy's films. And most importantly this one. <br /> It clearly has many features of a failed film: It sounds kitsch, scripted, staggering due to censorship ?? However, the film also earned some good points: good Rodgers-Hart music ("I've married a goddess", "Tira Tira Tira la"), EE. Good acting with Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> If you do not like it, you can not forget it. This strange film actually leaves a very strong, dreamlike, seal, and you remember for a few days, perhaps it's days. Why? In the thirties and early 40s, the motion pictures are no longer the same: such as a dream, meant to divert people into forgetful reality. <br /> <br /> All the dream-movies in this film, especially the stronger it is. <br /> <br /> This is a good way to congratulate the film, it may be good or bad. To see it, you see a dream.
