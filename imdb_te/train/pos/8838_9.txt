Finally what will happen is that the audience did not expect the end. Well, we are dirty to destroy the lives of all kinds of brothers, Andy (played by Hofmann) and Hank (played by Hawk), wherever it goes, but how or when we do not know until the end of the film. Huffman is as good as ever and Hawk is good as a young man, mainly because he can not really think of himself. Hawk might have been slightly away from his element, but he played a very good role. Andy's wife cheated by Hanke by Murcy Tommy into the compound; Andy's abducting company funds to pay for his drug and sexual addictions; And eventually a father who explains exactly what happened during the day of robbery. This movie will keep you thinking.
