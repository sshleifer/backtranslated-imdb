The sudden impact of Eastwood's artistic failure at one of his career is considered to be a good reputation as director. This is not the film itself, but the attitude that leads to the supportive alertness. Some places are more indebted to Death Wish than the original Dirty Harry film. If it was argued - at the end it was a film about guilt, justice and vengeance. For me, at the end of the day it is more sympathetic than sympathy. However, in view of these claims, the sudden impact is not considered to be a wonderfully made film. Forget "forward punk, make my day scene", that iconic but not original. But look at the San Fransisco view taken from the air, zoomed from the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are great. Or look at the brilliant scene that visits her mentally unhealthy sister at Sonda Locke's hospital. Eastwood faces the face. So all of the sudden impact of all of the sudden all shows a mature image of Eastwood. And correctly I remember that Eastwood was first put on screen even though it was an action movie in the debate theory. The film is also the first film directed by Eastwood. Although Eastwood has a great deal of talent as a director, dramatization has always been a weak point (play for me, Misty, Breeze etc.) The plot of the narrative leads to well-integrated visual elements in the film and does not attract attention from the story. The farting dog is the only thing to be bored.
