See going seven pounds and I'm not sure what the picture is because I see the movie really leaves it too open to grasp about it. So in the first 20 minutes or you totally lose the plot, do not know what is going on and you think Ben is a big ass, just say Tim. "Twist" to talk, this is the end of the movie when it's opened in the last minute. Mainly, Tim (Smith) suffers and ends with the big risk of ending eight people's lives. <br /> <br /> In this film he will have to help seven new people. The episode seems to impress him. Rosario Dawson, for me, this is one of her better movies, aside from the eagle eye which I think up. Some are a bit bad, but she is in the film. Other actors such as Timber Harrelson play a very large role and play a role. Although the casting of the film is still fine <br /> <br /> This film is not exactly what I expected, it's definitely slow. But this film is still very good. Nothing is known until the last 5 minutes of the film. Until then it seems like a pointless love story. The final seven lbs = seven stars thought.
