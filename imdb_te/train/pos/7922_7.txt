In these horror films, the cold war mental disorder of the 50s, Reagan-era American and High School films Adam Orkin plays the quarterback Star Tony of Full Moon High in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) went to Communist Romania and wounded the wolf as one night lost in the streets. When he returns to the state, he can not control his clerical stimuli and goes to the murder spree. Bored, he flees out of town. Decades later, he returns to the town of immortalized Toni and re-registering in high school. He can not control his transitions yet, and towns and friends know that he is not very human. This will end in all schools' big football game. <br /> <br /> In the early 80s, I thought it was good because it was good. But I was surprised that the film was actually legally funny. Denny Kelly, Bus Driver Dend Wilson, and Alan Arkin as Kenneth Mars, a peer coach with Togg's fierce former flame, will go to all, with delightful results. When I saw the film, I was staring at how this writing and humor were to the 'Family Guy'. 'Purne Moon Hai' went to the same position and did not take herself seriously.
