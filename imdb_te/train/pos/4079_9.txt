When I was 8 years old in the UK I saw this movie (here is called "Lapta: The Flying Island"). I absolutely love it, and when I'm repeating it for a while and then I've lost it. I enchanted through story and characters, but with many haunting and beautiful music. Sometimes I was mistakenly referred to as "streamline dub" (Dub actually delivered by Ghibli himself and simply Streamline) - which was the original English dubbing version I saw which was sadly unlikely except part of the ridiculously expensive laser disc. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this release I feel Disney has partially gone. Voice acting is the same but the dialogue does not have the "raw" dub or the same raw power as the original Japanese, and I think that James van der Beck is too old to play the lead role. They made some meaningless changes, such as changing the main character's name from "Pajoju" to "Pajoju", adding some conversations. But most of all I think that they have ruined several scenes with improper music - for example, the initial sequence of AirShips was originally silent, but thanks to the melodic inspiration of Disney's melodrama, I do not speak when nobody speaks. <br /> <br /> The film is still used for recent animated films Breaks away, and I'm very well Can not be resorted. The plot is simpler and more attractive and the film shows a flare missing from the modern mass-market, homogeneous animation.
