When I see this film for the first time, it's a recorded copy and title / cage terror. I still own the tape, and I agree, I've watched it more than once since starting it! The film is very low budget and the conversation is often unexpectedly fun! I've gotten some of my friends to see this and we've had some great laughs from the terrible script. A week in the film, (which was in the early 70s since they were a very hip man!) I'm going to camping for a weekend weekend. They bemoans some happy conversation and fish death after eating a fish and eating and that they ate! The guy Goofy come back to somehow how they ate the fish and is now part of them, and he goes; "That cute guy!" Heavy man, really heavy! LOL! In any case, I believe in one of those who play the role of the flute, along with Vietnam. (Anyone they are musical people!) When the guys clearly attract the girl and prove that the couple are not friends, they end up terrified at night. The guy ends caged in a chicken coop, and his girl friend has to watch two boys ravished. Actually, at the end of the night, she is beautiful, and when it comes to the morning, the guys are free to leave and leave the girl and guy. The devil learned a lesson about how to treat the person, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a deadly smile! It always makes me happy! If I find this on DVD and replace my old tape copy, I really like to buy it again, which is the classic camp! You love this stuff!
