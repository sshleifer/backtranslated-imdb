Many Italian horror lovers hates the film because there is no connection between the first two Demons movies. And with the "Demons III" in the title, one can imagine it. The problem is that this film is never intended to be part of the Demons series. Distributors are only "Demons III", originally titled "The Ogre" to gain popularity in other films. The new American DVD release of the film is titled "Demons III: The Ogre" in the Box Art, but the film is also "The Ogre". I do not know if previous releases have the title "Demons III" in the original film, but this new release is just a little white lie. If you can get past "Demons III" in the title, you may have some pleasure in "Ogre". It begins with a creep intro, and is pretty creep throughout. No gore and movie movies are slow, but I still dug it. It should not be like other Demons movies. I gave "The Ogre" 7 to 10 Italian fans should try it out.
