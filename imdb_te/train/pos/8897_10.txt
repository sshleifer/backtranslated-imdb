My sister and my sister had rented this movie because we did not demand much to worry about and worse. <br /> <br /> The film exceeds very low expectations. <br /> It's not just a century to represent. It contains the true depictions of the characters in it, and many actors perform amazing work. Different stories are combined with real footage to shoot from a very special touch. <br /> <br /> I would like to give an endless amount of appreciation to Julia Styles in the role of Carrie. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone.
