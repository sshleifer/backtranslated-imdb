This animated film is a masterpiece! Storytelling, music, animation and storytelling all wonders. My girlfriend and I saw again the second time and got more insight from it. We invited a couple friends to see the soul with us and they really enjoyed it. When I came to see them, I saw them as a movie about horses, but later learned that it was more than that. I liked Esperanza, Spirit, Rain, and Lil Creek, and reminiscent of Nathan Chasing Horse, who was smile a lot in dance with laughter. <br /> <br /> I saw the Spirit for the third time and wanted to see again. I enjoyed the miracle of "Spirit" because the American Indians's portrayal was realistic and unlike the film "The Road to El Dorado", which portrayed Indians in the worst and stereotypical way. But DreamWorks Spirit passed through a great image and I found it acceptable! <br /> <br /> I hope they will continue to keep animated films like Spirit, and the Americans want to look at the sequels or spinflies of the soul, even if not as polite as the Indians. Open mind go and see the soul: Stalian of Cimarron.
