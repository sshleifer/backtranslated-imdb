I come from a completely different background to pinjar than many reviewers who posted here. I am relatively new to Bollywood films and have grown up in America. So there is no widespread evidence to compare the pinjar to other Indian films. <br /> <br /> Pinzar is less than a masterpiece in its own work. <br /> <br /> In a line I pinzar is the most important films ever come out of any studio anytime. In the Mass-Appeal Scale, it is an Indian equivalent of the * "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" that has been promoted in the US. It may well be a Bollywood movie to be an American map. American cinema public people have long had a romantic affair with "Gone With The Wind", and some passport similarities with Pinzar not taking credit from that theme. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the grim background of the Indo-Pakistani Partition in 1947-48, a coercive human drama for the young man was captured in her circumstances and she had no difficulties. <br /> <br /> If you do not have a story, it is exquisite. Paras (the protagonist) is better to develop as a figure - for Western audiences who do not know Indian culture - if her character's "back story" is fully developed in the early part of the film. But it is extended to 3 1/2 hours per hour or perhaps more. One minute of the film is not wasted, and what's done without compilation has not really been cut for a long time. <br /> <br /> I have used many words to describe pinzar: "sharp", "disturbing", "compelling", "heart wrenching" immediately came to mind. But "stimulating" is probably any of them. There is no need to consider any story about the inequality of the human soul against inequality. And the success of Prio - maybe she is not immediately clear to those around her - less than inspiration. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie much for the strength of story power. <br /> <br /> This is to play Urmila Matondkar Porro. There is little scarcity between youth and new actresses Beavy, and Urmila has the unique capability to play a full confidence role in any role she plays. She does not just play a role in the movie, she breathes life in her role. Manoj Bajpai's choice of Rasheed inspired. Many Indian film makers can do: miniature. His concept of expression and nuance is essential to the character. <br /> <br /> If you see only one Bollywood film in your life, make it Sujar.
