As a child I loved nine or ten people. It is all round Bollywood action / comedy film. This is definitely a Bad Boys simulator! The whole swapping identities but the arrival of two other twins window throws out everything and arrives in the colorful villains who dance and sing! The action scenes in this film are not revolutionary but amazing scenes. This film is a lot of fun and great re-need Amitabh Bachchan. Govinda is always a gem, which is his best work, the best comedy scenes in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The songs ... funny and impressive .............. laughs when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachchan is surprisingly very funny and you 'bad mia <br /> <br /> "Nazr Dahl is the best song .........."
