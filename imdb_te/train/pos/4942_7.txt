I have to admit that I missed the first half hour or so of the film. There is also some slight amusing humor, but for the best time I have been wasting my time and the difficulties in the margins that cause my impression, then - for obvious reason - I suddenly realized that I was enjoying this. I have no eyes on me and no sudden dramatic scenes. In fact the whole movie is very enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman jumped his career as a "small project" starring an untitled actor. He is going to play a supermarket manager and spend a day in a neighboring supermarket to investigate the role. Where he meets and bonds with Scarlett (played by Pazzage) - a cashier who wants more from life. She helps her to prepare for a job interview as she is auditioning for a character, when she introduces him in real life. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega are a mixed romance but the father-in-law chemistry is unbelievable sort of a whimsical, completely together, great "as" (that character credits are identified). If you think you will miss early, stick with it. Finally, it becomes a delightful beautiful image. 7/10
