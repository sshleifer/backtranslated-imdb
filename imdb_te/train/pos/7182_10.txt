I thought I did well for the first episode of the first series. It was really fun and I thought the actors were brilliant. I think it's a crime to say that it's bad because I felt the right time. I find it really annoying when people say it's not historically correct because I'm supposed not to have a Saturday night entertainment show boring history documentary and I have the right clothes and settings. A brilliant start and I'm going to love what's coming next !! I talk to many people in my school and they love the show! We all feel fantastic and have great stories to go with it.
