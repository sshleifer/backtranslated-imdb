The film has amazing features! Reese Witherspoon's debut performance was excellent, but Jason had her chemistry with London. The score is awesome, windy and pure. James Newton Howard improves the quality of any film he has composed for ten times. He has a talent for young people in the days of his loss, and be sure to hold his score for the song "Gothic Panic" recently "Peter Pan" and "The Village". I first saw the film at 13 or 14 and now I do not cry at the end, I have two tears for nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughters. This will become a life-long comfort film.
