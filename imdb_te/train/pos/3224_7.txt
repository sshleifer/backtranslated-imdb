Good cinematic-film cowboy stuff: I've seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to act in these two limits: You do not have any conversation, and you're playing a tight, military robot is not allowed to show emotions using your face-to-face! Howzat? Kinta is a bigger era of aria and is asking for a diva during a duck-tape. Despite the verbal and emotional slogans, Russell pulls out a wonderful role. Despite his barriers his robot becomes human. <br /> <br /> As always, Jason Icons has played a great role in the villain villain in history - assuring you to like the draw and the quarter. Connie Nielsen is sweet, soft, mother, and beautiful. I do not know how good my feel is based on her acting and her physical beauty, but her eyes are very difficult to pick up. Unfortunately, Gary Bussey's role is too small and limited. <br /> <br /> Many plots are very authentic and have a fair amount of weaknesses, but since it contains the science fiction comic book, I can not see what is wrong with some weaknesses. The good guy wins by the end of the story, and the appreciative crowd get a great deal of emotional satisfaction. <br /> <br /> The whole point of Phoebe's sort of fate that Russell does not perform is a good job.
