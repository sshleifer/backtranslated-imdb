Clean Family Oriented Movie. I laughed, I cried ... I liked it. I was worried not to see anything from the office but Steve Carl as Goofy Michael. Boy, I'm wrong. He must win an Oscar for his performance. I'll definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out. My husband enjoyed it and he was not in these "type" films. I saw it in 2 other couples within the 30 years range and we all agreed that it's the best picture we've seen in a very long time and absolutely the cleanest. Just 1 Word Word! This is not even known as PG13. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, drama, romance and more!
