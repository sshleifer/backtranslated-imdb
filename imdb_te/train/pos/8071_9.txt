The film deals with the life of a person, especially after the Irish rebellion of the 1920s and the bounty of his head and the aftermath of giving a friend to the next consequences. Looking at the movie, you have to take the script and with some minor updates, you have to do it again and it's enough for sin, contemporary events. But the tea remake is not nearly as good. Victor McLaughlin (who qualified for the Oscar) and made the best of the ensemble cast, although not all actors with Brags in the Hollywood period, most notable character actors or just beginning. Very good movie is worth looking at well. Highly recommended.
