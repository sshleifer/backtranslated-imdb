I love bad movies. Not only because they are really entertaining, such as 'good' films (such as Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood Patos), but they are often better than those films. And the reason why I love the Italian tear off the cinema of the 1970s and 1980s. <br /> <br /> Some of the best films, such as director Rugerto Diadoato House of the Edge of the Park, and his Atlantis interceptors live like a cop, dye like a man, are a fun action films. But it's very bad. Barbarians so idiot film. Peter and David Paul, such as the Barbarian Brothers Kutchech and Gore, were very attractive because they did not have their charm and acting skills. But if they do not work, they're doing something important. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad special effects, very stupid story, bad direction, actually nothing bad in everything in this film. I can not explain how much I laughed when I saw this first time. The Barbarians & amp; Company camp classic everybody should see once. If you think the Outer Space fun camp from Plan 9, this is a real killer.
