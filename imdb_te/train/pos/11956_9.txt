I also said a few shades of Hitchcock ... it's better than MMM, although it's not some of the Woody fans but some are flawless. By the way, do you know that Annie Hall was the first assassin secret? However, Woody has recovered some of the comedy with the film. The plot turns are good and strong. I can say that in the first 20 minutes or so some actors were a little too late to give their lines. Scarlett Johansson makes Diane well-cast in the Keaton-type character, and at what time there are uncomfortable movements between her and old Woody. No one can imagine a more perfect actor for Peter Lemon's role than Jackman.
