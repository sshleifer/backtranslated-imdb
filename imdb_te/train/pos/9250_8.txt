Clark Gable plays a can-man who captures the hard-boiled Dame Jean Harlow's life. She tries to breathe her while she is brushing herself with her strictly-damaged perspective. Despite their hatred and cons, they fell in love. When Geppe kills a man, he leaves a loyal Harlow to the women's prison when he dies, where she becomes pregnant. Anita Lewis and Howard Emmett Rogers is striking across many of the most striking and surprising characters (a Jewish socialist female prisoner and a black women's mate and her predecessor's father do not have the trace of stereotype). Gabbley and Harlow's characters display their meltdown, featuring microbes and quirks for the characters that are beyond the special gabble and harlot characters. And the direction is much better than you'd expect from Sam Wood. After joining a pretty shotgun jail, she was later surprised by the snow on the camera tracks. It is the best of both in "love criminals" and "women's jail" genres and has some of the best hard-boiled conversations ever written.
