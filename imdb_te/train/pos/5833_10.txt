I can not believe that people are looking for the plot. It's laural and hardy. Already easy. These two riots. 70 years ago their comic intellect was funny today. The mouth was not a filthy word and they were able to keep the audience in stitches. Their humor is not sophisticated by any narrative. If a purple cushion can not make you laugh, there is no reason to see what this guy did. It's a simple time, and people laughed at stuff that was funny without a plot. I guess I'm taking a simple mind to enjoy this subject, so I'm qualified. Two man does not compete with humorous teams, we are very sophisticated ... are not we lucky?
