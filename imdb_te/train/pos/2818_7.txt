"Dragongirl" Chan returns from the "The Young Master" to the "Dragon" role. But did not bring much from the first film. His eldest brother "Tiger" did not appear anywhere; Marshall, his daughter or his son, was originally cast by Yuen Biao in the original film. But the dragon had the same master - perhaps other students rushed on other things. <br /> <br /> The film entitles the film "Young Master in Love" to watch the dragon (the first sixty minutes) to be chased. A villager girl with different idiotic and slapstick paths. His friend with his long-time Chan Stunt-Team member Mars, his rival, was his friend (inappropriate "Cowboy"). We see different scenes with their silly schemes backfire. <br /> <br /> The film is notorious for failing expectations at the box office. I'm sure those predictions are beautiful, and I feel that the film never has a fair judgment based on its own profits. But I still feel that there is a problem in the movie when I try to do it. It's very unlikely, sometimes going back, and I think it's very rare and unlike Chan's other work. <br /> <br /> The ultimate scene that really captures the movie. In "The Young Master", there is a fantastic final reel, a completely exhausting action - you really enjoy each blow. And again, Chan goes against the same opponent from "The Young Master" (which is the same role?), And time and energy is amazing here. Chan style that uses every last bit of his last atmosphere to help defeat his opponent - relying on pure physical ability - is nowhere close. They are fighting barn brilliant little prop gas and improvements. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to see the prequel before seeing "DragonLord", in fact, it can raise more questions than it has yet to expect. Answer. But the original film is a top film, and "dragongard", which focuses on girls chasing and team-sports, which seems to be blocking. Luckily, it offers some fighting scenes (plus a spectacular shuttle-cock scene) push on the line as a must-see image in this genre.
