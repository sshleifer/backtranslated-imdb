Dramatic license - Some hates it, but it is necessary to repeat any life story. <br /> <br /> In the case of "Lucy", teenage years of Lucille Ball, early life and 20-year marriage were included to Desi Arnaz, but were cut and recreated. <br /> <br /> The main emotional points are obvious in the life of Lucy: recognizing her as Nick as an actress in the battle of Lucille, and eventually the character Lucie Ricardo became a legendary comedian; Deshnagi is a tired, romantic and ultimately impossible marriage; Lucy & Desi created the first televised empire, making it the TV's most memorable sitcom pair ever since. <br /> <br /> Like Lucy Ball, Rachel York does a laudable job. Do not expect to see a marvelous transformation like Judy Davis when Judi Garland plays, but makes York City more lively and more fun in his own right. Although her humor-time is different than Lucy, she is still believable. Very detailed about her thorough behavior on the set of the film and her love of Vivian Vance at the beginning of "I Love Lassy", but it is nice to be a Yard character portraying Lucy secretly rehearsing. <br /> <br /> Daniel Pino is less thin and less attractive than real country, but he has his own charm and most importantly in the opening sequence, <br /> <br /> Vivian Vance and William Froely are not very grateful to most of the Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman roles. . They are not good actors in their own right, they are not suitable for people playing. Many actors come from Austria and New Zealand and the repressive notes are notable. <br /> <br /> Although the main structure of the film's production is committed to historical fact, there are many differences. Jess Oppenheimer, the lead author of Lucy's radio program "My Favorite Husband", which opened in 1951, featured in the film scene to help with "I Love Lucky" in 1951, the creator! The film deals with Mark Daniels as the lead character of "I Love Lucy", which completely abandoned William Asher in the first season! Moreover, I have found that this is due to budget hurdles, as they were shown to live in the same apartment for Richard's New York residence, in fact they changed apartments in 1953. The kitchen set is a little bigger and off-scaled original as well. The Connecticut home is very close to the original area, excluding the right and left sides of the house, reorganized. <br /> <br /> Even though the RKO did not hit the market in 1957, the country was also talking about buying RKO during Lucy's red-shocking incident in 1957. These changes were for a dramatic license, not only to inform the main facts, but also to disturb two important figures in the history of "I Love Lucy" to give them a bit more respect to Oppenheimer and Asher? The biggest donkey "I Love Lucy" in entertainment scenes, at least some of them come. It's always captured in the film and it's dangerous to see billions of people looking at, but making more changes. The scene with the giant bread loaf was cut, and everyone immediately knew the episode with the difference! "We have a baby," the number is also reduced, but it is practically more than dead. With Rachel York emphasizing the habits of Lucy really, the "Grape-Stops" scenario is the best. The producers made a wise decision not to try to recreate the bits of "Vitaminatagami" and the candy factory, instead the actors showed them as rehearsers. <br /> <br /> The main flaw in the film is the reason that many people know about Lucy's life. Overall, this gives a good portrait of Lucie & Desi's marriage, and does not ignore real errors while working effectively.
