Thanks to Kevin Smith, some of the geeks say that Radio Radio is not good because it's good to see. And Oh! Muppets participate! It makes it bad! Everybody liked the Jedi Returns until someone commented on Kevin Smith's comment. If you recognize the number of people you like, then sudden people will see you as a kind of disease. The film is better than ever Kevin Smith, and I think it's my mind that he has dismissed the man. This picture is good! It's awesome because I'm six years old! Stop stolen Kevin Smith's opinions and enjoy this movie! <br /> The end of Ewok's song! I bet you do not even enjoy people "Ewoks: The Battle for Endor" !!!! I've burned you all!
