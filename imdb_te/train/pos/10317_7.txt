Do you know how Star Trek fans are all star trek movies really bad? Why? Once again see their leaders. I think about Dock Savage. I am a great hub for this role, and the opportunity to watch the dock and his staff in an adventure is overwhelming. And the only 20 minutes of the film's assumption is the notion of anxiety. Then they remove the roots from many stunts and decided to throw them in a film, resulting in a somber turmoil. There are many promises here, drawn through many unfortunate options (music, "camp" elements, etc.) but the spirit of the dock is there and we know that document and his team. So, in my long winded way, what I'm trying to say is not a bad image of this: it's just not good to stay. Who is the fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Baker Bunzai, and many others? Let's look at the film to be familiar with the leader who inspired them.
