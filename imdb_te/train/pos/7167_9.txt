I could not comment after reading a very small "bad" commentary. This film is better than just bad. Acting is beautiful, from the kids in the cast, is neither beautiful nor anything else but works like my son's friends. The film is great and it expects the audience to remain the same. Double-back flash plot lines are speculative and do not work as a complementary task. I saw this movie with my kids and I saw them again a few days later. If you have children and their syrupy sweetness inspires a diabetic coma, if the death of the films die, then check "holes." My 6 year olds enjoyed 11 years, and my husband and I enjoyed both enjoyment. How many movies about it?
