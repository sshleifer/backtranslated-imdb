<br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent were sent to the Silsby in the world's deep oil well. While there, some radioactive mole men come through the oil well and explore the town. Jeff Corey and many other towns try to dispose of the mole men occupying. Superman can change people's ways to protect the moles? <br /> <br /> In my opinion Superman and Mole Men are a brilliant, well written and well-documented film. We'll look at Superman briefly, but it still does a great Superman adventure. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars
