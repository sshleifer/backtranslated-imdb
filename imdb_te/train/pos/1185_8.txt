Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger have changed to the good-body characters they have put in "all the brothers valiant". Taylor appears to be a bit uncomfortable in his bad-guy character, but Granger plays his role. But the true hero in the story is the forest and the northwest. The film is perfectly designed, given the atmosphere of times wonderfully. Directing is very good and the film is not light entertainment, it is a big picture and ignorantly ignored by ignorance.
