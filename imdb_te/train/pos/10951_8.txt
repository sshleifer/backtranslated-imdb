I do not have to play with Big S tabs or weaken a agenda, say mensia or chapel (I like both). She clearly stated in mysterious, enthusiastic comments. Her program does not change the world, nor does it mean. But, along with the happiest Brian Possan and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of "Mr. Show" fame, it is an average show with an appetite for destruction! My side was completely destroyed by the first episode. Look, I love this woman and her beloved boyfriend is Jimmy Kimmel, she just sends the lines and runs the viewer. The best comedy around. In spite of any kind of spoofing like "Mary Papins" in the second half when singing fake birds on fake birds in existential nonsense in society and college. This one is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and do not lose their recent lipo-suction therapy or boob job).
