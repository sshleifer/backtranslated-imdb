Sidwalk Ends World Lara is the best film directed by Otto Primingsar. And this time, he got the same co-stars: Dana Andrews and GENE TIERNEY. <br /> <br /> Most of the supporting role of Thurna is when the spotlight goes to Andrews. <br /> <br /> He tries to kill a man in the process of arresting him until a hard night, which he used to deal with thugs. When a suspect falls on a cab driver (TOM TULLY), he goes along with the murder trial, but he feels guilty because he is in love with the cabbie's daughter (GENE TIERNEY). Tauren, the girl she's going to look like, is very fashionable and does not seem to fit the damaged background elements of the story. <br /> <br /> The story goes horribly wrong with the story and goes deeply into the murder of a hero who has a silver plate on his head as a hero in his battle. Ultimately, Andrews becomes a moral character by developing a conscience on his crime. <br /> <br /> It is attractive from a strong supporting actress with good acting. Nair's good entry, starring Primer, was well-directed by Andrews and Tinee, though she was a bit misinterpreted.
