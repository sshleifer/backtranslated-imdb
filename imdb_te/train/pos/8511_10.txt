The film returns the word "spring breakroom". Hans, one of the group fat, shows these talents Chris Farley's talent. Johnny Kansas, "The King of the $ 1 Bargain", shows that he has consistently maintained stocks in Kansas. Kyle's laughter is really enjoyable, and offers a little eye candy for ladies (like Matt). Dwarfs, with their moments, did not do justice to Mexican hot dances, it is desirable. Finally, our hero, Ed. He wants us to be hopeful, men, majestic and luminous folk. And that's the hope, that's a small place called San Lucas. Even if these blockbuster theaters are lost, it should be rented because we have to deal with each other in these spring breakmurines.
