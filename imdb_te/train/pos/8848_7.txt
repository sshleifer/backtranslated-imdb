I have seen this movie in a very strange way - I've put it in my Netflix list and why I can not remember (I know in Philip Seymour Hoffman). <br /> <br /> When my wife looked at me, I returned to her in 45 minutes and said, "You know, I decided to hate this movie, but I did not want to see something about it. Half-dozen scenes are really electrifying at the performance of the actors. </ P> <br /> It is finally a Sydney louboutin picture. And I thought - Wow. I'm really surprised that Lumet really took what's a dirty, really short story about pointless, broken people. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is very good in this movie. Scary looks good. <br /> <br /> I also recommend specializing in talking to Lootet, Hawk and Huffman about making this film. And education has the interest of the student to learn at the feet of the hawk master. <br /> <br /> Continuously kissing their donkeys teaches the first rule that works with water, determined by water. And there is an element in this picture - when the actors leave the air with the emotion's sulfurus blasts, and the smoke has nothing left. <br /> <br /> But Lettette gave us the network and twelve Angry Men - each of their own ways reached the highest level of the film. <br /> This film is not at that level. But there is something about it lingerie. <br /> <br /> My last comment is about comments - if you see the number of comments about this small image in IMDb - comments, pro and depth and intelligence con - a good suggestion that something is going to happen with this image.
