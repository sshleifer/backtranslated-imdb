Last night I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival playing Midnight Madness. To be honest, I shared a name with the Radiohead song because I bought tickets for my movie, so I did not really choose: - It sounds like The Silence of the Lambs, but it became a semi-gore film. Some people already say no characters, and this is exactly the right one. Potente's character I really could not care less when she got ripped through her twins creep. The Potenette character gets her desserts and I will make homeless for the homeless. Christopher Smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film. Nevertheless, the story is very weak, but again the whole point of the film is afraid of getting out of you and it has been very effective. The Kirtla score was topped by the Bristol team. <br /> <br /> The director is really good chap and entertaining in a very Q & A session. <br /> <br /> This kind of genre is perfect for fans, but I would recommend it to try any of the fans. It's a fun ride.
