This is clearly Prototype of Mick Dundee but 'The Adventure of Barry McKenzie Fannier. I was delighted everywhere and laughed loudly at times. An outstanding centerpiece by Barry Crocker in the lead role, an Australian who unleashes poms in England in his unrestricted rare ways. Barry is often confronted with brutal observations on some of his Britishers. Relations between the two countries are prickly but not friendly and highlighted by the last line of the film, when the plane saves a little reluctantly McKenzie when boarding the house. "I started to like poms."
