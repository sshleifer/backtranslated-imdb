This was one of my favorite Govinda films in 1994, David Dhawan makes a great job of directing the film, he's funny and family drama. Govinda Raja Babu is good and gives great performance. Karisma Kapoor is an actress who I hate, the film is a little bit worse but still angry at some scenes. Kadar Khan was a performer and an excellent performer in acting. Arona Irani is a wonderful and wonderful performance. Shakti Kapoor is as good as Bhujanjindham. The film is entertaining in comedy, action, family drama and romance.
