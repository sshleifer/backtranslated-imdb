This film was supported by me from the comedy film and audience members I have seen over the years. Laughter is sudden and intense since my Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002). Last year, it was easy to find out in the name of Mr. and Ms. Smith (2005) (spying on Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sexually abusing my super-girlfriend). The director of comedy and drama Ivan Reidman is balanced, crazy and clear ridiculous. Shock and dramatic intense wedge never rule comedy. At the same time, the imaginative romantic comedy will not lose its touched emotions, even though it's broadcast. In some ways, it is good to see how it works. As in real life, sometimes the truth is very clear. Eight ten stars came with Totssey (1982). Perhaps a nine (depending on how it looks in the second view).
