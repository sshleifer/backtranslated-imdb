I have been disappointed when I recently saw this movie on VHS for many years. Every time I watch it gets better. Peter Ustinov co-authored the stars and the original screenplay (nominated for an Academy Award). Other stars you heard were Carl Malden, Bob Newhart and Caesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant / embezzler, just released from the infamous Wormwood Scrubs jail in England (he was stolen from the Conservative Party headquarters because of a Liberal). He will soon begin searching for a new owner, whom he finds himself abducted, and that computers are the future wave. He entered social networks into the London Men's Club and learned the recognition of the best computer experts in town, stole the identity of a Caesar Smith on the left in South America. . He is an American conglomerate named Ta-Ken-Co, headed by Cornton Clement (Carl Malden). Clemper hires Smith and shows him around the computer center, most notably its dynamic blue light security feature. Ustinov asks the computer how to defeat his security and the computer obligingly tells him, "disconnected the blue light." Using the hacking techniques in the future for 30 years, Ustinov breaks into the system and generates computers to create inspection checks for many fake companies. Clementper's assistant Willard G. Natpol (Bob Newhart) notices the tranquility when he deals with Tan-ken-ko and Ustinov's scams. With the help of his secretary Patty Terviligarre (Maggie Smith), Ustinov will survive prosecution and happily live forever. To tell you how to spoil this very funny, romantic, clever, and forward-its-time image.
