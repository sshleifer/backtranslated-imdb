I'm not a parent, I'm not a male. But I was able to identify with the hearts and pains of each character. <br /> <br /> The youngsters should watch this movie. That way they will start to appreciate the family value again. <br /> <br /> I can forgive those who do not understand the value of love, family, and friendship. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see Patrick Duffy in a different role than Bobby Ewing. And it's great to see Ben Affleck, the best 19-year-old boy in a moving and hearty performance. He showed him at a young age, he had a heartwarming drama. He needs to provide more serious characters. Notice Hollywood Land ... In his first role in years, he won Best Actor at the Venice Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This film is appreciated by people of all ages. <br /> <br /> I do not see children under the age of 10 for fear that this could happen to their family, but I would recommend the whole family. <br /> <br /> Many times with friends I've seen this movie on DVD. Because it depicts important values ​​in life.
