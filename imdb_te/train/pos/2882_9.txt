Cinderella is one of the first movies I've ever seen, and it's time for me. It's a lovely looking image, with beautiful animation. My favorite animated scenery dress scene- I love those rodents. The songs are also lovely, not of Snow White, but they are happy to sing and are a reflection of Tchaikovsky. A dream is a wish and so it has love standouts. The characters are also a pleasure. Cinderella was idealistic and strong, and mice gave great comic relief. Stairs have done the same, as well as Lucifer. But I love the step friend, she's really bad and played a great role in the name of Fairy God Mother. It's true, the film drags a little, with the antics of rats, but they are genuinely funny, so I do not care. I do not think this is an overtrain, do not you understand? It rarely plays on television, but is really a sequel on the evil sequel cinematic. If you like a great Cinderella adaptation, never after the wonderful, or luxurious slipper and rose, is not good. But what you are doing, avoid continuity, a mistake that I own because you thank me. 9/10. Bethany Cox
