The second alternative is the Gundam Universe Story (the first G-Gundam), Gundam Wing and Gundam. The familiar elements have been found but the Wing Wing is actually different from its rivals. The pits are not bigger than the terrorists to deal with a single company. In fact, the series did not really become an episode of the war episode 7, but the real controversy, EW Wars, did not occur until the next episodes. <br /> <br /> It is the greatest positives in the series. All the major characters are fleshed out across 49 episode runs and another great plus series fantastic character and mecha design that can really sympathize with everything you put on each of the characters. Designs insult some of its gnome counterfeits. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest criticisms of the series is how many people die in the split of UC fans' original UC saga. Gundam Seed is more clear why the Gundam Wing gets this rap when the UC clone is behind me. <br /> <br /> Take a general comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Chan Aznable. Throughout the series, Jake's has been in more fraternity and publicly OZ, while Red Comet Zeon's icon is shining. Another big difference is the fact that Czech is losing many soldiers in his possession, the other nickname he gave in his debut episodes: "His own men's killer." This label is not provided by char. <br /> <br /> The problems in this series are not mumbo jumbo but two issues. Release animation footage of Gundance attacks first. Heavy Arms Attack Tanks, MS, and Airplanes will be fun for the first time. But it's older in re-use scenes. <br /> <br /> The second issue is that the whole series is a whole year. If you really think about all the programs in this series, it happens a lot more than a year. <br /> <br /> However, I guess you can easily remove this fact while ignoring the introductory first lines of everyday. In place of it, this is probably the best of the alternative universe in the Gundam stories and the great introduction to the world of Gundam. After all, it was the first Gundam anime to be broadcast on US television.
