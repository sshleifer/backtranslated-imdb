It is one of the distinct horror films, which is appreciated by having a more mature understanding of the term 'horror'. The story is a major factor in recognizing the story of a little kid and with many young children, he finds that he is easily scared. Mainly because he can not understand things like he is rarely available for his father. From watching the movie, the husband can argue with his wife about the balance between working time and family time and you can understand it, but not a little boy. The boy who feared forests could even imagine, which was originally founded in the film, the family of the city. Furthermore, when they go home, when they touch a deer, then the locals argue with them, and the little boy does not necessarily enjoy this pleasant experience in the forest areas. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is finally what his little, innocent mind is framed to describe all of this. American Indian Legend has it, but when it finds a hearing about the young man, it clearly and simply explains. Not because Wendigo is actually what, but because he understands it. In this scene you really appreciate when you see the movie. Obviously this is less-budgeted and cheap, but more than jumping montage, light use, and general imanation. And the final question asks the picture: Is it all in your head, or is it really there? <br /> <br /> Rated: Pornography, violence, and sex scene
