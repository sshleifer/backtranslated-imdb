Makers of this good movie they have suffered by this terrible test, you did an amazing job to get in contact with the characters. Terrible scene in the woods went awesome that you forgot that these men are just playing actors. I drowned in a movie with this film. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voyett are not well on screen, as well as Ned Beatty, Ronnie Cox, Bill McKinney, and James Dickie, a film based on the film as Sheriff of Anthony. It is somewhat upsetting and hiding children, but it's a great dramatic film.
