I have a special needs child's parent and I enjoyed the movie very much! It is love, warm and fun. I learned a long time ago to see humor. I specifically thought of how sweet it is to be careful of all the other characters and the caretaker after his grandmother's death, for fear of Frankie. Before the film was edited I attended the film's sighting screening with other special parents and special needs children. Everyone enjoyed the film and it prompted exciting discussions. We talk about how we laugh at our children and we also talk about how we are concerned about them. The screenwriter talked about how many years she volunteered with autistic children and other special needs children. She is based on the real person's role. Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has earned us through some very stressful times. I give the film two thumbs up !!!
