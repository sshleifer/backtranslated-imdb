Love Rosario Dawson, I think she will be one of the finest actresses of the modern era. <br /> The goddess is more about self-empowerment than anything else. It is consistent with everything in the movie. The dialogue is flat, the letters seemingly intentionally bland and one side. Representation of self-empowerment, such as loss of empowerment and return from the roles and self-empowerment. <br /> <br /> This rape classic is not a good one, many do not enjoy the movie. The standard 'rape' audience does not particularly like this film, and maybe that point? The film asks more questions than the answers, and if it likes them or not, it faces the target audience. There is a compelling relationship between the characters and target audience and the audience can not read through the face of the face, which makes the viewer ineffective or unpredictable. <br /> <br /> IMhO is a badly rated good image.
