Once again seeing this movie, it seems infinitely superior at this time than I did not see. Acting is amazingly amazing. The characters are clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is simply wonderful as a rebellious son. Other actors and actresses are similar in each case. Robert Redford created a brilliant period from the days he made speeches in the 1920s. The scenery is very beautiful in the mountains and streams of western Montana. For all, this is one of the best films in the 1990s. <br /> You must see this movie!
