This was one of his earliest films to the Cologne episode director Steven Spielberg. Jack Cassidy's role as a murderer who killed his partner to defend his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy later appears in Colombo. After all, Colombo met his match in the role of Jack Cassidy. He is a mystery writer who plotted to commit a perfect murder. After his first murders, his next victim is an abusive ordinary shop owner / wife who blackmails him for money. Instead of losing more money, he kills him. It's always fun to watch Cassidy and Falk. Folk's acquaintance as a columbo has been repeatedly seen in the years after seeing this episode. People want the television to forget about the success of today, they want to see the characters again and see the shows again. It's not as it is, how and why, it's not just like Colombo's intro and his liking, high scores of viewers like me.
