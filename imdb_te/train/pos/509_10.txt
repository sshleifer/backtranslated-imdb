"Broken Bow" will take us back to all that started. Set in our future for 150 years and Kirk, Spock and McKay for 100 years. This installment of the "Star Trek" franchise, "TOS", first impression, "Go to Gone Gone Gone" to get the feelings of awesome, danger and enthusiasm. Scott Bucula was perfectly cast as Jonathan Archer, the first captain of the first "Star Ship Enterprise". He and the whole cast really show true respect for Star Trek's legacy. John Bullsleyley is alien Dr. Flaxz Brilliant, and Jolie Blacock's enthusiasm but the logical Wulkan science officer T'Pol is entirely luscious. Broken Bow is the best Premiere episode of Trex in my opinion, and I believe Jean Roddenberry is absolutely proud.
