Here I am the last word in the oldest semi-doc 'Eskimo' movies of "Nanak of the North". How wrong it is! As a fine ocean-kicker I went up to 330am to see this hope for handmade 'Skin-Boat' glimpse. The picture does not let me down. Any student of kayak / umic construction can be found here. (Note to fellow skiers: they use Norton sound kaucks with single blade paddles). <br /> <br /> The film went beyond acceptable narrow interest. Although others know that they have a lot of hearts in the film, some minor back-shot-duplicate-bits, they are only slightly annoyed. This is probably the perfect time to make this film (from this amateur anthropologist perspective). In the early thirties: 'Talkies' are quite new and they (in fact, including Louie B. Mayer!) Actually allow Inuit to talk in their own language. And there is a lot more, despite the dynamic drama, authentic. They are really those polar bear, whale and whacking that caribou. The fifty edition of the film was very cheesy with 'songs', technicolor etc. Dubbi version? Not even. The mirror image of the "white shadows in the South Sea" (1928) is also a very good companion for the spectacular film geographically "Eskimo" deals with unscrupulous and deep disturbances of Western culture / technology.
