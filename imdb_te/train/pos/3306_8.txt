Finally - I finally got round and could see a "clean" copy of Pakeezah! To date, I have a mess messy jerk version of the Dubai TV in the 90s, with the quirky English subtitles, dizzying wide screen coverage and its own minded fluid colors. <br /> <br /> I saw the world of such poor (and short) copies, and I thought good idea was valuable and more than 140 minutes. Meena Kumari is a film, and I believe that since 1958 she finally learned her in 1971. Chronic alcoholism eventually killed her and, in fact, some scenes in banking, a body needs double. <br /> <br /> The story of the Purpose vs. Setbacks can not be considered as a fiction that has something close to the remote, but I now reliably describe the world that is once common in India. It is a shiny and colorful movie with a simple mercilessly epic message, an intense romantic tragedy that can somehow be felt simultaneously. But the dramatic Lata Mangeshkar - especially the Thar Rahi - and the golden music I have penned by Ghulam Mohammed, which is part of the opening of the film's best story. I did not listen to any serious, beautiful, poetic, and sung songs in any film soundtrack. Sing in the Rain can be my favorite music film, but Pacheja has my favorite music-and Lata's songs are not unique to her. Only Jalia is a unique duet with only a single Mohammed Rafi, where Lata has a song here. <br /> <br /> Previously, Pakiza is my favorite Indian film, collecting the westernization pace of India and de rigueur when Western values ​​are sponsored by the state. There is a very low watch bag for the taste of Indian "pop" music before the drum machines, Bollywood beat and strokes.
