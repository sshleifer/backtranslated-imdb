Have you ever been able to escape your dull and stressful life at school or at work and go to your own magic expedition, one of your closest friends, to face all kinds of dangers and villains, and a lost civilization waiting for someone to discover the secret of the mystery? Even if you're not a very fantasy-lover, do you ever feel that you are a baby again, and not want to have the world's attention for a few hours in the world? <br /> <br /> It relates to Miyazaki's "Castle in Sky". Pazu, a young but very brave and ambitious engineer, spends a rustic life in a mining town for a day, a girl named Sheeta falling out of the sky as an angel and goes to the far exceeds the clouds they have pirates and military units on their trail. <br /> <br /> "In the old writings of Miyazaki and everywhere in the world, this film is sprite However, it is difficult to say that these films are better than others, because the three films, at some point or another, are problematic <br /> <br /> "Castle in the Sky", on the other hand, does not make much effort to be any worse, and it's not the upcoming story, perhaps the best of the best depictions of a child's mind that I've probably seen It's probably not just a beautiful masterpiece, it's just not wonderful to use the perspective of a child's eyes; Hundreds of feet, I can not help, but looking at the earth or the ocean from enormous trees or clouds looking overhead or "amazing" <br /> <p> <p> < br> </ p> <p> San or Chiharo / Haku; The angel of Sheeta Paz, literally from the sky one day in his life, was absolutely the perfect man from him.

They are not only an adorable reminder of who I am, but their lovely friendship never lets across the entire image, the last frame is only growing stronger all the way. <br /> <br /> At the same time, "Castle in the Sky" is such a easily accessible film. Whatever type of mass artist you are, here we are sure to find your solution. Mystery, action, drama, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, romance, and some western ... here, go to people's movies (perhaps the horror). This is the first I can easily recommend as the film of Miyazaki; <br /> <br /> It is certain that some of his most recent works are not as predictable as other astounding globalization. <br /> <br /> The end of this film, translated into English, is also a kind of discovery of some kind of discovery, and some kind of soul-mate, not found in our worldly lives. "Too lights I have long been the reason why you are in one of them ... earth stirring, carrying, let us see." Miyazaki always gave poetry lyrics to end the tracks from Joy Hayasaki's excellent scores, but it's the only thing I've ever seen as a touching love song and an exciting dream. <br /> <br /> "Casillus in the Sky" is not the most advanced, exciting, or meaningful work for Miyazaki: the true vision of childhood fantasy, and for any mature men who wish to have the same fantastic concept they imagined they had when negligent young children A wonderful escape from reality. Sit back, relax, and do whatever it takes.
