Once again, Madhur takes you to the Bhandarkar jungle. <br /> <br /> Mumbai Hi-societies - stars and stars, glam dolls and witch doctors, business legends and broker varieties, sharp focus here. <br /> She is pregnant, stewardess and her eldest husband, pedophile businessman and his neonatal wife, reporters and police captain; <br /> <br /> The Bhandarkar drama performs dirt on kings, dancing queens and dead organisms. Atul Kulkarni makes a punch like Bunk Irani and Santhi Mudul. Konkan Sen Sharma became the former Crime Beat Reporter, but she was very low with job change and party circuit. </ P> <p> A different image as refreshing, well worth the money.
