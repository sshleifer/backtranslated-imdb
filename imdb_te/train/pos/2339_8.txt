I love this show. Now, I'm not a big fan of many sci-fi performances, if it does not match them, I do not notice it. I like the story book quality of cinematography. I love the story too, but I'm wondering how to really improve the story of how the Neck fails to chuck in my heroine ... well, you know. I'm like Chuck, I can not see her annoying, I usually hate the sweet, the good and the perfect characters. I like the voice of my hero, even if I have some of my family members and some have some similarity with Walgreen's statements. I will do nothing about Ned's troubles and see how the writers are talking about the future and see what the story writers see and wait.
