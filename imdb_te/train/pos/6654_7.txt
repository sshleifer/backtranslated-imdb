This film brought a new dimension to Gandhi's life, which is good, which shows how man he is. His relationships with Harilal have repeatedly mentioned Gandhi's sadness and his failure as his father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> I thought my big stomach pain was surprisingly tense in the film. It is good for the person who played the role of Mahatma Gandhi. <br /> <br /> Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too camouflaged and that he seemed to be negative in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is really all rounds but the relationship of father and son. The rest are vague and are only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the image. <br /> <br /> Remember that you can not see the full picture.
