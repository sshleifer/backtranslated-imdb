Mahatma Gandhi, The Great: <br /> <br /> The greatness in the world is associated with people like Alexander and Ashoka the Great. Gandhi is great to be a great man rather than a great human being, because we believe that we have brought mankind to him, that Gandhi is a human being and a man who is willing to sacrifice mankind is not his enemies. <br /> <br /> Gandhi is my film about Gandhiji but not about his son Harilal Gandhi. One son, whose father is one of the greatest human beings who lead the land, is the director making a success in filming this story. <br /> <br /> Gandhi has been criticized by Gandhi for failing his son, saying that he sacrificed to Gandhi, the son of a son to do justice to the father of a nation. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is that of the hearts of all the world's people, not only in India but in the Gandhian country. <br /> <br /> Gandhi is the real human being. Jaihind.
