It's great when I'm a huge Jane Austen fan and a motion-length film (a real fan is as small as possible and wants to be achieved only in a small sequence). Gwyneth Paltrow is really a little clueless but well-intentioned wealthy girl and Jeremy North is captured by her knights and elite classes. I did not think I was missing all of that movie, although I liked it as an actor with Ivan McGregor. As I mentioned, I did not see Jane Austen Fan, but it was longer than allowed for a long film and I thought it was really a story. Well. I've seen every adaptation of this book and this one felt the best one!
