It's about a mad scientist who creates critter on halfway shark on an uncharted island, then arrives in his creation and (bad laugh) and calls up his old business and academic buddies who wants his tutor to kill them! <br /> <br /> These monster movies follow a similar formula, but these spices are a bit of humor (I promise not to tell sexy infants, the tongue of which is made in the strong cheek). But let's say those sexy kids - but very cute babies, sweating sweat, in tight T-shirts. In the end she was the other and the other. Thanks, thanks, bad movies makers! The plot is filled with an unusable thing, a man drives on a jeep, slams on a tree on the right, then a helicopter is likely to travel to everyone on the island. Yes, oh, well, how 'we're concerned about a while; We'll come back to you. Sharkman is happy - humorous person in the awful CGI or rubber suit. Mad scientist gives a pretty good performance; He was his inspiration, his inspiration, he did not make any apologies. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want a stupid, FUN B-image, do this job.
