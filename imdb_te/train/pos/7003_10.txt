The emotional impact of the film explains the words. It's elegant, delicate, beautiful, and tragic all rolled up for two hours. Will Smith makes his acting abilities mature and full of fun. Who knows? I've seen the Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this blockbuster, over-the-top actor, should be a weird for Smith. His performances in two films include Smith, the other talent, the script's choice, I'm not sure, but I can now describe a whole other dimension to view him differently. Seven pounds are one of those movies and you need to suspend your beliefs to enjoy its essence. Do not watch it for the plot, look for the timid and conditional situation of the human heart both literally and metaphorically. It is the story of human guilt, atonement, love and sacrifice.
