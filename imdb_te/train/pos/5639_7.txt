I have read other reviews and compare it to the movie and the message, so compare it to the real life of the film (eg, what is going to go to music school), Britney bashing, etc. <br /> <br /> I have rated this movie 7 out of 8 to 14 years old, and for family image. <br /> <br /> I love pop / rock music, I'm 45 years old. I learned about Britney Spears, credits and these reviews. <br /> <br /> I did not recognize his poster on the wall. So I was not afraid of any 'self promotion'. I do not care about casting, lighting, producers, directors etc. What is the image and it makes me fun. <br /> I've seen this movie for the message. The highest epidemic in the world is low self-esteem (the whole story) which sees the message in the brain because it is an area of ​​interest. This film is great for light, bright and windy children. I found the Texas Twin film began to wither up and give the course give / give up the message, so yes, it's a bit predictable. Great message ... to be more of them. <br /> <br /> This film is a great family film, but for getting a glimpse of himself, get Hannibal.
