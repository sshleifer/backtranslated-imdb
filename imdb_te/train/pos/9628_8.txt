There are very few plots in my favorite Laurel and Hardy movies. Instead, they give them a lot of mundane conditions and let them be happy! Movies like Help Mattes and BUSY BODIES are ridiculous as you guys find work or cleaning the house. Most of the dirty work here is in accordance with the two films - Stan and the Ali Chimney are trying to sweep the sweeps and the film's most memorable chimney (most unsuccessful). Seeing Olly falling through Chillney, working together to get the whole dilemma and snailie's insane behaviors together. <br /> <br /> In an odd twist, the movie starts and ends really weird subplot. It is a mad scientist really professor and he seems to work on a formula to make things smaller. Late in the picture, you will see a duckling and duckling into an egg! After he left alone in the room, what was the surprise? While this subplot is unnecessary, it works well. Rarely the middle part of the work. Give the guys nothing exciting and you'll be amazed at the happiest results. The band is one of the better films and has gained nearly 9.
