This image will definitely get a thumb from me. It has witty jokes and it has me in the wake of a lot of stereotypical and insulting opinions in eastern Europe. It's intuitive and is 100% original and you have to guess across the whole picture. In this film, I was a person who fascinated me with Halley Duff. It is plain and simple to see that she has taken the leap of faith that she has left outside her 'chick-flick' genre. Her voice was spectacular and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well executed. This is the best performance I've seen from Hillary, and she has seen so many movies. Her character, Yonika Baba, was described as 'The Britney Spears of Eastern Europe' and it appears in some of her habits and song, 'I want to blow you up ... ... up ...'. You also feel sorry for her, her performance really grasps you, Yonica very complicated and confusing character. Joan Cusack's entire image was sometimes laughing with her slapstick comedy and laughing with her sometimes slapstick comedy. John Cusack's intriguing conversation will probably make you chuckle across. I strongly recommend this film.
