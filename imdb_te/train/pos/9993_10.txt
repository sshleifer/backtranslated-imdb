Many Hills and funny Brooks movie I've never seen before. I can see the tape 100 times and see it again. I'm laughing off my ** and in a few moments I'll cry. It's a really good and funny picture, and if you like Brooks - it's mandatory! In short - Brooks (billionaire) reaches the streets for 30 days to win the entire poor district from his competitor. The ray of the reality, but in the end - it's strongly recommended about the warm relationships between humans!
