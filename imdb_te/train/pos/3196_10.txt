The film is wonderful due to many reasons. Harris turns into a very awkward documentary and goes into the relevant social commentary. Groovin 'Gary, a small-town boy, was very much impressed with his many irony. He decides to play Olivia Newton John (he is very passionate) in the local talent program, showing that Gary's actions are uneven with the traditional social environment he lives. As a result, he makes various justifications for his actions, so people do not think that he is really a transformation or other social boycott. In the second installment, the fight between Harris and Gary and Beverr will be exploited in a new attempt to create an article in the original documentary. The third and final installment of the trilogy is really amazing for Harris's extreme sensitivity. Unlike the second installment, "The Archie Kid" shows Gary as a really distressed character. He fights to get a consensus in his own community. Olivia makes her secret love to wear like Newton John and does away from the people who still want to emit a social. This film is realistically portrayed, as with reality, it also provides many responses. Surely, Gary can be seen as a ridiculous remorseful character, but with him he can be identified as recognizable.
