Double exposure is a tremendous surprise. Outstanding performance (especially from the lowest colon), fine cinematography and compelling storyline. In other words, it is one of the best horror attempts to emerge since the 1980s. <br /> Colon plays a fashionable photographer who experiences murders of his models, who is his mentally unstable brother (who does not have a hand and a leg). Models about killing When the Kalan dreams actually become dead, the photographer begins to suspect his own selfishness ... but there is more to the picture than he is looking for. <br /> <br /> The film deserves no praise. Many critics and film makers are covered by a group of slazer images released at the same time, but it is the highest for those forgiveness. It is intelligent and unique, which can comfortably say about most of the genres of this genre, but it is also created with generosity and displayed. Double exposure is its kind of gem.
