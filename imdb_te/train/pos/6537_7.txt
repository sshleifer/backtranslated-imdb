The children I took for this film (four kids, 9 to 12 years old gave 10 stars). Emma Roberts was adorable in the lead role. After the fascination with Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton, the streets were refreshed to see how she could not find her work. An assistant cast, including Tat Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick, and Monica Parker (a guest role by Bruce Willis). Final Takeaway: Beautiful picture. <br /> (Note: I did not read the book series, so my commentary depends on the greatness of the film.)
