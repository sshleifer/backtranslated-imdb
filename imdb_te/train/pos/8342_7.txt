What a nice romantic comedy I do not think I've ever seen is what makes you look good. All the players did a good job of keeping this lively romp. In fact, any genius mathematician in the real world also looks at a little greasy monkey, but I love romantic comedies ... so I will completely forget the reality and have a good time. Nice picture. Damn, Meg is a baby, e?
