The last chapter in the series was the official Dirty Harry trio of The Enforcer (1976). Dirty Harry is older, more dirty and harder than the old 1971 classic. </ P> <br /> Previously Dirty Harry was murdered by a mental killer, Vigilante Cops and Vietnam veterans. <br /> <br /> In the past, one of the two died. Kalahan was in a new murder case (played by Sondra Locke), who was raped along with her sister and her sister. Ten years later, she will take revenge for her attack. At the same time, Kalahan falls in trouble with his officers after he triggers a murdered story, in which the mob hunt him. So in order to make the heat of the city die, Harry was in a seaside town, while at the same time the victim was in the town and she hunted one another in the attack. <br /> <br /> Harry is in proximity and finds many murders in his homes in the killer's trials. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, suddenly the Impact is one of my Top 10 Revenge films, the second best dirty Harry film is better than both The Impercer and The Dead Pool. Sudden Impact has the original dirty Harry, a dark tone of amusing value. <br /> <br /> Are you lucky, punk?
