Robert Blake I have copies of these two great films, where the 1967 film Most Blake is shown by a window in jail where he is killing his childhood life? Show a lot of what's really going on in a classic and do not tell us that it's a really killing but it's really great eye catcher if you watch the 1996 film that makes classic classic classic very sensitive.
