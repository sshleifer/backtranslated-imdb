Creating a book is not a good idea to follow the story by page-by-page. When people read the book, they begin to see their own "mental movie" characters, how they begin to grow and exist in areas where they exist. And the eye of each other is different from the eye of the mind, which is why, when the 'real' film is finally coming out, you can always see the frustrated audience. <br /> <br /> All the heroes will be able to achieve the director's own vision of their own, It is possible to see as close as possible to see. There is no better case for movies than the films based on Stephen King's novel. When the filmmakers capture the essence of his stories, the results are breathtaking and really terrifying (CARRIE, SALEM'S LOT, DEAD ZONE) or fans are considered a terrible terrible mess (The Kubrick's version of IT and minieries for TOMMYKNOCKERS). <br /> <br /> Although the perfect king is not closely following, PET SEMATARY has just a few moments with skin and bone-deep discontent, which is directly cut off from the book to the screen. You can forgive most of its shortcomings. For that, we work from director Mamie Lambert, who turned music video (she's not exactly a horror movie, but another weird-like-hell you should put in your list), from work <br /> <br As I learned about the story, I would sleep with more details. Doctor. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) moved his family to a perfect home in the country. Well, almost perfect, except for two nasty little details: the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway, and the return of the big pet cemetery in the woods. Because Louis has a younger aperture for a veterinarian and a son ... well, even if you read the book, do frickin 'math. It's a King story, after all, so this is where the mystery is headed. <br /> <br /> Here it is not rarely destined, but frightened along the way. Some of the best-known scenes from the book brought to Sharky, moving-inducing life: Rachel Creed (Denis Crosby of Star Trek) is a terrible memory of her sick sister; Louis met with Jagger Victor Pascov (Brad Greenquist), who died before and after his death; Trip into the "other" graveyard beyond pet cemetery. And that third action ... If you do not give some nightmares, you probably want to check your pulse. <br /> <br /> Here's a good performance, especially at the end of Fred Gwynne <br /> <br /> The only issue with a movie version is that of Louis's son, Gage's cast, (Myco Hughes). Lauder and the staff are still doing the best they can, and unfortunately, Hughes learns that it is impossible to get the child out of the cottage at a time when it is too small to "sell" his intended role as an evil, ghostly zombie. <br /> <br /> In this film, when he appears in the film, the scenes that he has performed are still skillful (especially Guinness's death scene) <br /> <br /> Anything else is better yet. CARRIE still has the title for Best King adaptation as I am concerned; <br /> <br /> Still, it's awkward when reading any story based on the King Book? Now there is no bloody ... now.
