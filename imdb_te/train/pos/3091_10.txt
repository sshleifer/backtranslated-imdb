This presentation is fully worth looking at. It has the best cast of talent I have seen for so long. The premise of the show is unique and fresh (I guess I did not use a lot of executives at ABC, not another reality show). However, the program is confident with characters and fantastic stories. I'm in my forties, but most of my friends have loved it (Late 30's - mid 40) and die for quality performances with talented cast members. I do not think this performance was given enough time to get audiences. I believe that this performance which I gave a long time has done well. Once again ABC does not give a chance to the real probability. Most shows have given the opportunity after the opportunity and almost worth it! They have a real opportunity to give quality and really need to click the audience and give time to earn. I really liked the characters and looked forward to watching each episode. I'm looking for episodes in ABC videos and the performance is good and improves. I think they'll get money for another episode (number 13?). What we want to see! See if Bambard can save ABC emails and letters and save this presentation from extinction. It definitely worked for Jericho. Some things just save value and this display is definitely one of them.
