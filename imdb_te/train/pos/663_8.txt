I have seen this episode more often than any other TFTC episode, that's a pleasure. And it is very scary, but the good, the worst is pleasant. A woman walks the issue when she kills her 2nd husband but a escaped maniac in a ragged Santa Claus costume she and her little girl decides to pay a visit to that moment. I'm a lover of mary Troyer, Bad Wife, and Larry Drake Dingi Santa Clara who is reminiscent of SNL or some other TV comedy ski show. I forgot Santa Drake for years. His Santa is an unstoppable power and at times threatening. Perhaps you expect Santa finally gets at home. This episode is played to laugh, but it is also beautiful at times.
