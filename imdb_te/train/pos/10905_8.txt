In September 2003, 36-year-old Johnny Kennedy died. He called a terrible genetic condition known as dystrophic epidermolysis blossosa (EB) - his body was literally falling short in the touch, and his body was covered in scary ulcers and led to last fight against skin cancer. In his last life, Johnny decided to collaborate with filmmaker Patrick Colorton for his life and death document, and its result was first broadcast in March, a single man's amazing, confusing and provocative comic strip. Not shying away from EB's horror reality, the film is also a celebration of a life that has lived full. Patrick Colorton was the producer and director and first talked about the documentary of the year of The Boy S. Skin Fell of the Year in March 2004. It attracted nearly five million viewers and donated to the public after Johnny's charity, Deborah, a half a million pounds. The Johnny Kennedy Memorial Fund was set up to raise another million, with Johnny Kennedy aiming to leave a million pounds legacy.
