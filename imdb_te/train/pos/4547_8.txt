It is very speculative and not a Hollywood-Ish visibility but it is a 10. Daniel Day-Lewis concludes his position as one of the leading actors of our time (I do not ask why the prominent person) and the rest of the cast will have to stand on a high level. I personally impressed with Hugh O'Connor, who played Christie Brown as Christ. The first scene I saw was really strong. Wow.
