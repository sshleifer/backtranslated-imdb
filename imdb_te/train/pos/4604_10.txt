This film is a perfect 10/10 without doubt .. It's not good for you because it's a good thing for all those who have a low-segment of the film or that's nothing like Jackie Chan's movie is bad because it's like telling what a romantic movie is bad! If you're looking for Jackie Chan for the Fight Scenes, there's no good story or a lack of concentration for it, as compared to other American films of the time, Jackie Chan's films have top plot scenes and good plots, though American films have a good plot Despite that, Jackie Chan compared to what she was doing during the shuttle There are action scenes. Looking for pornography, Jackie Chan is looking for ACTION, I think I want to give you a bad rating because there is no plot because I think a smart movie reviewer would rate a good movie, but it's a good film that gives me a fun film. In the middle of the film is absolutely boring, it is very boring, but all the action sequences and struggles put it this way to pay for all the rest. This changed how American action films were created. If you want a real person, the real entertaining film will see this movie and many of Jackie Chan's pictures, he is pure everyday. He literally makes American films a walk in the park, and even in the TODAYS movies. American films are highly dependent on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and are very high. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are a real fun task. He is also out and he is very talented what he can do. A masterpiece
