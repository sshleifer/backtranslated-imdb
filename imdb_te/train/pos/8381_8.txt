I loved this movie since I was younger! Its amazing. However, there are some subtleties in the film (for example, if our hero's name is not understood as Achilles, it is a bit too much for the average movie Watchtower, and in the final battle between him and Alexander, in the heel in the heel, the Achilles in the mythology is portrayed in his heel). A little fact of amusing kind! Anyway, the great movie, the good story, it's nice to see today's special effects redone! Unusually enough, Gary Graham's average success, T.V. The show was featured in the Alliance Nation. This film is a fun watch and should get more praise!
