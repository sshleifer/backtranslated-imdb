Since watching the trailer, I have long waited for this film, it looks like a political drama starring three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack, and Bridget Fonda. And although Harold Becker was directing, he did an unparalleled work, combining himself with Pachowin Love's Sea, which is one of their best performances. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie because it's very bad. But it's a bad thing. Despite all the corruption, the government is still valuable, and there is a great potential on how to make a complex statement about corruption. Here's a good acting. Pacino and Cusack are very good, and Danny Ileio gives one of the best performances in his career. But Fonda did nothing in her role and when it was merit in the central narrative, the film loses its way, the final scene between the Cusack and Pacino would be briefly recovered, and then finally down. I want to do more, but not more.
