The film (and most others are average 5 stars and less) are thrilled when the IMDb averaged 7 out of 10 stars and the fans mocked again and the movie slammed all the time when the film came to be a former girlfriend questionable film years later I sat down to watch this film and I found myself enjoying Even smiling and smiling slightly <br /> <br /> Story: Alvin Sanders (Jamie Fox) is a no-nonsense treasury agent Edgar (David) as a pawn to catch a former criminist, Bristol (Doug Hutchinson), a killer. Morse). Each movements of Alvin are tracked by a bug in his jaw. This agent After Bristol, Bristol's gold bricks were taken back into a heart taken back <br /> <br /> Jamie Fox is a great thing like Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-talker, he's better than most. Dow Hutchinson is like Bristol. He is sometimes over-the-top in his John Malkovitch's attitude. He's here in the battle zone as Looney Bin Jim. David Morse is a hard-fitting Treasury agent. Mike Eppus is also funny as Alvin's brother Steve. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in the film is a few attempts at the thriller fall flat. Horse race is on the track, but I can not see it. The director went there, so he got the points. <br /> <br /> All attached to the chair scene chair with the Treasury Agent while all in the bait are filled with detonator on the door plus not a bad image by a long shot. Its never boring, its always funny and I do not check my watch every minute. That's something to count. <br /> PS: For those who have reviewed the movie as being too violent ... how long do you live in rack? I've seen every movie by Die Hard series and Quentin Tarantino. But those films are not a violent right? Weirdo.
