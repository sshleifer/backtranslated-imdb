The story is based on two Edgar Allen Po pieces ("The Fall of the House of Usher", "Dance of Death" (poem). It is an ancient weakness home (for example, "The Cat and the Canary", "The Old Dark House", "Night of Terror" and "On the Terror"). Boris Carlofe plays a dimensional inventor of life-size toys scaring guests. In this film, he first dies (or will he?) And residents of the house are subject to the most horrific experiences. I do not come here in detail, but it should definitely look for fans of old dark house mysteries. <br /> <br /> Get plenty of popcorn and soda in the dark room. /> <br /> Don Bashin 8/10
