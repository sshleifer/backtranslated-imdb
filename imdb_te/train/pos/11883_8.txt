I've seen this movie a week ago and I'm thinking about it. I have done this movie too. I found the characters are incredibly believable and almost like a mistake. I was disappointed when he liked to play his role, even though he was as disappointed as in real life as in the case of Leo, even when he was fully aware of his HIV status, and wanted to have insecure sexual relationships. Leo was also disappointed to refuse the medicines available to me, and a terrifying way when Marcel decided to transport him back home. I think this film showed a very real way why the HIV figures were up in young gay men. Bash Gayes (I'm homosexual) does not mean a real person who does bad images and he and others do not know about the consequences. <br /> <br /> Instead of letting Marcel go to the funeral in Leo illness, whether the biggest message from this film is gay or straight or whether it has UNPROTCTED SEX!
