The film has problems with its performance, which is also dangerous for people looking for temporary and cultural honesty, but challenges those who reflect on various issues. One of these is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. The Bible and the faith are historical nature. Third, the humanity of Jesus. The tension of Christ-betrayal relationship is developed and maintained through the film. Judas' love is shown in parallel to Christ. When Judas spent his life, the viewer was angry. Peter's denial and guilt, though moving, did not play a powerful role as Judas Drama. Chris Sarandon offers a novel and provocative Christ, whether believable. I would like to see this movie in the movie or VHS to use in film or discussion groups.
