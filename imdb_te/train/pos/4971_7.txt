This is Abdurstist Dark Comedy from Belgium. The perfect shot in crisp black and white films, Benoit Polvevoday (Man Bates Dog) Roger, is a furious, obsessive father of a family in a small, sad Belgian mining town. Roger goes with her photographer, along with her little daughter, Luis, to take photos of road accidents. He was engaged when he won the car in a competition where the contestant crossed the record - and his son Michelle decided to try to break the record by running the door - he also appointed an overweight coach to train him. There is a place in a radio show called Elvis's Michelle dress and 'Cinema Lies', where he explains the mistakes in the film. Louise is friendly with neighbors neighbors, a pigeon fancier. Roger correctly stops Michelle during a record attempt, which leads to his death. Surrealist films such as Magritte that are extinct throughout the film. It is undoubtedly beautiful and worth your time.
