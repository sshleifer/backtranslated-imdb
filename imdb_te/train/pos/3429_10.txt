I watched the movie premiere on Friday (1/19) in Park City for Sun Dance and shaken me a lot. When sitting in a theater, going to the first Ganesha soldiers, I was more than I could afford. The others in the audience are equally moved and if we want to refuse, these men and women share their experience with us as evidence that we can do. Robert Acosta, Paul Rickoff, Sean Hughes, and Herold Noel, all the veterans of the war in Iraq and the film. They can now be a house, this battle is still inside and probably always. It is our responsibility to support other troops, whether you support the war or not, the bumper sticker. Watch this movie!
