This film has a lot of points. It is one of the best horror casts outside the Lagosi-Karlov-Chaney circle: Lionel Attville, Fay Wray, and Dwight Frey, plus the famous Melvyn Douglas. A fortress with a rod downstairs, a mad scientist, a tarper's verzing torches and hunting vampires, a "Igor" character, a beautiful girl, a goofy horn buromeimist. Fluffy focus camera work is moody and imaginative. <br /> <br /> "Kilinscholas" ("The Little Castle") is not really a monster because there is nothing ego in it. <br /> <br /> It is not a high-level material due to the ho-hum resolution of the plot, and revolves around the simple crazy scientist (athleticly well-played) that he estimates his work more valuable. Some awkward bad dialogue for Dwight Frye. If you like opening b / w horror pictures but it's worth a look.
