I first saw Enchanted April five years ago. My husband gave me a surprise with the following Christmas. It is the two women who decide to rent a fort in Italy in April. At the beginning of the film they are very sad women, and they will not be able to help you start this scheme with two other women who have invited you to share their expenses. This is probably a very good picture I've ever seen. It is pure and simple, without any car, no enemies and deaths. It is made with care and good taste. Unless you cry happy with tears - you can not help but smile it all!
