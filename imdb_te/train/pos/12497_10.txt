If you do not already see this movie of Mary-Kate and Ashley's, then I'll say everything: "What are you waiting for ??". It is another wonderful and wonderful movie that we all know and love brotherhood twins! It's fun, romantic, exciting, and completely breathless (scenery-wise)! Of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main scene here! Need any other way for a true fan? Not at all! However; It is a great image in every sense of the word, so if you do not already see then you have it now! I also understand now! So what are you waiting for? I promise that I will not be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
