The first step is to find out that you are in the first place to get that road that leads somewhere; It will initially take strong steps and take positive steps to overcome the negative effects of your life on the road. Karyn Kusama is written and directed by `Girlfight, 'which is perfect for a young Latino girl. Diana (Michael Rodriguez) is eighteen-year-old high school senior from projects in Brooklyn, after her fourth fight since the opening of the semester. She masks a deep sitting angry that threatens to go to places where she does not want to go to her. She lives with her father Sandro (Paul Calder√≥n), with whom she has a very temporary relationship, and her younger brother, Ray (Santiago). With her life on the edge of the breakdown, she needs an outlet to send her badly damaged ghosts to the channel. And one day when she stops by the gym, where she has small trains, it finds it, without looking. Ironically, the smallest can do nothing with boxing; He wants to go to art school, but Sandro is determined to have his son want to save himself on the streets and spend ten dollars a week on his lessons. Diana convinces the young children's coach Hector (Jaime Tyrley) to take her, and her father refuses her for money, a weekly allowance (she does not want to know what she wants money), Sandro refuses her and tells her to go out and earn her own money. In the end, with little help she finds a way, and the ring will soon be her second home. It is an environment which she instantly applies, and her life will be about to take a turn for the better. And at least in her 'gender blind' tournaments, she does not intimidate her in the fight against men or women. <br /> <br /> Diana has found its element. <br /> <br /> For the first time, writer / director Karan Kusma has done a great job of creating a realistic background for his story, honestly portraying life in projects, in the dead-ending situations and many young people on the road leading to somewhere. And there is no candy coating on it; Hector tells her Diana, when she asks where he is, 'I'm once a war. I lost it. ' Then, looking around the busy gym, `Like most of these guys, they're also going to lose. But they know it - 'It's an attitude honest, as well as roles, which makes the film better. You can smell a lot of boxers' sweat - and it hangs on all aspects of passage and grasping and hanging these people <br /> <br /> Making her screen debut perfectly moves like Michael Rodriguez Diana, She has cast her entirely with the depth and breeding intensity, the waves. She's really real how much Rodriguez you really are; Where exactly does the actor leave, the role begins? Whatever it is, it works. It's a powerful, memorable performance, from whom one actor we look forward to another attempt to a great anticipation. <br /> She definitely makes Diana a favorable role model, many of whom find that there are alternatives and ways in which life is available. This image, however, ends up with an obscure note; Diana is clearly on the feet of her feet, where she is headed by the reference. Did she mean she was a short-term solution or Hector's woman's talent? After all, realism (realism is one of the strengths of the film), professional boxing is not exactly a profession, it is not open to weapons for women. With the approach of the film and the process of filmmaking, the decision of Diana's perspective was fitting. <br /> <br /> Supporting actors include Santiago Douglas (Adrian), Elisa Boconagra (Marisol), Alicia Ashley (Ricky) and Thomas Barbour (Ira). Although it can provide a true picture of life, what some in the ring are, with some regard to the `girlfight, 'some items are a bit of reliability to extend. Next, it's a positive picture that is satisfying experience for the most part. I rate this one 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
