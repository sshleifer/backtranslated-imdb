I saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, and I want to see it again because I hope it will get a wider release! It is a character based film, and more than Andrew and David's work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well filmed and well paced. <br /> One of the best movies of the eras I've seen in the movies, and very refreshing this summer. It was laughing the audience all the time. See if you want. (I especially liked the "Candy Bar! Candy Bar!").
