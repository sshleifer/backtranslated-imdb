It's just the best picture of all times! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw this in the early 70s when I appeared on Bulgarian TV and I immediately loved it (I am 14 years old). 25 years later I bought it on a video tape, and a few months ago finally appeared on DVD in Bulgaria. I spent 35 years with this movie, all my friends and my family. My son was a teenager when he saw the first time, and he too (and this practically only increased watching Hollywood movies and did not speak or understand Russian at all!), It really loved. Why does Danielli make this miracle special? It's hard to say, as it is difficult to describe what beauty is ... but the fact is that it is the first time you watch this movie with the same pleasure. I can not remember any other movie, how many millions it's expensive or how big is that cast ... chapow, maestro danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
