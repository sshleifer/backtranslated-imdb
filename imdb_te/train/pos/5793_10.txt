Moonwarker is a full adventure movie by Michael Jackson! <br /> <br /> Before the movie starts, a performance of Bad Tour (Man in the Mirror) is a great movie. Until Moon Walker got in 1988, we got a collage of Michael Carrier. Some music videos (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Alone, etc.) begin with this story. <br /> <br /> Plots Michael and his 3 friends (who are children) are being chased by the "bad guy" of the story, because they have discovered his bad plans for the child to get the world hacked on drugs. At chase we see excellent sections, fx. Michaels Video for Smooth Criminal, which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences, but then one of the children kidnapped Mr. Big and she would do it to save her before a drugs. <br /> <br /> In this film we see that the day is not only spectacular, but impressive today. For example, see Michael switch to a robot / spaceship to save his friends! <br /> <br /> The film ends with a show by Come Together (later published in Hessie's Michaels Double-album), and you leave a movie with a magical feeling. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to every family who wants to spend a nice night with candy and popcorn before TV. Now some parents can stand and say: "But Michael Jackson's alleged child abuser!" Yes, he really is, but we know that it is not true. Wait and see ..
