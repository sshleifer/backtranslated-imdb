Seeing "inspiration" is very satisfying. When imaginary films are such rare, and once "impulses", there is something to embrace. The script is logical, and very creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronlin, and Bill Paxton, are credited performances. It played as a zombie movie, but "impulse" is far superior to any boring "luxurious" and the reality shines in almost every scene. Even if the script is pure fiction, you get the feeling that something like this might have happened. From the beginning of the "Grabber" to the credits roll, you will be attracted. Very entertaining and definitely recommended. - MERK
