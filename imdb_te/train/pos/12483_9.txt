Although I am in the film that is part of the Sheriff Hodgzez, it still can jump in many places and I believe it's not easy. I say biased attitude about the film, and okay, I'm there, but I have not seen the full product until 12/27/2006 and is very proud. I'm not a horror movie fan, I loved the old "B" movies and black and white science fiction films. This movie will make you "think" when you're going, but it does not, then it does. It keeps it completely out of balance. I suggest directing the director's notes and special features first. It is well written, directed and filmed and you can personally tell me that this cast and staff work is a real pleasure. I hope to be part of Brian and Lawrence's future projects.
