The ring was made from Hillscock's unique screenplay, which deals with a love triangle in his first films. At first glance, Cecil B. DeMille's infidelity-background morality appears to be a more cynical update of the comics, but it is actually the first contender Hitchcock film. Although he has not yet used the ideas and intentions of suspense thrillers, he develops at least the suspense-making tools at least. <br /> <br /> As well as a student of German Expressionist style, the editing style of rhythmic sarge eisenstein has its effect on Hitchcock. But here he puts the tempo on the contents of the images rather than just editing. It is clear from open shots where round riders riders make a smooth tempo brighter. And, like Eisenstein, seems to suggest the editing style sound? <br /> <br /> Now a very vocal sound is heard because the image is very confusing. <br /> <br /> In contrast, in the US, The Ring is not so cluttered with header cards. It is notified by images as much as possible, and Hitch has enough confidence in the audience, which does not suffer or read much of the character's speech. And it is not complete by markers or overacting possible, it's all point view, as well as some strong yet subtle performances, right angles and getting the right time. Unfortunately there are some very clear expressive tools (specifically double exposures), most of which are unnecessary, but are much smaller than those in The Lodger. <br /> <br /> Some respectable mentions are mentioned above for actors. At first, the stunning, pretty and most talented Karl Brien in the lead role. Despite his talent, I have a bit of confusion about why he's character, and honestly he looks more ballet dancer than a pugilist! But it just goes to show how much I know, that Brisson is actually a former professional boxer and is inexperienced in the acting. To achieve his opponent, Ian Hunter, a long career in support of the characters up to the 60s. The most important character in The Ring was given to Lillian Hall-Davies, who was crushed between two lovers. She is well-maintained with a feeling, poor performance, and her career is not always in the sound age. Last but not least Gordon Harker has never been able to give any comic relief in his role. <br /> <br /> The clock's action scene of the ring is one of Hitchcock's most glamorous moments of quiet-period. Martin Scorsese may have had his attention on The Ring when he directed the action scenes in the ringing bull, because his speech for these scenes would be "ring inside". The ring starts with some common long-term shots in the fight, but when the action is intensified, Hitchcock falls in the middle of us, scenes and point-of-view scenes. Hitchcock's goal seems to always have his audience, and this role is crucial in his next career, the secret of his success in the scene of the character or the observer of the character. <br /> <br /> The ring is really low but deserves more recognition than the well-known The Lodger. It's a more polished and professional work than the previous film, and perhaps best of all his quiet features.
