<br /> The story is said to be a complicated and fantastic story of the last Harem of the Ottoman Empire, and inspiring to see the inner workings of the world that we now lost and learn about the people who lived there. The story, the characters, the acting and the scenes enjoyed. <br /> <br /> The main character Saphia plays an amazing role by Marie Gillain, doing it. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are both lovely and lovely. <br /> <br /> The film is more standard for anyone looking to see Hollywood lowest and the world they are emulating.
