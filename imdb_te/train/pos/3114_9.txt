I'm going to continue this brief briefing not to damage anyone for you. This film is awesome. From beginning to end, it is filled with real thrills. Combat sequences attracted excellent and chase scenes, and it was far beyond what was said at the end when things were clear, but it was only the previous one. Damon is shining and really brave actor has proven that he does not trust him in this role. He is this character. In David Streitrine, Serious CIA spokeswoman welcomed Bourne to be released to kill. It's a non stop and really leaves a lot of way to the edge of your seat. Some things in the end are just a Smithson straight, and therefore a 10 rating is opposed. Leave open for closing sequels and I absolutely hope they will consider doing this more, no one has been bad. An amazing ending in all of the amazing picture and a wonderful trilogy. <br /> <br /> P. Moving Cam does not hurt any of the action, but I still think we can do without it. The good news is, it can only be observed when you take a lot of action when you speak.
