Woody Allen's second film set in London. The Tha Taro card murderer murders hunters in London. Enthiran journalist Sonra Parangi (Scarlett Johansson) gets a suggestion that he may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She starts with romance but quickly falls in love. <br /> <br /> "It's been short and very fast." But I kept entertaining and guessing to myself until it was too late. It's not a lot comedy but comedy, some very funny lines (all from Allen of course). <br /> <br /> Allen's not the best thing but it's much better than his worst. <br /> <br /> Allen is bad but he is a good man Lion has played in front of times and it has gotten tiresome.But Johansson and Jackman are just great - they look great and give two glamorous performances.Allen (surprisingly) works on their sex appeal - there's a range where they're both in their bath suits. Allen still knows how to shoot in London The only real debit iyadu. <br /> <br /> He said, "the point man" was in - he's probably better that he went to. <br /> <br /> worth seeing. I will give it to 8.
