When I first read the hamlet, I could not help but think about the end of Fort Arctus Fortune, how Bettie Midler dramatized the play, and said, "Give me any day Romeo." Five actions of the person trying to decide whether to kill his uncle? I looked like overkill. But after reading it, that game really appreciates. I saw Olivier and Gibson's film versions (and part of Nicole Williamson version), and all of them from Oliver's take on their model; Dane with sadness. Olivier is not self-guessing about it, but Gibson and Williamson from what I've seen, "Look, Ma, I'm acting! I'm acting!" <br /> Now the version of Kenneth Branagh, which is breathtaking from the beginning. It's the best Hamlet, and perhaps the best Shakespearean film, in my ten tenths of 1996 (behind the English PATIENT, and forward Lan Star, Jerry Maguire, Pharaoh, Secrets & Lies, I love you, love for the big night, Richard) put. In fact, Brahnag's talented filmmaker has lost a full-length version of 70mm print, four hours of interest, but neglected in discussions about the film is his performance in the title role. My favorite show this year is very far. Blacks are placed away from the meladogram that appears to be trapped by playing a simple, normal human being, and understands his actions and feelings every step of the way. Branagh uses his whole body to perform a series of emotions that he travels to, but he does not seem to be a scenery-chewing, since he plays as usual. The rest of the cast is top notch as well. I do not care for Jack Lemmon, though I agree with a weak member of the cast. The most surprising turn comes from Charlton Heston; I have always found him tight as a board, but he is very commanding as a player. Other big surprise Billy Crystal; I thought I'd find him all wrong as 1 Gravedger, but while he was in the role he was his usual funny self. All in all, an amazing picture!
