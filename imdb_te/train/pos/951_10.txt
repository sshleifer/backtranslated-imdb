I know that many have a special affection for the Dickens story's Alistair Sim version, but for me, this 1984 version is beat. In VHS my wife and my wife and I see each Christmas Eve together. <br /> <br /> Scott - Scout Tightcast - shudderingly understand and nasty, making his transformation more fairy and moving. I'm there with his performance in Patton. The souls are all efficient, every crease than the last. The skeletal form of the dark, floating, Christian Spirit and the Come to Come will remove my spine every year. And a supporting cast! David Warner was, in particular, Bob Crochet, Susanna Yark as his wife. <br /> <br /> I'm reminded that this version is closer to the original story than most. But I am mistaken because I have been many years since I read it. Regardless, this is an incredible Christmas classic.
