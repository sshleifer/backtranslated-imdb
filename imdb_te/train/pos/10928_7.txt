A dead Kung Fu Master sends his last student to find out what happened to the five students who are forbidden Poison Clan. The student wants another member of the clan who worked with good money to see if they are acting for good and for him to be the owner of a good man to stop him. The alumni were taught in a different style snake, centrifuge, scorpion, lizard, toad, and the final student taught a little in every style. Students end up in a town looking for an old man with all the money, and soon everyone is struggling to earn money. <br /> <br /> You know the classic martial arts movie title. I've talked to a couple of casual fans and it's a film that's stuck on their head. It's not a good movie for me to watch movies for my movies from Shah A studio (an example of an armed Swaderman or Brave Archer series) for my film. The film is not small, it is not because the movie is a mystery, no one knows our hero, and who knows who is the best in both of them. We have given four recognition but we still have fifth really who will work. Initially the training sequence and the killing of the old man and his family, this film is not correct for the martial arts film, 40 or 45 minutes does not take any action. It's a bold move to make but pays off from having your attention on the plot and performances. (This film is also the first martial art film I thought I did not see any women. I do not think there is a spoken character, it does not suggest anything, it has something to hit me.) This is a good movie, not a reputation in some circles, A good picture to cut on the bed. <br /> Around 10 to 7.
