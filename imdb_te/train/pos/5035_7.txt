In the horror / thriller McCook? I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> The plot is mentioned in flashback mode and is related to a very simple and happy family. Sorry, I can not say much more than scatter the whole movie. If you decide to look at it, you will be surprised by little. <br /> All major players are very good. Bill Paxton made a great job directing the children and his performance was awesome. McConneg's performance is rich throughout and the bill is perfectly complete. <br /> <br /> You are challenging to think about this movie. Dad silly? Is there God Has the Demons? How wrong you go right wrong. What is "right" anyway? I'm still thinking. <br /> I recommend "weakness". 7/10 and one of those movies that deserves a second or third view and is rewarded.
