I have read many commentaries that criticize Bob's cheese and campus on this site. This film is wrong for amateur acting and weak special effects. What do you do from a group of experienced people in low-budget production, locally produced (Valley Forge PA) Christian Shorts. The fact that I did not have serious concerns about the film, the fact should be clear from theme music that did not complete with crazy lyrics played on early credits. For what it meant, this picture is amazing. I have seen some of the recent ultra low budget efforts, the Blair Witch Project, one of them, no entertainment value or intelligent thoughts behind their platforms. BWP Pure Flame. On the other hand, Blob is well thought out, well scripted and well entertained. The old man falls across the asteroid and the mass featuring a stick made the spectacular and originally creepy pokes scene. When the old man used a movie horror masterpiece, the scene in the Doctor's office was slowly moving on the gunner. Bottom line, I love this movie. I am challenging anyone to make a movie near anywhere worth $ 120,000.00 for today's dollar value, and anywhere else that is fun and blob-like. It's just not done. Period! <br /> Thanks for taking the time to read this review.
