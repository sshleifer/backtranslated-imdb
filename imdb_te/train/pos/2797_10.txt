10/10 for this image. <br /> <br /> I am currently a British Indian doctor in India. Beckham put me on the word, 'Cause I am a die hard Liverpool fan, and personally think Owen is really cool. <br /> <br /> If Liverpool and Man Unden are opponents, I'm sure Dead do not see the film. <br /> <br /> I'm in Delhi to meet some friends, <br /> <br /> "Look at the heck by watching this movie?", "Cass it's a nightly event. <br /> <br /> What a moron I am. I should see the day the film was released. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​using Beckham's name is to imagine audiences (which has reworked my case!), but then I can not really think about the title better for the film. <br /> <br /> If you hate footballs, if you do not like Manchester United (or England), it's constructive for you. In fact, I'm 29 yrs old, a psychiatrist by profession, but a kid at heart. The film has dropped "Star Wars" from my No. 1 position. <br /> Surprisingly, Indian-British like me did not comment on the film. <br /> 10/10 for this film.
