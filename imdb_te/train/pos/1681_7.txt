"The Case of the Scorpions Tail" is an all-inclusive Geo. This story is a standard Geo. His wife (Ida Galli) collects a $ 1 million life insurance policy when a person dies in a plane crash. The widow goes to Greece for payments but follows a series of gruesome murders. Many suspects, including a good investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance agency and the widow of the widow. When director tries to estimate the identity of the killer, Martino keeps the story moving fast. Anita Stroudberg (also reminiscent of "Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key" and "Who So Saw Hai Dai?") Is an amazing-looking heroine. This is one of Martino's best films.
