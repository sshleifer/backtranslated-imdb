A very fine and horror horror movie from the poverty-string film company PRC, which really cheesy movies like a devil bot or flying serpent. German expatriate director Visbar wonders with a small budget and his studio-bound swamp set. Gant and the horrific Charles was influenced by Middleton Strongler.
