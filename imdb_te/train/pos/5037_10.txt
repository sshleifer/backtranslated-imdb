This may be the least underestimated image of its genre. I do not remember seeing any ads or advertisements for this which may be the reason why I did not play well at the box office. However, stupidity is a fantastic and real genuine horror movie. <br /> <br /> Film begins with Snapshots of photos and news stories about a killer called "God's hand". Later, a man walked at a police station and told him that the murderer had his brother. Two of the victims will go to the place where they are imprisoned. During the tour, the man began telling his brother the story and we will go back to when the events start. Fenton and Adam Two young brothers living with their hard and religious father, one day, received a divine message from God asking him to kill demons as regular human beings. <br /> To accomplish this divine mission God destroys the list of demons and asks his sons. <br /> <br /> This is a completely horrific and thrilling movie. Your seat. Tension is high, innocent people (or ghosts) are killed and religious experiences are questioned. It's in the end but some very clever twists. If you like this style, I would recommend it very simply for you. I had the DVD and one of my all-time favorite horror thrillers.
