In my opinion, these stars are less frank synthtra, Jean Kelly, Catherine Grayson and director George Sydney, one of the fewer music for any lesser music from the lineup, there's nothing for the screw, and in the line-up <br /> <br /> Sinatra and Kelly Clarence Dulittle and Joseph Brady and two Navy men. The film starts, they're just dragging the Los Angeles area for some needed vacation. Brady plans to visit a girlfriend named Loha. Doolittle still seeks a bit wet, appropriate enough, and private from Brady (publicly, the protagonist Isabel Lennart and Sydney smiles men everytime women have exaggerated their maneuver). Brady promised to help Doolittle get hooked, but mainly because the dulittle will not leave him alone. The local police have to keep their plans for a kick when they force the young boy to be primarily engaged in navy. He does not inform the police where he is or where he lives. Brady helps and he and Dulittle boy get home back home. When the boy's guardian, Susan Abbott (Grayson) finally appears, Doolittle goes to Gaga for himself. Brody tries to convince him to forget about him; Brady just wants to come back to Lola. But they will go back to Abbott's home, and eventually something of love with the triangular forms of love. Things became more complicated when Brady was dissatisfied with a famous musician Jose Irby in a studio residing at a studio, and set up an audition for Dubialite, which was a singer and actress before Ibrahim. <br /> <br /> With the narrative, the strange combination of music military music - in the naval premise, apparently, Broadway pop stars more informal settings, abotted music, Mexican music - often moving to a Mexican restaurant in a Mexican restaurant in the Mexican section of Abbott , The famous music of Abbott's famous music, lyubes. The songs are plenty better, and everyone participating is definitely a singer or musician, but the crushing of the style makes it feel lost. Wurse, a big star at the time, had a couple performances, effectively bringing that plot to a halt, which at this time was more than a bit hokey. I saw another movie with extraordinary music, Robert Altman's Kansas City (1996), but the plot stopped to change over time as a concert film. Anchors Aweigh will take a similar strategy. Yes, it's a musical, but contrast between the songs that connect to the plot and concert shows that look like the contractor responsible equipment. <br /> <br /> There are also some plot problems. It is not very well because Bradley Abbott's Dullet is against the invasion. Brady feels that the dulitille should not be associated with the caretaker, and is relatively "correct" and conservative, but on the other hand, Brady is the same woman who agrees with herself that Doolittle is not the same. Abbott appears to be a good fit for dullet and, moreover, Lennart Brady is struggling to prove that he only wants to get a doolittle from his hair and to meet Lola - Brady's role is quick on any candidate, she is not a good fit or not. This might seem like little detail, but the plot is actually the keys for half a third. The story is a bit drawn. The length is a problem. Anchors Aweigh, should have been reduced by at least two hours and at least half an hour to the clock in twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> I would like to complain about this film. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of errors because I have no conventional knowledge of mechanical knowledge. <br /> <br /> Sinatra, Kelly and Grayson are absolutely glamorous, separately and together. They perform good and interesting performances. Sinatra looks much smaller than his original age and is 29 years old? 30 during shooting. He plays an unusually innocent and relentless role - he is totally different from the next characters, and is different from his public image. For Kelly, this is his progress picture, and so for him. His choreography is different and impressive as his dance. Grayson is lovely, her performance is sophisticated, and she is just gorgeous. <br /> <br /> And there is also an interesting thing that probably only arises because Sydney is allowed to expand into a large variety of sentiments. Jerry Tynges (with the "Tom and Jerry" fame) expanded Kelly Dance. This is one of the earliest examples of combining live action and animation, and it's very well done and enjoyable as long as you're a fantasy fan. Fantasy sequences are the best of the film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It's fun. Fans of classic music fans certainly should not have anchors unveiled, and Sinatra fans get a lot of kick in his role.
