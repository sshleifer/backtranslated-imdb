This is a great movie. Giant robots are incompatible with the opinions of countries that are sending conflicting people. <br /> <br /> But I was surprised by the characters. We can never see Achilles and Athena's relationship with the development of kisses more than the kisses and that we can not see Athena's fear of Achilles's safety. <br /> <br /> Their love is very pleasant
