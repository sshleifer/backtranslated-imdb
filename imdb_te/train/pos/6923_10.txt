With John Wayne's exception, the actor is long in the saddle in the Western than James Stewart and the film proves it. This fantastic story of a vengeful revenge around a Winchester rifle is the only weak point I can think of: Will Gare's cast acted as a very frightened Viet Erp. The cast of the villains is good: Steffen McNally, a sensitive Dutch Henry, Don Duria Waco Joni Dean, and John McIntyre (such as playing good guys and bad players) as a soft gun runner. Showdown between Stewart and McNally on the summit is cool! I have made this Western to this Western Western crop. They can not stand a chance!
