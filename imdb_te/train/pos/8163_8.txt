Corbin Bernsen was an excellent and successful performer with Dr. Alan Feinstone, full of wealthy and successful Beverly Hills dentist. When he realizes that his lovely blonde babe wife is cheating on him and begins to hire him about the IRS tax issues, Finestone cracks and bends around in the pressure. Brian Yuzuna, director of the dark, witty and sensitive script with attacks by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Poyelli, and Charles Finnch, reveals the seamless neurosis and psychosis bubbles that are well-known to the delicious and harmful surface of America's dignified rich richest. Moreover, the Yuzna the more spices pitch black up the fierce goings with a wickedly twisted sense of humor hanging. Bernsen shines as Dr. Feinstone; He is an underlying lingerie treat that is not true to Finestone's fraudulent calm and guaranteed layer. The supporting actors are also great: Studio Muffin Pool like Jimmy, Pakey Assistant Karen, Gibbs' equally active partner Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec, such as Finstown's Bitch, Life Huffman, Broke, Earl Bone, Longtime, Ideas Agent Marvin Gold Blum, Molly Hagan Cleaner Matt, and Marz Ruffalo as Sleezbazz Steve as virgin Â£ Keehne sweet, gawky teenager Sarah, thorough adolescent Detective Gibbs, Landers. The first-rate make-up f / x is every bit gross, gross and upsetting as they should be. Polished cinematography by Levi Isaac has great crazy slope camera angles and some delicious zoom-in close-ups. Alan Howarth's enthusiastic complicated score also comes to the place where the meat is packed. An enjoyable warped treat.
