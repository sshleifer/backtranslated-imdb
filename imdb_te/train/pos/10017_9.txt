I definitely liked this movie! Not all other commentaries I read about it. I totally utter in every second! <br /> <br /> I've found the story-gripping, acting serious, and spot-on in the direction. I literally make phone ring at the end of the phone. Although there is nothing "scary" about the story, I'm on the edge right through the whole film - the rest of the evening. <br /> I've found the most perfect choices ... it's sprinkled with small bits of casting, script and humor. The film has gone for very little thrill, but it has never been done, and I have made this film a lot more thriller than the recent recent thrillers ... and finally the years.
