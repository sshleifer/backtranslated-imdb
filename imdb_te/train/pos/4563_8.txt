This film is hard to imagine based on the true story, and heart-confusing is how Christ has managed to accomplish this miracle. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, it's hard to imagine how hard it worked to create the role of this disabled. <br /> <br /> The earlier film was not too disappointing, the story is very bright and witty. <br /> <br /> Kristini is not thoroughly judged by Normals, his life is also colorful and delightful, but we know about his loneliness and painful feelings through his eyes. <br /> <br /> The key to Christie's success is that her mother's support is more touching, and unknown actress Brenda Fricker deserves her Oscar for this role, using this fat low middle-aged woman Christie's dream to come true. Good luck for Christie! And Hugh O'Connor is also amazing as the young Christie, a show for kids! Christie's love story is very believable and reliable. Christie does not have the right to love and love, and his love for the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly Fiona Shaw, in the Harry Potter series, has impressed her character in her bizarre Aunt Petunia, so her performance is beyond my mind, but any woman Own youth is ...) She has sympathy, love, both side Edged sword, pleasure and pain <br /> <br /> Btw, everything else works better of Jim Sheridan (In America, The Boxer, etc.), except for the exclusion or tea traiying 'career really passionately for him, no pity!
