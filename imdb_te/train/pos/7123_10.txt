Sometimes I saw a movie and was really impressed by it? And it's not easy to explain why I like it. Is it mostly unusual movies ?? The rest of them do not compare to the rest. Goodnight Mr. Tom is one of these special films. Is there a lot of emotion in this film? And that acting was very good, I was crying and the story continued while watching the movie. Young Nick Robinson ?? A young boy (William) was evacuated from London due to air strikes during World War II. <br /> <br /> Refusal to take any responsibilities at Tom - is a concern for a troubled young man. But he agrees to have been left without any choice. What was the worst for Mr. Tom William when spent? In addition to his luggage, his mother sends a belt and written instructions to his son's host? Do not hesitate to use it. Is this belt field beridized ?? It should not be used in such a ruthless manner. Mr. Tom gives a real home for William, and the boy is happy in his new life, he goes to school, makes new friends and finds the hidden talent. A letter to the sudden is called home in London with a letter referring to William's not feeling her well at all? And it all starts again ?? This time only gets worse? Are there many ideas you can understand in this movie? Love, fear, sadness, joy, pain, hope ?? These are still. Goodnight Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of comparable British cinema with others like beloved Frankie and Billy Elliot? If a comparison. I really enjoyed watching this and I highly recommend it. Before I finish reviewing this, I would like to tell you about Thomas Orange's great performance in Jack. I reminded myself of my friend from my own childhood (:
