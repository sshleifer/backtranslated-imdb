I usually do not like reality shows, especially the achievements of "American Idol". <br /> <br /> All comedians around the world conduct a brief program for the famous Talent Scouts, and if they like them, the audience will be a real audience. Then ten or twelve comics were selected to live together in the house and "Survivor" style tournaments were performed using comic tactics. Then "final comic standing" is determined. I like the comedy stand up, so this should be of interest to my interests as a reality show. Some are chosen by some pretty funny comics. <br /> <br /> My negative criticism is the fact that these comics are very much originally chosen for their share of my negative criticism. Performance play. <br /> They first lived together at home like "Big Brother", but now they are grateful to God for doing so. <br /> <br /> Many of the comedians I feel, they are funny, but other comics in race, ethnicity, attitude, and sexuality are obviously unsuccessful. But overall, it's a well-made reality show that has been two words so far, now I think it's a quadrilateral.
