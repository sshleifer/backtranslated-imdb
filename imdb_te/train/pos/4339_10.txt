This is one of the best films I've seen. The movie is well liked by this movie. One sentence in my mind is "recurring history". Life shown in the movie: When people become young, they can not understand their parents, their own spouses; People do not have every necessity for not sharing the most beloved time with their children until most of the time; People should always work hard to support the whole family but are simply responsible for neglecting the subtle sense of their partners. People always change their lives at different stages of their lives; People will always be forgiven if their loved ones love their loved ones; It is not too late to share the blood of people in the world, and it is not too late to talk to them about their feelings in the lower part of their heart, so people do not have to be sorry or regretful, - A new life. Actors and actresses are excellent. He fully understood the director's intention. I have the attraction of the film to bring a keen and exciting combination of cheers and tears to the audience.
