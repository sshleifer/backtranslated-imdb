The silly film is really funny, really. Yes, its dead moments, it's a bit too clear, the second half refuses a bit and the story is incompatible crazy, but it laughs out loud funny in all respects. And the right wing for Ed McMahon is worth looking at. Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, is another fantastic funny, underprivileged film.
