Ronald Coleman acted as a prominent Broadway actor, who began to lose his mind and sense of identity. After years of playing a wide range of episodes, he certainly can not remember who - who his characters and who self. And, more intense, he begins to see and hear his game even in everyday life. So, since he has been playing in "Othello", he started jealous and suspicious action - as the title character. Ultimately, this leads to insanity and murders. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie a couple of years ago and liked it. I saw again and loved it. I'm probably my enthusiasm for Ronald Cole and it's a great success for him - and he has earned an Oscar as Best Actor. And, I think Coleman is a very good choice, in that year's competition (Gregory Peck for John Gentleman, Bardi and Soul for John Garfield, Michael Redgrave Electra for Father and Michael for Powell and Michael), <br /> <br /> Now a reviewer hates Shakespeare I saw this picture hated - and for half his review of the review is not for him Financial. However, this film is not really about Shakespeare, it does not matter if Shakespeare does not like it. I'm not a big fan of Shakespeare, but Coleman surprised me in the small episodes of the re-play - although it was not true of Shakespeare, as I mentioned. Instead, it is an amazing film that loses his mind and adds his role in reality to reality. <br /> <br /> "Othello" may be any play, even if it is an excellent choice for the murder scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, the fascinating script - Some suggestions of Film Noir. Fortunately, acting was terrible, because Simon Hosso, Shelley Winters and Edmund O'Brien (who was particularly good - he played his role correctly). And, considering the direction of the great George Cukor, it is no wonder a wonderful picture from start to finish.
