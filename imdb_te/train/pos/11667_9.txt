The Secret of Kells I have been waiting for a few years since I saw some early footage in Kill Kenny's Cartoon Saloon. I'm waiting here to tell you now. The cartoons are heavily styled, but I'm not so angry I fear. The whole picture is one thing of beauty and great imagination, I come to life on the page of little people who love the animated bright book especially. The character is fantastic, I love Brendan Gleesen's voice stranger abot and especially the voice of sprite isailing. The forest is such a beautiful place. This story is a combination of reality and realism. And really perfect materials for the book attracts the audience to cheer on Brendan in his quest. This matter is a lover of napper and brilliance, so the thing is close to my heart, but I've seen everyone and agree that this is a lovely little picture if it's not the fans of Craft. When it's released I will definitely buy the DVD, and I want to tell you about all the people involved in the cartoon saloon and this mammoth project. There may be too many. :) I'm coming back here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and given them to Christmas, everyone loves it! And I want them all the luck in the world at the Oscars, such a pleasure to see this nomination.
