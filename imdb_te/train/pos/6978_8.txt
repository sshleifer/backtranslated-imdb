<br /> <br /> When I try to spoil it, some people really mention the pilot. <br /> On the other hand, it is not quite sure how to understand the enemies that they consider themselves to be BSG fans and not as a pilot. <br /> What do they do? In the background we will help 50 years before the birth of the BSG, the life of the Adama family (already we know some from the BSG), the deep description of the Caprique population and its understanding of the other colonies, and the roots of God's belief in humanity and the unique belief of Sinhans source. <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> This initial guarantee is 1h30, I want this to be as good as BSG for scenes Confidence also brings stress. <br /> <br /> I have hoped from below, but there is no reason to doubt that we can learn much. <br /> <br /> Seeing a deleted view of the DVD gives you more material to chew on your brain. <br /> Looking forward to January 2010
