<br /> <br /> "Write a fox and ask at least to finish filming <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the show and enjoyed every evening after OC. I tried to see that presentation And knowing that it has disappeared Can you imagine my disappointment? Now I'm not very happy with the fox, and even after learning that the ending is over, I mean, if you're working on a project, finish at least to see what's going on. A half-shot program is like a half-car, It is pretty much useless.Fox, the film is damned and perennial Sana some of the fans to give some peace.
