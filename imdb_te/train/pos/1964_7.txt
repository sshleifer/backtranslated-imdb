I can not accept other critical comments. Probably they are very complicated, because they have difficulty in the past. I want to see a comment from those who have never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe many young people? I'm glad to feel the film that IMDb did not influence by reviewers. After 14 hours I'm still trying to find flaws in the plot but I can not think anything serious. <br /> <br /> This follows the same approach to Basic Instinct 1, but the plot is less confused. It still leaves me wonderfully but more satisfying in the end. Sharon Stone is always sexy and bad, and wears well for his 48 years; It defines her role. David Morrisy was satisfied even though he was Michael Douglas. Among the supporting actors I particularly liked David Thewlis as a detective.
