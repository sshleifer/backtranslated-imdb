**** Including spoilers <br /> <br /> I have been a horror movie fan for decades. I have seen great things, I'm surprised. I have never seen this before. It's a treat, from a very hitting path ... either way to the swamp ferry boat. Here's a horror film made in the 1940s to kill a lot of different things. Beautiful girl is fearless (Gulp) for change and saves men, including the man who loves her from the monster! How is it for a twist? This girl was totally different for most women at the time, not throwing herself in her own shade, there was nothing to be afraid, not tripping on a leaf as she was running. The gas was not afraid to stay away from the rest of the villagers. Also, there are rumors to follow this place. The heck she also takes Naps on the swamp grass outdoors ... like a typical 1940 version of Ripley. No snake, gator or ghostly stranger will have the courage to bother this gas. Books on early feminist images must also have this negligible work. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of me, they are fantastic amazing B / W horror films that have made me in the 30th. And be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection.
