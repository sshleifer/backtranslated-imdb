This will begin to bet between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist ... the man wager no spending the whole night in a creepy castle. Well, of course he can, but he will come out unscathed? It's hard to tell these strange people who do not need to wander around, including snow-covered Barbara steel. This is a very peculiar film, featuring French and English language, and a few times back. Perhaps this happens because the bits of the dialog are missing? It's also a little dark and claustrophobia, a candle and a small circle of such a product can not be seen, plus all the time there is a lot of fear and the feeling of impending doom. This version (in Synapse) is not even cut and I am surprised that I can be censored in a movie since 1964, and I have seen an unseen picture, I can imagine. Overall this is pretty good and black and white gloomy. Barbara Steel certainly makes the film itself. 10 to 8.
