I found this a nice romance / play it has a nice finish and a generally nice feel. It was not a hallmark hall of a sleep-pre-marital fame-style family film that was considered a "normal" behavior, but I thought it was going to be a gene by Jen Fonda and Robert De Niro, with a very linguistic picture. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the film is that you already have difficulty learning how to read and write when you are an adult. It's a big theme and some touching scenes, but to be honest, the film is not that memorable. <br /> It is still very happy.
