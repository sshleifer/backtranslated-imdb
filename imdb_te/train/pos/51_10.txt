Busy is pretty awesome! I liked every word she did- strange and geeks, Dawson's creek, white chicks, smoker. When I went home for the first time I went and came the next day. I'm a big fan of her and she has many fans in Israel. If someone has not seen more time waist and now than it is going to look amazing image. I recommend you to see all of her movies. I saw busy in the late night show with Canon and she is very cute and beautiful I love her! Everybody who has seen the movie - she is very scary in the home room but she is very beautiful in real life! You have to see all her half-naked pictures of stuff magazine (proverb) she looks great there too! ~ Daniel
