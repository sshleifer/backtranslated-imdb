Most of all, I like the mentality of the performers performing in Hollywood, and more specifically in terms of its love, the comic book pages. Why? <br /> <br /> Executive No. 1 'Hey has a number of dollars collected from superheroes today.' <br /> <br /> Executive No. 2 'Good Point, Let's Coming Soon Soon! ?? We'll lucky dip in a hat and randomly choose to build a superhero on an image! '(Dip is happening and a famous superheroes name will be removed) <br /> <br /> Executive No. 1' Great! Who can play that role now? <br /> Who is the 'big box office star' during the executive No. 2? <br /> <br /> The name of the executive No. 1 of the big actor is this week. <br /> Executive No. 'I do not overlap with the character he did. <br /> Who is the executive No. 1? He is the big name; Anyway we'll make a film with him. <br /> Executive No. 'You look great! <br /> <br /> Let us complete the full picture. So no one can ever question it and there are attractive special effects to calm people. <br /> <br /> In the above-mentioned scenario I usually feature many modern superhero films. All the style, the ingenuity of the iconic leads and just casting curiosity. To be equal, there are exemptions to the above rule; When is Hollywood right ?? Take the original casting (and still the best) Superman; Christopher Reeve and recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men movies. <br /> <br /> Do you come back to the common negative qualities displayed by Hollywood?

Unfortunately (but not generally) Hollywood has not allowed Kallara to complete the full length film but fortunately for us, the result he has completed is two (and more) superhero small features. A Wonderful Batman: Dead End and Another This mock trailer is a completely fictional movie called the World's Finest. <br /> <br /> Well, we do not have our words here. This is definitely awesome stuff! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mister Universe winner and masculine model Michael O'Hearn cast steel giant man who makes the most perfect choice (they have looked similarly awesome but totally poorly barbarian wasted). In fact, in the case of physical comparisons, there is undoubtedly close to the comic strip. <br /> <br /> The Dark Knight in Batman: Along with this Clark Bartham. <br /> Again, there is another judgment justified! <br /> What can I say? ?? It's really true, full length film! Hollywood studio executives ?? Please note! <br /> <br /> This little movie is inspired by fans. Tough, the most rigid and intense negative reactions against it are clearly once again (as well as with Batman: Dead End) and a younger, lesser film also from an experienced audience; Somewhat grammatical is a fact fraudulent by the liberal use of the ancient beginnings and the base words. Such an unfortunate state of closed mindedness is indeed a sad phenomenon that one of our top studio officials in Hollywood has got a great satisfaction from no doubt. After all, these are the same exact sort of CGI's perfect slave, popcorn stuffing imbecils that Hollywood has been churning out through the vicinity of these days that the same misleading people will revel in the worst majority.
