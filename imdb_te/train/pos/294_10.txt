Critics and critics reacted when the first release was released and stated that the film was the director's best. The film attracts audiences from a detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) in the film, which falls in love with the most active and beautiful women found in the film (Audrey Hepburn), Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patty Hansen). Much of the film in the film is a seriously sensitive feature in the film, which is either advertised or rewritten in the script. Ben Ghazzara was astonishing after singer Collain Camp and followed the detective on the head of Audrey Hepburn, and saw the cam-driver Patty Hansen on the side. John Ritter follows Dorothy Stratten and soon comes in love with her. Blaine Novak has some of the girls he chases (including Jois Feijer and Elizabeth Pena). The film has some great performances by a fine cast. The stands are Audrey Hepburn (she has no line in the first half of the film). Ben Gazzara was never better (and a choice of romantic prominence) and one of her best roles as Colleen Camp Manick living singer Christie Miller. She was delighted to see her when she removed her lines in a rat-tot-tat delivery. Highly recommended! ********* stars!
