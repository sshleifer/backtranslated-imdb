Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper still change the world to their smiles. The combination of these two magnificent stars is a reunion / new movie. Look at it and look forward to hit sixty! Mary rebuffed youth-based society with intellect and charm. Touch of play adds 2000 realism. Following is a TV series to extend new characters and give us the opportunity to see Lou Launt Grant, Phillis, Sue On, Murray, and Georgetown!
