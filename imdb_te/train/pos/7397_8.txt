"Jijoo" is the story of modern life and ancient traditions, and its impact on a family in China. A businessman who returned to his home in Quanxiu Pu, a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Xiang), believes that his father Liu (zhu ju) has died. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] The Da Ming is a family around the family and finds out how he wants to know the importance. The work of his father, the old tradition that he would ever die. Also, the film analyzes his relationship with Er Mim, who is emotionally challenged and the problems of small society and the bathroom, not only their bodies, but also cleans their souls. The two main themes of the film, the family and the progress of the progress are very well maintained, and the point of the movie is not lost, the two themes are well developed and we are a glimpse of Chinese society and customs <br /> <br /> Director Yang Zhong simply tells his story Characters do the characters, the job. This is a very flexible method, but it is perfectly suited image, and I suspect that too much style will fit this good image. <br /> <br /> Acting is outstanding in its natural way, everyone works in a more intuitive way and looks almost identical. If they are portrayed by real people. These three main characters give significant performances and Wu Jiang as an errant Ming steal program. <br /> <br /> Although the film is "good old days better", the attitude of equilibrium, progress is good, and we must go forward, but do not forget where we come from and balance between modern life and old traditions. <br /> <br /> And the touching image. 8/10
