I'm a huge fan of Jet Li! He is the best HK action movie star alive ... and consequently - has rocked this movie! I saw in the video store and because it was in the main section of this main video store, I did not initially record its existence and had to see it twice. I knew immediately that I was going to rent. My only comparatively (I suppose) is not dubbing (AAARGh) and subtitle. And yet, one of the best jet lists of the film's original / strange / cool storyline and action is one of the best movies ... yet they fall under that category.
