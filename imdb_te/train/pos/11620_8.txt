Great little thriller. I was expecting some kind of crazy horror movie but none of our time to do what I got was a little tight thriller. Many of these images we have to rewrite the characters in the characters, so when we start killing people, we have a hatred or hatred. Here is such a stupidity. Yes you will see some characters but they really are interacting with the principals. Husband's wife was abolished in such a motorcycle. Let's see how efficient the new hotel clerk is, as we see them, how effective the Lisa is. We all have a small but important role in the film when all the heck is broken loose because we see a young girl. These flight attendants are essentially required to carry the platform forward. Particularly bad guy needs her at the start of the flight. The rare person in this movie is very important. Two young men who are on the plane are just 2 linear-only 2 characters that do not use the plot. That's clever because I thought I had anything with the plot. The role of a woman from the first scene is a young hotel executive named Lisa. Jackson does not even care when she's showing her true colors. She thinks what she can do to make her time. No other movie will be acting as smart executive ladies idiots. But this is not. This is a very small movie and I waited for the film to be shot, because the movie is going to come to an end. Nobody has used it. The new hotel is not known as the clerk and call her what she says and go out of the hotel without telling anything, ask your employer and tell her that she has too much to drink. Craven movies should do more of this kind. One last comment also. Brian Cox is in the film, but he does not have a clue for me. I had to come here to see that he was Lisa's father. He is totally unrecognizable.
