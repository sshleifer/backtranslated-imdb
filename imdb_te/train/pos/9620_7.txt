Most Hollywood movies can not be tortured now, but there is no bearing on anyone's life. Granted, movies do not always understand deep, but it's nice to know there are still movie makers who care about telling "human" stories. I do not give up the premise of this amazing movie, yet, screenplay is one of the most difficult and memorable ones I have ever seen in my life, and I'm also a 32 year old film buff! The bug in my favorite list is in the top, with only waterfront, Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus. This "moving" movie should be one of your favorites - that is, if you have a heart!
