The film is not a kung fu movie. It's funny about kung fu. And if Sammohan does not spend some time looking at the pictures of the great French comic film maker Jacks Tati (e.g., eg, Jour de Fethee) before making the film, he is in the same wavelength. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think Tatty's films are delightful; But they are not all tasteless. Some told me that he hated his work. <br /> <br /> However, Taty 's main shik - or at least one of the major shikak tattoos His finest - a proud steep microbial with 19th-century sensitivities The answer should leave him in the 20th century in France, it is defined as much by the perspective of a gradual shortage. He usually has serious problems with little things like record players or radios. He is in a car accident, but the world is not safe when he travels a bicycle. <br /> <br /> Previously, the nineteenth century has emerged from its internal identity that is more than 20 interesting. <br /> <br /> In the same way, a country boy came to Hong Kong's big city, believing that the city was interesting as Bruce Lee had done there Kung Fu movies. This little town is not recognized, but it is not considered inadequate in the big city - when he found the kidney in the street, a police stop him, while Hang was actually stirring up the water from his shirt and dipped in the bay when he accidentally dipped. It's interesting about this gag why it's so funny about what the police's fuss is about - in a country town, as long as no one is looking at you, if you go gotta you go. In other words, Hung does not really breathe in the street - but he certainly does - what's the problem issue? Hung's invasion with Bruce Lee of course gets him even bigger problems. He dismisses the gang of gangs refusing to pay the owner of the restaurant owner. In fact, in the film Bruce Lee, thugs are painful, and they will learn their lesson. <br /> <br /> In Hong Kong's Hong Kong, unfortunately unfortunately, and thugs returned to his uncle when he wandered around him. <br /> <br /> However, as always, Hong has finally succeeded. These characters always have some success in the comedy because they are totally innocuous and despite their comic mistakes and misunderstandings, they refer to what we really worship and the best of humans we are seeking. We can not really be Bruce Lee (he needs to experience the loss of all his friends before he is badly beaten), with our own innocence, really the heroine of Lee. <br /> Unfortunately, the world is in the cinema. <br /> <br /> "Do not worry. - And in that question we found Sammoho Hong in its best combination.
