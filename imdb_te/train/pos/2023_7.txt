<br /> <br /> I've seen a while ago on TV and this product is reminiscent of a lot of Beeb Costume Drama. I've done it again on DVD this week and have the same impression. It was a good story at first, but the heroine Oh so terribly brave and noble and weakens and she was completely back to her whale's husband when he was ill and I got completely bored with her saintliness. When I wrote this story, I thought it was "right to do" and it was difficult for a woman to be independent from her husband, and to treat her with a lover as she hoped that I would like to see a lot of modern audiences. But nowadays it is very difficult to bring the santimonialism, especially when this heroine is a strong, brave worshiper who is ready to defend her against everyone and everyone. So in the film I am equal to the hero. It happens according to the novel, but it is somewhat irritating to today's kind of life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So when I was with Helen for a long time to stay with him, the script did not allow him a little more than a minute than a minute earlier. We were all frustrated by the disappointment of the husband and the frustration of the good hero and heroines. Instead, film producers are not upset or out of time or financially. <br /> <br /> "You are here - a minute, you can do that, the director wants to go home ..." I thought I was completely dissatisfied. Toby Stephen's performance is a complete and very beautiful hero, and Rupert Graves is an amazingly evil and self-gallant villain. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald was satisfied with the limits of the script, which forced her to be more harmonious and substitute for the sacred victim instead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " So 7 stars still good watch despite the irritations.
