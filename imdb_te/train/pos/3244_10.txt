Namad 7 and I can not agree more with an HVR comment. A perfect laid back on Sunday morning film. <br /> <br /> But I'm always surprised how often I want to return to this film. I copied this movie 12 years ago in VHS, which was featured on one of those pay cable free weekend previews (HBO may?). Never heard before. It does not know why the market is sold well. ?? This is one of the first films I've replaced while releasing DVDs. Great combination of cast and writing. Plus, things in Montana's return to the return of the wilderness (heartfelt) do not harm. <br /> This is not the kind of comedy for all, but what? If the Adam Sandler type stuff is thinner for you, this is probably not your tea cup. This image requires your full attention. <br /> My next view is probably my 12th. But when I still get to such scenes as police cars start blowing off the hoods, I know I'll miss (the face of Ed O'Neill's face!). Recommended 110%.
