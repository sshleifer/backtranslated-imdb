I'm a production accountant in this movie, I had to do some voice-over work, so I was not completely impartial, but if it was awful, I would say that. I thought it was a pleasant movie, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, but anyway, but there was a lot to laugh along the way. <br /> <br /> The Bible says that many actors in the film have not yet reached their summit in time. This movie. Susan Sarandon, of course, is one who has gone on too great fame. Melanie Maran TV on the weekend day as a "thirty-somethin" TV drama series as a photographer. Robert Englewood later called Freddy Krueger, which still haunted people's dreams. One of my personal favorite actors in this program is Sheffff who plays Dab Taylor. He is a wonderful comedian, and really good and honest guy. We have fun at this event and I'll come through that fun.
