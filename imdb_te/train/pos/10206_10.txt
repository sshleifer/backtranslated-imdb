In my years of film festivals, I have seen many smaller films that never got the theatrical district and they end up $ 3 bags at Walmart. <br /> <br /> I discovered the DVD of the tank tanks, the great doc, but how sad it is to stay on the bottom of the rock. <br /> <br /> In this film, I have everything in the film. I liked the New Yorker Film title translated directly. It's good that the Americans are going to expand. If the film title helps the US audience to analyze the random confusion, it is better than all. <br /> <br /> Also, I have seen that subtitle prices are rising in dollars. Come on! The euro is not difficult to figure out, do gringo audience math. A shot in Paris, especially a shot in Paris, can not have a burning effect by reminding the viewer: I'm looking for an American movie and they translate me into euros. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to seeing these actors and more from the writer and director.
