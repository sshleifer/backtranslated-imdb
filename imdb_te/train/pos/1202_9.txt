I really enjoyed this documentary about Kenny and Spencer's "The Dawn" pitch for the pitch. There is a great idea how to try to get inside to make the outsiders bigger. <br /> <br /> The story is well-organized, well organized and well-directed film flow. Definitely worth a watch. My only complaint is that their closure has appeared. Perhaps that's part of that point. <br /> <br /> The film is also a great way to see Kenny and Spencer's personality outside of the Canadian television show. You can see a bit more to come. <br /> I'm looking forward to seeing the Papal Chase.
