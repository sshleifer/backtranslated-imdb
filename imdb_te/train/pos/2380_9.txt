I do not mind walking all. People really went back to places. This gave authenticity to Martinez technology for this period and some perspective. I was very disappointed with the effects, especially the "Thunderchild" scene, which I thought was one of the most exciting of the book. But the film was not much appreciated by the Wells to appreciate the film. It's about time. The actors prefer and the shows are lovely. This film is very valuable to hear Jamie Hall's great musical score. The actor is interesting to play both the author and his brother in London.
