MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great man. General Douglas MacArthur. This is one of America's greatest military figures, of course, and a person I know from the early moves of my memories. Despite the continuity issue (others may be), e.g. US to accept Thayer award MacArthur's speech to the Military Academy in 1962 said, "They will die of old soldiers die." This happened in the speech of Congressman Truman in 1951 to the Congress (which did not appear to the two eyes!) Gregory Peck Im-Peak, who had recently returned to the Philippines in World War II. The film moves quickly and easily to the general, his family and his crew from the beginning of World War II to the end of his service career. The film is an important component of the WW II and Korean War. Of course, Peck's role as a great man who faced dual evils of fascism and communism, and a person who hated war as a soldier was actually a memorable person. "There is no substitute for success in battle."
