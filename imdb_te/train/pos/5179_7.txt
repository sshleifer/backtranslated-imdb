<br /> <br /> Indian Summer is a warm, multi-colored film that makes the afternoon of the film (with a bit of editing). For a few weeks' vacation by the head of the camp, an elderly group from the camp's "golden age" will set the tone in full after spending time at Uncle Lou. The film then allows these characters to spend time, because they remember their time in the camp and create new memories in their latest deadlines. <br /> <br /> The film is a great success in all of its characters, and allows the room to develop them without worrying about the development of the plot. See these people, and their relationships with each other for the movie and why it works well. It never goes to the top and dramatic, always keeping its warmth, charm and realism. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia has never seen a well-captured film and I have always sincerely recommended that one of these camps have never been a baby.
