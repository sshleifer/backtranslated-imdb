You know that Clint Eastwood stars with the film Dirty Harry, not just the stars, but the producers and the directors. Some were the best in the series, but I totally disagree. In my opinion, the only dirty Harry, Suned Impact and Magnum Force are two valuables to stay in the series. Although there is a good deal of good pairing with good action sequences, there is no dirty and sandy effect on the three films. This film captures all the excitement that makes Clint Eastwood's film better, and it comes with quotes that make a dirty Harry movie better. It's in Dirty Harry "..well, punk?"; In the Magnum Force "A man learned his limits"; And in this "go ahead and do my day." Also in this movie, it's nice to see the change of scenery, as you get tired of seeing the old San Francisco streets on the other series in the series. It's the best dirty Harry sequel in my opinion, with great performances by Clint Eastwood and co-star Sandra Locke, and good direction by Clint.
