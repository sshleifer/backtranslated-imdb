Who's Horror is not an academic painting, huh? Thanks to this wonderful hammer small picture, I know you will now never offer a piece of wine and bread with salt at your own home at least one wine ideas and minds forever because he is just hypnotist and gives us the power to control him in this combination! Thank you Hammer! The tenth part of the House of Horror series, I'm looking forward to looking at, because Dan Sharpe is in the director's chair; One of Britain's best film makers, but still has not sinned. Sharp was responsible for some neglected independent productions, such as "Child of the Vampire" and "Someplace Images", such as "Rustbin: The Mad Mann", "Dark Places" and "Psychomania." The work of the House of Horror is one of the best of the series, with a complicated yet attractive storyline and delightful occult backgrounds. This plot stumble upon a strange object similar to a mirror on two antique dealers, but is actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to call Choronzhon; Demon Guardian of the abyss. The mirror is heavily desired by a Satan cult because they need it for their celebrations, but Michael is averse to sell before knowing the true value of the device. When he chooses an apparently solemn girl running from cult to avoid sacrificing, Michael is also deeply drawn into an obsessive conspiracy. The satanic traditions and young women's carnival sacrifices are typical British horror themes, but David Fisher's screenplay offers a lot of themes that are not frustrating and well-built themes, the most creative climax. There is a lot of tension to admire, dialogues are ridiculous, and acting performances are fantastic (especially the true novelty of John Carson's leader). Recommended!
