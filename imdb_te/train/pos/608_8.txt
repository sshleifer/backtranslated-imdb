Phantasy films are not always my cup of tea, because I'm slightly suspicious as seeing this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I know I'm for ride through the movie magic. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes starring in the movie Starla shines. <br /> <br /> Michael Pfeiffer is menacing as bent on an evil witch who captures the star for the eternal youth and beauty. Robert De Niro is a lovely character who gives audiences the comic relief for audiences. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was a surprise and enjoyable film fan. If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie is fun for kids and adults, Stardust is the way to go.
