I do not think this film will be released today. It takes time to display the depth of the letters and does not complete the turns and turns to keep the plot on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> But what is this picture: Study about how families can deal with a very interesting investigation. The language of healing and extreme loss can give us comfort, and we instead rely on raw emotions. Grief and anger without cause and patience, even hate. And unfortunately, the main character in the film (a young boy who kills and slays his brother during the hunting) is given more than its fair share. He eventually goes with his grandfather (Wilfred Bramley), and he is clear that he is in an accident. <br /> <br /> This young man knows in his heart, but I know this young man who needs to hear those words from his parents and receive their forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I would like to mention this film: lack of dialogue. Physical response and facial expressions have a tremendous focus. And the picture slowly allows you to really see the reactions of the actors. <br /> <br /> We can not do anything with today's movies. <br /> <br />
