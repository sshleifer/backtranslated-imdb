This is one of the films I've seen. For me, it makes it look great! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at the original Munjers series. While there was a lower slap stick, they still worked wonderfully together "ridiculous." For Lilly, I have more plot involve Ivane de Carlo. She has shown that she can make comedy in the original series, but it is mostly wasted in the film. The film also pretends to be a great Sid Caesar, but sadly he has no connection with Guinea and Louise. I think I might have got some good work out of that.
