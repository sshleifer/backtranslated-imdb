I love this movie. This is a great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist-type issues, such as girls who love to reserve sports for men. This shows the two hardships that seek to outdo the gender impediments appearing in Indian and sportsmans who seek outside the cultural barriers, especially during England. I think cultural fights are more emphasized than other issues. <br /> <br /> In contrast to other comments, I do not think this movie is like dirty dancing or any other chic flick. This action is loved by a variety of people, men and women, both young and old.
