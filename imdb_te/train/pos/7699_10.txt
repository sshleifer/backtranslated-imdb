The best example of Hollywood SF films. Its effect is more than a decade. However, it is quite a bit of a few things related to how the target audience of the fifties in the middle of this wide-entertainment entertainment program, and sometimes the slow progression of the film does not help. However, the compelling central idea of ​​the story, combined with the ancient, extinct Crowd civilization and "Ides from the Id", has not lost its appeal and the film continues to keep the corresponding "must see" image. I am more interested in speaking here. The present DVD for this movie is terrible. The film was never really seen on the home video and there was a terrible need to restore its elements. I'm going to do it soon and I get a special issue of this SF classic.
