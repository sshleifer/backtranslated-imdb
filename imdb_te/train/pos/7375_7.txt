Not the ring (or the ring 2) on the same level but still a good Japanese horror movie. I will take a page from the Japanese horror template of the North American horror producers and put more spoonity and less cheap shocks in their films. This is a good example, a whited out face scene is a young actress behind the scenery, photographs on a wall, just for a second, and more smiling looking. It is worth checking out that you like genre.
