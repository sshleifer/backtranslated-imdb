<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> The show started with the match. Kane V. MVP. It's okay. There is nothing about wrestling here. It's about visuals. Overall this is not bad. There were some spots filled with Kane, but eventually, Kane first won the fire again with ramming to the MVP. <br /> Nice opener. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long has announced a new match for Team titles: London and Kendrick fights against opposition: Regal and Taylor, The Heights, and MMM A Ladder match !!!! <br /> <br /> It's a whole carnage. Here are four teams judging by three, you can expect chaos. The spots are awesome. The whole spot fest. One point went for poetry in Jeff Motion and moved to London and hit the Jeff ladder! Shortly thereafter, Jeff mnm is going to kill Jeff, set on the upper cord with two ladders nearby, Matt saves and jepes Joey Merkuri to "see-saw" the shot! Mercury is hurt. His eye is quickly closed and bust the open hard way. Mercury is taken from match and Nitro still exists. He is going to fight alone for titles! Regal and Taylor then catch London and drag him to the ladder for the first time! Jeff climbed the ladder and Nitro in a killer spot, falling through the ladder to grab the jef. Awesome! Finally, the London and Kendrick Tag Team titles retain. <br /> It is silly. I can not recognize why WWE has not announced why. Buyrate grows huge. <br /> <br /> The mercury disappeared with the nose and the eye. He was in the hospital. <br /> <br /> "You know, you know, chris Benoit V. Chao It's a very strong match I enjoyed that Chao beat a killer superplux at one time! Benoit won eight German suplexes also hit with Benoit Sharpshooter. <br /> <br / > Helms V. Young Cruiserweight title championship Unfortunately, stupid fans do not care for this why Helms and Yang are very talented and wrestling, I agree with JBL, he has reached the crowd, and the JBL 100% is correct, Learn to appreciate or get this. <br /> Kennedy We The Undertaker-Lost Ride Match It's not quite here, it's a slug fest with some exceptions. At Kennedy's stage at the top of the Kennedy stage, the spot was fine, and the reaction was frustrating, and finally, Ticker won the match with the tombstone and Kennedy singing. Kennedy needs this victory. They worked for two workers. Still, Kennedy needs this victory. Undertaker lost. Creative gets up again. <br /> <br /> Stupid diva is the next thing. I like women. It's not. At least Tory is here. It will refresh. Judging from the audience, won the rhythm. WWE Ashley wanted. Consider your bathroom break. <br /> <br /> Main event: Cena & Batista v Finley & Booker T. It's nothing too. Cena v. Finlay and Batista v Booker. Batista and Bookers can not work together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. The end is corrupted. Finiley did not sell Batista's knees with a chair shot and Batista shot and finished the match. Lame. <br /> <br /> Overall, Armageddon has a low score, where the ladder is a major event. There was enough money worth it. Some others are solid. <br /> <br /> Last Word: Good PPV as a defender with ladder match. Smackdown is not a bad performance and is not adequate. Smackdown needs to stop letting you know along with the Cena tag. Let SmackDown stand on their two legs. This show proves to be a smackdown.
