This is a fantastic picture. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. It is very compassionate, very beautiful pictures, and things that are not too much compassion. I was totally entertained, and when I was completing the Tom Robins story, I was happy. Now I do not read this particular book of Robin, so I am just right now, but I can not imagine that this movie might be too bad commentary. The film has a great deal to define yourself who has the best part of your Dream Robbins novel. <br /> <br /> I do not think all of you, who have said this before a bad image, should leave your heartless light in your mind. So far this movie is dead. Long live the crane.
