I thought this film was a run-of-the-mill romance of 1930. The boy meets the girl, they fell in love, the boy loses the girl, and the boy eventually wins her back. That's not like that. Clarke Gabby plays his artist Edi with its general appeal and naughty eyebrow breeding. He hides from the bursting cops in Ruby (Jean Harlow's) apartment, where her bubbles are covered in the bathtub. Instant chemistry. She's hard to spend some time, but for a long time the girl can resist. The heat between them is clear, and some scenes are definitely pre-generated code! A blackmail job looks good and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for "troubled girls", she is painful and, thanks to her roommate giving her the ragging, Eddie begins to believe she will never be forever. In Harl, he definitely plays a hard-haired, fast-talking ruby. She'll never gap all the good lines! There is a moving scene especially when she plays "their song" in the piano entirely. Last fifteen minutes I cried every time. Really sweet love.
