I'm happy that this is now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not want to be less concerned or engaged in wit and fiction, this film is an excellent example of the success of content & style. Literary story you do not like this movie. The reasons for this are quite simple, but unfortunately rarely achieved: Matthew Jacobs has done an excellent job of casting the story of Catherine Store's novel 'Marianne Dreams' for a hero. <br /> <br /> The film's director Bernard Ross will allow the actors to use rarely. They indulge in the art of acting! It is a rare treat that the actors will follow the car in the camera lens, the eruptions and fire fights break them around, but in fact it does not. <br /> It's not an imaginative thinker and spoon-food tabloid reader - it's a solid script, directing and acting, depending on the weather, suspense & presumed horror. If classified as horror, 'Paper House' performance is more common in Sophocles' veins than Tobey Hooper. <br /> <br /> At the end, you want to be very big sounds, bursts, cuts, & bright flashing colors you 'd be looking at' Transformers', but by a skillful & remarkable use of narrative without insulting your intelligence by feeding your cacophonous nonsense diet If you want to find a suspense story that separates it is your thing.
