The film is totally ridiculous. The storyline is not only, but acting is horrific. Special effects are set in Assinen and in the posterior desert desert. Nevertheless, it was allowed to build a very entertaining film so far. It's 101 minutes laughing because of the fact that we all have 3000, or any fuel of any El Camino. Just because there are other items which I can spoil, because I will make the movies look great marcionic. I recommend this film as very simplistic. I have no idea who looks forward to this high quality feature, but a good laugh if you are what you need, watch watch of the Year 3000!
