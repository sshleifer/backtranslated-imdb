I'm Italian and recently I see this movie again I am surprised at its beauty: I'm the first 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can get the compliments with the minds and the minds of the elders. Now I am able to understand a unique period of Italian cinema (Passoini). <br /> <br /> Hollywood epic images are good ... for fun. The baby-maize and coke are not suitable for audiences because this 'Odyssey' is not enough for an English version. Suitable for Homer Pathos and Essential Reflections. <br /> <br /> The latest DVD version in Italy has been released: Integral, with amazing colors. You can find it in some file sharing, but it's only Italian and without subtitles. Very bad: the dialogues and voices of the film are also great.
