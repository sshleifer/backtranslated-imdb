A delightful delicate comedy gem, for the past five minutes, leads to a loss of British TV worship. Last five minutes it gave me 2 points in my rating. Despite this major theme and style error, it is worth watching the character acting and unique Cornwall setting. Many fine small bits of fun to go through all the waiting for the bank approval after the credit card swiped and made us very soft when we did not - not very precisely card maxed.
