Geo Nolan (Victor McLoglen) was poor on anyone on earth. In the 1920s, living Ireland, Zippo and his fellow Irishs were part of the underground revolt against the British. A special rebellion, the English wants to murder, secretly returns to the town. He feels he believes his friend Zipo, but the Â£ 20 reward proves very exciting. Zipo kills his friend and drowns in the pit of despair and alcohol. Meanwhile, other Irish rebels are searching for information. Immediately, Geo was the main suspect, but they, his friends, did not like to believe it, as he broke a hole in his pocket. The Informer story is very simple in its story, but it is critical in its moral and emotional aspects. This is one of John Ford's most emotionally involved films. Gopo is flawed, but we can certainly understand his intentions. We also understand his forgiving role and have a lot of sympathy for him. The script is also very exciting. The kind of suspense we all know about how everything ends, so our teeth will shine and cope with it. Acting is amazing. Victor McLaughlin, who has appeared in many of Ford's films, probably gave him his best performance (an Oscar for it). His or her splendor is worthy of each other in this film. In addition to the excellent script and acting, The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressive films. I love Ford's dark side. In its mood and in its themes, The Informer reminds me of my other favorite Ford films, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); This is equivalent to the Grapes of Roth (1940) in these subjects. 10/10.
