I really enjoyed this movie. Britney should be a magnificent role model for teens and more appreciated. The film follows your dreams and does not tell people what to do, discourage and criticize. Holly fulfills her dreams like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are times in everybody's life when others act as judge of those who do not have someone else. Seeing this movie makes you feel special in your own way and make you understand what happens to your dreams. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. She never knew how much it meant to me. Bravo Britney. You are great!
