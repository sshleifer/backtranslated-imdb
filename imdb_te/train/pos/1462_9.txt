In this documentary, Roger meets a factory's rich manager in China, which sells and traded beads and other trickets in Mardi Gras in New Orleans. The Roger Factory argues that girls love their work and thank you for the opportunity offered, but four of them show a lot of stories. Mardi Gras's overwhelmingly overwhelming contrast has shown the tragic lives of girls. Film producer David Redmon should be praised for having excellent and rare footage in everyday life within the Chinese factory compound, and on a compatriot-camera interview that sells and sell beads on the head of the American company. The film is clearly stated for its purpose as a window behind "Made in China" labels and clearly works.
