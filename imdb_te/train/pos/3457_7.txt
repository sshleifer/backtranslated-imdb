This is the first stage of his career, directed by Steven Spielberg, It's not sensational, but some of the great ones coming up for Spielberg appear in the film. The film is primarily similar to Spierlberg's 70s movies and TV works. So some characters show some quirkiness and I mean I'm not alone talking about the role of the Colombo. The 1975 Spielberg movie "Jaws" is perhaps the most characteristic character of the character. But unlike some small suggestions of specific early Spielberg elements, you can not call this movie - a good example of a rising director. <br /> <br /> The film looks good and is very good, but after a good start, as it has always been murdered, the film has become more and more obscure. It is a book without a lot of true memorable moments, because this is not a disappointment because it's a boring picture to watch. <br /> <br /> Murder is also very intelligent and has shown some great and interesting potential for a crime story writer who killed his writing partner. But this story does not actually explore all the possibilities. <br /> <br /> The film is still good enough to see Jack Cassidy's role in the role, which he thinks is very much a crime from his secret / crime. Writing experience and trying to give him all sorts of possible references leading him away from him. But Colombo is well aware and he is the first number one suspect from the first moment but he plays as a normal player. <br /> <br /> The film has a good overall style and some excellent camera position and editing. <br /> Spellberg's next work, especially for some of the camera-angles. <br /> <br /> Do not allow the name of a fine and complete viewable Colombo film but the name of Spielberg. <br /> This will increase your expectations for you too. <br /> <br />
