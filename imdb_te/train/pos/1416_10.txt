Earth must be seen for children and adults. My son is very happy watching these funny birds and snow bears. We can learn a lot from this movie and be proud of our great treasure on earth. There are some animals in danger of disappearance. That problem should be corrected by all the officials of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary provides many extraordinary images I have never seen. Then it will be accompanied by a heavenly music. The director did a great job of getting great respect. Nothing can stop me and my family for the highest rate. I hope the thing creates a sequel too.
