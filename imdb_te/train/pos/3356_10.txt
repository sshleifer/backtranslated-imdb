Eto'or is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I looked at a summer night "C'eravamo tanto amati": We liked it, but we did not love it as we loved "a special day". I believe that Ettore scores are pretty low: We are often forgetting to remember him because his latest films are disappointing. So, yesterday night, my mum and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, directing, cinematography, score and product design are clever and accurate, but the thing I like is chemistry between Loren and Maestroani. They have two wonderful actors and Antonieteta and Gabriel's lead roles. Antoniette is a housewife: She has a six-year-old daughter who is married to a Phasomic Fascist, but her husband wants another child to reward her family. Gabriel is just anti-fascist. When they arrived in Rome to visit Mussolini Rome, they spent a special day in 1938 on a special day. I do not want to spoil the plot anymore: I'm looking for this movie!
