I loved this movie! It's really bizarre, very funny, softer, witty ... it does not make sense to tell about the subject of the movie, then I'd give the result! You need to know what you know about it! Everything is connected and why is it. It starts deftly and they begin to roll faster and faster until they end up with the most frantic outbursts you can imagine! It's more fun to see for a second time, once you know "tricks". The actors are amazing, especially Evan Trojan, a true master piece whose final scenes! I highly recommend this film, which is one of the most original ones I've ever seen!
