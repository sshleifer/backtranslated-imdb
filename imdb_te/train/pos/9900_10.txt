This is like movies you like that you never chose to grow up in school. If you liked this movie, then I suggest you watch Valentine. I found that the person who played the role of Marty (Simone) made me die after he was released. I am surprised if he is part of the film. It starts when Carol starts to go to the girls' restroom to act as Carol is doing herself. When he was changing in the rain, Carols snuck into the bathroom with famous friends and got everything ready, camera, electric shock, pole. Marty realized he was satisfied when he opened the butt back naked. He tries to cover up the shower but kids open it and begins to understand him while grabbing Marty and rolling the camera. They chose him, killing his head when he was upside down, and they made him (a little) electrically. When the children were in custody, when he was given the coach, two of the boys gave him a joint and denied him. The teacher skips one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to forgive him. Pigging is in the Marty bathroom, combining some of the things that look like skip spikes and cocaine in the science lab, but do not know what it is. Lab will make him more intense. Five years later the children who suffered him received the old invitation papers for a 5 day school reunion, which exploded that day. Each one will die. I do not understand that the drowning girl really drowned. After leaving Martini she was able to come back. She almost came out for the first time.
