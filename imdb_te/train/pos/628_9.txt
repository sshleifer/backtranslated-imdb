This movie is very fun. The actors really make the movie go the distance though. Without giving up the theme, I would like to celebrate the newlyweds of the newlywed bride as a bride. You can see Robert Deniro total different in this movie! (Just Worth the entry for that entry!) From adventure to romance, and all the items in a well-kept comedy. <br /> All ages will enjoy it. (My parents too!) Good special effects, little ones may be scary. Good date picture. <br /> <br /> An A. (which looks better at the box office)
