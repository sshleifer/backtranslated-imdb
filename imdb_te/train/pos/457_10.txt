The show is very fun and the title song is very dirty, I can not get out of my head. I've found the older man I've got the crevices I've removed, and these four attempts are excellent in their efforts. Some things are worse than what they're doing, but it's a great deal, and now we can not make a real life in our PC world. I learn something from the shows. If you like mystery, drama, comedy and a little more forensic work, I love this show. Quincy, ME and Barney Miller work in another way and reminds me to interact with each other. They screw up so much but they get to work, and that's what counts.
