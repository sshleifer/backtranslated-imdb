The film was very unsatisfactory, even though she did Davis on the map, due to her spectacular performance, such as the illiterate Gutterspipe Waitress / Wesley Mildred Rogers. Acting is very good in every respect. I am not able to strengthen my life Philip, a sensitive, well-stomped young man constantly misused, and this tramp is constantly eating on him: I can not believe his innocence in some ways is ridiculous. Yes, I know he's a delicate club-footed, introvert intellectual. But Davis, such a tragic wizard, can cope with culture and her attitude or actions. Davis is shocked by her role: yes, she can now go down to her journalists, but it's a clear creative role in how you look. Too bad she does not play a gangster's mole. Her role was absolutely reliable in triumphs in low lives!
