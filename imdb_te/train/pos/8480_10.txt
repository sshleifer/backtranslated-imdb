Thanks to Warner Archive, I can see this unforgettable mammoth diversity, but the kitchen sink. (Bathtub, though.) The film will give screen time to every person who has signed to Warners at that time. If some artists are unaware of some, they are bigger in silent days and have long been known for the popularity of Tacikis. There are some really great artists from the instrumental era. You are more impressed with the Winnie Lightner, which operates two numbers. Also the French star, Irene Bordoni is a love song of croons in sexy love. Perhaps one of these massive versions is a two-strip technicolor "Chinese Fantasy", revived for this version. It's really beautiful and it plays Minna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, the huge "Lady Luck" finale takes about one-fifth of the hour. This is really an epic in the early talkie age. No old cinema buff will love this.
