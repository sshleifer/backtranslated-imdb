This is the special twists of two genres previously seen. The style of a huge monster with the mummy movie style of living. This unique mix makes a unique and compelling tale. The vowels are the best, and I never have ever been in the horror film ever since I knew Tommy Bosley. The impressions are impressive and the idea of ​​the biggest mommy filled with small mummies is cool. One of my complaints, I saw Mommy mommy, and some people think they did a great job. The dialog, characters and story is perfect. Acting is amazing. This is the best film from science fiction channel. I heard the best film from science fiction channel. I will do 10 runs for Felen 10.
