I thought ROTJ was obviously the best in three Star Wars films. I am surprised that ROTJ is the weakest instrument in many trips I've voted for. For me it seemed best to ROTJ because it has a very deep plot, very suspense, surprising, most emotional, (especially the ending) and definitely has the most episodic film. I personally like the Empire Strikes Back but I feel it's a bit less than ROTJ since moving slowly, not episodic, I do not feel too much suspense or emotion as I did with a third <br /> <br /> After reading these surprising reviews, ROTJ The reasons for the lesser casting of the other two are just simple and ridiculous. The reasons for the overall image of the low-ste. I heard a number of strange reasons: a) Yoda's death because BABA FATE died c) Defeat the small EvoLs standard bandwidth because d) Darth Vader was revealed [/ b] <br /> For each of these reasons I believe that I am losing a full point. First off, who die when Baba Fate dies ??? If George Lucas wanted to die, he wanted to die. Do not get me wrong I am a fan of Baba Fate but he has done some guest roles and Lucas does not mean that he is the central character in the films he has starred in. His name is not mentioned anywhere in the film ... you had to go to the credits to find Baba Fet's name !!! Determining ROTJ is a small character that dies because most people think ... Secondly, many fans do not like Yoda's dying. Sure, it's a long time in the film. I can not see him die but it makes the film more realistic. Not all the good guys can stay alive in a virtual movie, you know. This film would have been a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon tantamount if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys were killed. Another factor on this topic is about Yoda's death. People have not complained that Dibb Wader hit Abe van Canobin in a New Hope. (I think most of the trio is the best of the trilogy) Why obe van death is ok but Yoda is not ... hmmmmmmmmmmmm .... There is another reason I did not believe there was another reason I did not believe because people's beautiful Ewoks found the stormtroopers overpowering. It's totally ridiculous! I can not believe this !! At first, Ewoks were their native planet Endor, so they were familiar with the landscape of their home. If you have a number of strategies to look carefully at the movies, Ewoks used to defeat Stormtroopers have been used by the best use of their own grounds. (I hope you learned to use it for your life because you lived in the forest) they made lights, ropes, walkers and other traps. Many of the forest areas have been damaged because they are not counted and do not know about forest interests. They are only their blasters. To add, Ewoks stormtroopers are not as battling themselves, they have heavily helped rebuild a team of rebels in that victory. I thought it would be a great upset if I wiped out a combination of Storm Wars Heroes, the band of rebels, and the great acquaintance of Ewoks with the great acquaintance of their home landscape. Finally, if the scene is not yet unreliable to you, Emperor Strikes Back or A New Hope, where there are ten storm surges in the whole group of Han Solo, Cheabaka and a princess in the eyes of guns and heroes who missed their blasters !! And only, the heroes, of course, always hit stormtroopers with their blasters. The troops must have a very, very bad aim! At least in the Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Endor is incredibly believable because you have struck the two armies with one of the three leaders in a hurricane. Do not trust me Look at the battle at Cloud City when our heroes fleeing from the Lando base. <br /> <br /> When our heroes were trying to escape death star when saving Princess Lia and shooting at deaths like Han Solo and Luca <br /> <br /> The last reason I care to talk about is the most ridiculous way to spend time here) People do not want to disclose Darth Vader! Well, in many ways that movie is a big part of the plot. Luke is trying to see whether Darth Vader is his father, Annakin Skywalker. It was disappointing if Luke ended up seeing his father face it. Anakin's revelation has changed since Darth Vader's dark side (in his helmet) and the good guy Anakin Skywalker (by removing the helmet). The point is that Anakin has again shifted towards the light and that's what the helmet's removal is about the meaning of the scene. In fact, even if I was Luke's father in that view, it was not what you did if you wanted to see your son with your son before you die. Helmet. <br /> In another reference, a subconscious or conscious estimate among many people is that the sequel is even worse (although it may be good) that many films like the pre-movies ROTJ are qualitative. I always do not play that fraud in mind and I always try to go to a movie with a " I bow to myself thinking that it is not really good. <br /> <br /> I am not sure that I will criticize these films but I have many college students and adults tell me their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me (except ROTJ, a New Hope is a favorite of them). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I believe that the results are scary and misleading. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is the best of the Jedi Return trio. One of the three movies in this movie gave me just 135 minutes. There is no moment of boredom because every scene is curious, exciting, awesome or all of the above. <br /> <br /> Open mind is because if you look for fans with a little bit of nitty, tiny detail (or "another sequel") " Of course not! " Unfortunately, this fantastic movie, like the ROTJ, is another amazing movie. <br /> <br />
