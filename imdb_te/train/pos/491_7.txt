Its relationships are already couples on rocks and put them in an island paradise tempted by 26 singles. The launch of this show, the simple yet outrageous & funny. Leave the window out of the fax and allow the flow of adultery. It was like a real-life version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the program is that it's not about conniving to everybody for a cash prize & manipulating each other. This is the ultimate test for cast & temptation, pure and simplistic and a relationship. <br /> <br /> People loved or hated this program. It is kind of like slow to look at the horror traffic accident. You know that you do not see, but you can not help but see. Next to the play, there is a lot of eye candy.
