I still liked this movie because I want to help this person. I'm in my fifty and there are many friends in music business ... they want to become grown up .... Fans, groups, money etc ... and they're adjusting such a difficult time as a normal life ... as they look to get new bands etc Spotlight ... It's almost like they have to start anew ... this picture is 70 and 80's The old rockers go too .... now that is a testament to what the film is sad and nirutsahaparucukuntune. But this has left an old rock star and gone unreliable. Her weakness reminds me of the young girl who is home to Hallis MacLaren (painful) ... and she is a woman in a film that stands spirited for her. This film should be for folks in their 50s who saw the bands of growth and fall of the bands, people known to the members, and as they creep for ages, and the popular fades. It's an almost perfect picture .... But one way is positive ... because the whales. Must see!
