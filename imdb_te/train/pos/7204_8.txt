<br /> You have written Deathraat by Ira Levin (Silver, The Stafford Wives, Rosemary's Baby). It is a theatrical drama adapted to the screen. 95% takes place in a beautiful home of cinematographer Sydney Brul (Michael Caine). <br /> <br /> The playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), a dramatist who attended Sydney Drama Workshops by Sidney, was the author of the hit successful Broadway play in his life. He sent a copy of the play he wrote. Sidney tells his wife, Myra (Diane Cannon), the play is fantastic - definitely shot hit. But is it enough to die? Tell time. <br /> <br /> The brilliant dialog and many turns and turns are from the beginning to the end of the film. The whole cast feels good time. Another fun remembered by Michael Caine Mystery: Sleet. <br /> <br />
