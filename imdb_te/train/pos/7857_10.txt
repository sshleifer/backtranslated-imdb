The film also failed to participate and move to audiences familiar to only modern over-production sound and computer-enhanced technologies in 2008. <br /> <br /> In 1922, the film director should be a deep and satisfying experience in a movie with others on their big screen. <br /> <br /> The producer of the film is making a two-hour silent film and has the same tempo and balance. The silent film production was pure art, attracting attention through its production, direction and acting - no padding out of the words or the computer that created the computer. <br /> <br /> The film does not mention movies and is about to mention Christian themes. It is not a movie 'Cristiani', it is selling something. In this era it is often mentioned in the era of the present moral standards in these periods - the Sunday church on Sundays is a national past, Christianity is often given in homes, so the film portrays the normal life. <br /> <br /> It is very strange (and not only does it teach religion, but only the difference) In 1922 a representative from the film industry interviewed a large audience with a Pastor Pickford as an example of immorality, <br /> <br /> <br /> In 1922, he was with the other people he mentioned <br /> <br /> The Pastor Film Industry Church attendance dropped to 500,000, but in the discussion the filmmaker made the following observations: <br /> The saloon attendance also fell, <br /> <br /> This family is not a representative of a whole lot more than the actors (facts) Iga, to be honest, and it's a wonderful film about being willing to sacrifice. Mary Pickford, innocent, honest, passionate, full of joy and happiness, loyal, humorous and silent sacrifice - to represent the poor and illiterate, but she's perfect for the role. It's not a reprimand for our voice, but a little bit by the movie. <br /> <br /> These characters are slowly and modernly reminiscent of some of the modern Chinese films revealed in the movie. The tempo that creates a strong connection with the character. <br /> <br /> It also has a soft tempo for the first half to build all the items for the final section. The last 30 minutes was a great film production and it was appreciated by the lack of sound purpose, which led the dialogue - it was achieved through ingenious acting and great direction. <br /> <br /> It is sometimes surprising to know that at the end of the film you did not hear it, but you seem to hear everything. <br /> <br /> Great performances include Gloria Hope, Jean Hershold and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes of ordinary pickford's poor humor, when the snow swept away, went straight out with the perfect balance and ending. This is a distinct touching humor, it should not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> There is another special scrutiny of Silent films and especially the Pickford films. Audience is bored or frustrated, with more and more dazzling actors. Pickford is generally the focus of many films, but she still has not been able to adequately acquire her, and she has a good acting ability.
