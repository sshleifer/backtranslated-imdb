A WWII all-girl (almost) swing band is a beautiful little picture set in the UK about the reunion. Dench and Lynne have always been rewarded with the great "Tubes", and this is a good story for the funny story of the older actors of this funny story. The time is well spent and a pleasant watch for all.
