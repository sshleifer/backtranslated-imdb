Writing something real and true is challenging. It's good to know how to shoot it and keep it together without being alert. The image of Ishau Sarton is one of those you can spot in Life in its simplicity and beauty. I'm touching with "big bad swim" and from now on, I'll keep it up to date. I have nothing to show my friends, because it's nice to talk ... but it's good to look good. Not everyone can go to festivals to find pearls like that and this film is really worth putting there! Big thanks to the staff of this master piece, and I'm waiting to be delivered.
