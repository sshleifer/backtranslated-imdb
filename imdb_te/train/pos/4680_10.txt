Give it a chance to start cooking - a terrick film that starts slowly. The story is built on interest and complexity. All the right times for the letters and story subway waiting and click. "New York City", the overall image of the HBO / Hollywood concept of Sex and Relations, is an outstanding contrast to the amazing commercial breaks of "New York City". It is a rare picture of honesty and compassion of its characters. Loved it! Great cast with great performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and her girlfriend (forgotten by his name).
