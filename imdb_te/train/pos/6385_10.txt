This image is great! It is an excellent version of an ancient mythology. The animation is somewhat strange, but not new from Disney. <br /> <br /> Background animation is not magic. This is a different level of Disney people. Some characters are very small, but it is made of the aesthetics of the scenery and the stupidity. The music is a great tool, but it is right for the movie. <br /> <br /> It is not necessarily enough to sing the utensils. <br /> Perfect. 10 to 10.
