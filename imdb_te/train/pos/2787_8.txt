Initially, I rented the movie for my daughter because I was very interested in soccer - and was so disappointed (except for the plot that moved with soccer scenes). I feel like a parent I have a little surprise about the introduction of homosexuality - but these parenting these days are fully available to children in these days (I am inconvenient). This emotion is a sink in the main premise of the film - you should trust your children at their own choices at some age. The young British-born teen girl named Jassinder (Jess) introduced the dilemma of the East-Indian heritage that dreamed of playing professional soccer. His older sister's pending marriage in traditional Hindu marriage offers her great opportunities to explore her hopes and fears for her future. <br /> <br /> Many cultural challenges are an interesting technique to explore Jess's disappointment with her parents' expectations for her parents. <br /> <br /> In Summary, soccer scenes are very good (slow learners) and I do not need heroes - something is needed to continue the film.
