I enjoyed Long Street, which was followed in the stages of Raymond Burr's successful IronSide TV series, and was intended to give the competition. <br /> <br /> The show was canceled after a season - because I believe it was wrong - Long Street could not compete with Mr.Burn's Ironzide. <br /> <br /> The pilot for this show is particularly well and very memorable. Looks like a box set of Long Street. <br /> <br /> This story idea is only here explored and disabilities in TV.
