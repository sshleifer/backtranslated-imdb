When I first came, I saw in the movie theater and the audience are truly happy with this movie. These characters are a great cast, it has many big names, some of which are now identified so they are now. I think it's a great idea if I follow any of these actors or add them to your watched list if they like them in other movies. Some of the scenes remind me of the kind of full-comedy kind of like Bird Cage or Clue, the kind of odd sudden-looking comedy, with some really professional delivery from the fact that the presriceters are actually. In the culture of daytime soap, the film has done a great job, perhaps very realistic.
