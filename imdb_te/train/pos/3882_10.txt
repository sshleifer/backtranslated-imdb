I saw this tape and immediately pulled it back and saw it again and twice laughed hard. I strongly recommend those who do not recommend this tape, but it's uncomfortable around transistates. It's more than just one, it's a feature. Comedy is not a problem. This man is intelligent. All comics must have its own tendency, intelligence and talent.
