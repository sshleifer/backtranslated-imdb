The film (and yes, it was a movie - it was portrayed as a two-part parody, but two episodes of less than 2 hours) were one of the most memorable art works of world films. The Soviet regime and the kind of person who grew up under it, at the same time mannered completely well, and yet the book was a reliable follow up of the book titled Mikhail Bulgakov long. These sets were flawless, and director Monochrome took a spectacular view of the film in Sepia, adding a classic feel to the end of the 80s, with the washed-out color incarnation. I can not say much about the plot that the audience deserves to recognize himself, but the performances are the true Oscar material; Special references go to E. Evstigneev, who plays an old professor with such existence, gravity and gracious knowledge, and he stole each scene with just one word or gesture. Secondly, in reality the soul / shirikov, vi, tokoloknikov playing the horror perfection, is more intimidating than Hannibal Lecter, because he is only in real life - the whole country is driven by men throughout history. <br /> If it is a social political head, it is worth noting that the film is dark, even though the film is dark, there are many comic stories that make me laugh at me. While smiling in this movie, this feeling is not only joy, but also understanding and deal, it's always a plus. </ P> <p> The tone of minor defective intellectual / bourgeois snarborough I was caught up in "bright" letters at times. <br /> <br /> The film has been skipped by Western licensing companies. Although all cultural references and revolutionary vocabulary must be worn in the translation, the main themes of the cinema should be - one of the best rounds of all the rounds out there is rare and untranslated (which is a cry of shame that can not be too hard). While we were looking forward to crossing our fingers for the Criterion Edition, I was thinking of creating English subtitles. Looks like how it works.
