I really liked this movie. Three stars (Canary, Fishburn and Underwood) gave loyal performances and Harris topped. Some of Harris's scenes make lighting and shot angles look really dashing on his face. At the end of the plot surprising turn is interesting. Not a great movie, but an enjoyable one. I gave 7 out of 10.
