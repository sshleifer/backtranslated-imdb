In the next thirteen years, he had a history of Jean Lafitt from the Second World War (Dr. Wassel) about our history. In the first sequence of production, Gary Cooper was cast as Wild Bill Hickok, starring Jean Arthur as Kalamiti Jane. James Ellison Buffalo Bill, John Millen (not usually the villain) General George A. Custer, and Anthony Quinn is one of the Indians who fought at Little Big Horn. These villains were Charles Bickford (selling arms to Indians) and Porter Hall Jack McCall (who killed Wild Bill Hickkock). <br /> <br /> Generally, the history of America after the Civil War.
