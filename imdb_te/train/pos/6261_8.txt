A wonderful documentary of 1924. Today's early twentieth century is the strongest of geography in Iraq. See this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille does not take notes before making his ten commandments. Marian C. Cooper, photographer, and Cinerama created the idea that this was probably an idea when filming spectacular scenes. Werner Herzog fans find the film a treasure, with the struggles facing difficulties, and with the praises of their surroundings, there is no human ability to be clear. This is not true of these things, but the filmmakers themselves portrayed themselves, not just the will of things.
