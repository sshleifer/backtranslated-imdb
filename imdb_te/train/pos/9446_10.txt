James Dickey is a wonderfully detailed writer. When reading a "Deliverance", one is immediately shipped to Deep South's Lashback Backwoods. When watching John Bourmain's film version of the book, it is easy to see how quickly he summarizes the book's summary. The camera description is as detailed as that. The characters are fully absorbed, and the illustrations are awesome. In 1992, I first saw this film, after my first year college. I'm in a phase of watching movies that I released in 1973 for my birthday in 1973. Among them are "Patton", "Papillon" and "All the President Men"; Good movies, all of them. This group's class is easy. Many say.
