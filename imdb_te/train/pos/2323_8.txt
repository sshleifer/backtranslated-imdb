"The Man in the Moon" is a beautiful picture. It embraces most of the time and works well in all aspects. I can not say this movie is terrible, but what are these days? <br /> <br /> All the members of the cast did great work with their characters. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at a young age, and does a very good job. Jason works well in London. And Sam Watersston, the only person I have discovered, has done a wonderful job with his role. I really liked Sam's character (Matthew Trant) a lot. Sometimes he seemed to be the kind of father you feared, but in the end you really liked his role. The rest of the cast is great. <br /> <br /> If you are dealing with growing things and throwing you in life, you should watch this movie. If I read the plot summary and look like you're interested, go for it. Anyway, thanks for reading the movie, <br /> <br /> -Chris
