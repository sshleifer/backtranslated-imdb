As well as saying exactly as a glimpse of the divorce court in Iran, interesting directors of divorce and Iranian style are made by La Sisters by similar directors. Now they divert their attention to the court system in Cameroon, Africa. What's great about this court is that 2 judicial officers are women, which is exceptional for such a country. However, they deal with many people who use women to encircle women, but this film is especially relevant when women have recognized the divorce laws and women's rights, and have made great progress in society. So the judges often punish men to behave in an ancient manner during this period. Women who appear in court are not sensitive to treatment. One of the main points of the film is the abusing of a child who is abused. The judges do not waste time in meeting frier women. Who said that justice is no longer working? This 2 is behind the bench. They often carry maximum penalties! Ya! You go girl!
