<br /> <br /> This film is, in my opinion, it's flaws (I'm * some *), a fantastic masterpiece and a great and amazing art art. <br /> <br /> Here Mr. Becky has created a completely beautiful image and has shown the director of his immense talent and versatility animated films. The adult audience does not get 1/100 of his credit for literally saving literal art. If it was not for Mr Bakshi, I believe that animation is from the Disney attack. With Lord of the Rings, he has not just created a beautiful animated film, but he has created a completely new art form - unfortunately a lot never done off the ground too. Many people complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film (The use of live action films is used as background images and is often animated using various methods that appear in small amounts for animation). But I feel that people who complain about it can not agree with the art form. No, it's not Disney animation. This is not a direct action. No, it's not "cheating" - it's a new, lovely, and absolutely fantastic art form. The fairy tale as "Lord of the Rings" is so fresh and fresh that it feels absolutely at home. The basic use of this technique's preschool is to live the life of Middle Earth, a very dark and mysterious way, especially the darker of Tolkien's creatures, particularly Nazgul, traditional animation or direct action. Beagle's screenplay (which is very little, as I realize, in the early work of Chris Kankling) is a very reliable adaptation of Tolkien's works. As long as possible he will use the conversation directly from the novel and it feels at home in the world created by the bird. The first book and 3/4 had several cuts to fit in a single two-hour 15-minute film, but there were very few changes in the story. Lionard Rosenmann (also one of my favorites) is also happy with the time limits of the horn horse, the reconstruction of the Norse horse, but, again, with his time limitations (the longest animated feature), Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (Score is based on its LotR work) It is fairly and dynamic and I say It is an orchestra success, but when it comes to the pictures of the film, it enters the whole new world of symphonic perfection, so far it will change to many people from the Hollywood fare. <br /> <br /> Voice actors are awesome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p>  ్పన అందరి రుచికి తరచుగా కాకపోయినా అద్భుతంగా ఉంటుంది. కానీ మీరు ఊహించిన దాని గురించి కాదు, అతను / ఆమె ఊహించినదానిని చూపించటానికి డైరెక్టర్ యొక్క విధి అని గుర్తుంచుకోండి, కాబట్టి అర్గోన్ ఒక విలక్షణమైన అమెరికన్ అమెరికన్ అనుభూతిని గ్రహించి బోరిమిర్ వైకింగ్ ప్రేరేపిత దుస్తులలో కనిపిస్తాడు. This is probably not what you expected, but I have seen him for showing us Mr. Baker. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bucky is not afraid to slow down for a moment, and his skill is clearly shown by constructing an amazing tension. The artistic ability of Bakshi in this sequence and Tolkien's incredible work fuse should be equal. <br /> <br /> The recent DVD release by Warner Bros. (2001) is not bad. While we are offering our last thanks to the ultimately available image in Widescreen format, this package is very small. How wonderful it was to have a director's commentary, seeing the 20 minutes of additional footage that had been deleted for the theater release. Another delightful addition is animated after which it may be assembled live action footage. The DVD release included the entirely awful voice over at the end of the film, leaving the usual voice over in the film's final fame. <br /> <br /> In fact, the greatest tragedy is that this sequel has never been done. We can not see the explanation of Gondor's Baksh of Faromir's Shelob, the cracks of the Ducks of Eowyn's War with Witch King or Gandalf's confrontation with him. We'll never have a picture of Dashthor or Pathir's Paths of the Dead or the Dead. In the end, it's insulting than all Shams we've approved of Peter Jackson's Glitz and Glitter Hollywood Action Action version of these subsequent events of Tolkien's work, but I have no cinematic version at all <br /> <br /> David
