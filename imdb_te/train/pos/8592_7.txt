An evening is good for entertainment - but the plot is unbelievable. Garrison's affair with the first lady is true and passionate; The president cut out a cardboard. Who are the real villains anyway? Nothing has improved or not explained enough. I still do not know how they wanted to kill the president or how Mole was involved. The villains are unnamed and undeveloped, so you never participated in their plot. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland have done well to induce some realities in the story - chase and confrontation are good. But while Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria are unbelievable in their roles, Basinger has not completely lost character and Longoria is not a Secret Service Agent. This might be a very good movie but it did not get it to answer, with very unanswered questions. Despite some good scenes, the overall disappointment. And they used the 'West Wing' set for White House scenes? - I kept guessing to appear in CJ or Charlie!
