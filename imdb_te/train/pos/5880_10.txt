Contrary to the person listed above I felt that the scenes were really funny as this film has a lot to mix with the scenes. I did not want to give the plot and storyline to the people I have not seen before, but I would say that Paresh Rawal, like the late Priyadarshan films, Hera Pheri and Hangama, did not play a vast role. Paresh Rawal plays an outstanding role in a small role given to him by John Abraham, which Akshay Kumar has shown in the film is low, he has almost all of the films since Vakat and Andaz. Though the three heroines are playing the first time in the film, the Narikes acting is very beautiful. I must see this movie if you liked the hagamah or hera fare.
