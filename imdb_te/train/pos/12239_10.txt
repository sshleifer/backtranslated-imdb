Fantastic farce Which, in fact, is intended. Thankfully there is not a social or political message, nor does it have little effort in that direction. Plots can actually take, or at any given time or place? Unfortunately, for all, it's just, just cinematic, and movies come from speculation, not actually. The only intention of the film is to entertain, do not educate, and it is fun, the reality is thoroughly and thoroughly thrown by the wind. I think from most documentaries we will agree to assess the enlightenment and authenticity. For entertainment I am described as "no-browner" these days, which will be in all aspects of the game. Some chuckles and an instant laughter Now and later, this is a fine fare fantasy.
