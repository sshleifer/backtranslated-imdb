Stephen Raido is already a star for his tour de force in "Wild Reeds" and is one of France's biggest indie stars. In the film, a local boy named Seedick meets Matthew (newcomer Jamie Elkoy, a wonderful, active, enthusiastic performance) on the beach. Matthew had a complicated relationship with his sick mother, aunt and sister (who had a competitive relationship with him). <br /> <br /> The broken story of the film is - a small one - with a long flash spine, bits and current pieces and real-time forward-moves in the future. Director Sebastian Lifshitz does not indicate what time we are in, and the storyline is difficult to follow. But it stick out: the last 45 minutes of the film are engrossing in such a way that you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. If heartbreaking and uplifting, the film is to be seen with the movie "Beauty Thing".
