I chose this option in the 'Dark of Dark' box set and saw my interest in the performance of Hyde and Gack. I imagined a horror film with a huge gor-fest and a very bad conversation. If this was done in America, it would have been right. Instead, I worry about the good development of the characters, and the show (gaat) is developing through the film as a person. The two star acting skills are surprisingly good, they are not professional actors, the director has done a fantastic job, in the future minus flying cars and holographic billboards. On one hand note, the performance of Tarot Yamamoto is very surprising. The only role in the role of Shago Kawada is the Battle Royale, which appears to be opposite to Shago. Toshi was bright, exaggerated and hyper, working with comic relief through his antics. The hardest person on the island of Shago killed without thinking about it. <br /> <br /> If you familiar with war royal, let's look at his performance, you will be surprised at him. <br /> <br /> But do not mess with the back of the box because this is not really a vampire movie. It is just a picture with a vampire. The role of Hide's vampire is that there is actually a background of what's going on in advance, and you'll love the last scene. It's a really moving picture at some point, photography is really well done. This is perfect for you to pick the next time you are at the blockbuster.
