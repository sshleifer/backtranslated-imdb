During the season next season, players or characters in the show will be visible to the people you love to hate. Is this presentation or are they selected for it? Each episode exclusively insult a person and ends up killing him. You see that you are totally wrong and ill. To beat others, to beat themselves, to play dirty, to retrieve, to escape and finally to tramp out by trump. <br /> <br /> The rewards paid for lasting humiliation and suffering are also falling heavily. In new seasons, like "You get to meet xyx who'll lecture you about uvw" .. who cares frearing? Are the characters uneven and individually, do you wonder if they are actors paid? <br /> Be careful and preserve your conscience. These are your fellow humans in the gun line.
