A flying saucer with a group of 20 male space scientists traveled the earth hundreds of millions of light years and was founded on a 'obstructive planet 25 years ago. The earth is imaginable, beautifully and totally socially useless, and her father, a Hermit Philologist who was more haunted than the ghosts of the ancient civilization that he had built himself, the robot they found. <br /> On the surface, this story is a mask scifi murder mystery. Some have compared it to Shakespeare's Tempest, but it is a story and in some ways insulting Skiffy genre. It's a scene movie, sure, its tempest, but how many hundreds can you say something like this? <br /> <br /> Under the hood, it's a warning story about the progress and the social evolution of technology and its proper and safe use. Yet the film continues with all hope for our future, which we expect from shows like Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason that the film is so beautifully mentioned. Special effects, and aesthetics of backgrounds are as powerful as unimpressive directing and unparalleled performance. Although the goofy of the science fiction props in the 1950s is not for Retro-Art-Deco Ness, you might think you're looking at the 1960s piece. <br /> <br /> This is a very special sub-genre I would like to call science fiction for the 1950s, but in my opinion, it is essential to have someone interested in science fiction film and special effects. Its clever recurring intellectual plot through the re-use of Star Trek, Lost in Space, and the Firscape's six or seven episodes has now attracted the attention of the most attentive fans. Trekkers are particularly interested in the various aspects of the film, which appear to have triggered the themes of the original series of Star Trek 12 years later, although they (the relatively mild) were frustrated by 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind. I'm not nitpick, however, lack of manifest social progress in this film is a major issue I have. <br /> <br /> Some people watch the film to see some of the first cast of Leslie Nielsen, the youngest in the movie. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is just an average, and sometimes poor poorer ones (especially in the climax of the film). Walter Pigeon, despite being so amazing in other films, also makes his character more playful. MS Frankis, Earl Holman, and the amazing Robbie Robot are the stand-out actors in this audience, with the overall role of actors compiling a good job. I think there are no errors of the viewer and the editor. They definitely got a high part of the film.
