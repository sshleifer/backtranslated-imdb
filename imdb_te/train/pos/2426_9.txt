"Once in life" is a very good movie. However, it is not good for everyone because of the widespread use of vulgar language and the violence of certain circumstances. The film is called "Life" in the NYC neighborhood, where drug problems are important. This image is used as an instrument for effective and vibrant dramatic formation through powerful dialogues (although it is difficult to understand some of them because I'm not my mother tongue). Sometimes there is a bit of exaggeration, but I think that it is better for the general trend given to the film, which makes it more effective for reflexes than a good style exercise, especially during the time / action. The characters are simple, though simple, and the actors work fraudulently. I enjoyed the soundtrack (B. marsalis). If you are not very proud, you should see the film once, twice, twice. I rated the movie 9/10.
