... no plot summaries are read, because the plot is small, brain-dead and nonsense. The film is fantastic, both Denzell and Dakota acting (she's high on the sky, trust me that) are just amazing, and the plot is in the mind of the mind. A small word is actually "wonderful" to use for original talents. The film is based on just realistic facts and some characters are not fiction, a fact that attracts from the shock that I have during and after the film. If you like two actors and some disturbing movies, you still have not seen your favorite one yet ... Trust me, you will eventually have an unrealistic and irritable feeling. The image is awesome, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever ... do not miss it
