Dumbledore is not for everyone. It is actually a funny and collective cartoon because there is no one except Dumbland Lynch. Violent? Yes. Profanity? Yes. Absurd? Yes. The worst piece Never. Dumbland is a terrific picture of some Americans who do not hit the wife and children for brains and fun. I can tell you that I love it from Mexico! My favorite episodes: 1- my teeth bleeding around, the noise and violence around me make me tear and put me behind my bed. 2- Get the stick! Yes baby get it and learn a lesson: Some people thank you for your actions. 3- ants. Lynch episode of all, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge ...
