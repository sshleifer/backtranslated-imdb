Tell what you think about Andy Milligan - but I guess he's been confused by 10% if his family is also upset about it. Unfortunately, the video's print of the film has sex scene inserts, in fact the distributor has been shot to raise the box office appeal of the film. Milligan's ugly camerouck and silent film music will end several times, and the Millyan's wealthy actors suddenly find a good-looking stand-ins, and the psychedelic 60 guitar rock begins to do it. Unfortunately, it's easy if you do not take a little effort to make room for added sex scenes, trying to pay attention to Milagan's original film. Whatever is still left, it's still a perfect thing. I have seen a more hateful mother in any movie.
