If not surprised, he was disappointed, because the film was not appreciated. Once again, Billy Jane is more than just a Hollywood pretty boy in a poor performance, which has a tremendous slap with a poor mourning. This is a silent movie call because there is a lot of music and sound. It's a manic pace and Ed Wood finally finished appreciation of Goofy's inventiveness. Look at the cast list, and realize that everyone will shine. There is no one to show their face. <br /> <br /> But today, critics try to predict what's going to happen. To hit more than they show a wholehearted appreciation for a movie. And IWUETDID does not have a significant target audience. It became increasingly love for Wood's script. After his death, sophisticated social parasites brought him another serious blow, and lost a small classic world. It's really fun and realistic experimental film, which deserves to live at least on DVD.
