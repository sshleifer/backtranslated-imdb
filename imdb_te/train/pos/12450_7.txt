Rented and viewed this small (<90 minutes) work. It is the best thing to do in Modesty's film - and agrees to make her creator, Peter O'Donnell, a "creative consultant". The character, and she loves, we are respected. Spiegel directed him to be the best he has ever done, and acting very well. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect as a match with Modesty's original Jim Holgeye illustrations. She is an amazing person who is acting on him! Raymond Cruz as a young Raphael Garcia is also amazing. I'm Tarantino & Co. The series will go to do more - especially I find they'd choose to be unbeatable Willie Corvin!
