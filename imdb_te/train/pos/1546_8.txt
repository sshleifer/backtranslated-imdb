I was about 36 years ago (1969), which was one or more of the film. If I could now remember the bits, I spent a long time looking again. The parts I recall have, exactly or incorrectly, are confused gas and German spy Suzy Kendalls, and some clandestine sexual aids on the back of an enclosed truck to get military information from him. Music score is especially memorable and emotional in Gone with the Wind League, and I love to hear again and again. There should be some commercial or copyright reasons because the movie is not available. Why do not you know I have no doubt about the lack of quality or interest.
