Before the Kuzu, Lucky Devil is Dog. In 1978, the Halloween Night "Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell" was started. A new puppy (from a farmer living in a family and a vegetable-selling neighbor) is a family story because their dog's dog was killed by a skipper. Everyone loves the new dog, but there is something strange about him. <br /> <br /> It is not long until Mike Barry (Richard Creena, First Blood) is noticed. His wife, Betty (Yvevet Mimiakux, The Boys, Jackson County Jail, Snowbist), also has two children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourez and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and Professor, Hello Lorry, Tough-Turf) changed. Does the dog have anything to do with it? <br /> <br /> Ike and Kim make this film look good because they have seen themselves on the dark side of the witch than in the pictures of the witch. This is one of the TV horror films of the 70s really terrifying in the horror movie of the TV. <br /> <br /> This film also includes Ken Kerkel (Dallas Cliff Burns) and RJ. Amstring ("Devil Race" who was unable to keep away from the Devil movies? <br /> It is worth watching.
