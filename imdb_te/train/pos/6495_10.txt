From 10 to 10, it is necessary to watch the film clips from this magnificent, super documentary battle, which people have not seen over the years, which was not exhibited in 1974. Any of the image clips shot in this documentary from the battlefield, some of the clips leave me dumbstuck. The whole series of 20 episodes is long and Sir Laurence Olivier tells the storyline of the narrator and war. This is still the best documentary for the war, and is now able to make a tremendous punch for more than 25 years. Even though you have some episodes, you have to watch it for a while, yet you still have the documentary on the basis of this documentary impact and who died in the name of the war.
