I first saw the film because nothing happened because it was boring, but all the horror things died when the church died and life and the gaze and his mother died where Idiot Dad warned them again and ignored Juda, but he was not the best of Steven kings. I thought his best work was bright. I do not think people who see this movie comment on how terrible it is, because they all think what they think. That person can do a good job of making a horror film. I mean gauge bad and how Judd he kills the intellectual. One of the most innocent most unbelievable character killers is cooler. The movie does not like the dumb people all because it's a scary movie and nothing at all. Do not expect something from a movie. It is still not good in a normal area. I still recommend people to watch this movie
