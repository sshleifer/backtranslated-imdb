"Written on the Wind" is an irresistible, awesome kink film, because director Sirk was able to do this. The movie drowned in a bucket full of freudian icons, strange melodramatics and colorful contrasts. The relationship between financial success and mortal decay is the main feature of the film. It seems that Cirk is one of the side effects of sexual dysfunctional capitalism. However, I would like to see a film as what I can do with sit and kit material. Colorful palette is especially impressive. Acting in this film is great. The film was based on Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (which won her an Oscar Award for Best Supporting Actress), as Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall gave the brilliance of the most glamor and film elegance. The spectacular scoring of Frank Skinner's spectacular scoring, Russell Matti's amazing camera work (a masterpiece in every shot), and product design department. Also, the title tune is a beauty. It's an unforgettable movie.
