I do not have a problem with the movie, I thought it was very good. This was a distorted original LAPD crime scene video. The Lion Gate really wanted to see people who have died of death and blood loss in the general view of the audience. Sorry Lions Gate, It's a Weird Bad IDEA <br /> <br /> Returning to the film: Cast, especially Wall Holmes, especially John Holmes. John Holmes misled women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend), and he was deeply deep into drug trafficking. Relationship with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) created his dirt, which led to infamous Wonderland murders. How well did Holmes intervene in these murders? We do not always know about the whole truth of the story (Nash is still alive and free person), but this film does a good job.
