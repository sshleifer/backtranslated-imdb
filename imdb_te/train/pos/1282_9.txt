Many years ago, they saw the couple in the Sundance Channels, and the system had a good cinematic jolt. In modern Western culture (or lack) it takes a partial surrealist and more stringent edge, some seriously wacked, way-beyond-focusing on the Hollywood-edge inhabitants. It is an early entertainment performance from Marc Ruffalo, and some memorable cinematography from the DP made by Polish Brothers movies. A polite umcompromising humor and it is an unnatural original feel for sure to set it apart. This film is written over by Cult Classic, and I'm surprised not to have it on DVD yet. <br /> Hopefully soon.
