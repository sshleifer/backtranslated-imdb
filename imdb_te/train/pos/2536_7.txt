Remembering thirties horror films are always the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein; And there is a very good reason there, but there are small but yet amazing spectacular productions, and the invisible ray is definitely one of them. The plot is not particularly original and can be seen many times before the same plot (back in 1936) but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director Lambert Hillyer created a very nifty little original horror film. This plot is a congratulatory Dr. Janos Rukh; The man who found a way to revise the history of the earth. He leads him to believe that his discovery is believed to have an unknown radioactive element in Africa, so he works closely with colleagues to find it. However, tragic events occur during the trip and a good doctor reveals the element; It shines in the darkness and sends him madly. <br /> <br /> The film's biggest draw is undoubtedly, with its two biggest horror stars - Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and two incredible performances. Carlofe really shows what a good actor and has plenty of meat to impress his character Carlowe. Bela Lugosi has a very different role we have seen him and has a great show from him; It's nice to see a bit of versatility from Lugosi. The film begins slowly; But start picking up things soon. The second half of the film is really good and the movie is exciting and really is when Carlof (literally) gets a chance to shine. The film does not rely heavily on the central character's actions to keep in mind the larger special effects; And it works well. The film is going to be a very clever climax. Overall, The Invisible Ray is not one of the best horror films of the thirty; But this is very good and recommended.
