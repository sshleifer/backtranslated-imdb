The premise of this anime series is about the plot, a plot foundation on all subjects! I really laughed. The main character has a unique loaf of bread and he goes to the baking baking school. I want it to be available on DVD, it does not matter if it's subtitle or dubbed - it's fine. The theme song is also funny alone. At the time of the theme song, an African-Japanese man has an African-Japanese horse, a French long, as a samurai sword. These images do not understand if you do not see anime. You laugh at your shoulders. This is definitely the most exclusive anime I have ever seen.
