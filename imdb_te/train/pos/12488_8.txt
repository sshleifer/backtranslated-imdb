I'm not in all the pictures about horror movies, and I'm pretty much ready to see them. I do not mean that I like to see most of them or have no criticism. This film is creepy, and well done. In fact, I think this movie will make an exciting double bill with Session 9. <br /> <br /> I saw myself alone, and I must specify before coming to my comments. I started watching it before going to bed and it took me about 15 minutes before realizing that it was very effective, so I saved the rest for the morning. It is still crazy, even though it is in daylight. <br /> <br /> I can not be sure how effective it will be when I see in a large group. <br /> <br /> After the death of their daughter, the couple will go to a remote cabin with these deaths. Let me know about this death - this is one of the rare films that spit away from the death of a child. It is very important, it sets two tones, as well as describing a lot of action in the movie. <br /> This couple did not do well. The wife is out of his relationship, and the husband can try to bring her back. Some comments have complained about their acting - they claim they are more like a father and a daughter than a husband and a wife, and this is legitimate. He is trying to give her more direction. <br /> <br /> There are various types of fears in the film, many are rare but some are strange. The story is very straightforward to the film, and eventually takes an odd turn. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br> <br> <br /> <br /> "
