In the past few days, I've read a lot of scoop reviews, and I walked into the theater where I was preparing for a prefix from Woody. Happily, I'm not more wrong. In fact, Woody has slowed the touch or two, but Woody's writer / director was in good shape - finding a credible way to integrate his 70-year old self. To judge from laughter and sage, audiences eat Allen's one-liners and conversation that I have not seen in many years. <br /> <br /> Software-approved story arches, a movie scene owned by assembly-line formula fare for twentieth flavor and kiddies, is the way Allen has satisfied and inspired for his most personal and yet rewarding achievement.
