I liked the top gun. It's my interest. Predictable plot, good character development and storyline. It is very nice for High None, the town's people are weak and the villain is afraid to stand. There are some fine actors in the film, and they do not have the opportunity to share their talents with everyone. Some actors did not receive credit for their roles. Denver Pile appeared in his short days as a good man. John Dehner and Rod Taylor are the best of their roles. Sterling Hayden was able to do something bad for him. It is hard to imagine a drunken drink. Laura, played by Karen Booth, is a bored character. She saw that two men were fighting against her. The Hague. Finally, how can travel without luggage? Especially women.
