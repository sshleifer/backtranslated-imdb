I went to see Anton Fisher not knowing what to expect and was very pleasantly surprised. The job of acting by Derek Luke is the best and the storyline is amazing. Denzel Washington has done his simple job of directing his acting. You know that it can help people with mental problems and is a perfect example of this film. Do not miss this one.
