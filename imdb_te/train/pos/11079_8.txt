I can always see movies that you think, give answers to their audience. "Revolver" is one of these films, and though many critics say it's difficult to follow, I've got a bit concentrated and open minded. For the first time. True, it does not match to other minds such as "normal suspicions" or "memento", but its own intelligent and thought-provoking image. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really like about this film is how beautiful it is. Every scene, every camera angle seems to have thought about the ages. <br /> If you look at it, you will know what I mean. <br /> You end up doing this. If not, well, no one ever says "revolver" to everyone. And that's my 2 cents.
