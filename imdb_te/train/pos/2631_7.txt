The Lion King is a serious story about a young lion to take revenge for his father's death, while The Lion King 1 and half the entire opposition is mad and enthusiastic. The Lion King mentioned the story from the lion's young lion, 1 and half of Timon and Pumbaa's tail, unable to drain tunnels that left his home, because he had fewer friends and neighbors and a warthog with a smell problem than Maker's perfect duo left home. The film is a bit shorter than the subject, but it does work better with filling up with different sketches featuring Disney Time and Pumba, which is "Watching" the movie with us. My favorite sing is going to be halfway through the image along, make sure you see the bounce bug! Disney 1 and the half "The Rest Story", but this is not really. Without all of the serious stuff that has spawned much of the second half of the original Disney classic, The Lion King just has a different perspective. Credit Nathan Lane, like Pumba for their nominal work like Timon and Ernie Sabella, may not work without their efforts. They sing, they entertain, and they make us laugh. They also give a reason to prevent a hot tub in a warthog.
