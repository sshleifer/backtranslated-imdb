The British made the TV as a black woman, which was broadcast on BBC 90 'by Christmave Eve and again '92. I believe I made a round on American TV in A & E. It was released in VHS in Britain in the early 90s but came out of print. A U.S. The company later released on DVD, but the version was also sold. According to the book's author's website, the rights to the film are now owned and not released, and unofficial laws are sold in eBay. <br /> <br /> I first heard the message on the message about this message and check it out. I found a copy on eBay for 28 bucks. This is a duplicate from the seller in the east, although the DVD says, "made in Canada," ha ha. <br /> <br /> This is a good copy, and you can not really make the mistake of bootlegging labels in order to release items that are rare, from print, and lost in legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. It dates back to the 1920s, with all the authentic and avid British settings at that time. The woman in black is very atmosphere and darkness. For the most part, this film is very low key, but effective and scary. Self-determination does not include all of the gore, violence or special effects, but Black in Woman can still create chilling moments completely. It is a cool classic style ghost movie. The film also appears to be exempt from color in 1930. Without all the modern horror films, I fear that the film is a lost gem. For me, it keeps me one of my favorite of all time.
