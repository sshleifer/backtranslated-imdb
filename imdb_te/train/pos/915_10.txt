All the talents Mr. Suraj Bajatiya showed in his first 3 films, because I thought he was so bad that he was so bad that he was dying to his 4th one mainstream. But I have to say that I am not in an accident. This person is just as intelligent and just as wise as Vivah. This will influence you from the first scene. The scenes between Shahid and Amrita are amazing. The chemistry between these two actors gives those moments between srk and kajol. As always Alok Nath is wonderful as a good and loving father, so Anupam is Kher. But it is Shahid-Amrita's film. Most of the scenes are very nice. However, Shaheed looks a little younger to marry. This film will have liked to have gone through such beautiful moments in their life especially. All in an amazing picture. Hats for Mr. Sooraj Barajya ...
