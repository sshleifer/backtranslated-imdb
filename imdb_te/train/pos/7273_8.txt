Carlos Mercia this hour hour is unique. He worked hard to show that he was the real deal. I know people say that he is a stolen material in this special but this is not true. Carlos brings comedy as he wants, and does not want others to do it, so he is very good. He says he is not funny because he says dee dei, and they still can not understand as part of his action, and they do not want it, but he brings it up and laughs at making people happy. For all the rivals out there, there's a message here, Carlos is here to stay, there's no point you're trying to bring him down.
