It was one of the best comedy films on television at this time. It takes the sugar-sweet idea of ​​a show in a close family and converts to a more realistic and funny picture of a normal family with siblings and parent spots, brat brothers, over-produced fathers and bimbo sisters. <br /> <br /> For its credit, '8 Simple Rules' This comedy knows and does not make much effort. Many major performances (e.g., 'sister, sister' and 'lizzy mack gyr') think that its main characters are now young because they end up solving social problems and losing their humor through very hard-hitting. This is a trap '8 Simple Rules'; It solves some problems (such as being school age) but doing so is fun. <br /> <br /> Truly, it is really intense when John Ritter and his character's tragic death act as sensitive. <br /> Since I missed Richard, this program reminded me of her mark, '8 Simple Rules', and the second version of Kate's father Paul Hennes.
