If you have trouble dreams, you should give this image a low rating. <br /> <br /> These guys who are inspired by humor are not happy to all. <br /> <br /> The movie is good for those people! It plays old science fiction films and radio shows, most witch B-rated themselves. With spaceballs and airplane 2, you have to make some sense of your imagination to get comedy, but it's worth it.
