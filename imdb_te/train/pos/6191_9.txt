Hall Hartley's films are often hit or missed by many audiences. This film is no exception to that rule. At the time of the 1998 sequel to 'Henry Foole' of Fay Hart, this was the darkest of his dark affairs since Grin's actions have been pennered by Henry's ex-wife (always played to perfection through Welcome Parker Persecution), all about Henry unpublished books. In all these interim, fay ends up dealing with international spies, etc on an Odyssey. The film is quite a bit in the second half. If you're a fan of Hal Hart in the past, this should not go wrong. The first Timer of Inexperienced Heart, who only heard of his film making technique, may want to check out his earlier films before taking this one (especially if you have not seen 'Henry' yet). I admired the camera work, reminding me of some early man ray photography.
