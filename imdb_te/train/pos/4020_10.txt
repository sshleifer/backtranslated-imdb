Pinzar by Mr. Dwivedi is a fantastic picture. Its absolutely hearty and best in 2003. It has very good performances. Dwivedi knows what he is missing from MAST Urmila. It's like she's never seen before. A truly great show. Manoj Bajpai is also the best actor to have Bollywood with her. This movie is about a girl who lives in Pakistan (Urmila). She is from a Punjabi family Livin in a small town. She was kidnapped by a Muslim man as part of the fight for the Punjabi family. In the next few days, Urmila's arranged marriage follows a series of twists and turns. This film is really good movie. The storyline is solid with amazing screenplay. Lilab Dubby, Isha Koppicker (I can practice it but she can act along with Jass Dantin on Khallas), Kulbhushan Kharbanda and many others. Those sets with advance division Pakistan, clothing, cinematography, acoustics, background score add positive points. From the beginning to the end, the question is what is the question? This film is not worth a clunk but it is worth a part of your movie collection. The final scene is the last picture. I refer to all those No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-Dil-Too-Pagal-High audiences to see that spectacular film. My rating: 10/10.
