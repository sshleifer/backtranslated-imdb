I have been watching "Dick Tracy" for years and as a result this has become an important part of my life - it's with me throughout childhood and I've used it to see it often. Dark, satirical and very misunderstood - as an adult, this is a very good picture now. <br /> <br /> The only thing that the Pacific nominee Pacino has received is - it is rarely discussed and it has not been much fuss when it comes out. <br /> <br /> Pacino is Over-The - the best effect because he has fun loads. Beatty Dick Tracey is great and maybe better than any other movie behind the camera, perhaps I did not see the film to capture the atmosphere of the film Noir comic book. It is breathtaking to see a scene from the movie. <br /> <br /> There are some really funny characters like "Mumbai" by Dustin Hoffman. I do not think there are any errors. For all of the acting - the mandatory kid-role is much better than expected. <br /> <br /> Overall, a fairly good picture of the years after its release, and an average of 10.7 Critical reviews on average 5.7 / IMDb are very positive (check RottenTomatoes.com) and why it's hard No - this is a complete example of the comic book's essence, from style to eccentricity. <Br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
