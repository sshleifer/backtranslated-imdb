"Capitas de Abil" is very good. This story is not a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it looks. The story's fiction does not have great interest, but it does not spoil the movie. Captain Salgiaro Maya's heroic actions are not overly exaggerated and the film is a tribute to his work. <br /> <br /> In April the revolution was one of the great leaders of the captain Salgiono Maya. <br /> <br /> All the actors are good and the small characters are fantastic. Lisbon looks beautiful as ever. Do not miss! I liked this movie too.
