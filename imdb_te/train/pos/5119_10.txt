I say, this is one of my favorite films. I can not calculate the times I saw. I'm already in love with John Travolta, but for the first time he carries his body up, he's pretty handsome for Clean-Shaven Gillie's first trip, I'm afraid. Debra Winger, as always, provides a perfect show as Bud's youthful, innocent wife, but with the necessary attitude to marry a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you're not a country musician, this is not me, it sounds like every soundtrack with you every word. If you get a chance, please see this movie-it will not disappoint.
