I saw this film after seeing the Paltrow version. I realized I was a good person, I thought it was not good ... but I'm wrong: British version is good and enjoyable! I found Jeremy Norm more "agreeable" than Mark Strong, but I can say that holding the strongest Austin's knight of that strong. However, the two versions are good, but anyone who likes Aston's books should see this film. <br /> <br /> Andrew Davis has changed some things, but is still realistic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
