This Cecil B. DeMille epic of ancient West, Jean Arthur's finest performance, is a silly, unusual, abusive immortality, but dedicated to calcium jane. She really pulled it off! Gary Cooper is in his most hypocritical, but sometimes occasionally pithy sayings: 'The plains are large, but the trails cross ... sometimes.' This story is a cross to end all the passing. All cowboys of Western education are nothing but Jessie James. Even Abraham Lincoln person opens the story (or at least, DeMille will be so confident in us). There is no room for anything sensitive, it's the face stamp for people 'stamp' em. Of course, the film is a full front frontal attack on Eisenhower that eventually became known as a 'military industrial complex'. It's not a story about pistol runners, about weapons for anyone with money, and from the heart of Washington. But let's get into politics, let it go to Demile and guarantee that the satellite. The film's main interest is to use the first film to be composed by George Anthil after the film, which he is more likely to say about his job in 'Bad Boy of Music' in his autobiography. Antheil seems to have developed a 'big sound' followed by all the subsequent Western countries, so the plains spin in the sky with voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky, addressing open spaces and having simple melodic gaps. That does not sound so unusual, because we have heard a thousand times. But he is the first to appear in all of the sage brushes into this symphony of open skies, which entered the American mythology, and it is a soundtrack that has never been so different since then, but unfortunately not enough. Anthony Quinn is an early form of cheeny Indian. Gabby Hayes is there somewhere, but you lose him in the crowd. Gary Cooper broke them up, bumped up - but was he able to cope with a little?
