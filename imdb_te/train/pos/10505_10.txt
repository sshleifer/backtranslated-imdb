Yes, this is true. I strongly believe that both the N64 and the weird-looking controller are designed so that this game can be made. It was the first time I saw it, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and its amazing now. The play control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has the Nintendo charm, which is not always so unseen but is not rejected. For any N64 owner and for all there is a reason to get the N64.
