I have a lot of time for all the Colombo films, but this is especially well written and ultimately the solution is very effective. However, in my middle memorabilia, a scene began in the middle between the Colombian and the murderer (I apologize if I do not recollect all these details correctly). It's Columbus's most spectacular picture I've seen: from the inside of the cupboard where the victim is killed by the victim, and beyond the room, which is lit daylight. The hall is sitting in a high-back armchair that faces the door (and us), and meditating in the alarm, almost in the silhouette contrary to the light. No sound. The camera slowly goes out of the room and moves towards him. He is deep in meditation, shining in the cigar, looking smogs of smoke from cigar slowly. Then the conversation starts. Excellent.
