Although I did not consider the big fan of fairy tale movies, I saw Stardust Mille Pfeiffer as a villain in the trailer (especially she looked at her as Bussie Velma von Tussle in Harespray). Boy, with her ugly makeup in her beginning and end, is a very convincing evil where she is a witch! Robert de Niro is also the pirate captain who is forced to hide in "the room" to defend his "reputation"! Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many more actors now work better. Dance and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, while Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard) and Kate Magogan are special when she meets. The newly arrived Charlie Cox is the best Tristan and he has seen his father Dunstann a teenager who feels for him in early scenes with Manchwann (actually Ben Burns). Many comments are compared to The Princess Bride and I have seen some similarities, but the main difference is that with PB you know that it is just an imaginary story, as one old man told his grandson. Stardust You believe that for most of you, what you see and hearing is done with all the pleasures that occur throughout. So in that note, I highly recommend Stardust.
