Fox's epic words in America's great guiding efforts come with DVDs with some exclusive "extras". Members of the Mormon Faith (Church of the Church of the Letter-saints) in Salt Lake Valley 1847, after the murder of their prophet / leader, George Smith (Vincent), the Bruce Young ("Frontiersman" added to the European release) told the story of the great Pioneer leader Price), the US brought the curtain in 1940, just about to enter World War II. This is Fox Chief, Darryl F. Janak was daring, which was the breath of the fresh air of the Mormon people, which was the first film effort to demonstrate their loyalty to the screen. Now Fox, working with James D'Arque, curator of the magnificent motion picture archives at Bragg Young University in Provo, Utah, has brought the DVD to an outstading edition. Mr. D'Arque, who made his doctoral doctorate in the film a few years ago, provided one of the most commentary tracks for the DVD. He understands the fact that these films are appreciated by filmmakers, even though he divides the fact from fiction and decorates the set across the film. One of the fun bits dealing with actor Dean Jagger, who plays the title role. Several years after the film he married a Letter-Saint woman and eventually moved to LDS's faith. There is a lot to learn from D'ARK's knowledge, it's great to be part of the DVD! There are more than 100 images from Fox & BYU Archives on Drive, Newsreel Footage of the premiere premiere in seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks for another outstanding DVD FOX - And thanks, James D'ARK for your great comment!
