Jessie and Celine (Ethan Hawk and Julie Delpi) are two strangers on a European train. After Jesse spoke a bit on the train to take Selin to explore Vienna with him, both of them came out of a wide range of backgrounds. In the next few hours, Vienna has brought all the way to two cities, making it one of the most crazy with each other. <br /> <br /> This is a breath of fresh air for a genre that has deteriorated this wonderful romantic-comedy. Richard (Dazed and Confusingly) Ligletter wrote and directed the "short front cast" because of "Lee's" before the "Sun Rise" actually blossoms because you love their roles and have a fantastic appeal between the two. Smart communication is a must for romantic fans.
