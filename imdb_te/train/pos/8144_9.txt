I can honestly say that both the films are really a must watch for both "black hat's fame" and "this spin tap". In "Foolishness" you have a lot of times in Hysterics. No wonder two films are such a big cult. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. You must rent, but the only way to enjoy this film is to have it for you.
