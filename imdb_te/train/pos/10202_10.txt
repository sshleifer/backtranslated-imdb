I personally liked this movie and am alerted by some people of the rating given it. This is a movie based on a comic book and it's animated, if you do not like comic books or animation, you do not like this movie, so you do not have to watch and bother. However, if you love interesting, strong roles and heroic (sexy) kissing women and protecting the world (hell) you love this movie. I really thought pulling myself in the story and it's pretty cool picture. Adult animation is the most anime-esque or more like some American films after this new trend. Titan A.E. Live Action version of the Punisher to meet. In the end I will recommend this movie to someone who is open enough to look for a comic hub and a superhero fan or a fun movie.
