At first I saw this movie without knowing anything about it, and I knew Joel Schumacher did. One friend and I have gone to see Daniel Film Festival at the Danish Film Festival, which is a variety of films that are a lot of fun to watch movies that are not featured in Danish theaters. /> <br /> Anyway my friend and I have gone to see and it's amazing how it really looks and this really kills a cord with our feelings, we really are the plot <br /> <br /> The movie is reminiscent of the Danish initiative "Domoma 95" It was recorded by 4 Danish directors Lars von Trier (Dancer the Dark). <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the American GI <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell did not see before in this film but I can not wait to see it. <br /> <br /> Lars P.
