This movie appears to disrupt us. You love it or hate it. <br /> <br /> In this film, Tor Cruise shows have also begun. A painting by Imran's girlfriend - Impressionist painter. Paintings can be confusing since Monet's style is painted in small tabs, but from the distance, you can tell what the subject is. Cruise stated that the painting was "Vanilla Sky". I believe this is a reference to the artist. The film is like Impressionist painting. Impressionist filmmaker! <br /> <br /> It covers the painting of the film title. <br /> This is not your typical linear plot. It needs more thinking. There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and do not know exactly what you're going to always do. <br /> <br /> You have to focus on this film, but I think people make a very difficult focus on it. When it's over, you have to think about it. If you try to figure out what you're outing, you'll be overwhelmed by yourself. Just let it happen ... it's "go" ... put an open mind. <br /> I found the top notch of all the shows and thought it was amazingly unique, wildly creative, and spellbinding. <br /> <br /> But I will criticize those of you who do not enjoy you. This makes a specific taste appeals. If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thought-provoking, challenging, and spiritual movies, then look. If you'd like a little lightweight, skip. <br /> If you like what I describe you will surely enjoy.
