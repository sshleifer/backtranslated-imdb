Since the Iranian government has a beef, we do not want the US State Department to see it. Nevertheless, it shows how civil civilization really is Iran The content of the film is concentrated in the struggle of women in equal combat: the ability to see a soccer game at the stadium is strictly limited to male audiences. The film is ridiculously funny, and proof of freedom and expression in itself and in Iran. I loved this movie. Five girls try to spread the police border at a soccer match ticket gates between Iran and Bahrain. From the next comedy bus trip to the stadium, the police are very funny to interpret the girls in the middle and later in captivity, as a result. Do not miss this classic movie. It must be seen. One of the best foreign films I have seen over the years.
