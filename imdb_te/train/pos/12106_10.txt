Antonio Margaretti's "Danja Maccabra" / "Castle of Blood" is a strange, atmospheric chiller. It looks beautiful in black & white and it's an amazingly geopl√©e gothic vibe.Alan Foster, an English journalist with America's horror writer Edgar Allan Poe, accompanied by Poe's Porsche, is unable to spend a night in the house of Thomas Blackwood's exposed mansion Foster says. When the race is received, Foster is locked in the building and the horror begins! Atmosphere and hell from it to me. Cryptic sequence is really bizarre and tension is almost unbearable. Barbara Steel Bad Spectator Elisabeth Blackwood is very beautiful. "Blood Castle" is one of the best Italian horror movies ever made in the early 60's. A masterpiece!
