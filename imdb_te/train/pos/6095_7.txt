I'm a bit more controversial. The program is terrible, acting terrible (even when the original name actors like Brad Pitt and Bill Mosley are in an episode) is terrible, dialogue is moronic, and the episode / ethics of each episode is small in the 50's. From these episodes you do not have to worry for the moment, and Bob Saget's kind of Robert England's comical home videos are kind of short, meaningless and fickle. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is one of the most ridiculous televisions ever on television. 80 fashions and smooth vision actors appear all over the set of The Set of all times, giving them more self-imaging than the threats, so we remain in an episode with a high school boy. If his girlfriend fails her friend then dump him and his friend If the parents deny him, another she is a penny The naked mom (she played by her husband Brad Pitt) is afraid that she will be locked up in prison, all the other panicked another in the league against him in the world when he runs away from home, another she is her mother-in-law and her step-father is another fear she did not break Have a party in his home that is afraid to be confused with the couple Dug was killed. <br /> <br /> Because of these dreams, I think you can see the funniest plot and equipment, but they did not come out of the left field, actually intimidating the audience. You have the characters wearing like an 80-theme theme nightmare something rotating around making humorous decisions in hummy fashion and providing no other purpose but moving around making the distinctive decisions that move to the next weird plot point (usually looking like a peripheral character <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's been late (pretty much everyday) on its chiller TV, and I'm looking forward to it, before the sick curiosity, And now I can get good laugh every day.Arested Development and Extras Air of the Air The funniest thing on television right now.
