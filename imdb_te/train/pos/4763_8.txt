Unlike the other commentators, I'm appealing this film, with all its flaws and some actors' acting. </ P> <br /> As a technical expert, I have found these experiments interesting and hardware realistic. The computer is awesome when reading the minds of people, experiments are now managed to do so. <br /> <br /> I would like to see that these experiments are at an early stage, and the results are not yet favorable. <br /> <br /> The characters in the film are well cast. The girl looks a bit dumb, though overacting a bit. Truck driver is a ringer for real truck drivers. The minister first doubts (the chief investigator tells the minister that he is not sure that God created the man or created a man.) He returns when the chips are falling <br /> <br /> In the film, they are in line with their human characters, they are realistic They respond when they die as human beings Pramadalukrisnanga limited intelligence thriller, the movie, which links to the philosophy of the exercise of scientific leduoka enough to have a pleasurable thrill.
