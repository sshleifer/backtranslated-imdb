At the beginning of the 90's, it looked back and liked the cable. It has not seen it again until recently seen in the cable. This is still a great Vietnam film. It's not exactly sure why it's not rated. I found everything about this film structurally. Wet (not from Vietnam) relates to the circumstances I brought in both Harris and De Niro. This film can now be more sharper than our situation in Iraq. These cables are often used for people to see me. Human survival on our soldiers is not on the battlefield. The rest of them got home there. And this film is one of the many that brings home that way too hard. Wonderful picture.
