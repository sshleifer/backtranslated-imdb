Like most people, I've seen Jason Priestley on TV and I think he's great. But I do not know if I had a sister! Justin Priestley is just another guilty other than our "Vesta". A murder scene involving a good music, conspiracy, and Amanda's epidural doctor is an abusive doctor that you should stay for weeks. I'll leave it at that. Kudos.
