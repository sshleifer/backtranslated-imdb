I have read so many comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone will agree that I am surprised in the history of 9/11. <br /> <br /> I agree that the narrative is weak and that some are weak and unwanted. Another two brothers discovered each other after the disaster and cliff leaflet about Tony. But I do not think the play is unnecessary. I think our own lives are like commentaries like most theorists. We live and make our own autobiography. So if we say about our lives, this is always in the form of narrative. <br /> <br /> We want to keep history in the story so we know our story well. . We can recognize in the form of a story. When we say in the form of a story, we can better understand what happened in history. This is therefore the purpose of adding a story to the documentary. The story is weak, so it's gone, but we understand what's going on. It was ill with my brother about my illness. <br /> The second point is the blockbuster film about it. True, it's about to come with a larger image about 9/11. However, there are a few things about the subject, but none of them is like this documentary. Will there be a movie in 5 years? I agree that making money from 9/11 is wrong. But I agree that one of the best way to tell the history of movies is one. How many films did you see about World War 2? If I do not see these pictures, my opinion of the WWD is completely different. I remember seeing the Schindler's list, and I cried for an hour during class. Movies give you a good picture of what's happening in history and it helps in the memory of disasters and deaths, even if it is fiction. <br /> <br /> My opinion: It is not always bad to tell stories, it can tell us with the story, and forget about what happened to us.
