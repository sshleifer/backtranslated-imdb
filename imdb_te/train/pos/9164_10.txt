I recently saw this product on DVD. This is the first time I saw it since it was first broadcast in 1983 and I was fine as I remembered. For the first time, it appears in the old fashion and is much smaller and more verbose after the BBC serials. (I miss the wonderful dress plays that seemed always on Sunday afternoons backwards) but it's near perfect as it is next. This is my favorite book I'm a "Jane's Iron" Purist little and I've never seen another book that is reliable in the book. As I recently read this book again, some of the conversation should be seen on the spot. Rochester questions John when he finally read the scene, as St. John I saw, their words were reproduced correctly and perfectly by Dalton and Clark. <br /> <br /> All other productions made of everything seem to be in some way, leaving some of them to leave the "reverse" family, and Jane has contact with them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Casting is accurate, Jell Clarke Jane is depicted in the book "Small Plain and Dark" and I did not agree and she looked very old. Timothy Dalton is a bit more beautiful, but perfectly as Rochester, to correct every aspect of his character and acting on his socks! When he is slowly turning around in church when the marriage is interrupted, I agree with other remarks that are also very scary when his expression strangely threatens. But in another favorite scene, his happiness is good when he walks the stairs on his stairs in the morning and goes into his hands after announcing their love for each other. Amazingly portrayed love and totally reliable. Oh dear such a man! When Jane comes to bed with her dying Helen and Rochester takes up shopping for her wedding ceremony (I'm in it but when I remember my memory tricks) <br /> <br /> If you see another product of Jane Eyre, you will see it just perfect!
