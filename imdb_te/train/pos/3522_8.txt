Not a good memory image from this noir era, but it has some great performances from a great mystery plot, general Nair atmosphere and lesser known actors. Robert Zoidak, a talented director of mystery / horror classic 'Spiral Staircase', filmed the film two years earlier and attracts the viewer, showing a true skill to create a dark and breeding atmosphere. Phantom Lady focuses on Scott Henderson; He is a married person who is unmarried. He picks up a woman in a big hat in a bar of one night, and agrees which strings attached to two fun night 'pair. Nevertheless, police officers found his apartment and returned home and realized that they were there because his wife wearing a voice with one of his necks! The jury sends him naturally to kill his wife that no one has seen her with a mysterious woman. But fortunately, her beautiful female employee gets on the case. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " In fact, in the Forties the black and black color is not the fact that the Phantom Lady is an Italian Giollo! The central characters are of great interest, with Alan Curtis giving a good role to the unfortunate victim, Ella Rhines is effective as a female detective. The true stand out of the film, Franchot Tone, offers a memorable performance as the frantic villain of the character. The film is also in the role of supporting exceptional Elisha Cook Jr., the drums in the film's most memorable section. I criticized the film, and I would say that the identity of the murderer has been revealed earlier - although the Phantom Lady has some credit for it. The ending is satisfying and everything makes sense (which is excellent to consider the plot line) and overall, the Phantom Lady is definitely one of the greatest and most underrated noises ever made!
