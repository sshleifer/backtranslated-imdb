When I first saw the previews for this film, I got some shaking. Where is VH-1 walking in space? I mean, Harris and Quinn can not really see the sound like John or Paul. But I have to agree, this film will surprise me. This is a long way from predicting the predicted image. Instead, it's a study of the character, less-key, strange, ultimately friendly, and the final lesson we all learn: even if it is not impossible, once we have what's been compiled and what we have issued.
