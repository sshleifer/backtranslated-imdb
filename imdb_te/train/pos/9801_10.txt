The original animated Dark Knight will return in this Ace Adventure movie, competing with the coolness of the masque of fantasies. <br /> <br /> Batman has a lot of style and intelligence of mystery of the bottleman than Batman first or Batman and Robins. <br /> <br /> There is a new crime-fighter in the streets of Gotham. She's dressed like a bat but she is not a grown-up girl. And Batman rejected any affiliation with her. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne has to deal with normal love and detective work. <br /> Penguin, Bain and Local Mob are more complicated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this case, we have a lot of things to do. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ Some great features (small 'Chase Me' is awesome) and a very cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack but I did not get it wrong ... cinematic pan and Batman: The Mystery of the Butt Woman is drawn and shot at 1.85: 1, but this DVD is featured at 1.33: 1. I find this very annoying consideration presented in the Mask of Fantasy Anabarinic Widescreen. Warner has literally made dozens of movies on DVD with a complaint <br /> <br /> I would give this DVD 5/5 but the lack of the OR lowered the overall score to 4/5 This is a shame because the Wide Screen is full of a great DVD package.
