The Angel Duchess of Zero Mozel and Harry Belfontan team to present some interesting shows and material in The Angel Levine. It's an interesting twist on the themes from it's a wonderful life. <br /> <br /> Zero married Idi Kaminski, both of whom were in New York for the poor Jewish elites. Montel is a tailor and proud of his business, but behind him and arthritis prevented him from working. Comminesky is very good. He reduced the application for welfare. In desperation like Jimmy Stewart, he cried to God for some help. <br /> When he earned Henry Travers, he could work differently, but Stewart also suffered the travers. But the Travers got him a thing, he's been 100 years away from this dead coil and all his relationships with things on earth are gone. God is very different, and Harry Belfonte, who died recently, handed them some important training to the angels. <br /> <br /> Befonfontane did not agree with his life, still faced many problems. He has a wife, Gloria Foster who does not know that he was hit by the car at the beginning of the film. You got good controversy with the fact that you have problems with his problems and the difficulties of the mastel and you can not believe in a black Jew named Levin. <br /> <br /> It was a few years before nomination for actress Ida Kaminski for Polish / Jews, nominated for Best Actress in The Shop on Main Street. Other prominent character Irish actor Milo Oshia is playing a good Jewish doctor. I remembered a Shia broker from the verdict, and I was really surprised to hear him from a piece of doctor. <br /> <br /> Angel Levin increases interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this community. It was created by a stellar cast and of course the acclaimed author Bernard Malmud. Make sure to catch it when broadcasting.
