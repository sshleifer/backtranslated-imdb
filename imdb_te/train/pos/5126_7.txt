John Travolta for Urban Cowboy is one of the strongest alpha makers on the big screen. He made his promise to his uncle Barry Corbin promised to leave his parents 'homes and work in Dallas' big city in his petrochemical industry. In the 1980s, there was an increase in America. Texas is definitely a growing area in the USA. <br /> <br /> Travolta does a good job while caring for the audience about his role. Sexy Pig. He encounters and marries Debra Winger on the same background, but there are some ideas that women should not be shadowy people. <br /> <br /> When she hit him at Gille's mechanical bull, it was a man game for him. <br /> <br /> Gilly's former offender Scott Glenn is the breakout character of the film. He is a real snake in the Urban Cowboy, he just gets the goat of Travolta with the look and he moves in the winger. Travolta Gilles starts with Richard with slippery Madeline Smith Osborne. <br /> <br /> Despite the characters, the Urban Cowboy is the biggest commercial for the world's largest honeysuckle tank. Gilse's position in the suburban Texas community of Palladena is missing, but memories are live. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is that it features an excellent score in the country / Western songs. I'm not sure if some of the songs did not leave specifically for Urban Cowboy, but the only reason I can think of is why the Motion Picture Academy is ignored by this film's musical aspects. <br /> <br /> I especially liked Johnny Lee's Looking For Love, which was specially written in the film, a disgrace that was not nominated for the best song. <br /> <br /> I loved the role of Debra Winger in the film. She does not recognize femininity, but she is standing in the travolta style. And this review is still dedicated to being an unknown woman who will be the first woman bull-rider in one day professional bull riders.
