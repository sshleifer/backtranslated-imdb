I thought the ice age is a wonderful movie! A woman 30, without kids, I still really enjoy these funny, witty animated films. Sidah was a good character I've seen for a while since I was more than a Bartok in Anastacia (I'm really joking, I thought his character could be played or hit) and more ridiculous than Melman in Madagascar. I've seen at least 15 times the film (I've got it clear) and I've done the job at the cinema (in many cases ... yes, still). My favorite scene is where Sid says, "Oh, Oh, Oh, I love this game!" And Sid and Manny will continue to figure out what's trying to say about "tigers" ... "Wolf Pack, Bears Pack, Oysters Pack, Measam Pack, Nose Pack, a Der Pack ... Lies Pack, Truck Pack, a Tile, Birds Pack, Pack ... "or that part goes! Although it is the funniest part about the whole movie, although I really enjoyed "placing sloths on the map" and the humor behind many other episodes. The only animated film "Brother Bear" that can be remotely similar to Ice Age.
