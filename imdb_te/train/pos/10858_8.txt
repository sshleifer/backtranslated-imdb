Enjoyed the film and the efficient Confucian crime play, no doubt that the old Order Brush represented the danger of a young Greedy man, the modern society represented. I thought the final scene was fantastic and did not mean that we believe that big D is punished for being greedy or believing that it is part of a long plan. I love the scene, once in the Chinese movie, violence is not a dance-directed martial arts festival. Always disgusting about HK films is that the main effect for the British is that 'Yes Sir' and 'sorry' entered into the local language and it still remains as we go.
