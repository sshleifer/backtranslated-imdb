"The Metadore" stars Pierce Brosnan as a gray out murderer. He is in the James Bond seed, very tight, garish clothes, golden chains, and an ugly haircut. Our struggling murderer, Julian Noble, is in Mexico trying to get back his nails. Desire to stay in the same hotel, down-on-lock businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) tries to recover his equilibrium. <br /> <br /> In Danny Deliver, he closed a deal with his wife (Hope Davis) and was disappointed with the good news. <br /> <br /> Noble and Wright accidentally became friends. Wright convinced Nobel to expose some maneuver, and he performed with a bull. Noble will eventually be performing at Denver to target his employers. <br /> <br /> Writer and director Richard Shepard performed Q & A after this delightful film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepherd also fell on his luck. After his agent lost and recently rejected the scripts, no one decided to write the story that no one could buy and create that role. Pierce Brosnan was called. Brosnan will recover his balance in the film. (Bond is life after that!) He has a fantastic skill for self-frustrated comedy. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Wait for closing credits to read what the filmmakers think about Bullfight. I look forward to more projects of Richard Shepard.
