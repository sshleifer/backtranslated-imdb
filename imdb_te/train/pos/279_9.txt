I love this game that you can literally go out of your seat while you're playing. When jumping up and unveiling the screen, when you get it hit, its realty at the same time keep in mind that you just do not want its game and your stay there. Sound effects and audio are excellent. There are weapons and different spells and you can also choose to typing or doing typos. You will get this stone that will hit the enemies when you meet again to explode your enemies with more magic. The best part is the whole time which you play is what you might really jump and afraid of what could lurk around the next corner or you might jump behind. If you want to enjoy the full experience, try playing with the head phones.
