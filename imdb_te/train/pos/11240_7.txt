The low budget Brit pop plays a girl who wants to become a star, turning into one, and then finds quite a bit of everything. The good cast and the sense of time and place you can not hide the fact that we have been here before. Many scenes are a bit fainting and a lot of sounds like O'Connor's voice mini mouse! After this film she was immediately disappeared - so life crept up! A must see if you want to see a punk version if you are a star punk.
