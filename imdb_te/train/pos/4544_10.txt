Okay, I know I should not like this film but I will do it. From the romantic commentary of Pat Morita of a Japanese stereotype to Joy Leno's annoying Yel, I laughed in the film. As long as you consider it not the best in the world, it's good Mvie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My favorite episode is Morita is talking to her boss in Tokyo with a second drink close.
