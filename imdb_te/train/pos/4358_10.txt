Okay, this film probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" to offset the misleading rating from some of Bozo's who gave zero or 1 star reviews. The great possibility and promising of talented filmmakers in every department of this compilation ... these three went to achieve significant success in three big-time Hollywood productions. The performances are tough until the complete turn of Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Shilling and Bryan James are impressive. Martin Cov Bj√∂rrow may be a major dramatic psychological hypnotist with Straub-Lamp, and Lance August is deliberately a lab victim. But overall, it has some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments. Definitely worth seeing, so judge for yourself!
