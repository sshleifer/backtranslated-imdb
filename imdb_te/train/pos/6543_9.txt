I read Nancy Drew all and read it when the books are lifted. I loved the effect that the line drawings in the movie scenes were used at the end of the movie that shifted to the scenes in the movie. A good way of pointing connections between picture and books. For example, the scenes with the Oriental antiques dealer are reminiscent of many scenarios that I recall from books. I thought Ned was perfectly cast, and Emma Roberts was a fantastic 21st century explanation of Nancy Drew. (Just like Betty Crocker picture, she keeps her time!)
