This is truly a trilogy of 3 of the short stories of Somerset Moum. The first is The Verger, which is about 15 minutes and is very enjoyable. After 17 years, Albert Ferman was dismissed from the Church's job because he read and could not write. What does he do? <br /> <br /> The second is Mr Noon-Annie, a story I read for school six years ago. Another 15 minutes one, and very good. It worked better in the film than in a book, but it was only the last time I was 14 years old. <br /> One third is almost impossible. The length is about an hour, it just drags. It's not so bad, but it's not too late. I saw the first quarterly bell, I missed the last quarter hour, and it was still in the sense and I could not escape <br /> <br /> Overall, I give it 8, 9, and 10 to 6 respectively.
