"The Kennel Murder Case" starts at a run and does not stop until the end. Everyone has a reason to kill the victim and many have tried. William Powell is an amazing person like Philo Vance, Gentleman Detective. Mary Astor refreshes herself as a niece-on-niece to marry her Scottish gentleman and her legacy of happiness. The film mates with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you have to rent a disc (or check it out from your local library), do this. It's pure entertainment!
