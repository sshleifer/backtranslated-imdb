Because all the negative reviews of this film I have not seen almost. However, I was surprised that it was a very happy horror film. <br /> <br /> That performance is great - rather than a wonderful Alice Craig - but some of the conversation ("Just consider your meal.") is very fun. <br /> Stephen King's attempt on the whole - 7/10.
