"Going Berser" is actually one of the funniest candy films I've ever seen. Sure, it's a low budget, but it's a non stop comedy tour de force. There are millions of memorable tons. For example, when he asked his father how much he would earn, Candy says "Oh, I pull it from thirty to mid and eleven thousand dollars, sir." Oh course, the delivery of the candy that it sells. Only classic stuff. Eugene Levy is also a delightful performer of a serious filmmaker. <br /> If you are a candy fan, I can not adequately recommend this film if you want to redo the forgotten gem.
