The lamentable past (Henry Thomas) comes from a sweet-skinned young mountain man coming out of the woods with a left-handed baby girl and instantly falls in love with her. Although local tempros (Cara Seymour) do not think a little about the new family, urban adults generally support him to protect children. Parallel stories that luckily meet the little girl in a long hike and a vast traveling salesman (David Stratheren is his worst). This is a lovely slice-of-life, "The Lilies Bloom" & "The Dalmaker" in Ozark's same vein. Three beautiful scenes were filmed in the hills and covered by simple living lives - but not the usual mindless - not the American folk. Strong language and brief but showing violence makes this one of the most secure family views.
