The most moving and really created eye opening documentary. I cried the whole way from beginning to end. Looking at the show, a man will soon take possession of the fight to live without pain. For the first time I heard the title, I was almost scared to watch the program, and it was difficult for me to be in everyday life in my life every day. I really felt him. The most attentive part of the documentary was when Johnny circulated his coffin. Can you guess it? In addition, despite his inhuman and incontrovertible pain, he still opened his charity. (Debra) Johnny, the only person who deserves true respect and appreciation, is the definition of a role model, what a real and true leader he is!
