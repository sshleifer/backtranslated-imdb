When I first saw Ice Age in 'Sikaya Cinemas', I returned in '02. I was 13 years old at the time, but I also liked it. <br /> <br /> How many years have we been in the video and have seen it many times, never boring. At this point it is due to an element that is different from the other 3D animations created by it - the characters have a special 'home' that leaves them. <br /> <br /> Also, each person on the surface seems to have put each other together, but they're really good friends. Also, all the characters have their own charms (even the bad guys). Sid Sloth is beautiful in his annoying, overly affectionate and simplest sort. <br /> <br /> Manny is adorable in his depressed, reckless role, and so forth. <br /> <br /> Another great thing about this film is the beauty of the animation. <br /> <br /> Another factor that sizes of the film is that the gender is very small. No female characters are rare, but you have a slight impact on what you watch the movie until you see it a few times. For this reason, there is no mention of a nuclear family that is really disorient in the background of the ice age. <br /> <br /> Ice Age is a great movie and the attempt to put a 3D animation in front of Shrek 2 and The Incredibles.
