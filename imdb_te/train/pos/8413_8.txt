A stupid young man is engaged with a woman - discouraging him to lose perspective and general knowledge. An evil sorcerer approaches him and tells him that if he agrees to give anything he wants in his room, he can give him a great wealth to win the heart of the lady. The dumb man accepts and the magician steals the image of the man from the mirror - and the bad things happen naturally. <br /> <br /> If the film takes just over a decade, the film's review and score are very voluntary. After all, the plot of the film is a bit stilted, at times a bit unclear and acting. However, when you think "full-length" movies are rare in 1913 - and often only 20 to 30 minutes!

So, given time limits, this image is pretty good and one of the previous horror films.
