Just kidding, I rented 12 Monkeys because I was a huge Bruce Willis fan and I heard some things about the film. Some are good and some bad, but one of those movies you got to pay attention to every second, so I was a bit worried. Because I felt like one minute if I was going to be one of those movies that got to see several times to get out. But I have seen last night and I am really impressed, this film has everything in it: action, drama, science fiction, history, dark humor, and even a little romance. All of the actors did a fantastic job, giving Bruce a lot of credit, and in the scene of his psychiatrist car, he really came to me. But Brad Pitt, I'm amazed how excited he's done a great job. He is not crazy to his role, and it has worked and is very believable. <br /> <br /> James Cole, formerly a virus, has killed 5 billion people, and only 1% of his population survives. Even though humans are below the animals now below, scientists have sent James to the late 1990s (which actually means sending him to 96) to learn about viruses. James entered a mental institution where he met with his new psychiatrist Dr. Catherine Rilell and another psychologist Jeffrey Goines. He tells them the future, no one will believe him, and will go back in the future. But send him to the right year where scientists are kidnapped by Dr. James, but he tells more, and believes in him. Now they are trying to prevent the virus from ever happening. <br /> <br /> 12 Monkeys is a wonderful picture. The story is very scary, as I said, because we believe we are far from that probability. But the whole picture is great, cast, sets, just the whole picture is the greatest one. It has a terminator type where we lose one day valuable item if we do not listen to others. What's wrong and what's wrong? Who knows? But I highly recommend 12 Monkeys, and I'm sure you will enjoy it if you give it a good chance. <br /> <br />
