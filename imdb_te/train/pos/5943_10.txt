This film is great. Every thing seems to come out of the comic book. The sets, dresses, and plots are great. Clark Bartram is our favorite Batman again. He looked a bit better at the end of the dead, but he still pulls it off. Superman is very good. The flying effects are ok. But because of its favorite movie we feel great. The shot with the car caught Superman is incredibly believable. It's cool. If it's true I'll definitely see an image. That's got everything you wanted in a Batman / Superman film. Even if it is an exception, I will wear the Joker instead of 2-face ... it's a great movie because it's 10 for the whole movie.
