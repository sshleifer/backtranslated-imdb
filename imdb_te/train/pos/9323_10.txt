This film is very powerful for me. I want to be a spoiler, but I have a friend a couple of years ago; We're like brothers. <br /> <br /> I can not vote for this film. I can not vote. <br /> And I still saw in the statistics that were there. <br /> Try again tomorrow (sms) <br /> <br /> I do not care about the small flaws, it's the relationships between the characters that I got pretty cast and the real conditions. <br /> <br /> A small gem of a film Just like "Spring forward" is another discarded gem. Key to writing about the relationships between people, writing well and opening with the first level acting and directing.After all, what is not it all about?
