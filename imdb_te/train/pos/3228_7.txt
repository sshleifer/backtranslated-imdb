<br /> <br /> David Webb People meet Paul Anderson ... If it is unreal to you, it's right because this is correct. <br /> <br /> Anderson's first successful film was a violent thriller, which he used to paint these images in Bladerner, Anforgivenen and his screenplays pretty much Beautiful. . Surprisingly more of his other movies! <br /> <br /> People's script is very clear in the first half of the film. Trained soldiers from birth, taught to kill, and never have a normal life. They were replaced by good, genetic engineers and Todd, one of the original soldiers, left on a planet and left for the dead. Where he has to face a group of refugees, others want him to hate others and there is an interesting play here. <br /> ... New soldiers move on the planet for a military exercise and try to kill people. Large, violent, loud reaction takes place and People's script becomes Andersen's Action Fest. It is difficult to believe that the script actually wrote that way, but the final product is good as I expected. Once the action starts, somewhat, although a lot of approval, thought-provoking and exciting. <br /> <br /> Rated R: Very violent
