Blackadder 3 is probably the least Blackdard series people have heard - it's basically the second and fourth ones and there is nothing revolutionary in it. But it's still great - Wellington's fiery Duke and a fat fool doctor Johnson (English first author of the dictionary) will have to calculate this range. The series's more joyful one-liners are distributed and historically accurate and enjoyable parts will bring humor in the lesser known era. Blackdard's third outing was not very popular and well-known, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a Stutty Prince was a funny and effective and Hugh Lorry was his best in the series. Very nice! 9/10
