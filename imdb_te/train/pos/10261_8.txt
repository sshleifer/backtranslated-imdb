For the first time, this is not considered a very intelligent and thoughtful inspired film, and most other critics may compare it. The first review says something does not know anything about horror cinema along the lines of this, obviously the other way around it. If a film is to look back after it can not really be convincing, it is a low budget ipecac. But really aiming for it all, it's meant to distract the viewers away from the perfect shock value (and its flaws are the original VHS versions are less noticeable). <br /> <br /> "I can not sleep and torture because someone believes for a week)
