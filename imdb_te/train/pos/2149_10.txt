Everyone in the cast, we know from Sukiyama to Ako and Toyo every day. They are very natural, and Suzyama's transformation is very believable. The score is so moving, it brought me tears. Choreography is beautiful without having an athletic look. Maui's lovely dance and attraction gave me goosebumps. Tamako is such a wonderfully joyous character. If you remember what she saw "King and I" you can almost see the attractive school in her face. The character of Aoyaki is both joyous and pitiful. <br /> <br /> Masocho is very naturally confused wife, and you are actively seeking her to be right beside her. <br /> This film is really a keeper.
