In my opinion, in the early 90s, there was a high point for historical drama. The Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy and the last couple of years filmed a distinctive passion and intensity during their time. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a unique and spectacular passion. It really is everything - interesting story, great acting, great dialogue, and breathtaking scene. I am impressed by the obvious dialogue. <br /> <br /> I can imagine how the 18th-century people spoke and behaved. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by the characters that I am surprised. Even more subtle than what appears in modern-day movies that are set in modern times, it is more subtle and shocking. <br /> <br /> The film is unique and most realistic during the epoch. <br /> <br /> <br /> The pace is very tight, strongly disappointing. Very keen and political sublevels were very complicated, but they did not remove them from the main storyline. <br /> <br /> This action is very well done and persevering. The most striking thing I've ever seen is that there is no soundtrack in the highlight action piece in the movie. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy has always been on the list of favorite movies. This makes for a long, exciting sequence. I will recommend to everyone.
