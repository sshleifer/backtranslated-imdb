Finally, I set up a mail order DVD because I did not have movies available in the stores. I love Christopher Me and I love small, often discarded movies because I chose the anti-Soldier option. <br /> This kind of treat! In this part we have such a charm in me. It's easy for a pigeon hole, you'll see him as his Alter Ego Eliot Stabler (LOSVU). <br /> <br /> In this film, even though Millet is a staunch mid-life, he skips skids in many ways to find a way to make him unexpected. <br /> <br /> Barry (Meloney) and Tim Busfield's character are realistic and not complete. I did not see Busfield for 30 years and was fun to see. But it's all Chris film. <br /> This is a little slow in the beginning, I agree. I thought some of the "flashbacks" could be edited. But overall, this film will delight you - male or female - it is an honest, refreshing view of relationships today.
