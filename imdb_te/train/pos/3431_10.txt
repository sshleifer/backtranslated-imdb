The best Estonian film I have never seen, though made by Finnish director Elkka Jarvi-Lautouri. An entertaining thriller about a group of gangsters trying to steal a large scale gold, the national treasure of the Titan Pimedas Republican Republic. But at the same time there is a summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries. In the early 90s, many nations like the Soviet Union and Estonia became independent. Now those conditions are good in many countries. But in the early 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime, and the Soviet era left them legacy. (And most of them still do at least some level ...) <br /> <br /> Taline Pimedes is the most original film of the time with reliable characters and well-written script. The actors are very good, especially Jury Jarvet (perhaps the most famous Estonian actor, played by Snarr in Solaris of Tarcovskiy), a tired, tired player of his life and old gangster. But the most awesome actress Monica Mehr, childhood actor Terge, comes from a young child in her early teens, a girl that is very much needed. (And her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb-credit list !!!) w / <br /> At the same time there are not many movies featured in the entertainment and artistic world. But Taline pimedes do that. Jarvis-Lautouri's other films are far from this kind of achievement. His first, Kotia Pan is very artificial and his latest, Made in History is just a strange mess.
