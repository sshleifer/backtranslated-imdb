China O'Brien (1990) is an attempt to make Cynthia Roth rock star in the United States. The Golden Harvest Production was made by famous director Robert Cl√©es. Sadly he loses his touch because he's either lucky to enter the dragon or he's not the greatest of the director. The only reason for watching this film is to see Mrs. Roth Rock and Richard Norton's fighting skills. <br /> <br /> If the film is directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it can be a classic classic action video instead of a cheesy simple video action movie. <br /> <br /> China O'Brien returns home to help his father. He had trouble with the local mob and he needs help from her. So she returns home and restores order (with the help of two people). <br /> <br /> If you're a big Cynthia rhythm fan, this movie is for you. I enjoy fighting scenes, the rest are the worst. Why the Raymond Chow Shell out some shekels and appointed a top-notch action director <br /> <br /> Recommendation.
