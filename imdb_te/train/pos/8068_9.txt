Because the movie is very bad, but at its best it is good because it does not necessarily mean that it is almost a form of action, "It's old", "It's old", "It's a classic", "grace" This is a movie. It's a classic, if a tarnished one. I do not like to laugh at people anymore, but I'm very annoyed by the principle and others. In my mind is the joker of Informer if he is dipping his orange juice on tablecloth as much as nudging an idiot sane. Yes, he tells himself, he is an idiot, and he is a true monk even when he is on his game. This is true for the same Informer, it's really scary, yet it's fantastic photography, some good acting, excellent score and good, nice story. At the end, I have to give away, politics, religion and mentality together, in a church, the scene seems to be corny and upward, and sometimes in life. Uneducated people of ordinary faith behave differently (probably intelligent) modern people, and the scene is not very unbelievable (I bought, but I know Irish). And people behave like that, they say such things. Not everyone is hip, it's not good for everyone to be hip. Are the people seventy or eighty years ago great? How about I do not think so. We're different. Watch the movie now.
