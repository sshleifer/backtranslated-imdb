I really enjoyed this movie and it's a little harder when your brother stupid comments in 30 seconds. But I enjoyed this film because I used normal HK action films. Most of the movies like this do not see for the story line, look for null action. And the vacuum operation is correct. You can see jet lee jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets. The film was released to a wide audience after Lee Lethal Weapon 4. It has fallen in ratings in this film. Many imagined to see a movie that was polarized as a North American movie. But most HK movie budgets are not nearly as good as the North American film, and the style in the HK Action movie is generally quite different in wire work. If you want to see a good action movie you should try to ignore it. <br /> My rating is 8.
