"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow (Love, Duchess in Shakespeare) with her or painting, her friends go down on her chariot and tell hello to the people in town and she is trying to get to know everybody. I have no movies, no television in those days, and girls but there is nothing to gossip. I read a little more. I love Gwyneth, I think she is a lovely girl. She is a skill, and has a right to hear Gwyneth sing in "Emma". I'm looking forward to seeing "duets", where she wants to sing. Emma Thompson's sister, "Miss Betts" Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Dancing at Lucknow), she was daring to speak to all British Englishmen. "Mrs. Elton" Juliet Stevenson (really, Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most exciting actors in 1991. Gwyneth is part of American film royalty, director Bruce Paltrow (St. El Chota) and Tony Award winner Blighty Danner (Myth of Fingerprints). She will be hopeful for a real time. Lucky us! I liked Emma and I would recommend it too. This is one of the oldest stories in those days. Favorite scenes: playing Emma and playing the piano. I especially love it when she sings a duet. Favorite Comments: Mr. Knightley ": Emma, ​​you did not ask me to contribute a riddle." Emma: "Your whole personality is a rarity, Mr. Knightley, I thought you were overly excessive." Miss Bates: "It leaves us speechless, I speak too much, and we have not stopped talking about it."
