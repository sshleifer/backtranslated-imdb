The frightening, well-made chiller is the worst murder of the deadly murder and the evil forces. <br /> <br /> A small town doctor tries to find out who is involved in violent sexual assassinations. <br /> <Inbus a terrific mystery, some horror murder scenes, one off beat and a strange weather twist build. The murder scenes are intense and scary, so it's not a movie to be frustrated with the little things! John Huff's direction combines to create a dark atmosphere that runs through the film, along with a bizarre musical score. It also has a kind of gothic vibe. Nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight. <br /> The cast is not bad either. The great John Cousewates makes a great performance as a new doctor in town. Kerry Keane is a violent psychoanalytic young man like local reporter, Helen Hughes, town historian and Duncan McIntosh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> **** Out ****
