Okay, I do not see very horror movies - and the reason is the films like 'Dark Remains'. I caught this one (a surprisingly featured DVD) DVD and it scared me crazy. <br /> <br /> However, the next day I was telling someone about it when I realized that I only saw 10% of it. The rest of the time I saw the pizza on my coffee table - my girlfriend caught me when my eyes closed my eyes. <br /> I did not try to see it again, so it was very difficult. <br /> <br /> Film production is rich and the characters' situation is really compelling. The simplicity of the film is really capturing my jump-button - it's just a forest area, a cabin and an unused jail - and very dark. It's a surprise to me that this is not exactly a multi-million dollar product, but it really looked at the effects made! Moreover, the film made a great love of filmmaking. Sound design and music have never really made use of my ambient system like many Hollywood movies. I saw the film online to win the LA Shriquest - a truly accomplished achievement, and I saw a clear talent of festive filmmakers - and I was able to make it the most durable of the film. <br /> Order a Pizza - If you want to keep your girlfriend, turn off the lights, turn off the sound, and so on.
