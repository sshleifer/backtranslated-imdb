************************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** *************** Nevertheless, I was a movie as a child, and I was a favorite admirer. Keeping in mind that it's designed for a child, I rate it on a relative basis. The story is the winter breakout lessons in the winter break when children build a fantastic ice castle, and go back for control of weapons like snowballs and other affiliates, empty hands and free time. When I was a child, the ice fortress slept on me and I would agree with children today, but I agree with Pixar and all computer animations, and if I have kids date and do not realize it. Moreover, the message of this film is a wonderfully allegorical and positive one, for children (and adults alike).
