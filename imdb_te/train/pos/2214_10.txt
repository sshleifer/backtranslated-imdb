My family flew back to the beginning of the 1700s in the early 1700s and my grand-parents never talked about watching the movie, but knew that it existed. I chose the vast African Americans and others as "pass" whites. This is a difficult story when your family learns they are talking about it and when you know that Ken River is all part of that history. Does it make me cry and wondered how to abandon the 'donkey' of my own grandfathers of those civilizations and my big grandmother of African heritage, how to survive in that oppression and elite existence? At the same time, I did not come out of that history, and I can not be a successful businessman, and I'm running a successful world today. Acting is excellent and fair depending on the actor, but it's a must-see film. Anne Rice is not incredible and I ask myself why she is writing about my family and not me. I would recommend this film to everyone. Leza
