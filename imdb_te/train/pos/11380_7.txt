The word megemania is used to describe Jean Kelly, and sometimes his dance is very tight, you have to accept the person you know how to put on a show. In American in Paris, he has some amazing numbers choreographs, some plots, but look amazing. <br /> <br /> Jean Kelly starred as GI out of Paris where he lived there to paint, soon he is the richest lady's gigolo, but he really loves whom! Definitely Harry's story, but the musical numbers save the show here! In this case I really liked the voice of George Guhri's voice. His duet with Lee Jean on his 'Stirwy to Paradise' and 'You Wonderful' was wonderful. Oscar Levant and Leslie Coron I can go. All in all, a pretty good, but dynamic image.
