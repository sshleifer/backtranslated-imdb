<br /> You get what you see. Not really! We are pursuing such delightful enthusiasm that we are destroying the mythical and brilliant 'glamor and glittering myths of Madhur Bhandarkar, pages of our newspapers and its lives (reading party habits) that we can only describe our internal viheuristic streak. <br /> This is troublesome as a phenomenon as Page 3 is troublesome. How exactly was such a control over the printed word and it was related to another discussion when it started entering the front page. Bhandarkar wisely escapes it. He is concerned only with the methods of this strange existence. In doing so, he had many elements in this way. Like Robert Altman (I do not compare Banderkar to Altman's intellectuality), Bhandarkar uses many characters to make his point more wider. It is a page 3 wannabe NRI, Gate-crashers, newly-rich, upcoming model, a social political or a romantic novel self-styled; All the characters were introduced with a goal and each of them had a special character-sketch, even if their parts were not excluded. And there is the appeal of the film. <br /> <br /> Konkan Sen Sharma is a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for Madhavi Sharma, Nation Today. Her job was initially controversial, and she soon began to look at the underbelly's wickedness with this fake and aesthetic skill. But Bhandarkar tries to bring this matter to a moral-playing movie and keeps a character in sight. So the film is not only about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) as editor-in-chief, as the coach of a big machine, Anjali Thapar (Soni Rajadan) - a socialist from social pollution, Abhijit (Rihain Engineer) - a homosexual artist And Maghiv's colleagues Pearl (Sandhya Mori) - Sasi Airhost and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - a starring Interested. It seems to be impossible for many characters (and more) to be collective in a story, but Nina Arora and Manoj are all set to make a full-fledged credit, tight screen play. Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar's dialogues were very careful. <br /> You can flat out any narrative, no matter how good and true performances. Thankfully, 'Page 3' actors and starry brims. Konkana is effortlessly moving through his writer-based role. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Murdul gets the best written piece, but it almost crosses. Atul Kulkarni has gone on to become an underwriter. Sometimes, the director was very interested in incorporating as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality). But the moments they use do not see them quickly. <br /> <br /> Finally, Bhandarkar's attempt to appease our warmth, but he takes it further. He reveals us to the gruesome realities of this department of humanity that takes us inside the photographs and seems to live in a strange and remote world. A few hundred kilometers away were destroyed by the brutality of their fellow countrymen but the same people who drowned in the New Year's Eve! Wise writing, talented songs, performances and honesty are the true feelings, although this strategy is worthless and lacking poor product values. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> > <br /> <br /> <br /> 29 January 2005
