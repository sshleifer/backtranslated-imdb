I saw my first John Waters film (Female Trouble) and I'm not sure it will expect for the second time. <br /> <br /> At the forefront of the previous film, Becker is actually a T. Sear satirist of New York in New York with a funny movie. Anyone who can not imagine finding these "experts" attractive about modern art, will enjoy the full completion of this pretentious snobs peeker, will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Edward Ferrlang (Pet Seemary II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) is surprisingly good as Pecker. <br /> <br /> There is not much meat in any role in the film, but he really shines. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricky (Prozac Nation) comes with another great performance as the peeker girlfriend. <br /> <br /> In fact, Ricky (a banner year for Buffalo '66, The Season of Sex, and Pecker). <br /> <br /> Lily Taylor, who played a very good role in The Haunting <br /> <br <br /> <br /> I would like to see Waters' work, especially herspray, for a long time, in the news.
