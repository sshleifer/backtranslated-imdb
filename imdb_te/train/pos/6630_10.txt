This is an important image. It challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. Here's a lot to like. The director was keen to distinguish the more tired cinema traditions. Unlike most recent American films, the film was originally intended to create a movie. There are a lot of DVD bonus features, and the two comments that describe the audience to the audience are still ignored after the initial view. When filmed at Sundance, some are uncomfortable and angry than the audience. It's a Sunday morning coffee film, not a Friday night party image. For a dedicated viewer, it's a treasure swipe.
