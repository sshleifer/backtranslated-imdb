Has become a classy product with a low budget. The variety of characters is amazing, 7ft ghouls from ax-wielding dwarfs! I enjoyed the relationship between Leeds, not enough romance to continue with non-exaggerated sentiment. I am very ridiculous (very wrong, not far beyond that, it is not too dark or very unclear). Eaves' other efforts in stories and production, this is a great step from helper and sanitarium. They have a great website which is worth checking out. If the level of improvement continues, it will not wait for Bane.
