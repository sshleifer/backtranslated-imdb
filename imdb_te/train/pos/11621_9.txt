I was frustrated one night and thought it was not a red eye and why. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is one of the best movies in many days. <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> Lisa Raisert and Ceylon with this movie Rachel Macadam's <br /> <br /> Acting is just fine and you get the feel of people in the movie. <br /> <br /> The music is wonderful, <br /> <br /> I like how well this film was doing well. It's never boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is simply unusual. <br /> This is a very exciting thriller. <br /> <br /> In total, I enjoyed the red eye very much. <br /> If you look like a red eye, I would recommend Electra and Cry Wolfe. <br /> <br /> I give Red Eye 9 from 10.
