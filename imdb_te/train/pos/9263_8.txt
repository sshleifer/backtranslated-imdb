This is a totally joyous and unexpected picture. Start by following a young man you expect to get a qualifying football game between Bahrain and Iran. If they win Iran, they will participate in the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that the young man is a girl and the girls (or women in that case) are not allowed to "sit with men" football matches. It's a fantastic comedy with a brilliant skill with a short comedy cast. The film analyzes the absurdity of limits on women's freedom (and the young soldiers should correct them for that matter). One of the girls has to go to the toilet and of course, there are some wonderful sets of women in the stadium where there is no toilet. Camera work is simplistic and in some ways this story is the platform. However, the film is a tiny scale that gives its bite. Great movie? No, maybe not; Great entertainment - for sure.
