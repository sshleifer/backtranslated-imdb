Best Modesty Blaze Movie I Have Seen So far. It sounds like a good pilot for the TV series. I like Quentin Tarantino magic, or something like a light touch, it's a little "cult". They come to a great deal of Modesty's role, but I do not agree that Willy Garvin is missing. Although I have read many comics and Peter Odonnell's books, the film is not disappointing, quite opposite. This story is surprising about Modesty and her childhood. I have not kept my expectations much since 1966 because of bad image. That's why I made this film slightly overturned. If you like comics and other stories about Modesty Blaze, you must watch it! Can not wait for a follow-up ...
