Okay, like many other movies, a SNL sketch moved away. But Tim Meadows does a very exciting job of making a dimensional character in a 3 minute role in the role of a moderate hit comedy. He bends down with a fairly frequent-a-linear-leaner, while Billy dei Williams has lost days in his land, and the whole thing is pretty well shot. True, it's not great art, but if you go to Wayne's World with the Gone with the Wind, you're doing something wrong. It's enjoyable .......
