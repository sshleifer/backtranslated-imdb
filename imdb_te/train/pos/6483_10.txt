Laurence Olivier commented that this amazing series, starts at the end of World War 2. The Versailles Treaty that contributed to Hitler's supernatural escalation was not fully investigated from the collapse of Germany, but as a critic suggests, it should be very difficult in the 26-part series. <br /> <br /> Unlike the expected war photography / action, you are focused on personal, emotional and human tragedy, especially if you do not have World War 2 buff / fan. Leading witnesses / adversaries, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the USA. Episodes of "testimonies" at home's home and life open to many eyes. The extreme brutality of the war on the frontline and the suffering of civilians, death camps, etc. are very well organized and exposed. <br /> <br /> "Frank Vitil's experimental Gloster jet and Gloucester Meteor's fight debut, as well as German Messerschmitz Me 262 - particularly the V-1 for the first time, and the surprisingly small mention of V2, which is a very less sensational mystery and miraculous weaponry, which WW2 advanced from more barren old science <br /> <br /> A great set of series that has made its mark and thanks since its gratitude has been made so far. <br /> <br /> A DVD, especially Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV, should be proud of being a military fan as a box set in history.
