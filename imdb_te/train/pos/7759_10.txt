On the surface, "Written on the Wind" is a sensational, glossy soap opera about the sexual performance of a Texas oil family. But it's all about the deep, social commentary of the 1950s life. Director Douglas Circ again scored another universal scoreser. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is the best friend of the stock, Rock Hudson, she also loves. When the stock is discovered he is clean and Buckal ends up pregnant, fireworks fly. And, the all-too-good Dorothy Malone Hudson, Texas's biggest Numpho, has won an Oscar for her role. Good epic soap opera.
