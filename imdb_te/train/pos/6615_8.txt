<br /> <br /> Karas and Tausayev's sisters, Reynation, are happy to say only positive about the movie. <br /> <br /> First, a boys' adventure, a police investigation into the quest of a missing young scientist in Renasasus. Gene scientist and researcher Ellana Tausayev for Avalon Company. <br /> <br /> The story of Karus, Ellena and Bilassen is much less than the SIN CITY, the better the film, and the connoisseurs. It's more meaningful for French comics fans (I've gathered my French comics collection last week, but I'm not up to this day). Atmosphere, music, characters, their lines, plots are all good and lovely. A rebellious sister, Bilassen, is romantic, I guess, Karas, a Parisian top cop to find a young man who is a very good blonde, a growing star of medical genre, is Elona Tausayev. <br /> For me, an old-fashioned fan of comics and TV series, Rhynesense, is an amazingly beautiful cartoon, a replay of an WILD WILD WEST episode, where a mythical past was replaced with mythological future. And blasé But, in a sense, thrilling. RENAISSANCE is not a suspense; Or does it look better? But it is saping and hypnotic. Moreover, briefly, a world, sketching a real world and we are thinking about telling his distant childhood in Avalon, Nakata, Jonas Müller, Tasuiev sisters, and Goran, Farfella, and Karas Kasbah ?? . I liked the feeling of Ryanissance, a certain gentleness and sympathy and courage, and professional, promising look; <br /> <br /> In these new cartoons, this one and lingleter's dick adaptation (never - only adaptation of the first and the dick) stood out for the beauty of the beauty and genuine enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> As a matter of fact, the characters have exotic names such as Bilasne and Ffellah, most of which are the arts and entertainment world (Goran and Elona <br /> <br /> Rowinson's poster Rourke looks like a look-alike.It is a SIN CITY rip off, but not a paragon of reality, and actually more similar to the story of Miller, a depressed society (The Willis 'character in the previous movie and the Rourke' s Cross in the original movie)? On the other hand, this cartoon is more public air breathing, the edge of the adventurousness directly, and, in a word, it is for Sin City kids? , naughtier kids I mean, there is a bit of nudity on display.I mentioned the traits that I mentioned, the future of the adult comics'   క్ యొక్క క్లిచ్లు మరియు ఉమ్మడి స్థలాల వంటి లక్షణాలను కలిగి ఉన్నాయని నేను చెప్పాను. తగినంత నిజమైన, మరియు ఇది తెరపై ఆ విషయాలను తీసుకువచ్చిన వయస్సు మిల్లర్ మరియు RENAISSANCE ఇక్కడ మరియు అక్కడ కొన్ని సారూప్యతలు కలిగి. Now it is also fair that every ring must have its ERAGORN, so the city of every sin, its revival. I admit that I am very partial to these tragic futuristic stories, and this is quite special.
