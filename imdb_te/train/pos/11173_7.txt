Ah, clicks, clicks, clocks; They play a major role in a wide variety of horror films. This one has many. Yet, this is Stephen King, one of the best masters of horror. This film is good, just too speculative. And what a stupid people do not have a horror film? This life was badly damaged by retarded sufferers. Pet Cemetery I seemed slightly creepy. The way to set everything up is really horrifying, but not terrifying. Most of the time, acting SOMEWHAT is believable, suspense is not that curiosity, but the entertainment level is set at the main rank; My eyes are practically jumping on the screen. All Stephen King fans must watch this movie, but think about an okay thriller with anyone.
