I've never seen a wonderful acting job in a movie as I did when I saw Daniel Day Lewis playing Christie Brown in my left foot. In fact there is no role in the scene. Christie played the character of Brown, or by painting all of his films and his surgery. I feel great and that's the way he holds all that stressed that I believe he is the most true to say he put the most Oscar-worthy appearance in history. He is very talented in this tough part and I believe that no one could have done it better or better than him. I can not say it, but I can not say that it is the best film of all time, and it has not played any role and then acted on it without acting. Please. Perhaps probably a man for that matter.
