Although the film has some weaknesses, it is worth watching. I have chosen from the cast, and Bonham praised Carter and Branagh to choose different characters from what they had taken in the past. Both have suffered a lot of people suffering from acne, but they prefer their humanity. The story is touching, but it will fly the shows. Bonham Carter's "Jane" is a great achievement, opening up my eyes for things that I have never considered before in my eyes, but also interesting for other reasons. My movie was very sudden, but it was a good English setting that was added to my experience than in the emotionally manipulative ending (see "stepmome") - in the 90s, without dulling in England, urban and rural areas.
