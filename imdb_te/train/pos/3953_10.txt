I saw this film on TV and never seen it again. For my life, I could not remember the title and did not decline it all while checking Roy's movie credits. The splendid, dark, and horror TV horror movie is the same class "Crowven Farm"; "Dark of the Dort of the Dark"; And "Satan School for Girls", has lost all the satanic factions. I also think Clint Eastwood's classic, "High Plains Drifter" has many parallels. Why not release these great little films, especially when you consider all the latest garbage packets filled with discount DVD racks at Wal-Mart? Most of these films are cult-less, so sales are not a problem.
