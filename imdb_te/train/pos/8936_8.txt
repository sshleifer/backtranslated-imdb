After "Beau Tessville", Claire Denis never came, it did not come up with an upcoming masterpiece. Now it is. Denis has a quantum leap in the film, beautiful cinematography, elliptical editing and oddity and strangely acting narrative events clearly blur. A nominal plot (taken from the Jean-Luc Nancy Book) is about a mature person who needs a heart transplant and he left the Tahitian son long ago; But most of the exploration of personal and cultural thinking to infiltrate it. It takes two views to fully comprehend, and is trailing closer to closing issues, but it is more modern and gripping than anything I've seen this year yet. Miss it in your danger.
