This is one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes, primarily for filming two lone souls in a post-apocalyptic cock. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The parable is somewhat heavier with the drama standards of today, it is a wonderful - use of the setting to make a statement about human experience. , And geographical politics, from time to time. The whole drama is based on the shoulders of Mr. Branson and Mrs Montgomery, who are not discouraged. <br /> <br /> Peace be able to rest in peace.
