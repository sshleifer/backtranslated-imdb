The film looks good - the emotional energy of Tom Hulse and Ray Leotto's tears brought to my eyes and my heart's happiness - showing us that the film is still in the world. By the end of 1988, if the film was released instead of Rain Man, Halssey was nominated at least for Best Actor Oscar. Definitely see!
