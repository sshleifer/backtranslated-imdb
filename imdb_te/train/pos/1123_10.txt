<br /> <br /> Four college girls (Ballston, Kelly, Stall and Cadby) went to Florida. They are their way to meet 2 guys (Turner, Davies), they really can not add nothing to the plot, but at least somewhat likable. The girls agree to meet the boys in Florida for some fun, but they have car problems and never make up. <br /> <br /> One of the girls is to use the bathroom as she is somewhere in the middle. No choice but to go to the bushes. <br /> <br /> She immediately threw a woman as witnesses as a man (March), and the girl survived from the area, she would not be too far, but loses. For her, they even went into the woods and walked into the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, responding by knocking the girl, the other girl flees, and she returns it back to the car <2 <br /> Finally, two girls discovered each other They enter the gas station. <br /> When I start mad, these poor girls are scared of their lives and the Red Neck Cops do not believe them. <br /> <br /> They are seriously treated and one of them is madman. <br /> <br /> The film has nudity, good actresses, psycho mimics, shower scene, graphic violence and solid stories on women. Some women probably find it risky and do not like the ending of sensitive people, but on all, this is a great little unknown image.
