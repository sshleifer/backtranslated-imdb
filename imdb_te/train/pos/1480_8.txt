I'm in front of TV, watching Casomile. It's changing, it's going to improve or better ... id. It starts with the marriage of the two main characters who have reported their love story. After the change of everything, a baby was born, and all the rest usually happen in a couple. This is not a simple movie because it talks about a simple couple, and the normality is the center of the movie. It does not need to show us something unique, there is nothing new, it's just a simple love story, a couple's story, and a general one that differs from the rest. It's also a flashing movie, everything is short, each sequence has long been a few seconds. Because it knows a lot of things to talk about the story, friends and parents reported, their opinion is central, opinions create and destroy the story. It's a simple story of a couple that I have said, but it's not boring, it's just a couple to show, which should be everything to know, but I do not forget to see what's the end of each one of you!
