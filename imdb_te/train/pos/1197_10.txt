I mistakenly saw this movie. What a little gem. The film, which was made in 1956, appears to be the last Seventies film. And the blue solder is better, more control and appropriate than say, say. Environmental and supernatural moods are moving ahead of time. The poor cinematography is fantastic and terrific realistic. More than dancing with wolves, The Last Hunt conveys the look and feel of the buffalo "killing farms" in the late 1800s. Those in the movie are real killing fields. This law was filmed during a buffalo bulls in legitimate forest areas, so the animals you see are really burned, the bones are real. At the end, a very poorly-rated western masterpiece, magically starred, directed and shot.
