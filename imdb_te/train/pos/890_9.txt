This is a wonderful Samo Hung movie. Actually, this is a great piece of Hong Kong action movie. This story looks for love story of pedlobl drivers in Macao and mixed up w / a vicious whitewash. The shows are excellent and the characters are all preferred and well defined. Participation in this story and enough romance, drama, comedy and suspense. Samo Hung proves that he is the best fighting choreographer in the business. The action is just amazing, esp. Fight w / la kalig and end. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are wonderful. Must see a fan of any action.
