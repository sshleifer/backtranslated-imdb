The semi-major character is known for their tension and release style in a horrific accident cartoon, the last time the leader was rescued. This particular casper is the only one to remember when the death is actually taken. <br /> <br /> In Famous Studios cartoons it is always said that "virtue always triumphs". Popeye always reaches his spinach, Baby Hue always leaves the fox with the fox, Little Audrey always learns his lesson. And some FS cartoons are really dark and depressing. <br /> You must give them credit. I do not think there is a good cartoon production to anyone than Paramount until I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry". Color, animation, music (great Winston Sharrels), editing, voices. They are stable and are the best brilliant examples of art form.
