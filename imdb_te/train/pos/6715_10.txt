I used to love watching the nights of Friday "Sabrina, Teenage Witch" on ABC's TGIF. I think one of the best shows in TGIF. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> My favorite character is Salem. He was adorable and very fun. I also liked Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey. He became HOT. I also think Melissa Jon Hart played a good young witch. My favorite episodes are "Sabrina Through the Looking Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: The Teenage Years". <br /> <br /> Overall I really miss this program. I hope one day will bring back the new episodes of ABC. I give this show 10/10 stars.
