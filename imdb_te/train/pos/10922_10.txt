When I was very young, they would display all kinds of kung fu pictures on Saturdays at a local TV station. I saw all the kung fu movies on weekends. I remember many of them. Crypt Masters, Blind Fist Bruce, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunken Sank, Master of the Master, Tale Dragon, and ... Five Deadly Wins. I remember the day clearly. And my father drank at Burger King. Let's see what movie we will see this Saturday. We walk in the house, jump over the bed, set on the floor and jump up to 56. Kung Fu is the title of the film's introductory introduction of many Kung Fu movie clips on Saturday. It has five deadly flutes. First in my burger with the credit sequence is fun. I liked this movie for a minute. My favorite character Todd Venom. The plot was difficult at that age, but it was not me ... it was a fight. Fights. Every time G.I was commercially shocked, and ended up 2 hours of the best film I soon saw.
