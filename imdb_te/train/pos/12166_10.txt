Very strange and compelling image. It's about the most awkward and hard-hurt man who tries to navigate his life as a door-to-door fundraiser / salesman. The director really holds a rare tale that worked well for the story. The pain of the life-long pain is very real and unpleasant when it comes to humor. There was a sequence in the really standing test center, and I often did not do what I had to do, which made me laugh out loud. I have seen for a long time. I did not give up my mind and I look forward to Bronstein's future trials. Excellent shows all around. Straight line "I really appreciate it." Now I have an iconic look.
