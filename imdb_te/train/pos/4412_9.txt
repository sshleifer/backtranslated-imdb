I've seen this film twice on DVD, and twice that I'm not impressed with a particular impartial attitude. It looks more like reality of reality than most other Hollywood fare, especially on the topic of debate. Although it is closer to the South viewpoint, it does not fail to question, eventually the sentence is gone, the war is gone, and the cruelty is a common divisor. <br /> <Really what is the best drama of the film. These days are good movies (briefly), the main fee (if you do not have high expectations), but terribly commercially enthusiastic. I will come up with a good image (without a masterpiece) because it sticks to herself, and gives the viewer a chance to move and explore him, instead intending to blow him with impact and emotion. <br /> <br /> There are flaws in this story, especially in the role of Jewel, but once again the situation has occurred. Worse, something for a young widow may be only logical to get back to a normal life, even by taking each subsequent person fluently. Still she is not weak, in fact I feel like one of her strong roles, her relationship is in control, and men are just tagging. I am very grateful that she is not a crying widow. The death of a 19th century I loved is something far more common than now. You also have small illnesses and lesions to die, so anyone's chance to die, obviously grief, is not traumatise people like now. <br /> They did not create statues about the losers, just like they are now, and I liked that attitude. <br /> If they're in some mood, they are different than normal Hollywood fare. If you want non-stop action or heart rental emotions, do not look.
