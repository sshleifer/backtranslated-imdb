A young and unlikely promising college degree (played by Blair Underwood) was sent to jail for murdering innocent girls and executing the death penalty. Sean Connery plays the role of a "happy go lucky" attorney who is going to leave the retirement of the young man and seek the case with the hope of liberating his grandson. Lawrence plays a well-known police officer in the case of Fishburn and dismisses a doctrine that he and the entire police department are trying to repel a teenager who has been convicted of offense. Ed Harris, Kate Coppasha, Ruby Dee, and Late Lynne Thigpen co-star in this very serious dramatic thriller.
