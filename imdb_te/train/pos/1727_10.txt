Wooden Horse is a very intelligent picture about the most intelligent and successful escape plan that was worked out by British Pow during World War II. It deals with the fantastic sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by acid-tongues by Leo Gun. Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Papins) are two heroes. All across the direction and fast moving. Highly recommended.
