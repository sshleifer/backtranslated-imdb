Che: Part One is an attractive experiment, not only a very interesting story, but it also tried to be different from the "biopic" style. Part Two is an amazing ending of this experiment. <br /> <br /> The film offers the same features from the first in Steven Soderbergh's excellent direction (from Benisio del Toro), not forgetting to break down traditional rules from biopics. I admire from Soderbergh's experiments ... They always try to do different and unusual things and they have succeeded over time. <br /> <br /> I am doing: Part Two is a very exciting recommendation because, first and foremost, it is a brave and lovely experience that challenges the viewer and thinks .
