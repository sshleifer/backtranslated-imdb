I love this show <br /> <br /> Every time I look at the episode, I repeat that line, reminding me how good this performance is. I am a huge sci-fi fan and this show has the most important science fiction (fiction?) In cinema / TV history. There are so many theories about this universe about the universe, I have not started a religion. <br /> <br /> I am 5 years old (19 now) from MacGyver fan and my 2 favorite TV shows All Time Star Richard Dean Anderson. <br /> When I first saw the Stargate film, I immediately liked it and thought it was one of my favorite sci-fi flicks <br /> <br /> I did not get nearly the show until the fifth season. However, I wanted to do Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin. The trio of movies but the studio instead selected the series. <br /> If it happens now, that's fine. <br /> <br /> This program is awesome, I hope I will die forever. Atlantis here we come!
