Meg Meacon visits and the piece he says - "Did the piston fire?" (She refers to the sexual power of her future wife) is happy. I love Meg Ryan and she will always be sweet in this wonderful movie. Very fascinating and very clever. She wants you to be her innocent innocent expressions. The hero maintains the garage mechanic well for physical transformations. Is Einstein romantic in his mind? The press round and puzzle round before the audience was well done. It is amazingly underestimated and deserves excellence and efforts at a revival. It loses votes, including the most improbable distance theory purchased by US Govt. I did not see why it would not appear in the best 20 sex comedy films of the century. Great movie, which has its approval presidential impression!
