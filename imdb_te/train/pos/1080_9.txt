The movie "Comedy" is typically 100 minutes of toilet humor, foul language, and groin-kicking these days. Modern humor is the lowest common denominator, the undemanding of the brain and the slow appeal. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings shows his Dream House of buildings" 1940 shows what Hollywood is capable of, and it just comes along occasionally good comedy, but it rarely experiences when it's just tightly funny. . Jim and Murre Blondings (Carrie Grant and Myroy Loy) decide to build a home in Connecticut suburbs. The film follows their story, home hunt tours, the worst structure of houses, all the way to the finished house - with "jazzuze water softener". <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy their characters, of course (Grant is particularly funny as he sees zoom out of home controls). However, the film was stolen by Blandings' brilliant advocate who played perfect through Melvin Douglas. He manages to steal every scene, from the Douglas crisis to the crisis. <br /> <br /> Reginald Denny Bringings is a magnificent old water driller like the Harriet architect and Harry Shannon. <br /> I have seen this film many times and I always smile. I think if you have built a house, it is a good movie to see when you want to lift.
