<br /> <br /> My name is Miriam and I am twelve years old, so Inspector Gadget is at the top of his career. <br /> <br /> When reading, I always remember that the original series (if I come!). It's just what I see is that the gadget's thing (even though I'm engaged now) is focused on what I like about it because it's negative to everyone. All the pessimists for you, I also got down there some down there. = P First off, for the childhood sense of humor, you could not have considered this film pretty funny. I thought, so ask me. I also thought the animation and character models were good, and I am glad that I'm still a gadget because he is my favorite character. (I do not like Penny.) Then Claw (his voice is terrible) and Mad Cat; I've done very well. If the idleness of the gadget is not a bit exaggerated (i.e., it's a good screen shot, even if it's a good shot of his hat-handed thumb). Oh, and I liked the song I played in the credits. <br /> <br /> And, like all the movies, there are some disadvantages. <br /> Do you speak with cars? What's with it It is said that you are targeting young children. The fact that cars are basically save the day is not quite trouble me. I liked a lot of penny and brain taking their place. And, apparently, Gadget liked his car than what is called natural. <br /> Oh, and the Chief is clearly understood by the gadget. I mean, the shesh, yes, he is not always the most happy of the people, but he does not hate the gadget since I read it. Like the inspector, his personality is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> This is the best thing I can say about this film. I made it for the animation car based plot and thought it was pretty good overall; More than live-action gadget images (butchered, butchered, BUTCHERED!). Firstly I came into the gadget, or maybe my mind is distorted, or I'm just odd because I'm just odd, but I liked this movie.
