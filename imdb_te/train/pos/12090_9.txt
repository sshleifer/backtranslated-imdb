I was alone in my parents' basement on Saturday night when I was 10 or 11 years old. It is featured in the "Chiller Theater", a simple horror feature that I have seen as younger. Now, I have seen many old horror films thanks to Chiller Theater, but "Dance Macabre," a.k.a "The Castle of Blood." I'm now 51 years old, I have never thought of seeing this fortune-and-glorious DVD version of the magnificent supernatural classic that I saw in the past year. I have seen four times before and it does not seem to get tired. <br /> <br /> They can not make such spook films right now. Haunted catacombs and mid-enchanted smirkes do not work in color as black and white back in the day. Anyway, this is an Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steel, deliciously shadow, cobweb-wrap'ed haunted castle sets, restless spirits to re-run their deaths ... and a wickedly ironic end. <br /> <br /> IMO, Robert Wise's "The Haunting", "The Innocents" (with Deborah Kerr) and the recent "The Other."
