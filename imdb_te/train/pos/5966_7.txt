Actually, I have satan and stuff that I never bought into metal, but this movie kind of played that idea. Definitely a picture can not be evaluated either seriously or at a high rate, but it delivers its purpose for its purpose when playing it. The story is a metal band of death in their hotel, one of their fans says that this effect and the tomb is killing beyond the tomb and begins to spin. So yes, "Elm Street Nightmare On Elm Street" plot is here. Granted Freddie had not previously sexed a girl in a car. It has another film with a heavy metal band, but it has a kind of children's town and has a band that made them crazy and how it played it is very different. He was a fan of bandwagon who first assisted the murderer's soul when trying to stop him. If I can not remember killing many Gary, it's not terrible. Most obviously, I would scene a scene where the scene looked like the girl's dressed headphones and later sexually harassed by some of the band's embodiment. Not great, but good time filler.
