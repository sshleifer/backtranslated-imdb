This image is why I found this website. I can not find this movie anywhere! I'm so glad I discovered it here! We saw in front of TV and wanted it desperately to find and buy and buy many friends who are interested in buying it. Another poster commented that it was boring, but I should say it is not. Specially, if you're a horseman, you love this movie. Horses are awesome, well trained and cinematic. This is definitely bought for our home DVD library. We recommend it to our friends. The relationship between man and horse in the movie is very inspirational and you want to spend more time with your horses. This is exactly what we see several times.
