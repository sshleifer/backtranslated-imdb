I saw this in the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and horror scene when the Germans attacked the Yellow River with the mustard gas for the first time. Germans and their horses are covered with toe (or rabbit) worm protective suits from the head. Experienced British soldiers have dan gas masks (only) and are once again waiting for gas clouds and German invasion. Gas clouds are constantly approaching, eventually surrounding the British rescuers. The Germans are slowly scared in their scary looking garment. Suddenly a scream from the guards ... this gas is not like what they were before ... <br /> I've remembered this scene for the past 30+ years and still shaking, I think you'll do too!
