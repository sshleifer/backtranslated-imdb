I saw the roll and it turned out to be a pleasure. Toby Malone's performance is really standing, I found it really caring about what matting throughout the film, it's also a lot of fun, with great mix of well-rounded characters with a very good speed, it's a lot of time considering running smaller. There are good turns around good, which keeps you guessing until the end. Other characters to search for are completely mad little and sneaky attractive Jesse. It may not have a Hollywood blockbuster's huge budget, but do not discontinue it, you can do much worse without checking it, you do not worry. Good pleasure. 7/10
