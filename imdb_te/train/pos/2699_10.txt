There are other reviews here, so how great it is or what I do not need to say about it ... It's my opinion: I heard about this film before I showed it before. I can not even remember, I know through the Internet. Distributors made it ever before the hit! For months I moped and complained. Please have a link to this image on this page and VHS only highlighted at Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Alta Vista's Babelfish to translate. I know the PAL format and they have a small little bit of beginning to change the text on screen to German and even dubbing in German, but like this film hilarious and campy, it really only makes it funnier! If you want to watch this movie and have a nearby place that swaps it is SO worth! It costs twenty dollars or more to get from the U.S. to Germany. Believe me, it may seem like a lot to spend on cinema, but if you go into a bumpy b-flick, you can leave money for your friends and make it right!
