The cone cinema is a surprise to a different audience because the multiple of the tones and styles that are found in the same movie. In the Korean play, such as "Secret Sunshine", you have some comic parts, thriller scenes and romantic times. Song Kang-Ho commented on the role of a film in an episode of the film, "There is no tragedy in life, even tragic-comedy." But do not get me wrong, the movie deals with this variation of the film, adds real meaning to the rich movie experience. This does not mean that there is no unity: in contrast, it is rare to see such dense and deep images of a painful woman. <br /> <br /> Shin-A, who is searching for a quiet life, has given her son in the town of her husband, who is truly united in the film, with different faces of her. This destroys the realistic part of all the stages of the poor mother's mental descriptions. Denial, Loss, Anger, Confidence, Realism: The film crosses that role, and looks like a psychological catalog of all the painful steps that a woman experiences. <br /> <br /> Conceptual experience (woman wears the mask of tragedy, man refers to funny interludes) and the artwork of the film to approve what you can tell you touch. Some parts of the film really started me (initially specifically), especially to the truly inconvenient Chong Jon's inability to help a person who really loves me but eventually caused me mental tiredness. However, some cinematic ideas are really breathtaking and shocking (for example the scene that appeared in a larger shot is amazing). This type of scenes make "Secret Sunshine" thrillers equal to the "The Hurt" Horror Movies or the Memories related to the murders. These films are indeed shocking, very original, beautiful, fantastic, and maintained to give another dimension to the genres they deal with. "Secret Sunshine" forgets, "The Host" forgets to be scary, moves its audience: a bad point for a play, but a good point for a good image.
