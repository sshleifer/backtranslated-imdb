Nicolas Rogge's projects are different from the least, but are less than interesting. "Stability" is clearly, first and foremost, an adopted stage: it is a word and a pretty-much 'room-bonding'. However, these images are viewed more than once: the underlying themes are not publicly presented and yet, it takes some time to adjust the scenes and characters changes of the four main characters: Einstein, McCarthy, Monroe, and Diemagio. <br /> <br /> Einstein was sentenced to guilty on Hotshima, and simplicity of sexual relations with Munroe; Munro was a bimbo and he was sick by watching Craves intellectual faith; Senator McCarthy is at the height of his witch-hunting forces, but it's a walk SlizBag; Demaggio is distinguished by his celebrity, self-imposed, and torture. Each of them has the seeds of their own destruction. Each character is a troubled, abusive / misuse past and has a questionable future. Gradually, we are the centerpiece. America's siege with its post-war cultural icons and commitments; <br /> <br /> Relativity theory, a proposed unified-field theory and, in fact, compared to the nature of the cosmos, the roles and interactions of Rogue's main characters are not enough. And these factors of the physical universe (all of which quantum, trust me!) Will affect us when applied to the development of ways to destroy us. The principle behind the neutron-bomb is the Monroe mention (not named,), which is not an anacronism but can be understood by contemporary viewers. In fact, all the instructions in the script are only available to the knowledgeable viewer: a 'fait of' 50s probability / personality traditions and how they affect us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This image and its screenplay are either too intelligent, or too opaque and pretentious. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
