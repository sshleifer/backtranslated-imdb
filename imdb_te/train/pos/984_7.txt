The cable that I started took place across the "byte" on a night cable and thought, "Eh, why not?" I'm happy it gave me a chance. <br /> <br /> "Byte" is not perfect. It is unnecessarily elegant and occasionally active. But the whole film has worked. All the elements are just right aligned, otherwise they are pretty ugly. <br /> <br /> I think many are due to Jamie Fox. I do not know who I tagged Fox for the main character, but who made this movie bigger. Reliable and amazingly fond of, foxy glides through the film, ridiculous than soft and hell like butter. <br /> <br /> Even though the plot is nonetheless, it is actually pretty well absorbed and the character of Fox is also a characteristic of a person. . Again, they have fallen without any of these, but it does much better. <br /> I gave it a low rating. Maybe I hold this move on the right night, or in contrast, but I should give it 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Fox.
