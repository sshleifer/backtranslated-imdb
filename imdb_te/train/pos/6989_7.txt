The film is featured in the first episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I see the film, I do not think about that wonderful TV series. I believe this is a surprisingly good start of the 40's horror film, a very surprisingly good sound and a 67-year-old public domain picture for horror movie. I'm really looking at Bela Lugosi and his bizarre staff, brides including brides, including his wife, an old hug and her two elderly sons, a big idiot, and another jokey dagger (Angelo Rositota from the Freelux of 1932). I also enjoyed plucky young female reporter, kind of a stereotype, but still fun to watch. My only problem with this otherwise good movie is that it is even ridiculous and unbelievable, plot for an image. I do not want to spoil any of this movie, so go out and rent, or, better yet, buy a couple of bucks.
