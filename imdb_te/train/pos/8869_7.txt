In this small film we have some great characters but a very shallow story. This is great to see because Singleton performs a great job at displaying relationships between esoteric conflicts and individuals. This is the viewer. Of course, we have all the sounds and stereotypes on celluloid in a film that is far superficial here. Not sure a deep image (even if it wants), but better than the average college image.
