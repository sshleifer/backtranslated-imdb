Being in a small town in Illinois I'm instantly connected to this film. When taking into consideration the age of making it, towns seem to be uncomfortable for a lot of people I've grown up. Yes plot so-so. And yes, acting will not be nominated to the Oscars anytime soon. But it is not. Point Reality is Suspend and is just FUN. This movie is fun and fun. From the greedy, unexplained banker to a better understanding, but from the excluded deputy, the film is in the sculpture of the sculpture and is fine in the small town. Who can not smile in the eyes of the Inferno drone or Verne Droid? And I like FarmZoid. I have one when I'm growing up. Overall, they take into consideration the technology available at that time, and it's a pleasant romance at a young age, you sit back at Saturday afternoon, popcorn, and laugh at small town losses. I'll see again and again for reasons other than having fun in me and my small urban ways.
