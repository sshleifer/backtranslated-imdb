A fine effort for the Australian show. It is not surprising that quality seems to have some revival in the Asian drama. Will I dare to compare it to the attitude of love to this presentation? No. But it reminds us of the early secret life. The cast was great, and I saw the magic that Gibben saw in her first two episodes, and the British cast is also strongly in Callum and Lizzie. But if Forsyth is to get another season for this performance, savings light (it does not need to be saved). I was not a fan of his performance in the awesomeness marking mini series awesomely a few years ago but he was always great in the hull in the lush. Its good to see Brook again silly. Let's hope the display keeps improving with each episode.
