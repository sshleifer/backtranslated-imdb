The film is superb for three main reasons. It's pretty beautiful. I absolutely loved that. There is a bold color theme with an image of unusual costumes and lovely sets. Very expensive (and maybe not) photography look will fill the look. I always enjoy those stories about groups of misfits / loners in order to become a family and become a family. Sometimes they fall into a clich√© but this is not one. The band of the actors has played the most flawless and most fond of characters. Alan Larkin is the best (his middle, van and road movie theme, I did not recall my favorite movie of Little Miss Sunshine last year). I found Fabrizio Bentigoglio, a very interesting actor, and at some times the slightest frustration by the Til Schweiger performance. In the early scene, all the tricks that they are very funny in their tricks their tricks. There is a mixture of humor and emotion throughout the film. I like the end too. And of course it's about the magician theme. A good magician creates an illusion for the audience where he wants to. This is what happens to a movie director, so they are called movie magic.
