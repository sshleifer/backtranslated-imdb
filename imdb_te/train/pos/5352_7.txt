This is the movie Arnold. Now you know, I've saved a lot of time I've taken to read this review. If you do not like Arnold, then you are just like this film. If the case is the other, then you'll probably like it too. <br /> <br /> Now if you are reading this, I think you will like Arnold. Good to you! He is not very good. Running man is a very distinctive Arnold feature. It's a very well-known simple retro-folks from the B-Science Fiction of 80s, a horrific one-liner group, a sample of violence and explosions and a good-looking heroine and a happy ending. <br /> In this case, the evil opponent is the all-controlled 1984 government that uses effective cloud-control television with gladiator-type game shows. Arnold, in fact, ends up in one of these shows and has been on all sides with a little help from Amber, with good help and good looks from his two fraternities. <br /> <br /> It is not a big budget movie, but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere in the future, with some nice matte images and sets. It's a disappointing 80, but I find that lovely. Acting is varied, with Arnold's simple grace and half an hour, with the help of a linear facing the stone. The heroine Amber is a distinctly evil TV person named Damon Killian, who is a bit stereotypical, and subtly named. <br /> Despite all the flaws, the movie shows its message very clearly; The opiate of television masses is a good way to control people. This has for some time included some of the future digital video editing, allowing bad guys to change their faces in the video to deceive their audiences. <br /> If you see Arnold movies, you will know when to watch this. Enjoy.
