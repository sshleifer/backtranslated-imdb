A suspense thriller is somewhat similar to Deliverance for the scene and arrangement. There are some newly painted scenes and good music, though Duffness of one of the characters and sometimes not seemingly unattractive attitude is not enough for the situation, although this may not be a problem. It also poses interesting questions about the limits of revenge and friendship. <br /> <br />
