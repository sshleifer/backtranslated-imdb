The final fadeout in the theater marquee is also a descriptive symbol of the theater. <br /> <br /> Now in a lower DVD release, DEATHTRAP looks fresh and as usual as ever. The cast is correct (better than their theater) and the location scouts should be praised in finding a terrible horror house for our "one room, two action thrillers". Director Sidney Lumet, who is surprisingly simple and innovative ways to openly quit any "new" thing on the start and end of the movie and left it alone with Levin's bad twisty center. <br /> <br /> The final scene of the film is a major Hollywood exit from the boards, and slightly slimmed Lenin's theme from previous movie as a hell (about a bak): "Another woman used to play."
