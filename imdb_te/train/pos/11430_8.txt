Unfortunately, due to the US audience's tendency to withdraw subtitles, the film did not receive distribution or attention. Ethnic relations and particularly colonialism are harming all parties, overseas ties to the home of "her home", with clear dramatic tensions, Memorial memories of Protanista's childhood, and her parents, perhaps a "true" human being. I can not see her mother's relationship with this elegant man. There! Whether you are French or subtitles or not or talked or not, I've given you enough hook to take. I challenge you to be courageous, strong and understanding.
