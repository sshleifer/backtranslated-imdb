Here is a love story I love to watch. And mostly, it's for two reasons. One, it puts young people and young people in mind. People who are still in love with their teens and for the first time are at least considered. All of us are in our lives and "The Man in the Moon" is a great reflection on our memories, and added on some details and more than any of us enjoyed. The second reason is love triangle. And I believe that, like teens, it is very dramatic. And the story is very well developed that you love the characters really are in love, or they just believe they are strongly believed they love and believe in the rest of their lives, after a tragedy or occurrence. <br /> <br /> The cast of "The Man in the Moon" is filled with great skill names. It is in this film featuring a versatile actor Sam Watersen, who plays really tough district attorneys as well as a strict, yet caring and clever father. Tes Harper, Jason London and younger, Reese Witherspoon. You see her as a young and talented girl in her fourteen years old and you'll be out of ten years' road and will win her Academy Award. All members of the cast will remove great performances and enhance the appearance of real people in real situations, with the dialogue of compelling screenwriting. If it really happened. I want to see this kind of film. Love story or not. I like to see everything that is true and that is not fraudulent or unbelievable in any way.
