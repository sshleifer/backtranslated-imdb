I have moved deep into this film in many films. First of all, I say Clara Lago is the most valuable thing! Such a beautiful little girl. Her performance is also amazing. The truth of life and most human beings. I do not like the part of being smoked; I hope it's a fake prop. Either way, she was absolutely amazing and the story was so moving. I was in the story and in her role. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how this film really looks. I walked through the blockbuster and when I was walking she saw her smile on her cover. Fortunately I glanced down the direction that was in this movie! I said, 'Miracle, look at her!' I thought. I chose it and described the film as fantastic as "A Little Lift". I read the plot again and after that I thought I would look at IMDb first and then come back and take it. I'm glad I did not, because I will definitely lose. <br /> <br /> When I look for a movie with my friend, I know that I can not regret taking this movie, so I went back to the place I found at first. One week I started school this week, on my dresser and I did not really have any time to see it, but tonight was the perfect opportunity. I popped it up and started making beautiful cinematography, happy scoring, and starting the plot. <br /> <br /> In this film, I would like to mention a young man Juan Jos√© Balesta. He is great. Carol is the father who played the father, who unfortunately can not be listed on the site. His voice is very romantic and sensual I can realize his love for Carol. Although his performance was not prominent, I really felt the presence of his character. <br /> <br /> It's really fantastic movie. If you're the lightest, but emotional figure moveer, this is definitely one for you.
