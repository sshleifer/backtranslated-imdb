I'm still not sure about Freddy Kroegger, though I'm still going to make this show cool, night, night-night, no cable, from this program's inexpensive VHS tubbus, to night, night-to-commercials and everything - The first couple of episodes were originally the Rod Serling-Esquire Announcer. Instead, every episode is a terrible childhood, dating, cannibalism, dating, money, death, dating and ... alas ... Using traditional horror themes from dating is a special nightmare. <br /> <br /> When a young boy suddenly goes to a young stewardess house (a literally, they grow together ...), together with a strange man who says, "I love you" To find himself in his cabin, where he had the other stewardess full trophy room, and I had blind dates for hockey (and wounds and Penalties), certainly a terrible thing in the series. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) for an episode was a pizza trader who triggered a delicious new secret material. <br /> However, some parts are good. My personal favorite is "It's an Unfortunate Life", where a young man works in his parent's burger joint because he wants to go to college. Speaking of himself and doing little puppet programs with older cheeseburgers - by a weird guy comes by drive through and suddenly when his life is not the same until a late night. No, not Freddy, just a thug with a pistol - the whole mind-blowing episode turns out - past thoughts that pass through the kid's head ... along with a bullet. <br /> The second half of the same episode (Freddie's nightmares episodes have two vague short stories) and his girlfriend was also wounded, but the drive was not killed and "from joke to the hospital" - they were all the creepy hospital nightmare clots in Cram, And then some - from accidentally having your mouth sewn - or waking up during an operation - Log on and try to have a dead boyfriend lure you into the body for a little cuddle. /> <br /> Again, that is my favorite. <br /> <br /> Some episodes are in the episode. They are placed as a representative of the series, and then no one likes them, the show stunts, and then they will not leave anything in the video. This is only a vibrant life in the PL DVD in England - but I'm still buying it.
