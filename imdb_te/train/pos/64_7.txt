It is Paul F. Ryan's first and only full-length feature. He did not do any work. Nevertheless, he had an amazing collective cast to portray the characters in his story. I do not know when or when the idea emerged on his head, but Ryan later became his own directing "Home Room". <br /> <br /> Busy Phillips Alicia, troubled girl on her shoulders; We always see them in the television series. Dark hair and black dresses; A package of pocket cigarettes, strange look and disturbing eyes (of course, with decoration). An incident occurred in her school; A shooting. Some students died, and she saw everything. Detective Martin van Zandt (Victor Garber) is now investigating the case and as expected, Alicia is suspected. But the shooting is just derivative; <br /> <br /> Dena Cartwright (Erika Christensen) is bedroom bedroom. She is one of the survivors in the hospital. The script established their relationship, school principle (James Pikenes Jr.). He helped all students return from the event, but Alicia did not seem to care. She is alone. So the Principal will punish her; She needs to visit Deena every day for five days. <br /> <br /> This movie starts. <br /> <br /> I do not even explain how amazing this film is. I can recognize the characters and the conditions they live in; I like reality. These things can happen to anyone. And they fully understand what they say. They're growing and trying to deal with the things they have experienced; They're doing their best. Alicia (when visiting Denny for the first time) and Denny (when she sees her predecessor Alicia) begins a journey to define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life; <br /> <br /> Director Christensen and Phillips run their roles well. See the difference between them. Deanna seems innocent and plain ideas; There is no complexity in her mind. When Alicia enters her room and tons of tons, she asks: "Who took them?" "Many People", Dena Answers; A few days later they learn from the parents who come every week. Parents 'numbers are well represented, but their sons' characters are not so important. Dean is alone. Alicia appears mature and violent; Smoking cigarettes and talking roughly. But after a two-day visit, she finds herself returning to the hospital everyday; Dean sleeping at night in the room. After the fight for both of them, I said, "Why are you coming back?" Alicia is very lonely. <br /> <br /> The ending of the movie is a bit disappointing, without destroying it. It is something I can not wait for. It removes some of the strength to have the image. Revelation is absolutely unnecessary; Image that can destroy logical climax. It is an amazing script anyway; And in a magnificent direction. <br /> <br /> When Erica Christensen comes in, she needs a flying character. Her role in "Traffic" impressed, but it was a big step; The main character. Perhaps in this film she is not very likely to see, and it is pity. She has never taken a wrong step since then. She also came out with good performances in awful films. <br /> On the other hand, there are not many options for Bus Phillips and other characters who are very strong in the film (any transformation). <br /> I am Paul F. (In direction, curse), and I believe he will sit now on his computer to complete his new script; I'm waiting for his next movie. I'm hoping for the best of them all.
