In years I have not seen this film, so my knowledge is a little rusty. I do not remember thinking that this film was twice the braveheart film. It's just more realistic and more believable characters. Like Rob Roy, Risk Rai can guess like a shaggy hair and chin with casual clothes. Liam Nesson has a Celtic look about him, who looks like a Scott and more importantly looks like Rob Roy. This makes some people angry, but comparison to Mel Gibson as William Wallace is a comparison. Gibson is described as a man 6th foot 7 giant, and Gibson is almost short of foot. This story is a tale of love, conspiracy and underdog. Like Braveheart? Instead of saying "freedom", a film that invades the freedom and nationalism, it is the image that says honor, love and justice. It makes a more interesting picture. Similar to gladiator. The cast is amazing and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this effort. It's good with how it deals with heroism and humanity. Mary was raped and raped by a scene of real Scottish strength coming out of a burning house, she washed her sperm from her sock in a panic. Heroine does something in Braveheart. Overall this is an excellent and almost flawless watch. Look at it and see!
