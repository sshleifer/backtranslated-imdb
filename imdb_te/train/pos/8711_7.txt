It's beyond my comprehension that has improved for the very worst DVD release from Norway, and still like gems like this does not get shot at the possession of their past glory back. I'm very good, but this is one of the few Sexy movies made for Norwegian Television. The film is much smaller than the film's historic gem, which is the first ever foreign film ever. And, my word, Blindpassasjer first! Did anyone in the Ridley Scott or crew see the mini-series? However, the scenes are actually very similar. Well, the Norwegian film's budget is __uch_ low, but it worked well for the Norwegian film production of the 90s, which has been working at a desperate age.
