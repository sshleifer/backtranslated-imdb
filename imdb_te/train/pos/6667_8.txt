As well. <br /> If you do not like satire or black humor, do not see it. 2) You do not like if you're a watchman. 3) Do not see if you want a superhero film. <br /> You see the rest, run, walk, see _Mystery Men_. It's funny, it's quirky, it's the delightful distribution of every bad superhero clitch known to man. Joeane Garafalo, Ben Stiller, and Hank Azari, as well as a couple of amusing small pieces by Jeopre Rush and Greg Kinnear do not ruin the cheek little key fun into occasional exploits into junior-high humor. (It is good to see Louis Lasser's work.) I laughed all the way. Absolutely unexpected, slightly strange, but good.
