I first bought this DVD because I was on the cover of SRK and Aishwarya Rai and hey! Another movie starring Ishau and Shahrukh, I was told that I would only appear in an item number in the last part of Aishwarya in a song I shared with SRK and its role was just 15 minutes. The power mother is an image about love and endurance. This is a film about variants, ignorance, age coming, entering into the film and embracing the hard facts of life. There is nothing to do with an image number found in SRK and Aishwarya. It was actually a dream scene though SRK's drunken character was caught unconscious by booze. Aishwarya Rai is the sexiest street girl who shows her one day in her favorite hangout spot, wearing less, and starts to come back to him. The title of this song is 'Ishak Kamina' (Saraswati "Loves a Bitch!") And it's plain dust is hot! Do not miss it.
