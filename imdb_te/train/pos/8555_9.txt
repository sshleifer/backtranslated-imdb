* First of all, I do not think this is true, although this is true that many of the series say it is true, this one is ideally reflected in the 21st century teen mentality .It brings you the perfect opportunities to make you remember the smile and the good youngster of the times when you liked the characters have the same fun. <br /> <br /> * Does it agree that the film is a young man but the fact that funny movies can not be for teenagers in the days? ... There's a lot of movies to hang out teenagers; Plus, it's great to have such a movie during a sleepover or have a good time. <br /> There are many comments about nudity in the film. Well ... let's get real ... Do not reflect the ideas of teen guys like that from that movie? What do you want to see ... smart books, romantic stuff? <br /> If you're a teenager, watch the movie, and if you are still young or think about what you're doing as a teenager or you have to think about such things. Thank you for reading!
