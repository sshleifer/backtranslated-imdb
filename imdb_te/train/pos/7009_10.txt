I thought this was a wonderful movie. It touches every man's fiber. Love is very intense in this movie. I think it's Will's best performance so far. Great direction. + 1'd editing. Music is great. Good use of flashbacks. This picture is going to see everyone. I hope I'll get something wonderful from this. Overall, excellent picture. I want to do more movies with Hollywood material. Action films can also be a story story. I like the fact that his acting is very subtle. He rarely has a purpose and dedication. I see myself alone or with someone you really care about. For me, the world has stopped and my only focus is on the image. The outside world has been suspended for a moment. It's a good feeling with these chaos in the world. And with this generation, it's great to see someone (other) looking at others more than others.
