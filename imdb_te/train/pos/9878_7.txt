I have seen almost every review of this movie is very bad. It's not too bad, it's really nice but not great. Judy Garland's character was annoying, but she did not allow it. Somewhere along the line, I became a grown-up, cultivator, overacting Van Heflin at least 40 of the early. Judy's songs were good, but the film lost a great chance of showing more of their relationship. I gave up 7.
