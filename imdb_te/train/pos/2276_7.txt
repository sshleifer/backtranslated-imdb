If you read the Mother Night, it was a pleasure to watch the movie, which means you understood the basic element of Wanggut's writing - a vonage that is beyond the story, not a human mind on the screen. His white and humor is not merely written by screenplay or best acting performance. I believe that Vennegoot does not ask vital questions that are thrown out of his book, but often the cynical movements of satirical images on the page will not appear on the screen. Does this mean that the film will lose the mark? Not at all. In my opinion, the film was a success because it did not try to reconstruct the readings of the book (it was not the medium for a lazy to run a page). It takes the fundamental aspects of the story created by one of America's true artistic wealth and displays in a frame without acting. I saw other movie versions of Vanneget books, and the director obviously tries to show Vannagat's intellect and loses his own skill. I can not make this film the best I have seen, but it's good to stand on his own feet. Mother Night Knows his story brilliantly by taking the Voicegate's "voice" or trying to include it from the voice of the movie, and protects the basic lessons of the story without confusion, confusion or despair.
