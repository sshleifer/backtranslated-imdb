This performance is great. I like acting, funny bits and its pruning. Actors, Lee Paes, An Farell ... etc., they made great in the show. The program began with the first thought of the dead and unreasonable primitive idea of ​​bringing the dead in the first row, and the people said that the first few parts of the second series were in a pose, but later looked back anyway. And now I really hate that I'm going to cancel it. Why not allowing ABC to finally complete when all the episodes are already completed? I know what the story really is. This should give a chance because many of the people I love are still present.
