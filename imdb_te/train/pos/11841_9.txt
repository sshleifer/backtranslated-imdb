It's a great movie with good story. My kids (10, 7, 5, and 4) liked this movie with me. The music is awesome. No, horses do not speak, but instead, the story is told by the Spirit. <br /> I mean that title is "soul". This film really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. I would have my 4 year old boy and 5-year-old girl really touched by this film, and it had to say that, they laughed very hard, and they finally cheered for the soul. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the "Spirit" with your family and lifted your soul with this heartfelt story. Your kids love it. I also think of you.
