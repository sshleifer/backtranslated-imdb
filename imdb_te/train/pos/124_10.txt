<br /> <br /> "I loved this movie, and some use of tinting in the scenes seemed like an old photograph coming to life. For example, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife and she is estimated to be behind him in a simple split screen, her face is backwards And in the forefront of Leo. <br /> <br /> When this young men were killed on the train by the boys Ravensteen, the scene shot in almost a political poster style, with close to ups of the face.It reminds me of Battleship Potemkin's, the red spray to inform tons of horror without too much gore That extreme stable style was when his father appeared to be dead in the bathroom of Catherine ... Mira <br /> <br /> While playing Leo, it is one of the things that worry about Van Treer, the word "dwarves." <br /> The black comedy used in the film is better. Ernst-Hugo Jarrett was great as Leo's uncle. It brings snipers who came from his role in the kingdom (Riget.) This humor makes the plot of WW2 and absurd anal retentiveness of rail conductors easy to take easy, in a terrible background of all chaos. It reminds me of the registry that everything in the hospital organizer is trying to maintain a routine at one end of the course when it finally goes. It shows that some people really care about the terrible things that are happening around them. <br /> <br /> Some people, like Leo, have been tuned, but nothing positive about it. <br /> <br /> The voice heard by Max Van Sidov is very fun. It draws you into the story and you jump on Leo's head, which is sometimes a horror place. <br /> If you do not choose one in this movie, I also saw the idea of ​​using Dancer in Dorcor, where Bjorke does not speak to her and does not make her own. Actually, at one time, by the Vine Trier Waves and Dancer Breaking, the opposite woman seemed to me, but now I know that I can not bear very well with his male characters! I'm in the same place at the end of Donsor, if you want to rethink the main character's actions, but they will never do it!
