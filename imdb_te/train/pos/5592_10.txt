Haydie Lamar and Full Frontal Nagnath is known for its introduction to the world, but it is much more. In fact, it is one of the parakels of some movie poetry in the same prestigious group under the 1930s seminal work of the paintings, Paris, Tabu, Olympia, and L'Auntante Under the Roofs. It is almost a silent, heavily dependent on its fairy tales and is an excellent, symphonic score of Giuseppe Bexis. It is a masterpiece of cinematography and music, yes, and editing, directing, writing and acting. A good 90% film moves entirely. Macha is an expert in using motifs. Perhaps this may not be subtle and maybe a little more used, but things that appear insects, lights and horses look pretty ahead. Fortunately, unpleasant, with little smile of speech. They do not do the jar until they imagine. The last bit odd, to say the least. We recall Russian silence, we have labor montage. The meaning of this narrative just makes sense, but it is very happy to do so as I would like it to be very flawed. Extazi is an image for restructuring needs. This is one of the best films ever made.
