Lynch proved his enemies as his initial work "Elephant Man", and he tells a simple, simple story without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story of an elderly retired man (deftly played by Richard Barnarth) who now stands at the door of death and determines a tractor ride across some states to pay his final brother's final visit. A brilliant score from Badalamenti, a silly director's hand that reveals the delicate photography of the countryside life (that love the aerodynamic field shots), and the man's basic humanity is a beautiful piece of cinema. Its very slow pace may have a sleep break for some viewers, but along the way to ride it will eventually be rewarded.
