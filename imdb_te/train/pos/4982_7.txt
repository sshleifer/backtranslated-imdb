I love these "Diaper Baby" Movies! This film can not be made today and it's great in movie history. It makes it Goofy and the movie is made to make you smile. I know when and how they work these kids. I think they are valuable and the kids will laugh at me, but do the rest of the people who have shown the same in the early 30 years. When the cinema industry is too small, the stock market crashed, and the world began to slow down and you have to remember that these films were made to give a break from the real person. My perception is that you can see movies for five cents, but then there is a feast for 25 cents. It's a completely different mind set different time.
