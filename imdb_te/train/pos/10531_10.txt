I love this movie. Our friend Marcus and I were browsing local Hastings because we rented something we had never seen before and this decent film was dipped across. We did not know anything about it, but it turned out to be amazing. 2 thumbs. How the film was filmed, the actors were so much fun. If you're looking for a funny movie that will also suggest you run your local video store very quickly and find this image. I will tell you some of your favorite things but can you destroy this movie for yourself? This image is perfect in my list of movies. Who are you flying to?
