Very exciting and attractive, I began to look at it and found that it was impossible for me to turn around once. I am one of the most critically acclaimed critics, but I am very impressed with this film because it can almost wind the air and experience the shape of the places. <br /> <br /> From a cinematographic, I thought I was using great light and texture. From the orange color of summer light to the plastic rolled bed I had a different air of realism. <br /> <br /> From the perspective of the character, I'm almost inspired by Victor Vargas' sense, the story is very inspiring, all the other members of the family have a more full background, more intriguing in the main character. <br /> <br /> When that grandmother and grandmother receive such a situation, I can say that the situation is really real. <br /> <br /> I think this film worked for me because I started looking at the unexpected expectations. And reminiscent of the memories of the teenage emotion, a good value watch.
