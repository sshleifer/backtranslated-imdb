I saw this important serious movie tonight. Its Richard Gere and Claire's Dane's most important and best work. Gear deserves an overseer for a fine filming of a man who is forced into retirement as a sex offender registrar manager. Claire Danes claims to be the female gear handpiece he replaces - when he investigates an ultimate case, he attempts to teach him everything, in which Gere's character may be held captive by a man charged for his surveillance. This thing is surprising, sex criminals and overseers, but this film will not be forgotten soon. I know that I will have to chase through the role of Gear for a long time. Anthony Hopkins of a serial killer was terrified in filming and I was very engaged. This image opens with surprising statistics, so do not miss opening credits. Extreme and memorable. Man can prove Richard Gere's best role. <br /> <br /> It is very strongly filmed and gives the gear a deeper feel of a multi-layered. Give him an Oscar ... he deserves it!
