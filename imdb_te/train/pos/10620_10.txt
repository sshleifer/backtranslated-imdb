In the first view, I realized that this story is less painful than other Canon Movie Tales. After many, I think it's best. Some songs are very bad, especially love song, but two things stand out, singing the movie, are the best. One is the art direction. Like other Cannon Movie Tales, it is a beautifully decorated period; Each image of the film and the jewelry (both of which feature the main parts of the movie heroes) are fresh and new and contrary to the peasant's plain clothes. Also during the song of love I made the fairy, find the princess dress and hairstyle study. The other thing is comic timing. The film is very cheesy, but the pride of the emperor (ridiculing himself at the end), suspicious guard, guarded by the guard Nicholas, and the stupid prince, are very fun for everyone, and everyone is very ridiculous. And in the wave-a song the sequence is very good, but it is enough for the songs.
