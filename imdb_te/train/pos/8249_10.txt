My goodness. This film really shows the talent of the actors. Billy Connelly is ideal for his acting muscles. Really a wonderful man, if you look in redemption of a rebel, Boondock saints are a madman / killer, and then finally in Fido as a zombie! His character in Fido is absolutely fantastic, shocking from handsome! Carry En Mos is not hacked! A Hearty Warming Conservative 1950's housewife, a dark character jumping from profession to Montrices and Monto! <br /> Now on the storyline (spoilers do not worry). This film makes Max Brooks (author of The Zombie Survival Guide & the author of World War Z) glad to be happy! <br /> <br /> If you do not like zombies, if you're bored or you're too busy, watch this movie!
