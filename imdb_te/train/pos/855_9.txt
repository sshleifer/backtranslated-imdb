This film is amazing. Finally well-written characters you all love their good and evil. Pierce Brosnan is a flat-out historic in this self-influenced role. I think it's the best thing I've done so far. He performed the shades that have the ability to perform this type of work full-time, but this character finally gave the room to run it. I almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his lingerie and shoes. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are also very much wanted by the cast and seek a lot of cast. Keener is ultimately preferred by Goofy so that his turn was really delightful. You give good actors a good job and give something back to us more.
