This movie is truly real and random. It is difficult to find such films in films currently in Hollywood. I really enjoy watching this movie, I bought its DVD Tuesday this week and I've watched it 4 times. I love Paz's sponglish accent, which is really beautiful to her. <br /> <br /> The taste of my cinema may be really different from others but I really love this movie, it's simple! <br /> I've learned something more about life in this film (well, or at least in the life of the USA) ... life is really random ... sometimes, meet someone, they pass by your life and your friends are coincidental, Do not spend time, maybe for a while but u enjoy "while" with them, and then u and never meet each other again, but time u are really unforgettable Is the. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> The cost of making this movie is low but its meanings are not cheap. I rarely learn anything from movies, but this is no exception.
