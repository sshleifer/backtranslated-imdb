I love this TV series too. It has an interesting and beautiful animation. I believe I cut the TV, I can never find Cyberskiy and Data 7 whether or not, obviously they survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix is ​​the best TV show so far. I'm really glad I got to see so I know it's late for hope to start the series again. <3 <br /> <br /> It's about a woman named cybersix, she's not a man. She attends a teacher teacher at High School, Attorney Sealdon. Now cybersix is ​​actually a woman, she is just disguised as a man of the day. <br /> <br /> One person who created cybersix named Van Rachel, and once finds out that he is using everything he can to capture her. <Br /> <br /> IF never seen it before downloading it completely. It is the best TV show in the world. Why did they cut it? Some people have problems. But I'm happy to see 13 episodes.
