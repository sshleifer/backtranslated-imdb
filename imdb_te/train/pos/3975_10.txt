If you live in the 60s, this film is very painful and is very happy at other times. It is already present, but the small print of the counter traditional tabloids is prevalent at that time. These are still sources of a social revolution. They are still "one-chaining for the wheel still in the spin". The film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD, which at this time spread, which only influenced the intellectual evolution of handwriting, engineers, scientists and helped in hyper-development of computer related operations. A salute to a filmmaker there - an era more than you saw earlier.
