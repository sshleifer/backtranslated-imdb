Why is a good actress like Elizabeth Berkeley in this simple film? Casting Some Good Performance (Elizabeth Berkeley, Barbie Girl, El Keats, Mother and Justin Wollin, as a man who has been constantly downplayed by her embarrassment), but the direction is very boring and the story is not very interesting and original. I can not believe that this image is made for a bigger screen! Julie Carman (Producer): Are You Serious ???
