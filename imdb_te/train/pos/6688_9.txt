In the history of the films based on comic books, "Mystery Men" is one of the least expected. It's not a regular comic superhero movie! It is played by Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), Bowler (Zenne Garofolo), Schoweller (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azarayya) and Sleeve (Paul Rubens). "Mystery Men" are questions about various vague stories, secret documents, and secret signs, such as "Superman" or "Batman" of superhero films. Billionaires like Bruce Wayne are not superheroes, but there are blue-collar types of menial jobs and nursing home life. Director Kinka Usher seems to be doing something for the average viewer. I found the "Mystery Men" visually imprinted and very funny. Even though it does not become a franchise, it's still a joy to see!
