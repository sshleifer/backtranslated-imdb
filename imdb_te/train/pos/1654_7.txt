Soup Opera, a small town marriage worker in the local newspaper, is a leading female actress in her native playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. A ham, a wind bag, and a female bogus actor, a famous actor who visited her in her room in her room, gave her tips to her, but "experienced" herself. Her husband finds out and kills the person who leads to an unexpected death - which leads to a murder investigation and more unexpected: a life sentence for Kabhi. <br /> <br /> When you sleep in a trunk with her baby - you know that you are participating in a bargus carrying a one-day long trip to Broadway and her man to earn enough money to earn freedom. Case Francis has improved the strong and emotional performance of the film - it's pretty * well-crafted by Case Francis, a pretty interesting plot, perhaps a very far, but very dramatic film. Mino Gombel also played a very good role in her role, where she worked as an elderly "close to forty" cousin and cousin. Especially for Ke Francis fans.
