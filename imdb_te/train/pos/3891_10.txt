One of the best comedies. I have seen this presentation 10 times and will see at least 100 people. My friends and family quotes from this DVD are very often, you think you did more than just watch it. A part of the start about alcatraz is slow, but it or sends it to the side of the Edi platform. Look for part of "Cake or Death" (Jokes about the Church of England) and "Hitler / Pol Pot" (see, hard to explain). The best part of the show may be Edy's facial expressions. He can really say a lot of his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow maybe help, huh?) Fair warning: Four-letter words in Edie have a very throwing trend.
