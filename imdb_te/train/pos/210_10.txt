<br /> <br /> Great combination, especially comedies Matthew and Barnes. Little wonder why Burns win an Oscar for this; He is as sharp and funny as ever. <br /> <br /> With two older instrumental partners, they will return for a TV special, but previously no one else can stand. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to see the two pick of each other, and their scenes together have enjoyed the entire film. For me, I especially "knock, knock, knock / enter!" Enjoyed the scene. If you're a fan of Barnes or Mathou, it will also enjoy. <br /> In fact, you will enjoy the whole movie. <br /> Ten stars. Put a little "sunshine" in your life.
