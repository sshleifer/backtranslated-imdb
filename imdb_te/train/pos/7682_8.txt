Holly refers to the problem of child sexual abuse around the world (2 million children are trafficked every year) and without a more sensitive and overwhelming - a long line of achievement with the team at priority films. American actor Ron Lavington plays the role of Haley, who works alongside the newcomer Thai Nuugen, and brings people to the public in the sensational K11 reddish district of Cambodia. While it is fighting with a huge item, this movie has the motions of laughter and we hope to see the characters, it is very difficult to watch for two hours. I am happy to bring this issue to the world. Child prostitution should be stopped and this is a very good step. It's great and everyone should see.
