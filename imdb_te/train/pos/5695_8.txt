Some of the paintings will only survive alone - "Wonderland" is definitely one of those films. The script will throw everything into the pitch of the nearest fever, but it is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Director James Cox is the most outstanding way to work with his actors. Most of the characters are on the edge, and often because they are very ugly people. Wal-Kimmer described John Holmes as an active member and controlled. Kilmer does not have any offense, but his version of Holmes can be severely controlled by a weak mind. Whatever it was, it was a wonderful performance. <br /> <br /> Like "The Saint", in comparison to Kilmer's more "Hollywood" characters, he proves to be at home in brick house bricks. Specially women - there are various small performances standing. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth, and Lisa Kudrow have a limited screen time than their male, but they are pretty. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Kilmer, <br /> I'm stunned, feeling. Yes, this story revolves around John Holmes, but it's nothing literally in his career. Basically, this film is a murder mystery, and - it's amazing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 to 7.5
