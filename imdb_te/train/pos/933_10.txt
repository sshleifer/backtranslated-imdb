I saw this movie in the sixth grade around Christmas time and I'm really glad to see that, George C. I heard that there was Scott, I was really excited because I was really George C. Love Scotts! When I look at this picture of myself and my class, I'm really, and when it's over, I'm really impressed, I thought it was absolutely fantastic! The classic version of Charles Dickens's classic novel I have ever seen! George C. Scott's acting as Scrooge was something, I thought he was the perfect choice, he screwed, he was a perfect scrooge! I saw two different versions of a Christmas carol, the other one with Patrick Stewart, but it's fine! <br /> <br /> In the meantime, they are doing episodes! But the best part of the film is George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was the perfect one! He's the perfect Ebenezer Scout, I do not think they found anyone better! I do not think anyone would be good if I could replace anyone in the film! <br /> <br /> The film is the definitive film adaptation of the classic by Charles Dickens, and I really hope you agree, you think this film is fantastic! I'm probably going to buy this movie on DVD because I think it's totally fiction! I'll watch this masterpiece thoroughly! This is the best version of a Christmas Carol. <br /> <br />
