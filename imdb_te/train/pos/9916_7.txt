Edward Buttons is a Canadian photographer who makes artistic "artistic" things imaginable. Batteries, boxes, metal containers etc. Everyday objects - Most of us feel utterly beneficial and completely refusing without aesthetic merit - instead of the Cartinsku camera, the art of amazing things was changed. He achieves this effect by focusing on repetitive colors and geometric designs that are obviously in the industrial world - for enough susceptibility to identify them. When buried by Burtynsky's lens, collapses of the trunks of the trashed become objects of beauty (but do we already know from "Wall-E"?). He is particularly interested in portraying places like mines and harbors, where man has already infiltrated the nature - sometimes with his paintings (ie workers in those areas), with their uniform wear and robotic movements <br /> " , "A documentary about Burtynsky's work, a greatly colorful film about it A "Koyaisisats" about it as the dancers and samples dazzles us. In fact, Director Jennifer Bychwall and cinematographer Peter Matttler have captured the original photographs in the photograph, including their own camera records, Budins and his assistant photographs in China, a port in Bangladesh, and a huge three rivers George Dam Project in China.

In fact, the film opens with an amazing eight-minute long shot of the Chinese factory, where hundreds of cloth workers stay away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows. <br /> <br /> When the film narrates less of Burton's "themes" of his work, it is clearly, confusingly contradictory, contradictory and decisive as the best half-burned. But it's "completely made landscapes", highlighting the image and texture, "landscaped landscapes" echo the most. In the case of Burtynsky, perhaps, a picture is really worth a thousand words.
