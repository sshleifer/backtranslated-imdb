When I see this beautiful documentary I can not hold back the tears. It was heartbreaking, disturbing and inspiring. I recommend this document to anyone seeking something that makes them think about what they are doing in their own lives. Or just, something that makes you think. You see John living in the last two months of his life. You will see when he has spent his days with a positive attitude. At one point you start to see that you are really a wonderful person. He begins to understand that there is something to teach us all. His life and struggles can easily wake you up, laugh and get life in a day.
