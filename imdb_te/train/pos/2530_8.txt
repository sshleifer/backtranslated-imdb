The recent acquisition of the Bela Lugosi collection captures the attractive images of one disappeared Ray in the joys. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi team enter into meteorites and radiation, and science is completely absorbed (specifically camera technology uses Karolof, Jonas Ruck, to identify a specific asteroid site) and is obviously funnier because the movie is totally enjoyable because the rent does not pay attention. The effects take place well in time, acting is great, and the end is particularly strong. In the 1940s, Pulp science fiction comics and novels and '50s, completely reminiscent of ray guns and ridiculous science. You must watch this movie!
