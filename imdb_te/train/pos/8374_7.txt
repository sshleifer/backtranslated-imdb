OK, this movie is good. I do not think it's the best film ever made but it's definitely fun. My brother and I still work on the scenes at one time, and occasionally hang out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and pop it in the pop. Enjoying up to the end, but a great feeling. It's just a fun to combine all the criticism. Success for Judgment Robot Jokes
