<br /> When people ask me for the worst title I've ever seen, I'll reply to "Black afternoon" and no one can hear it today. <br /> When I was alone about 30 years ago I was 13 years old when my parents went out for the evening. <br /> <br /> I only show you once in the UK and I do not know what is available on sad DVD or VHS. <br /> If someone is looking for a copy please let me know. I have seen it again and it's probably a big disappointment, but it's always a little rare film in my memory!
