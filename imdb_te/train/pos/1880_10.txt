Dudley Moore is fantastic in this heavily unknown classic. The film is very attractive on the talent of the cast. Dudley Moore, John Gielgood, Liza Minnelly and others may be a disaster. It has not always been well filmed and sometimes a mood (musical like "psycho" in a marriage struggle), but acting surpasses it. Arthur has played a happy role with his drunken remarks. But he learns to live by his own free will and develops well in the well-rounded role. The finish is too wheat, though. I habitually give up, but it can be improved. Many times worth seeing.
