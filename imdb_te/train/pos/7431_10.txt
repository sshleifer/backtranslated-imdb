I am very entertaining by this movie. It's all my favorite movie of 1976. As raised in the 70s, I was in love with Chris Kristoffersons look and behavior, of course I was a film critic, but for the era of time, I feel very good. I'm like Stressand and Christophson's combo. I worked well together. I have seen the film a lot of times and I love both Esther and John Norman. I'm a huge fan of Chris and I see him in concert. What a talented singer song writer, not to mention, actor. I saw him in many movies, but I feel like a star again.
