I initially started seeing this anime did not think I could be something really interesting about bread, but thankfully I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this anime is that it is very ridiculous and very funny, some repetitive garments. This animate, soundtrack and character improvement are lower than average, because these inefficiencies do not appear too much in the first episodes, because the great work in the anime starts to show in the last 20 episodes, reactions and <br /> <br /> If this final episode ends with 52, I gave a 9, but the last episodes would just leave a bitter backdrop, which is unfortunate Tu blowing away the 50 episodes. <br /> <br />
