I saw the blob several times and one of the best low budget budget unleashed invasion films since the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A strange meteorite terrain and an elderly person outside a small town will go to investigate this. A typical jelly substance then comes with one of his hands and a young couple, arriving at the time of the asteroid land and carries to a local doctor where the old man is completely absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass of the masses. When these events report to the police, they do not believe the young couple and blame them for making all of them. The mass is now heavily in town's cinema, and when they go to the streets to throw everyone down, they finally believe them. It is then attached in a diner inside the young couple and some people. The blob is stopped by spraying those who breathe fire and it weakens its weakness. Then the aircraft is shipped to Arctic frozen wastes and disposed of there. <br /> <br /> "Blob initially played a good rock and roll style song And the atmosphere throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The sequel, Beware! The Blob followed in 1972 and a remake in 1988, but it is best of The Blob. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) is headed and made him a star and Corseta Plays his lover. <br /> <br /> Bob must all sci-fi fans. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 stars.
