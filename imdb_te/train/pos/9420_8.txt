One of the happiest jokes that Ealing Studies performed well in the man's 40s and 50s in the white suit. The plot of this follows a person who takes a dirty or broken confusion. In fact, this is a huge improvement in the clothing world. However, things that threaten many people's lives, including cloth manufacturers, cloth mill employees, and an elderly woman who washing every week, are not normal. Man in the White Inn suit is a film related to scientific progress, and they do not always help; <br /> "Why do scientists go alone?" <br /> <br /> Like most eeling comedians, Sir Alex Guinness is an actor. Alec Guinness is a wonderful actor; He has the ability to light up his presence (and literally in this movie), but he also maintains his characters to paint the land and reliably. In this film he is messy, and he captures the proper atmosphere for his role; A brilliant and ambitious, but a little naive scientist. In addition to Guinness, The Man in the White Suite is also the story of Alfred in Batman films as the deep voice acting alongside Jon Greenwood, Guinness, played only role in the divine "Kind Hearts and Coronetes" and Michael Guff. Acting in the film is not always good, but it's always good, and it fits the movie. <br /> Man in white suit is a brilliant, thought-provoking and witty comedy moral. Comedy is not always clear, and it does not always work, but the movie is not a stimulating movie, so it's a forgery. Anyone who is a fan of movies, I am mainly recommending this film.
