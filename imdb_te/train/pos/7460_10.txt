I have written many Tom Cruise's fantastic movies (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut), but Verina Sky is definitely its own film. Many said it was unreal; That's not. It's different and confusing but it's not unrealistic. Weird Stanley Kubrick or Polly Shore. Different Truman Show. Confusing matrix or game. And unlike Kubrick, this film is the end. Everything makes sense - probably not immediately, maybe even today, but it makes sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because Daniel Aeyms (Tom Cruise) is confusing. That's something. The critique of the distinctive "strange" name has come. Where they see it as they are bothered to "open their eyes" as the original film of 1997. If there is not enough reason to see it, go to music. Cameron Crowe offers an excellent soundtrack; He uses it to set "feel" - a deadly element that contains many movies. With songs like The Boy Boys' "Good Vibrations" in the dramatic and emotional climax scenes of the film, he creates an offbeat and is surprisingly "right". In a fairytale film, its script, music, acting and film, Vanilla Sky is a surface bandwidth, in which critics appear brilliant. Excellent: A +
