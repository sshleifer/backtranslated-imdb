This film is surprising. I did not expect to be honest. The first Hollywood movie of Greta Garbo? What is that? <br /> <br /> Low-level silent movies are often tough and simple exaggerated hand-moving and facial contortions. <br /> I thought it was wrong. The Greta Garbo studio was as surprised as she was doing, because the film was star and appropriate to her. She has consistently understood the power of standing still or has a meaningful expression of the long running moment that can experience its effect and can not be seen. I'm thinking of myself, how did this modern actress come into a gorgeous silent film? <br /> <br /> The story is not as interesting as it is a simple story of love and it is lost. It gives Garo's appearance as a poor village girl who makes good in the big city of Leonara, returning to get the man who came away, it gives life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is a waitress, but his role is not really developed and he is revoked by the script. At one point, he is ready to wear garbo clothes, leave it in a huff, come back and give them back. And Garo and then his wife do not talk about his terrible final scenes. Way is very common, and he is not very long after, and I understand why. <br /> <br /> He is the only mysterious object of Leonara's siege. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the best thing in the film. "Leonara, you are clearly changing." Yes, really clear. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what this is without looking at all the pictures, let's look at the last 30 seconds - Gaby's glance is everything that stands alone in her luxury car. "She must be very happy, she has everything she wants" - Yes, Garbo's face tells about it. I'll watch this again, Garbo is simply amazing.
