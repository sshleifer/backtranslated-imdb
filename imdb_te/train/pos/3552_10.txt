I want to add the value of my two cents, if you've forgotten me that something I've already posted, but I think it's a reminder of Damon Runon's Ellivin 'intellectuals. Without a marvelous street, Daman Ryan's did not make this film - or other great classics dealing with gamblers & before the 1960s. Damon Ryan served as a newspaper man and he is Colorado, but he is definitely the Street View of the _get_ East Coast. Even if you are not a fan of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend some other images from Damon Rouion; "The Legendor Kid," and "Little Miss Marker," both are Bob Hope, a funny man who has left his politics. (As a West Coast Liberal, I find his politics very funny, too!) Damn Runyon's lives !!!!
