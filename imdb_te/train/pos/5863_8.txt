After 15 years of the Vietnam War, "Jack Pi" is too late or unusable. This is one of the few attempts to deal with the second woeful side of the war: after time. The film allows viewers to face different opinions on Vietnam Whites from films such as "Taxi Driver" or "Rambo", used to present their main characters as bad leaders after the war environment. Their development is very precisely shown before and especially after the war. Problems are clear but all this tragedy is always the feeling of some hope based on love and friendship. "Jack Fi" may be a silent Vietnam film, but it is really acceptable and legitimate after almost 15 years. Moreover, we can assume that the war does not end; <br /> <br /> The three main characters are fantastic. De Niro has done one of his best jobs but Ed Harris is the film's actor. Maybe it's his best performance.
