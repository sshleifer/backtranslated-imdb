I do not understand why the reviews of the movie are bad around the world, I'm not my rocker. I found it unhealthy, intelligent, twisted, mentally sophisticated. You do not come deep into the mind of a crime psychological mood in Hollywood film than this. It consists of layers in layers, acted by stone, and even after completing it, there are plots that you can imagine. People want Sharon Stone 48 and Michael Douglass is not in this regard. When I see people themselves, this film is expected to be a huge hit on DVD and I will stop caring for professional critics' attention. Give it a shot, you may be happy!
