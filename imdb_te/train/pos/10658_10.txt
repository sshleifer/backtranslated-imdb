The only time I saw this film when I was 10. I have not remembered this year because I have not been sleeping for a week or so after watching. This is exactly the case. I'm on vacation with my in-laws in the FT. Worth, Texas and I will never forget. Now, 48 years later, I try to make a copy for my daughter to be an adult. It has a lot of research to find any movie but I have always remembered that it was Barbara Stanwyck and finally got its name and reviews. I enjoyed it, but it's very scary! Jaqui
