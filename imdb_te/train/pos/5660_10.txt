When the show was actually broadcast I saw the episode or 2, and I also hugged when I saw 1 episode in Netflix. I saw the whole day in 2 days. :) I really liked the role of Gary Cole. First he is completely reprehensible when you start to prefer the character ("These Things Thousand Uses")! His folk Andy Griffith meets Charles Manson, a great man. Charming, attractive, rich, and dangerous type and "kind of" means I really mean "mean". As I grew up, I was like him. Lucas Black is great. The tones are very good. However, I always thought it was one of the best TVs and owed you to see it.
