When I was young, I saw this film and remembered one of the first movies I really like not being a movie or comedy. So, in my later years, I decided to look again, let's see if it's just nostalgia or that it's really in the film. To my surprise, this was my first film. This is a great movie. Emotional right amount, some jokes, nice songs (and not really great, and why I do not remember a musical explanation of reality) and all in all great use of my time. The last film in my re-creation also saw my minimum demands of a good film in the second class and I have not yet completed the film because I've shouted today. My dog ​​may have recently died and maybe not, but the most important thing is that it made me feel and the filmmakers make movies (that and money, of course). Yes, there are constant glitches. Yes, the script has holes, but it does not matter. The picture is also pleasant and cool. So do not be sad for people who are looking for bad things in life, because nothing is accurate, because this film is not correct because 10 is not. It comes to 10 because I feel it.
