Wow, this film had a big impact on me, which shook me. It's a fabulous story about a girl in Cambodia sold into the sex trade. I can not stop thinking about the fate of a little girl named Holly. The film setting is realistic, the movie is an eye opener, and I can not imagine anyone going out of it that wants to help change this horror problem. <br /> <br /> The picture is very moving. This is one of the best movies I have seen this year. <br /> <br /> The girl who plays the role of Haley does her work with her character. Ron Livinstein gave a spectacular performance. This film has moved me to tears, which tells an important message to be heard around the world. Everyone should watch this movie. I think this film makes a difference, I love it!
