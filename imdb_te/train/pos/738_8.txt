And it's a great rock 'roll film. How it originated (to be a movie about disco), which is one of the final films that children want to come out, but is mainly on their way. The Alley Freed Chuck Berry is a wallet for a new dance of the day and Tuesday Weld to prove the role of rock & roll music for kids when it comes to the princess. Forward to 1979, the same plot was repeated in the DA RAMONES, which became one of the most influential bands of the quarter of the century after the absorption later (and then the duty DJ guest shot, for "real" Dan Steel). Roger Komman's all-comedy comedy-extortion film, including two days of shooting schedule, is known by some known Carmen Repertory players (such as "Bucket of Blood"), such as Clint Howard, Mary Worno and Dick Miller, and you've got one of the greatest studio movies of the day. Use deliberate cheesiness and it is one of the few movies that gets away. I remember seeing the parts through a Stoner-induced Fog in Drive-Driver showed new DVD to only friend, and he agreed to one of the greatest movies drunk, not least for mermaid, celebrity ladies and great Ramones footage.
