I first saw it being performed ten years ago. I have seen again this day and have made a big difference to me. She fought alone, Caitlin (played by Tiffany Thyssen), Jesse (played by David Lipper), raped by a classmate who suffers from hitting girls. Caitlin is in a prominent high school group, but when she is revealed she heads the Ethan (played by Brian Austin Green). <br /> <br /> The film reflects Caitlin's struggle against the whole town <br /> <br /> Athletes, including high school, determine the social environment, allowing them to stay away from what they want. <br /> <br /> Thesis and Green top artists, throughout the entire film. All actors who have been inspired by genuine events have done a great job. She fought alone, which binds the essence of the high school (at least in 1995) and holds self-esteem and prestige in stake. Recommended. 10/10
