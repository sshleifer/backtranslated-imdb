As someone already mentioned here, every scene in the film is a gem. Most films are lucky to have a perfect view, but director Jueson is run every time. The cast has earned the right to excellent script and, moreover, the musical settings of Dick Hyman's opera and another music are designed for a perfect match. The length of the film's production is expected in the length of the film they imagine. Humor is subtle (mostly), and the camera-work reflects every little emotional story. Cher was such a comedy, Vincent Garderia (I saw him most of all his family and then saw that Broadway in his 80 years) and he was far more lukewarm than ever, and the untold defeat of the iceberg at the time when he came to showcase the spectacular actors in Io. <br /> <br /> Does the author ever write about this film? Hard to figure out why the average rating at IMDb is below here ...
