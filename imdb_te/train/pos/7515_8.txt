I know Batty Page for so many years. Since the 1950s, her soft-headed romantic films have become iconographic and still have a strong draw today. The "Betty Page" look is still the most popular in the world, and today it is unique as it did. So I'm just getting a little bit familiar with this movie. <br /> <br /> It is very fun to watch the entertainment of the movie of real people like Irving Klave, John Willie, and Bunny Yager. All today are considered trail blazers. Marie Harron made an excellent job of creating sexually abusive and deceptive atmosphere in the 1950s America, according to today's standards, seriously innocent. I especially used Monochrome versus Color Betty found herself for emotional and spiritual atmosphere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Betty looked pretty, did not look laughing, and enjoyed dressing in "crazy costumes" for the camera. Underlying sexuality and deeper emotional desires have completely lost her. <br /> <br /> To date, she does not understand "Fuss About About About" when she comes to her images or S & M content. <br /> <br /> It means that she is illiterate or simply "never" about herself and herself alone. Do not harm. Batty Page is just herself. <br /> <br /> The 1950s social atmosphere was shot by Ms. Harron and co-authored with Guerver Turner, and I'm really enjoying that day and I am living in that age. Combined with the huge ignorance about our sexuality with hypocrisy and oppression combined with all the frightening stifling world. The film is well captured and Bettie brings her incomplete belief and that she is suffering from unchangeable innocence. <br /> <br /> The film is slowly going from time to time, and Ms. Harron is fine with them. I recommend this film with Bettie Page, who does not know who she is and how she has influenced American culture. Those who have such interests should see this film.
