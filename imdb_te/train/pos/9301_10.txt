I first saw this dark comedy in cable TV 2000 or so. What a surprise and joy! Everyone is secretly armed with the film! Dreyfus plays the role of "mental" dan (reminiscent of New York Dan who is considered Schizophrenic or art mimics life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are with their most beautiful and NOT dolls! That beauty and strictness is a proof! Then there is a great "Bullshit" scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldbull (Rita and Mickey), where they play the world with "Bullshit". The film is subtle and bald. For all the shooting, it will be very quiet image. And, you have the opportunity to see many actors in their late or near final roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pierre. Henry Silva. It is not for everyone. But, if you like a movie that keeps playing the word too much and keeps moving everything without blowing everything in the picture, it's a picture for you. Roger Ebert Dumps in the film. He was flat wrong. It's fine, the best movie! Perhaps not for Ebert. I thought it was a 10 of how good and how much fun the script would be, not really a simple comedy movie. I like the very good I bought it on DVD because I did not show much on cable TV. Now, it's my whole!
