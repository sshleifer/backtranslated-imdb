This was the first review I had written with IMDb for me, but I liked the film in HBO and I'm glad to see it. Richard Gere works in this movie as a very interesting person / detective. I think the story is good, slowing the movement of the movie. Some parts of the film associated with Demented Sex slaves are pretty shocking, but if you see a crime movie like Se7en, you'll be stuck in the scenes. <br /> If you are looking for a good detective / suspense film, IMDb should watch this movie in a low rating.
