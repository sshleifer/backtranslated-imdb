Haanting is truly an image of a creepy house, a good deal of work and sound work, and everything around them is true and that house. There are scenes that you can jump on, and the terrible things that formerly went to Hill House, I found interesting. There are real creepy moments in the film and I liked the way she demonstrated the ghost sheets, curtains and the house themselves. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave the right climate and movements around you in the sound design. I wish I was a little bit worse. With the PG-13 rating with Jan De Bont and I think he's got a little more back. When I watched many years ago, the polysteist frightened me crazy and still had it. Hunting may use some more scenes of pure terror. The end is a little anticlimactic for me. Overall I enjoyed it. Acting is good and there are moments that you can jump. I'm more afraid of myself.
