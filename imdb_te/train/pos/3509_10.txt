I have seen this film for a while and still on my favorite movies list. You do not have to be hesitanic because people do not really understand this movie like you put it awesome and really like the movie you like detailed tip bits (like a cup of washing her glasses hair like 'Cafe Bustelo' coffee crate). It is one of the most culturally unique and one of the most exclusive films. Please do not bash this image if you are not already aware of any foundation on your foundation. I saw what I was doing entirely for the writer or the director, and he perfected the goal! The film is eligible for the best ratings.
