The film is full of laps around the original dolomite. It has everything that makes a movie great .. except for real actors. (Elnie Hudson can not be alone and you know!) LOL I agree that I killed my first video tape of this movie and plan to buy the DVD version as soon as possible! This image has too shy lines! I'm embarrassed to say that I know the back and forth theme song! I loved the role of Jimmy Lynch and he needed to win the Best Supporting Actor Award in Blaxploitation, but Oscar was not ready for this! It is a random picture of crooked cops, braces, chains, bad editing and of course martial arts. (It is 70 and I can say that everyone knows the kind of martial arts). I think the film should be restored and I want to show one night in the local theaters a marathon!
