If you ever seen a trailer for "The Recruit" movie with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you'll never have to watch that movie. <br /> <br /> The Renaissance story is about a detective who investigates a young woman and a medical investigator. This arrangement is futuristic paris, and science fiction elements throughout. The most important thing about revival is its visual style, not its story.

Also a watchable story.
