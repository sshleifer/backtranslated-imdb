It's not wise, sensational or innovative, but 'Dog Days' is a very fascinating role for some reason. It is like a crash tripping in heroin's bad dose, but not really. It is the Austrian film following the lives of many depressed, disturbed and annoying individuals and their abusive relationships with one another. It's upset and still very well acted and it's interesting to see these little things silly little things. Not exactly for the weak mentally, this most pessimistic film does not end at the end or reveal, we see these innocent lives in just two days. Grade: B
