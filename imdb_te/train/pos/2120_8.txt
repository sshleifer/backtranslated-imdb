<br /> <br /> James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan are co-workers journalists in a Budapest gift shop, they do not really like the rest of it, comedy is very appealing, with two favorite stars and very enthusiastic cast. The story is well written and the romantic innocence of the film (not known how to explain it) are not present. <br /> <br /> Everything is necessary for viewing Christmas, I do not think it's a good way for a jumpstart to Christmas. Feel better than this little gem.
