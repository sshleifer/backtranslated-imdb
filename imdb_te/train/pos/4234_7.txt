<br /> <br /> Many of the "Planet of Ops" Tim Burton's worst movie and me told me that it is much weaker than the original films. So I decided not to see. My friend, who has not yet seen the movie, advised me to look at it as this TT-Burton-Movie and Tim-Burton-Movie. <br /> <br /> The remake of the famous film like "Planet of the Apes" is evident that it is automatically affected by business idea. Also, Tim Burton's motion portrays his weird simplicity as "Beetlejus" or "Batman". <br /> <br /> If you like Burton-movies, even if it's a few flaws, it's not difficult to like one of his films: nude-rocking monkey skeels, over-dressed apes and a prominent actor, without difficulty. <br /> <br /> We are the first What are the answers to the question: What happened when Tim Burton was instructed to rebuild? For the first time, if Burton did not say that it was not from Burton, it was not remade from the beginning; It is a 're-imagining'. On the other hand, Burton knows that every filmmaker of his film has seen the first film version of Charlton Haysten (man), and that Remake is not without its model and that two films can not be stopped. Comparable. That's why he gives this film with this comparison every moment. G. By referring to quotes. Burton made a brilliant job of answering the original first question about the story-line, and then ended the audience with the disappointment by destroying all the audience and ending the film? And here's the spoiler ?? Leo returns to earth and finds himself in a world that appears to be ruled by elephants in the world. <br /> Now, the Bastonescu answer is the expectations of people they caught because of the surprising, surprising end of the first 'Planet of the Ops.' One end, more unexpected, more awesome and: totally confusing, because? And here am I different divergent planes with different Apes'- Homepages and Plots ?? It does not make sense of it. It does not understand, or it is very complicated that it is not as inefficient. Tim Burton is playing his cruel games, he has a grin and he does well. Burton fans would like it, others can complain about cheating and some manism. Well, and I do not think the producers always ask Burton to direct the remake again?
