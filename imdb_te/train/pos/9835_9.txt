Blocks off me just let me say that I'm a little zombie fan and I'm not doing the advertisements like lightly. The second is that this Italian Italian film and full-flick is directed to Bruno (Rites, Night of Terror) in advance for 15 minutes. This is not the dawn of dead folks. <br /> This is one of the most entertaining zombie movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is amazingly terrible. Check two scientists trying to find an antidote ("try to combine these two molecules"). <br /> <br /> All types of zombies come in. From shafillars, to capture maniacs, for birds! <br /> <br /> The legs are bumped, the hands are broken, the stomach opens. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​up the pace, and then fly after a zombie attack. <br /> <br /> Then the fridge is in the head. Oh head in the fridge! <br /> <br /> You already have to know whether this type of film is the sort of person you love. <br /> <br /> Do I know about the head in freddie?!?!
