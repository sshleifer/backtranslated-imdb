This brings to mind the exact opposite of horrific childhoods from Stephane King's works and stories like IT. There is no fear in this childhood - all friends - still up to 20 years old - feel remembered or suffering. Line-up is described by all friendly jostling, perhaps periodically described by one or more "picking up", but all are forgiven. Where the film * was not embedded * The next participants describe relationships - we all young people are basically the same person. More mature, but basically still the same people, and the same power structures. <br /> Completely amazing! In fact, people can not be relatively successful with social gatherings, even friendships can eventually end up. In this case the film is a small pearl - assumes that it is the intent of an image: the image of people who are filming obscene emotions. Violent resistance in bowling for combine is easily cold, but since the mid-80s, children and adolescents have grown up with admiration (cinematography, animations and series direct children are directed directly). Many films and documentaries are black shoulder Succeeded in filming - misuse, loneliness, push for exaggeration - in adults with dark and twisted minds. /> <br /> And here comes an image, it says: It will have a happy childhood, look'a'here <br /> <br /> Thank you for this. <br /> <br />
