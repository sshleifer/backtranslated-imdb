Maybe my all-time favorite movie, unselfish story, sacrifice and dedication to a great cause, but not preachy or boring. I have seen 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lucas's performance brings tears to my eyes, and Betty Davis, one of her very few really sympathetic characters, is a pleasure. Children are, like the grandmother, look like "dressed midgets" rather than kids, but it makes them more fun to watch. And what is happening around the world and the slow awakening of the mother under his own roof is believable and startling. If I had a dozen thumbs, they would be "up" for the film.
