The ridiculously funny and twisted film about a small town in Peakler Baltimore, whose daily, huglum routine is broken by Pierre, a young photographer who takes pictures of "original things". No beautiful models, no beautiful men, just hard living. This spectacular film is fun in the plastic chain of urban art. Pierre's mother's savings shop has a special scene where a homeless woman in the shop bought five hundred dollars instead of just 25 cents in the same garment Whitney Art Junkies. This shows you that you can never taste any kind of money. Once again, John Waters will send you into a constantly spiral of laughter and raw reality. You may have your mainstream Hollywood imagery with exclusive influences and celebrities, but give me a "Titanic" or "Godgill" day in "peeker" or "harespray" (another superb John Waters film)!
