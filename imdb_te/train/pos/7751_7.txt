I really liked Tom Barman's AWTWB. You have to write it down and enjoy it, and it does not expect anything. As it sits on a caf√©-terrace with a beer, in the summer sun, and go by looking at people. It certainly does not make you think later, it's true, but it's not a necessity for a good image. <br /> <br /> There are a few strands that I can do a little more, but I do not care much because being a lynch fan! <br /> <br /> I loved the film * or flair of this movie. It's soft, but fresh, and soundtrack is a beauty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
