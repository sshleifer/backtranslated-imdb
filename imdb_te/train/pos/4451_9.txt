The maze of the story is very simple: the old man living in the woods accidentally makes a mistake on the murder of a little boy and attempts to persuade the police to be killed. Even though a very small dialogue was provided throughout the film, the film's eye-catching visual narrative made the film more appealing. The setting in the gray woods is a sense of loneliness, which completes the calm of the characters. <br /> <br /> In fact, even the inability of the old man to understand the murder of the murder police with the inability of the silent murder case can also be understood as helplessness. <br /> <br /> The honest horror is disappointment, helplessness, and irrationality. <br /> <br /> If this narrative is slowly slowing down, it can be explained by the visual effects, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood to use other bad horror films. To build up stress for some creepy and startling moments. The end is also unexpected and believable. English horror films such as "The Ring", "Dark Water" or "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents", a film of Japanese horror movies, provides a true atmospheric horror experience. <br /> If you do not see the images above, you might want to give them up. Try it well.
