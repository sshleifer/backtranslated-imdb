I can not understand your objections to this film. This is a tactile, thrilling extension of the character created in "Basic Instinct". Just part of this story is unrealistic, the role of Sharon Stone is still alive and is not in jail at the end. <br /> <br /> Spiele Alert: When the movie progresses forward, we have presented with three theories of what's going on: 1) Sharon Stone's role is killing these people because of her crazy (risk slave); 2) David Thewlis's killing of these people to diagnose Sharon Stone's role; 3) David Morrissey's analyst takes revenge on these people. There are no theories as "true" story. (An analyst is a psychiatric care center killer, killing the only one on the screen). <br /> <br /> This "2001, A Space Odyssey." Who Is the Truth? The blonde is really crazy, the police is really curly and the analyst really wants revenge. The interaction between these and other characters in the story is important. As with real life, it is more complicated than everybody thinks and realism is much more complicated than cinema. Get on with it!
