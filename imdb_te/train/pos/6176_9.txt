The Spirit's 1986 TV film is a pilot for a possible series. However, the creator of the Spirit, Einner, did not like the film, and therefore did not produce any series. I thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the comic's spirit (sorry) with a modern twist. Sorry, it did not materialize in one sequence. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones is the perfect soul. Nana Visitor went to a good Ellen Dolan and of course after Star Trek: Deep Space nine years later. Probably the release of Frank Miller's big screen version of Spirit, most people can see this rare gem of Spirit History. When it comes to an image from Hollywood's existing role or idea, someone desires the previous versions of the asset and releases it to the video to make some dollars. When Antonio Bonders wears Zorro's mask, we have gained the hero's previous versions of the maiden DVD, such as the great Alain Delan version of the 1970s (all copies I saw were radically modified). Someone expects TV to release The Adventure of the Spirit shortly on DVD.
