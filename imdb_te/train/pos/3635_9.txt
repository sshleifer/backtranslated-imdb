It's a big Disney Flick. This is the story of an elderly high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid), who once went to the big leagues as a pitcher, but suffered a stupid career. But through a series of events, Jimmy Morris (Quaid) tries with a major league team and does a roster. This is a great family film. It is inspirational, but not too thick. It is fun and entertaining. I am sure film producers have taken some liberties while telling stories. However, Quaid is notorious in the title role, you can enjoy a whole family whole family, see no further 9/10
