First I thought I would look at the IMDb and tried to imagine the movie like Cover Elfant when I wanted to see this film when it comes to my guide. <br /> <br /> Although I do not like the role of Alicia, who played a brilliant role by BC Phillips, I realized what the film would do to create a relationship between Alicia and Deena. Diana, who played Erica Christensen throughout Alicia's almost entire film, is facing the gun but faces a gunfire despite having a gun. They share a loneliness and the film is so beautiful. <br /> <br /> I said I love this movie and will make positive comments about it. I did not even go through Elephant, as the Columbia tragedy seemed to be enjoyable. On the other hand, the film is compelling and original. Busy Phillips acting chain! This is a good thing and I want to see her progress in some more mature roles.
