This program does not appeal to everyone. Sarah makes her wants; She does not ask permission and she does not apologize. This is a joke with a group of zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. The star of the show is not the hero, she is a spoiled, big mistake. If you can not appreciate the offbeat humor offered, the show is probably not for you. Everyone should at least give this presentation a chance. This is the creative powers of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehan (The Comedy of Comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve AG (Bob Stewart's St Stage) and Rob Scrab and Don Harmon's creative powers (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). This is an emerging online community that displays the best talent of channel101.com. (If you come into this program, keep an eye on the "acceptable media branch" in March vh1, which is taken from the same talent. <br /> <br /> See the presentation of Sarah Silverman, the future of entertainment.
