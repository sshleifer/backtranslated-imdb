Music and Laurence Oliver's sombre delivery is definitely tone set for this amazing documentary. It's still the WW II buffs, the participant's successors of that controversy, the politicians who are always going their way through when they extend their foreign policy through an aircraft carrier (you hear that George Bush?) And to know who's interested or on some of the issues related to that controversy There is no need. 26 episodes are almost chronological, but can be viewed from the order as they are more or less autonomous. New viewer is bound to have a new insight because the size of the submitted size. The original footage of the struggles will be accompanied by participants' interviews. Most of the interviews are with second-line executives, such as the main characters, privates, captains, secretaries, eyewitnesses, and others. <br /> <br /> I'm now looking at the DVD version of the original television documentary. I am strongly available for this wearable, gapattotte, overpriced VHS offers available in eBay. I paid $ 120 Cdn for five $ 2 DVD DVD discs. This new release contains bonus material and is in full screen mode. Menus is easy to follow, the first of any episode selection you'd like to see after selecting whether you have given the choice of different chapters in the episode or playing the whole episode. Navigation's navigations on the menu can be understood more with such a comprehensive presentation, but the impact you see is not reduced after 30 years, 60 years after the end of the war. I had a copy of the first broadcast at Buffalo PBS station before I left London in 1975, and I had a copy of that time. Now my desire is finally come true. <br /> See this documentary. Tell your friends. Buy a copy for your library. Remember and respect the sacrifices and challenges that have succeeded from other countries and peoples of America, Russia, Britain, Canada and others. What eye opener.
