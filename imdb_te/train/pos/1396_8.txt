One of the main examples of a suspenseful, dramatic episode (in this case, the excellent balance of terror), with a lightweight affair, Shore Leave is the first genuine attempt on behalf of Star Trek writers, science fiction, and the formula is still incomplete (true success, Trouble is there), the spectator allowing for all illness Smiling'd like as long as it comes out pretty fast. <br /> <br /> Diverting from the tradition of the show, the enterprise is not the right thing to do in this episode. Instead, Kirk invented a perfect planet to spend some time with his staff: a three-month break after a long period of continuous work. The planet like the Earth (the budget-related fact) is very attractive, but only takes a few minutes before the unnatural event: Dr. McCoy begins a white rabbit visions that bring out the work of White Lee's Carol. Soon, other people enjoy the same things: a woman has the character of Don Juan, who easily runs with a samurai, and Kirk faces a dual encounter in the past with a loved and used person. To pick him up in the academy. Throw in an autonomous tiger, and Kirk and Spock is easy to see why it's determined to determine what's going on before someone hurt. <br /> <br /> The idea is to be a classic one: the idyllic place is to stay away from heaven. The comic strip on this subject is not a success, but it is not all that is good for acting, and the overall reluctance of the cast (especially, and ridiculous, if not the happiest William Shutner). Another well-known example of the authors of the new, previously unseen contents of Shore Leve is the Unique Identification: Definition of Star Trek Success. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
