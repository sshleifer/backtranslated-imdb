Christopher Lloyd is "all the head angel" funny and really trustworthy. The film is much better than the first, but has great special effects, the first one does not have a better plot and writing. <br /> Okay - written for the kids, but the adults do the kids very happy. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is really good and very human in his emotions, as well as showing some real acting talent. For change, it's a fun change. <br /> Watch at least once - trying to capture it.
