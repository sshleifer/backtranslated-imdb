This movie is the best movie I have ever seen. Being LDS I highly recommend this film because I feel more about Joseph Smith's life. Although the film is not made with highly acclaimed actors, it is a great and lifelike movie that everyone can enjoy and appreciate. I saw this film with my family and I can testify that we have all the heart changes. Life This prophet allows people to understand how difficult it is for the prophet and how much it faced. After watching this movie, there is not a single dry eye in the whole room. I have seen everyone touching what they saw and I have not seen it since. I recommend this film for everyone.
