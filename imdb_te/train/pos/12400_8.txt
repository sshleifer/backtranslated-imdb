It is the second animator short, and the first one is called 'artwork'. It contains a lot of references, metaphors and icons in a dense amount of materials, especially for 9 minutes. I listened to some complaints that this was "anti-human" or attempted to hate the man for their "sins against the machine". I do not think it's true; This just uses robots to show us, like humans, we are not particularly acceptable or open minded by anyone different from us. I said I would do that great work. The storyline is good ... it plays as a historical document, explaining what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. This is why it has clips from virtual news reports and clips. Voice acting is great, it does not. The animation is good, and the use of color makes it more open to make smooth transitions and other surreal images, even though it is a realistic drawing style. It has many bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals, as well as a small nudity. Disc commentary is a subtitle rather than English and is worth listening / readable. Based on the two parts, there is also a well-worked and informative making, so I would advise watching after watching the next. I would recommend this to the matrix universe and / or science fiction. 8/10
