When I first saw "Gray Gardens" many years ago I found laughing and happy camps. A few years later, I look out loud and look at it, but after a lot of perspectives I come to see the beauty in the strange, twisted relationship between "Big" Edith Bowie Biel and her daughter "Little" Edith Bouwier Biel. <br /> <br /> The mother and daughter living together in their ruined 28 room East Hampton building makes the point meaning "Shabby Chic". Jamie O's aunt and niece Amazing and cats with numerous cats, raccoons and oposmas allow filmmakers to paint Albert and David Miles in everyday life in their life. The result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving account of true love and anarchy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Big and Little Edi is a clause for love-bound bonds. And drive their lives, an example of determination and free will. There is more to recommend this film than I can put into words. <br /> You feel a bit uncomfortable for yourself. <br /> <br />
