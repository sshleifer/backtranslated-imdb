I agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies ever! I saw it as a child and loved it! Scaffolding scenes are good and he can really be compared with this guy because he is deported. Nice humor and amazing kung fu this film rocks! If you like kung fu you will love it !!!
