<br /> <br /> This is actually a story of Sydney Young (Simone Pegg), a journalist and magazine writer who divides into business. Way. Simon Peg looks a bit worse than his usual. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do with this fun and recommended English cream comedy All People or Anything Such is not happy or funny, but its moments Just sit and relax and enjoy what movie it is. If you are watching this movie with critical methods, you should not be disappointed and should not start trashing it.
