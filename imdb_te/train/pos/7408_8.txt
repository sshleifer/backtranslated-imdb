<br /> <br /> 'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a $ 200,000 low-budget film about a father and his 2 sons. Father is a traditional bathhouse in a traditional Chinese village where local, mostly elderly men come to relax and take a bath. Father's sons: The eldest son living with him and the son in a modern modern city and arrives to visit him. In this traditional village, the bathroom and his 'retarded' brother appear to be weird and bizarre, but it will change along with the film. <br /> <br /> If the story is sensitive or cliche, it is not. <br /> <br /> Really great parent, especially father and 'retarded' son (sorry, I do not know their names) and a great story film is touching and funny at the same time. You have the opportunity to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> This is the main alternative to Hollywood movie. <br /> <br />
