I guess if an image is magic, I do not need fluid or patches. If you skip the background information, go fast in some places and slow down in others. The magic in the film: The scene in the library. Stanley & Iris has many minor flaws, however they do not remove from the overall positive effect of looking at everyone's help in areas of life that is very improbable and correct. Both characters are smart. Stanley does not understand the unwanted work; He has more adventure in his childhood because he can not read. Iris, though well-educated, does not have enough adventure and does not understand how to interpret the U-turn taken by her life. Both their flaws and strengths, the characters compliment each other. It may be a stretch bit, accepting Stanley hiding his illiteracy to shut down an Iris work year after a factory in a factory or to work on the construction or other good payment job. When describing these "secrets" story, their ending is somewhat enhanced. I thought that nobody took time to rethink the script. However, it's a good movie, if you're in someone else's imagination of De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton on the screen!
