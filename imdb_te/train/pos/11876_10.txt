I know when I see this Bryan DePalma movie today, I know how long it has been criticized. Also, about violence. When I was 20, I saw in VHS that I thought it was violent and unprotected by Allah. <br /> <br /> For decades, man, I know how proud I am in this film. 30/40 'which is a remake of a wonderful film. How to Improve on Classic? No Yes. But tell a story that you've brought to the time of the "new immigrants" in the most desperate decade, more than 80s. <br /> <br /> If the disco is dying and the new wave / punk take place, the immigrants from Cuba can not tell a new home in Florida. It's exciting, they wanted but how to get it ??? These immigrants were in the same way in Florida, where they were forced to run the drug economy, earning money and earning money. <br /> <br /> It's wonderful for me to be Al Pacino Toni Montana, "a little train called". The best way to have your main character in America is: to fight, kill, and steal. <br /> <br /> It has seen American dream Tony. <br /> He wanted, he wanted, he wanted to live and did not see anything wrong in how he got it in his circle. Tony Montana's mandate of English language is heavily satisfied with the "f" word, but what did you do for Emily Post's full-fledged school and his co-horts? See how they came to America, what they learned and what they were exposed to. This is Tony and his staff "They're in America." It's about power. Tony Montana and never made it to achieve that. It's all violent, lying, stealing, curled, and stolen. <br /> <br /> When I was personally portrayed by the 1980s, the money transfer. Tony's crew brought money to the bank. Have you seen Toni and his team around? In spending and drunk clubs? Nope. With money and money on money, you get the power. Having off Tony Hogg. <br /> <br /> When Tony Montana arrives at the helm, he really gets there. He's a bloody take over, his Trophy 80's American Blonde drug trafficker is a bore he's a bore, he needs to keep on top, because he's suffering with mysterious surrounding those who want to take, because his empire ... he's going down. <br /> <br /> Previously, he goes in a horrific violent style, but I do not ask again what do you want? <br /> <br /> This film is the cinematic and siege of the 1980 film. It's violent, bloody, overly .. but point disruption can go home. All Cubans from Cuba who arrived in Florida in the 80s were like Tony Montana. Will you be. But in the 1980s, the United States was "someone" and showed how much attention was paid to greed and money in the United States, such as the only actions in the US to gain power over these poor characters and their lives in the United States. <br /> You will be surprised - since then has anything - learned today?
