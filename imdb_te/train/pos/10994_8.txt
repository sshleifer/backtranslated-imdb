This is my first comment! This is a fairy image! I watched luck night on TV. <br /> <br /> In the first 5 minutes I thought I was a B film, but later I understood what this amazing product was. <br /> <br /> I'm a bad B picture for some friends to see this movie. How wrong it is. <br /> <br /> I think the film is almost a product of genius. The well-known director has done an awesome job here and an insult to say he ended the game at this point.
