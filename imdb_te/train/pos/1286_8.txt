This familiar story of the old man / young woman is surprisingly tough-edged. This forgotten black and white indie attempt bikers, hippies, free love and jail bait mix surprisingly well. Actress Patricia Wimmer gives her career's best performance as title "Candy" (all 3 are in the drive-in epics). Vymer is unhealthy and young graduates (1971), but offers more serious performance in the bobby. Occasional violence and seasonal nudity are somewhat surprising but are well maintained by the director. Wimmer and George E. Cary May / December romance is sold confidently. There is only one similarity between the Bobbistter and Young Graduates, the same director surprised if the same film. <br /> The Seattle, WA, Miss Wimer, TV Rock and Roll show appeared as a dancer in the MALIBU U, covering the cover (as well as "Best For Men" in the August edition of August 1968, a flavored adult-only magazine - Page spread). <br /> <br /> Although she is part of the DVD-ROM on the BCI box set of eight films, the Baby Board has finally made her home video for the first time. CULT CLASSICS Vol. 3, available from Amazon.com and some retail stores like Best Buy.
