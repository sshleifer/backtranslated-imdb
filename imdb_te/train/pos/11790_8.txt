David Lynch's new documentary is a lot of "lynch" piece that has dark, tension, silence, silence, very sensitive background music, and again two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette, his repetitive background. <Br / <br /> <br /> The two characters create a very intriguing slave-wife relationship that appears to be directly visible with Mulholland's doctor. <br /> It's beautiful. <br /> <br /> For Lynch fans
