I heard good things about this film, it was disappointing. Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good and surprisingly confident at a younger age; Really all (small) cast is quite simple, in their normal 50s America. I could not rate this movie because at the end, the sorrow shown by the older sister did not seem to be true and the film removed me from bit. Perhaps we might want to fill the plot, or perhaps this picture should be a little too long. I think Maureen's role is developing very much. Dani (Reese W., the young man) can understand the wounded and angry, but why is her sister disappointed? Since she is only a few years old? In the end, did not destroy the rest of the picture? The scene of the film is merely when he meets Maureen and the court, but he just keeps track of it (Warning: This scene is surprisingly brutal, it looks like trying to shock a bit ... It depends on what you want - if you feel like a child's happy story, you are surprised The moon is a man in the moon And dreaming and a tough age picture ?? A rather embarrassing combination? While I liked the role of the court, I could see watching girls looking. <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> My husband, for some reason, I found Jason London in tractor funny.
