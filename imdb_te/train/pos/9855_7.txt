It was my first CG animated film I saw. In general, the appearance of other animated films alerted me to see them. No Ice Age. I saw the trailer with Scrott, I saw the happy sobertooth squirrel. <br /> <br /> Ice Age is a vigorously funny and fun movie. The story is basically set in 20,000 years ago, the animated version of Three Men and One Baby. Visuals are great. Just beautiful. It's one thing to create after conviction, it's another thing to create the arresting stuff visually and the Ice Age is great to look with its stylistic visuals. Blue Sky Studios is a company to see in the future.
