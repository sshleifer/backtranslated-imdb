I first saw the film and the International Film Studies Course. I am a 'non-traditional' student, and, perhaps for years or so, have appreciated the film's narrative slowly and reflecting the story. The heat and dust of an arid climate is depressing, the story is deeply psychopathic, filled with multi-layer symbolism, and an inner inverse of the theme 'other' in a land that does not. The upcoming awareness is filled with unmatched memories and subjectivity. Made more than 20 years ago, it was also a foregone of a genre of many other international films that explored the colonies of colonial colonies, clueless for the nuances of the cultures they entered. More heavily painted since reflecting similar reflections - and heavily funded --- Works: Indochine, nowhere in Africa compare Chakotat tender and boring. There is no adrenaline-pumping action or serious violence. Battles are mental, emotional and subtle. But, what is said, this is a good value image.
