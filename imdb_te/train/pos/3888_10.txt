This definatley is one of the best stand-up presentations evre. Ever. Eddie I was on the wall for nearly five years now watching this painful show, and it still rocks every single time. Everything that's small on the head side from his big broad physical comedy is an exaggeration. You do not need to look more than this line "word herb. You say erb, and we say herb, cuz ther is a f ### ing h". Brilliant.
