There are some similar hoops, where almost every line and every character comes close to flawlessness. It's a lot of humor !! And it is quite a bit of sarcasm there. Sally Field is truly head of the outstanding actors department and she is doing a good job with a TV-diva during the day. Sometimes her acting is widespread and slightly up to the top, but 90% of her time is mischief! The same league included Kevin Klein, Robert Downey Jr. and Woop Goldberg (unfortunately there are very few here). Downey Jr. may not be fully convinced as a comedian and may not have time for all the time, but he fights with honest and very grateful person with his role. But here Celeste is Cathy Moriarty as a real bitch, if one of the brightest stars here is one more dirty secret (you'll definitely see in the end! Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shu is very comfortable with his part. I usually like Ms Shue, but here she works like fish out of the water and is sometimes in a different picture. But it's not damaging, and for the most part she is at least adequate. Otherwise, it's a comedy to see where this is on TV or wherever it connects with memorable lines and situations.
