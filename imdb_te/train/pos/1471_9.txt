<br /> <br /> The film "The Porterver's Guide to the Movie" begins with Slovoz Zizek, a Slovenian philosopher and psychologist, applying to his Freudian / Laconian brain-sculptural world cinema. The second film documentary directed by Sophie Finiels (Yes, Ralph and Joseph's sister) is an important achievement, a clock in the 2 1/2-hour debate from a man and more humorous and attractive. In essence, it's an extended film lecture, and one of the best you can ever get. In the course of the film, Zizek guides us through the list of siege and desire in movie history. He spends more time in over 40 films, most notably Hitchcock, Lynch, Chaplin, Tarkovsky, Marx Brothers, and Eisenstein. But he is "Person," "Dialogue," "Three Colors: Blue," "Doggley," "Fight Club," and "Exorcist." Theoretically, Zizek's trial on the film ranges from death trail to "wish coordinates" and "partial objects" from enlightenment. <br /> <br /> "Pervert's Guide" You've taken a few minutes to bones in your basic Freudian vocabulary. However, even if you do not have the psyche analytical theory, Zizek's dynamic and cheerful personality forward the movie with such pleasure you do not have chance to hear at a special lingo. * Zizek * Images in the film * talking about the film - is often cut from the original locations and sets, from movies. Transitions in these scenes do not constitute such tension and humor. And Zizek himself laughs us from the "laughs" of a bold Oedipal explanation, for example, from constantly strangest little jokes or his enthusiastic inspiration. The go-ahead and laughing attitude in both parts of Finnes and Jaime is a necessity for the character of the film's gonzo. It is a spoonful of sugar that helps digest Zizy's unnatural medicine. After all, we all have a feeling, past a certain point, psychological theorists are just pulling our legs?
