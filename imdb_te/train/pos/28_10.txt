And yet there is another evidence that we must all Italian giallo worship and be able to recognize the exact most unique sub-genre in horror. Emilio Miraglia's "Red Queen Kills Seven Times" original plot, stylish production values, enchanting music, great acting talent and inventively crystallized scenes are absolutely mesmerizing. It is a fantastic Geo (first released in 1972 in the first five episodes of every fan of Italian cinema). The storyline does not introduce your average black-gloud & sexy frustrating killer, but combines the intentions of making a good old revenge with the horrific "Red Queen" horrific myths. At a young age, their grandfather struggles with the siblings of Kitty and Evelyn who are constantly struggling, and every sister who dies every seven years on April 6, will kill seven of his sisters, the inevitable last victim. Fifteen years later, Kitty became a successful choreographer of the famous modeling agency (her bed with General Manager) when suddenly the murder spree began. Sister Evelyn is a clear criminal, but she has recently moved to the states ... or is she? Complex yet comprehensive and participating red herrings threw you every minute and the Red Queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallo-history. Her face is never visible, but she wears a blood red dress and produces a terrible smile whenever she makes a new victim. She is not exactly sensible, because her victims are discouraged with a bak, pulled behind cars and even fired on the fence! That one of the latter is really one of the violent (= very gruesome) actions I've ever seen! Whatever you ask most? Some classy and flavorful nudity, perhaps? Gorgeous female actresses have gained more than one of them, including Barbara Bouchet and Young Cybill Dawning. Emilio Miraglia is not the most famous Gillo-director of him, as he did this and even "The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave", but his influence and prominence should not be forgotten.
