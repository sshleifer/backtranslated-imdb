I know it's raw, and I know it's not all at the PC, but it's funny. If you are in the early 80s and you can be sure that it has all the stereotypes of the time - and the film still passes with laughter - this is really a good comedy. The film's content is more than any comic tradition in thousands of years. <br/> <br/> If you are able to suspend your political correctness for one and a half hours, just laugh and smile. <br /> <br /> Someone put it on DVD, which is no longer difficult to find on VHS.
