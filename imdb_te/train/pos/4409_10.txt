This film is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave 10 ratings. The story is known as the 'Bushwalkers' of Missouri, which fought in the southern part during the war between wars. The clothes they wear are authentic, history and why they fought, were very clear and well researched. One of the battles they've shot for Hollywood is really ... but not bad. Actors are well-known actors and actors or directors, and know how to get the best of them. I think it is a good direction and a super casting companion, getting a stunning performance by the right people and actors. Not just one or two ... This image is really weaker! It all rolled into an image of action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your personal perspective) and history. There is also a future Spiderman and Jewel. She's fine!
