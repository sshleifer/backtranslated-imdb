Resident Evil: Code Veronica has great graphics, very flexible controls, a great storyline and high fun factor. The storyline is intended to penetrate the Claire Redfield umbrella field, Veronica's graphics are very good, with fire and rain effects very good. The controls are attractive, but the button model is not suitable for Dreamcast control, it is difficult to use. to.Its still guts shooting guts out of zombies around some wierd disturbing place .Cod: Veronica is also a little bit of "romance" between two main characters. You also get to play as Chris Redfield, from Resident Evil 1 .When the sound giant spiders in this game are crawled, they make a disturbing scampering sound on the feet, and alot of guns alot more realistic alot. New feature is always better, for example, even if it is hateful. Veronica loved a perfect: amazing graphics, story, comfy controls, and reali stic sound resident Evil Code. I give 10 to 10.
