The friendship between civil rights leader Steve Bucco and Donald Woods is the biggest but compelling reconstruction. Let's see how they are bonded between the two, and see how they help each other, the first half of the film is strong, but the latter is not strong due to the removal of the character of the biko. In addition, a structured feature film featuring great performances by Klein and Washington, placed second on the map. Washington has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor for the first time. Overall, a well-made image that is trimmed down a bit. 7/10 .________________________________
