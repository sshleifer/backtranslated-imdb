<br /> <br /> In addition to "Brothers & Sisters", "Six Degrees" is one of my favorite new dramas of fall 2006. <br /> The great cast is Campbell Scott) and Hope Davis (recently a journalist widowed dead in Iraq). <br /> <br /> Without acting, the writing is fresh and acting is amazing. In this program NYC is not in the back of the Warner Bros. or some other studio in the real city, which adds secondary or realistic. <br /> I am more interested in the latest "Survivor" and other reality trash. It's not too bad.
