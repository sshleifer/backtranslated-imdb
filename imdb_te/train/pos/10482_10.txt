I love this movie. This is one of those I can see again. <br /> <br /> The progression of the newly-widowed housewife, the American thread of a movie or an action thriller, for selling the bands. <br /> <br /> In this film, Elling plays a role as a comedy. Also a wonderful feeling is a good thing. </ P> <p> Two old ladies and a box of cornflakes ... (not a spoiler!)
