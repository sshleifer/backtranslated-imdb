NYC model Alison Parker (Cristina Ryans) hires a room in an old wheat where she meets some extravagant neighbors and experiences some creepy hallucinations. Attorney boyfriend Michael Lehman (Chris Sarandon), on her behalf, tries to maintain her integrity as she experiences her experiences on her physical, emotional and emotional health. /> <br /> The good moments in this mental horror movie for those that do not know it. The story is interesting and entertaining, but this film does not really have real fears. Or, for that matter, no atmosphere. It's kind of quiet quietly, but it's not a traditional horror movie. It's more of a story about an enigmatic woman's efforts to deal with the growing inequality in her life. <br /> <br /> "Sentinel" * * Offer is some of the exciting set pieces (especially with a glamorous, fascinating, creepy climax, and a scene with Beverly de 'Angelo). There is some gore to see, but not much. <br /> <br /> Gill Melley leads to filthy music lyrics. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers should not be able to complete the film without any review of the film. Some of them can not do much, but it's nice to see them together. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith, respectively, have been heavily influenced by a hard-closed detective and critical neighbor. Other legendary names include Jos√© Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner. Future stars such as De Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tell Berenger, Jeff Gold Blum are brief and other popular faces are Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickke and Martin Balsam. <br /> <br /> Film director Michael Vijer is well known for his "Death Wish" series with Charles Bronson. <br /> <br /> I can not think of this great horror thriller but provide its moments and reasonable entertainment. <br /> <br />
