Sadly, 8 Simple Rules, along with my teenage daughter, was the last sit-in for John Ritter after his tragic death in 2003. He is one of my favorite actors. He became the star of all other comedy (Katie, Amy, Kaley) and Martin in the show, but he was also a great dramatic actor (not worth watching TV movie) The reason, and it's his perfect comedy delivery, it's been able to break me every time. <br /> I see how much sugar is not sweet on the show (they come on, as I loved the cosby show, they are much better with each other lol) they portrayed brilliant normal family dynamics. It's realistic for all the sibling competition and conflict between parents, but they still kept it funny. Most American sitcoms showcases and exhibit fully with Morris and performances, and this program has not done so. Yes, there are things like fixing important issues like some drugs and bullying, but they did not try and do anything other than a fun family comedy. <br /> They made brilliant presentation about the death of John, I still sob like a baby every time I watch. <br /> <br /> You can assume that the program has rarely emerged. <br /> I'm sad to cancel the show, I'm still glad to see it again, I'm not tired. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you are always remembered for the delightful depiction of this father who is your savior are.
