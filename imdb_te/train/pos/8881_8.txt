<br /> <br /> The first is to consider the time frame created by the film in 1995. The rappers were in it and it was added to its professionalism. <br /> <br /> Remy is a socially frustrating young man, and he has not beenfriended by the Nazis until he meets. They took him. The Nazis are not embarrassing, but like many gangs, they fill an emptiness that is not economically, socially, emotional. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael Rapaport certainly played the role. <br /> <br /> Omar Eps is a hot shot track with a questionable work ethic and chip on his shoulder. <br /> <br /> Kristen is a young white girl trying to find herself, trying to forgive herself and her plight, and raped her. She discovered her self experiment with her sexuality and was politically involved. <br /> <br /> Many of the things dealing with racism and racism play into the public's own perspective. I have read so many commentaries about what is 'bad' black characters, but a white one (Nazis). What is that? Remi was not badly painted, he was trying to find his way and some skinned heads failed to accept him. He was scared, it was sad to see how he made him split. <br /> <br /> Ice cube and basta rhymes Anger black men, ice cube is an intellectual somewhat, and Busta Rhymes is depicted as a mute thug. They neither showed any scrutiny for their room and are generally not like white people. They are angry as Nazis, but not at all Nazi levels of evil. Sorry sorry this is unfair, but are there really black groups like Nazis? <br /> <br /> People say it is white = -bad black = good. Not true, the Nazis and the police who have more or less truths in real life are the only white white characters. <br /> <br /> Omar Eps, Ice Cube and Busta are seriously flawed characters, Kristen is a good girl, a good guy with her boyfriend (Omer Epsy Roommate), and even Remi is a good guy. , Angry and disgusting. Although the police seemed to justify some of their anger in their constant harassment. <br /> <br /> Remy's inadequacy in Remy seemed to justify his anger. <br /> <br /> The good picture is good. <br /> <br /> Like all movies dealing with racism, this is a great part of the discussion. <br /> <br /> I do not think Cube and Busta Weila have beaten Nazis.
