There are dresses and make-up grand, some spectacularly funny lines are included, and the character was made for Jim Carrey. Kerry has done a good job as it can instead be given to the frustrating script writing. Certainly this is a movie for kids, but if you're going to make money on this film you must really give the story enough body to go beyond Souce at least at least Dr. I expected more from Ron Howard. It's a worthy, but by no measure, there's no need to become a major classic.
