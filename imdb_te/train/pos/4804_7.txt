I saw these pictures twice on DVD, the first time I saw the second half after an hour and went back to the first hour. A fun movie, thanks to which Kiera Knightley, refreshes and gives us a real insight into the complex life of Queen Victoria's complex life and all the difficulties she can do. There is nothing bad about the film, no real bad language or sexual nature, it's a danger to family viewing. Queen Victoria can motivate children to investigate a little bit about herself and little characters like Conroy and Lord Melbourne.
