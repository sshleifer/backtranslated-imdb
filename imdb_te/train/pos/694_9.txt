Insomniac's Nightmare is the man's plunge story into insanity. Chronic insomnia, Jack is suffering from hallucinations; <br /> Finally we found interesting things about Jack, and at the end of the film we were "happy" after the end of Hollywood. Wrong. <br /> <br /> Tess Nanavati (author and director) has a good movie in 'An Insomniac's Nightmare'. A talented filmmaker and writer (she has produced the film after her high school graduation), she has the real probability and is one of the best in the upcoming future. <br /> I saw this small picture. Uncomfortable; Damini was frustrated by Monaghan (Jack), and I want to do this kind of work to escape the music, tragedy scene and realistic description.
