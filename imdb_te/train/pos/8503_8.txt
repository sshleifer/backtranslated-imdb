Sherman led the United Kingdom in 1986. This was followed by post-industrial recession. Manufacturing industries are still an important part of the American economy, and factory workers are a good example of "average American". The word "reducing" is not yet entered into simple vocabulary, but everyone knows the phenomenon. Bruce can hear on radio singing, "Foreman said that these jobs are going and they did not return to your hometown." Chrysler only agreed with Uncle Sam. Bumper stickers say, "Buy American - you can be a job you save." <br /> <br /> "Gong Ho" makes a better job of capturing the fate of American industrial labor force. Other famous movie of the time. Definitely the film has its flaws - except for Michael Keaton and Gedda Watanabe everyone has some loose plot threads and average acting jobs. But this story is really about the Eastern and Western convention: Keaton's Hunt Stevenson has brought the Americas to the outside, and the outside is still insecure. Vatanabe's Kasuhiro put Japan on a pile with a successful system, but is surprised to learn more from their Western rivals. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film, however, is flawed, only to the conflict of their two personalities and finally the synthesis. <br /> <br /> Keaton's performance is contrary to everyone else, practically doing the film through it. I always laughed Keaton for the ability to provide sophisticated lines, even if he was any script. His character, Hunt Stevenson, is a favored and friendly, naturalist with a brilliant-assorted series. But many of us have a fatal flaw: he should not disappoint anyone. <br /> <br /> Kajuro Stevenson's mirror image: shy and insight, but not because of his Japanese upbringing, can not be the bearer of bad news. Stevenson first summoned the Kazuhiro employees to the Japanese practice with complaints of total racial discrimination. Replies to Kazuhiro Stevenson's complaints "I understand what you mean," but his requests do not refuse loud. Stevenson misrepresents this, and says, "Well, we have settled down." <br /> In the end, CÄƒuhihiro and Stevenson have the same problem: the factory is working smoothly, achieving production targets and fulfilling their obligations to workers under them. To achieve this goal, they should take a page from everyone else's book. The Kazuhiro family is a clear example of becoming more "American". Notice that Stevenson and Kajuro have apologized for how he apologized to his laborers, and that Stevenson will do the right thing. <br /> And its clarity is slightly cornballs, but hey, this comedy. If you overlook the flaws of the film, here is a great story about self-awareness and open-mindedness.
