This film is like a low hyper-kinetic, more rigid dead or alive: strange underground operations occur, but when police detect officers. But when a police officer dies, a tatsuitto is involved ... and when his brother realizes that Shihoho is involved, things are slowly fulfilled. <br /> <br /> Micas, Shinjuku Tride Society He is still full of Oli 'ultra violin and cruel sexual acts in his general observation, although it is not one of his eclectic or vibrant pieces. Tapsuhito is a pretty well-designed bit of pulp fiction, especially as a first-person killing character that sells body organs that are illegally acquired from the underground, Taiwan and dug his way into a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who keeps almost the brothel of young boys. Tatsuhito's brother said in society, so Tatsuhito has himself become a dirty cop and forced to use similar violent and brutal tactics to spread into this chaotic kingdom. <br /> <br /> What is basically interesting about this little work? Tatsuhito is associated with his nemesis, Wang. The Japanese who were born in Tatsuitto China, then returned to Japan and stayed away. The Wang felt Chinese reliance on China, killing his father and developing a crime branch in Japan. Wang is also a surprisingly Shakespearean character, it is unnatural enough, you really start to feel sorry for him during his final showdown with Tatsuhito very little. When he was forced to fight when he could not control his brother, Tatsuoto was similarly tragedy. <br /> <br /> While Michael's films are rumored to be more successful on their shock value, sometimes it's easy to lose what Mickey does not create bitter, unreasonable characters. -PolarisDiB
