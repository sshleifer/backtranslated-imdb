The television movie is a warm heart warming that tells a story about a small five-year-old girl who lost her daddy and it seems impossible to bear. Her mother suffered so much that she could reduce their regrets. All viewers hope to be in practice. Samantha Matthis is just as cool as the little girl's mum, she is the happiest grandmother in Ellen Bertstein, the tender and bright actress of the year, as she is Nanny in "Jack and Sarah" worth watching if you like Samantha Mathis and both happy. Jared Ferland (the youngest five-year-old) is the most beautiful and most trusted young actress. "Mermaid" is a tribute to the milk of human kindness, clearly illustrated and we are still in this difficult world that surrounds us in this difficult world. "The mermaid" is all hope of giving us, by so much of love that by learning a lot of lovely people in the world. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
