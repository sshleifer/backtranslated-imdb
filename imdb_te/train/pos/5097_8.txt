This is a very rare film and it is very small from the Shirley Temple because it is nothing of her collection. Why the reason may be because it is not happy, unlike its other pictures. Musical, however, belt a song called 'The World over Nine Live'. The film starts in 1934 and is black and white, I have a color and VHS that I have, and they say they are colorful pictures of the colorful Laurel and Hardy rather than the original look. The film has a good age and is not good in this story, I was amazed, no one did not try to make a reconstruction. Some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carol Lambert have some time to talk about the film, and in some scenes it takes about fifteen minutes to tell what they say in five. There are some good wishes in the film, especially the {Jerry} ry Cooper steals a necklace and hiding in Shirley's Teddy Bear. He is slow to his tension and his actions, while his daughter is singing to the audience in another room. Face facial expressions are good when they are put into consideration. It is good at the beginning of the 30s and accept it for its age.
