I enjoyed Albert Pine's "Nemesis" for its cheesy action and partial-complex script. Perhaps it is a dumb on the rocks plot with the same super-action to run through "Nemesis 2: Nebula" which is why most people complain about the "confusing" plot of the first film. <br /> <br /> The name of the first lady in the super-form who previously sent to save the future gives the name of the name of Alex. She grew up in a tribe in Africa. The good part of the film has a conversation in an African language without subtitle, because I like it because it is somewhat authentic (how often do movies try to do this in the genre?). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, these days cyborgs find her and try to kill her. <br /> Do not get me wrong, the first one is great). Africa's political unrest, treasure hunt, and subplots involving tribal combat. The picture is very small in brains, so none of these are good. The film is basically a little fry and follows to muscle pedestrians to cyborg. It has its entertainment value, just do not expect any quality, or anything of the first film.
