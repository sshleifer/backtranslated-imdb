As such, Polynesky's "The Tenant" (which came out the same year) combines the best of those images and tosses for a good measure. The New York model failed to adhere to his lawyer boyfriend, living in the mosaic-painted townhouse. She meets a neighbor (Burgess Meredith) intelligent man, and other off-center tenants. She wakes up by the big noises on her apartment and finds that the priest who dumbs immediately is the resident of the indigenous building. From there, director Michael winner ("Death Wish") kicks into this supernatural thriller gear, and he is a devilish pleasure of inflicts the hallucinogenic tortures in his heroine. Dick Smith ("Exorcist"), "The Sentinel" is made up of an incredible Geeta Horror film with the help of an amazing ensemble cast, mini-storyline and amazing makeup FX.
