Those who gave a low rating to this product probably did not see George Balanchine's production on stage either, or McKale Kulkin's cast was not able to convey their verdict. The Atlanta Ballet was fortunate to have been the first ballet company to form this structure, rather than the New York City Ballet from the 1960s to the 1980s, and I saw many times live on stage. I can assure these readers that this movie is a very precise rendering and the unexpected cheap stunt to present the children's use Culkin with limited dance abilities in the title role; Balanchine's idea of ​​this role is, as his idea is to use a child to Mary's role. <br /> It is a theatrical film intentionally; In a way, it resembles Laurence Oliver's "Othello". The same set of stage production expanded the size of the film noise, but was not synthesized, and the ballot was directly equipped with the wise ones, and the version of the Mauris sedac-Carol Ballard version in 1986 without the exceptional "music video" quick cuts. There are only two wrong steps in the 1993 film. Distracting and completely unnecessary sound effects (mouse skecks, kids called "Mao-Jick!"), Dosselmeyer, etc.). Any sound effects can be heard at any stage of the "nutcracker" and are simply cheaply discounted to appease a countless audience who can not cheer the idea of ​​looking at a ballot in the film. The other wrong step is McKay Culkin's Nutcracker make-up, which certainly looks ridiculous. When he is on the screen as a nutcracker, wearing a huge mask (always performed when Balanchine produces the product), Culkin is actually a doll - he looks like a bald cap, as well as white wig, whiskers, and chin. He is also somewhat rounded on his face and the worst part of his make-up is that his face is enthusiastic as it resembles the decorations of Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahore in "The Wizard of Oz" (the film's makeup results However, has acted inhumanly, not of this person). And * shows how the comparison with Baryshnikov's Nutcracker in his * product looks like a nutcracker mask of Bryshnikov - "jaws" actually seemed to move when Baryshnikov bend his head. <br /> <br /> The dance version in Macaulay Culkin is amazing, except, of course, Culkin himself, whose dance, as I mentioned, will not even be wonderful. (Sugar Plum Fairy and her favorite Cavalier Balanchine's "The Nutcracker"). The colors of the paintings are slightly brighter since it was a fantasy. Choreography is also intelligent, and it is a parody of Tchaikovsky's ballet "The Sleeping Beauty" which includes the extraordinary music of the music - falling on the staircase, sleeping on the sofa, and the drussellmeyer "dissselmeyer" "broken nutcracker (the scene never included in the original ballet of Tchaikovsky - - A different task than "The Nutcracker" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's very good.
