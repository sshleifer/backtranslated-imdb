Teresa Pavlach Toronto is a leading member of the second city. She has made numerous guest spots and commercials here in Canada. Finally someone makes sense to create a show for her. Auxiliary case is also good. I have seen the pilot many times now and I have found refreshing yet. I do not know why the show was described as The Jane Show 2004. (I might be wrong) But as far as I know, the show was unveiled in 2005 and appeared in Global TV in Canada in early 2006. A new idea and hopefully it does well. Very bad this corner is not paired with gas. Now I know that the carrier gas is in CTV, but the two shows will be great companion pieces.
