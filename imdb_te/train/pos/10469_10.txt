In 1993, I remembered watching promotions in this program for this show. At that time I was 8 years old, now at the age of 22, this cult show is starting to look and feel to the end. Suddenly it seems too far, no great decade. Anyway, I've used Monster Witch to see all the time because I'm a huge fan of monster and horror films. This is like the 90th version of the Chiller Theater. Joe Bob's performance, at least, Monster Vision is more interesting and informative if not why MST3K's DVD can not be obtained. Joe Bob's commentaries and information are just delightful. Most of the films shown in the show are B or C grade, but there are many home paintings and Hammer movies from England, including the top lyricist and Ray Harryhausen's Stop Motion Majesty. Many duets can not be seen in Japanese sci-fi movies, and Godzilla is known to almost everyone and independent films such as Metric Storm and Motel Hell. In the new decade of film conservation and more independent mental director directors, I feel that I have been a good performance for IFC to pick up IFC, as I have already hit with IFC Grid House Performance. I'm sure I will definitely choose this show for a few days, I'll wait and wait. Until then "great television"!
