Apart from Seydl, Austrian films are also exclusive to Spillmann and other directors. The curiosity of the reality that the viewer has ever left on the film. Haststage is no exception. This effect was also achieved by playing actors rather than depicted stories. I never had the feeling that these actors were playing in the Hunt Stage, but instead of real people. So visceral concept of realistic viewer ... You live in the bottom of your block with a tireless pensioner or single lady in the picture. <br /> <br /> Any person who lives in Vienna is undoubtedly acknowledged by people in the film with their favored / sudern (complaint), their secret sexual motivation and prolo macho guys. This will be further strengthened by the Viennese dialect, which, according to many, is a lifetime complaint. <br /> <br /> There is a clear presence in the film with their silence and despair when nothing happens in the suburbs of Viennese. In addition, they celebrate materialism with shopping malls and large department stores. Moreover, they try to get closer to people with their human beings, yet not in vain. Examples include the old woman's sexual game with men in the border of rape, the proto man hitting the young lady who loses his nerves and irritates his girlfriend and hitchhyes and her drivers. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film is in the view of its images of normality / abnormality. Another distinctive feature of Seydl (and other Austrian Directors) is the performance of violent sexual images. This is the removal of the old woman for her husband, the sexual scenes in the bathroom, the lady's sex game with two people in her apartment, etc. <br /> <br /> They portrayed Seed lives in the Hunt Stage. They are either Paris, New York or Madrid and eventually more Viennese might be. The audience should not be satisfied or felt for viennes as the audience portrayed themselves as the same human alienation and alien victims in different circumstances. In the end, the image of Seydell is a warning to us about the horrific human relationships that have been revealed in Huntsj√§. And if the director did not get the reasons for this evil transformation, Sealal achieved his goal.
