This Night Listener is generally better than people. It has weaknesses, and it has an identity recognition crisis, no doubt, but I think its creepy atmosphere and mysterious performances make for this. The whole thing seems to be one of the damaged stories "This is my friend's friend's friend" ghost stories. There is a big complaint pacing about the film: but slow and sometimes awkward motion is deliberate. Are all of the above in the film subject to the potential sector and in the real life is just a plaque? So there is no "showdown" scenes that reveal lightweight conclusions or ground shattering. Thank you Heaven. When you look at this movie you have to enter the zone, forget your reservation and make your aspirations (traditionally) a good image. Williams is not spectacular, but he is easily adapted to the story's needs, and his character is somewhat common ("No One"), he entrusted the story to Everybody. Tony Colt's performance should be selected to the Oscar (although she can not win). Try and see. For the quality and content alone, The Night Listener is definitely the first twenty percent of the movies that have come today.
