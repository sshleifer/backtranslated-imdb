<br /> <br /> I saw this hero in a temple a night years ago, but it is an unimaginable experience that has been stuck with me to this day. <br /> The building feels a bit unrealistic - because of the earthquake, a vicious nerve agent's underground shop in the hills above a small town, and the microscopic sum of the substance finds its way into their food supply. The residents of the town constantly lose all the minds and lose every momentum and ability to retain temperance on the basic desires, and generally we should not just work. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is slow, but only the tanning disgust is added to me as the behavior of urban people starts to unfold slowly. <br /> <br /> If we all give us fervent instincts, we are raising interesting questions about what we have all the potential. I enjoyed it I'm not sure 'happiness' is the right word. Did you think of me Sure. I'm still thinking about it. Scary stuff.
