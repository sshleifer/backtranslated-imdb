Okay, I'm a fan of Nightmare series and everyone says here that this is the worst! But it's not you see Freddy's Revenge? WTF! That's all the worst! Now the film is pretty good and it sticks to Freddie's story and he has a daughter. <br /> When I found it in 3-D I was excited and I looked at the DVD box set and I immediately went to 3-D scenes. Lisa Zanes hand, Dream Demons, Freddy's Claw (more than once), Leslie Dean holding a leg, Lisa Zen had a lot of 3-D with the explosion of baseball bot, Docs Hand, Freddie's head. <br /> I really like this movie because it's in 3-D, but I wish the whole picture was in 3-D not just the last 15 minutes <br /> <br /> Ten minutes by the way not ten !!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!
