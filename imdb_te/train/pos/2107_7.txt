I recently bought this film from a group of other lazards from eBay. <br /> <br /> If you are bored by today's exclusive FX films and high glass romantic comedies, you should check the shop around the quiet evening corner. . The roles I like about the movie are very polite. There is nothing fake or pretentious about them. Take Mr. Mathewschke for example: When he learns that his wife is cheating with his wife, he tries to shoot himself. Not just because of shame, he is unfair to Stewart's character. <br /> Yes, the film's vision is narrow and plot is imaginable. Still, I liked it very much. If you like Notting Hill you want to shop around the corner. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds me very much Jimmy Stewart.
