One of the lesser things from the original Star Trek is the pilot: the dose of real and flawed individuals. The utopian characters of the next generation are so tired that they are reliable. I also love the bitter relief of human beings. Its funny ones look like slippery snaps. I look forward to seeing myself when it becomes a dominant race between humans, but I do not think it's working on the show's time frame. The only disadvantages that I have jumped on me are the "end of the 2 hours end", which is common in late traction. The second is shameless for ratings with awkward sexy scenes. It's not a good science fiction show with some skin to be in his own stand without the pad of Tea Tea audiences. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode works.
