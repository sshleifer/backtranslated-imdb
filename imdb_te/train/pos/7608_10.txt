I have seen the first series of interest, but I wondered if I had gone back after a long hiatus. However, I tuned into an episode of Series 2 and again hooked again. This is really amazing telly; Mission: Impossible back-to-back sensational elements in the 1960s. The characters are well rounded, and when the series continues, when they change - they are new to new surroundings - for their new surroundings, but they are cleverly in the role, and to anyone who thinks that you can ever apologize more than having sympathetic ones, while really subtracting them. I hope for many years to look forward to 'Lost' - I really do not care if I never get answers to all the secrets!
