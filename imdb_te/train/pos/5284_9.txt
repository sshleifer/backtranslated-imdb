Father and son speak very little. They speak different languages. When the son goes to Mecca for his Mecca Yacht 3000 miles, the dialogue will eventually take place. <br /> <br /> The film takes us to the heart of these two passengers, which is a great journey to the audience and the two principals. The pictures throughout are particularly impressive in Mecca. How different it is to the world, but at the same time, how will it be? This is true for father and son in this movie. <br /> Look at this movie. Tell your friends to see this. You will be happy.
