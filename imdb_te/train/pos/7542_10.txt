This film does not sit well, but it must be seen. I thought African-American couples were working to bring in the name of societies and many of them were trying to get "other" African Americans. This little showtime is almost like a spike lee joint ... You have an African American male (Danny Glover), who traditionally worked in white law occupations in the 1970s. Like any American, He is in line with his family's upcoming mobile status, but he has forgotten, and problems continue. At that time there were only two African American neighbors. Owning a house <br /> <br /> Then the blending started. His wife (Wopie Goldberg) is said to "take part", so she does what other women in her neighborhood do. And when he and his family feel "in", they are "lotto" (Mo'nique), and won him in the eyes of him and he wants nothing with them because he comes to another African American who gets in and he does not think that the neighbors are alike. He has, of course, a good skill, his new neighborhood "Ghetto" can not be there! <br /> Who is the trouble now? <br /> <br /> This is a picture of how big it is for the family, and how they lose in this process. Racism starts and ends ... with whom. It shows how much color you are and how much money you have, and you can still close yourself from the real world and help people around you. <br /> <br /> But, overall, the film is about 'people', and you have no race, but this African American children, in turn, will change themselves according to the cultures around them ("When the blonde hair and blue eyes are completed, your mind! How the picture looks to your neighbors and to each other is confused ... for the best of everything .. you feel that you have more money than others <br /> <br /> Again, not for everyone. <br /> Take a look and judge for yourself. </ P> <p> <br /> <br />
