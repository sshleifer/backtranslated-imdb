Leave puncture marks on the zoological and drying victims of their blood until someone dies (or something else). Who is the Police Detective Carl Brettsnewer (Melvin Douglas, who has been stumped outside of the B-movie horror genre) who stumped? This village meets epilepsy and her loyal doctor Dr. Otto von Neeman (Lionel Attville, in the role of another powerful mad scientist) to give some idea of ​​the cause of Carl's innocence. He feared the security of his beloved Ruth (Neiman's assistant, "Dr. X" & "The Mystery of the Wax Museum"), which later featured the film with Dwight Frey, Dwight Frye, who filmed the batsman, where he collects bats and the confused stance Has it. Let's see why he is suspect of the local mental illness being on a fever pitch. Maude Eburne's humor is quite simple (and easily influenced) by Van Neumann's patient believes that she reads her books in her laboratory.

Many of the movie is disappointed with the ending results as the actual virtual vampire about the murder of the original vampire killer.
