A linear trip to non-linear construction. It's time, in about 12 monkeys, current, coming between the future and the past and flows in to go. However, the simplicity of the movie can not be avoided: it's the projector's work, the ending of the story. <br /> <br /> We depend on the temporary theme that is inevitable of our actions. <br /> <br /> Terry Gilliam movie is the lowest place in the world of free images. <br /> <br /> We learned about a Schizophrenic prophesy that governed a plague on Earth since 1997. <br /> <br /> Cole's (Willis) mission is clear: back in the mid 90s, the virus. There is no way to change the past: all that is currently able to collect information that helps scientists (we, the audience, the future, the future) finds this treatment. <br /> <br /> The second is dark and inhuman, which is controlled by unrestrained scientists, which are "volunteers" (the term is incisively sarcastic) <br /> The scientists have not yet reached the highest level of travel time and the collapse ends on the wrong dates - later, the pediatrician pioneered for the psychiatrist Catherine (Stowe) <br /> <br /> We see the simplicity and unequal disruption in the simplest temporary via the evolution of the story. <br /> <br /> There is one scene where the first one and the ends are almost the last - and certainly the climatic <br /> <br /> It changes itself as a reminder of Cole memorabilia. <br /> <br At one airport, <br /> <br /> Previously (a kid who visits Calle Airport with his parents) meets the present (time of the narrative), and in the future (adult kale) storyline, Cole already has the feeling of enjoying the original reality now. Proof that it is impossible to avoid what his prophetic dreams are or what to do. <br /> <br /> The agents suffering from this disease stop him from killing a mad scientist, physician Peters (Morse). It is responsible for the spread of the disease. And, in the case of Cole, what to do. <br /> <br /> Many do not understand the image. <br /> <br /> "Two good films are such a plot: the back to the future trilogy (" the mad scientist "is another angle for the character, <br /> The" Wild Strawberries "is one of Bergman's artworks in another register , Which is in the second film - especially in the second film - it's more than just Gilliam's work, an odd Hollywood film. <br /> <br /> I do not see "La Jetski" I can not find it because it's great.
