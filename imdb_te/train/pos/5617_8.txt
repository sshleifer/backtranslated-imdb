His classical film Nair Lunar Romana returned to the themes of his great success in his 60s, with the crazy horror of Roman Polans, repulsion and Rosemary's baby, dealing with the mental disorder and claustrophobia living in the apartment. Polanski is the best of claustrophobic environments, and it is the most breathless and limited image he has ever created. Side walls and distant vanishing points are never as big as ever, and the sky is rarely seen in a small number of outdoor scenes. But the tenant is not just spatial, but also the intensity of focusing on its main role. In each scene, almost every shot is in the scene that Tolkovsky played by Polans. When the camera is not high on the screen when Trevlevsky's views are not the viewpoint. <br /> Almost everywhere he is looking at him in the mirror and looking at his own reflection. <br /> <br /> What do I think about the interior and loneliness of a character? We apologize for some mental thrillers such as M or Peeping Tom suffering from mental illness. Others, like Psycho, attempted a deep scientific analysis of his mood. Did not renters do these categories? It just immerses us inside the experience of Trelkovsky without demanding to really understand or appreciate what is going on inside his head. <br /> <br /> Palazzo is a master of the horror movie that is slowly unfolding. Often there is ambiguity about whether there is any bad place in his horror space, but they are among the most influential people in the scary audience. Why? Because they are very slow and immersed in the audience with a lot of effort, they have been struggling in situations and investing a lot of time. After much of the Polanski horror, the Ninth Gate maintains a bit of a mess with the plot but at least still practiced in practice in practice. <br /> <br /> This Polanski is a main character with a rare opportunity to see himself. His talent in front of the camera is as good as it is behind it, and he is perfect as positive Trelkovsky. Another standout appearance is all too often overlooked Shelley Winters as the Concierge. In this odd, Gothic European movie, many faces are visible but in fact it is a stellar cast. <br /> <br /> The song is more polished and less serious than the village, but the role of suspense and rosemary's baby makes it so absorbing and entertaining. The tenant is not good, there are no major flaws, and Polanski is in the lead role, but it is not in his most gripping works.
