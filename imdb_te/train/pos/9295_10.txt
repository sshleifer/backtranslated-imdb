It's hard for me to believe negative comments about all the stars. I laughed through the whole family, my whole family did. The film is clearly defined as an old time gangster comedy - the players are crazy - I bet they have a good old time while doing it. In fact, Gold Blum and Dreyfus are great - and the Everly Sisters, each with two Falco's, and Divine music. Rob Rainer is a great smiley limo driver, and Gabriel Byrne is a ridiculous nerve. Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, The Sleepy Joe's character and the entire mortuary and the Grave Digger references. <br /> <br /> Paul was afraid of his usual entertaining self, Byrne Vick, after receiving his "My Way" home. A funny speech to Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfus is well immersed. I think there is no one to imitate any film, the actions of the film - this is a joke - not an awful "gangsta" movie. <br /> Truly, as a musical comedy called "Mad Dog Time", many cartoons, TV crime plays, and talk shows. I would recommend a video for family entertainment evening.
