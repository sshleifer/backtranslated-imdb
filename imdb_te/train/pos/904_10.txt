Suraj Bajataya is the best film on the marriage. And here he is; Back to his fundamental subjects. It's the story of marriage from engagement when the story goes. You can see your whole family around you. You hates watching alone. The story is very simple, but the music is good, cinematography is wonderful, directing is the best, everything about the film is its own class. <br /> If you look at your girlfriend, you have a lot of shorts and shots that tell you, both of you will go to catch everyone's hand until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Amita Jodi has given us such films as Shahid Ishq Vishkh and Shikhar. Shikar is a good movie but it is not well received by the public. Really Shahid & Amrutha movie.
