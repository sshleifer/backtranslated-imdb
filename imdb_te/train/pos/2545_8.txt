Unseen Ray boris Karlov and Bela Lugosi's performing skills are both a spectacular performance. Carlofe pulls a flawless performance as a vicious and controversial scientist, and his scientific achievements and his wife go ahead with his relationships with others. <br /> <br /> While Logosi is passionate about his work, it's time to continue doing good things with everyone, but still true friends. It was one of his few roles as good guy and he played well. Yet his voice is heard and he believes that he is French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in the film is that it is based on "junk science", but as a way, waste science works well. Though ideas and theories are completely idiotic, they are "relevant" today when they make this image. And they will also advance forward- and will always be. <br /> <br /> It's a perfect joy to watch this again. I've probably watched this weekend for 5 weeks and I'll sit it five times more. Acting is amazing and science is entertaining. I highly recommend it.
