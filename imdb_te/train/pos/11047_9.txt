In the end, I hope for a few years to release this film in England, but I finally saw it. To start acting, the film has many great things. It's not all that much in a horror movie, but people in this film put all the fine work on. This and constant grip and interesting script, a nice sorta LoveCorce feel it, give the film a real solid spine. Add surreal nightmare image and occasionally gorgeous gore and images to dosages of the winner. This is my favorite kind of gore, very supernatural and vengeance. Also, Freudian over-tones often morose, angry bodybuilding fluorescence and daisy, meanwhile freakish and unnerving at his mentally retarded lover / athletic occasions, to give up any morbidly grown craziness sense. This is one of the most surprising hollywood movies ever produced by Hollywood. My only stomach is that I wanted darker ends in the tone, but still works, so I'd really recommend this to horror buffs.
