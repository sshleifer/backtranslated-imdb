First, let's start with negative points: 1) Do not answer story and questions, there is no place in it, 2) This film is not for all people, so unwelcome viewers are homeless and shining in the movie. <br /> <br /> The two points above are important because the image is very quiet. As an old type theater (as I went), you can hear the reel that you can go through the projector at times. I like that. <br /> <br /> This image does not leave you busy with music, or effects. It will reflect what happens. <br /> <br /> Without a rhythm it creates an atmosphere, it is completely pleasant. Stanley Kubrick was created in a similar atmosphere on the Ice Wide Shutt. Not everyone. <br /> <br /> Cinematographic work is amazing and I would highly recommend movie fans. Those who depend entirely on their storyline in the story are completely disappointed. This is the story you need to make the links in your mind. (It's pretty darn cool, but probably off too!) If you're going to catch the film, there's a very cool episode: when two cops are talking each other on their cell phones. An ultra cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. Hats for the person who is supposed to do this.
