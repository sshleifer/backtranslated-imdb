A surprisingly well for an independent movie, Insomnia Nightmare is a startling movie what it will be like suffering from insomnia. <br /> <br /> When Dominic Monaghan is acting as Jack, he is well-written and directed by watching everything he sees, which stimulates the audience one night. Long hours of a lonely night drag. The narrative is nearly hypnotizing, and starting from the opening lines, turning away is impossible. <br /> Every corner turns around and turns, an insomniac nightmare provocative and obsessed. This is highly recommended.
