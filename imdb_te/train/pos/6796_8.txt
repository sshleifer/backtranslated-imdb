Zodiac Killer (2005) is a very interesting picture from the German birth director, Ony Lomel. He directs this latest product, producer and co-stars. He is the only one to manage to make an interesting movie inexpensive. Heer Lomel reaches less when he works in the footage from almost the entire movie catalog. I saw film clips from Bowieman I and II, Warburds, Wolfe, Mental Waves, and Cocaine Cowboys (Andy Warhol also made Andy Warhol beyond admiration of the film). Though he uses old footage, he works well (and I can add it to the creatively). <br /> <br /> The film follows the young man who copied the original Zodiac killer. He was also a writer (Only Lowell) who also wrote about the serial killer during the sixties and early seventies. The friend's friend (David Hess) helps him try and find this brave zodiac. Can this killer be disabled? Does the author combine both together and save some of his former glory? David Hess still man? <br /> <br /> This film is not about the original Zodiac killer. I heard about people who have filmed the video about this film. But that's what. The director's old school artistic style reveals the fact that it is filmed in the video. My only complaint is the use of stock footage from Her Lommel's previous images (but I do not believe in the hype) why "wink" means "wink.") It is sand and street level horror movie. While denying the initial states, the film does not glorify murder. <br /> Most recommended for fans of onion lime.
