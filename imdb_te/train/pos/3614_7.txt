Girlfight is like cooking your grandmother: same old recipe you've tried a million times before, yet something new and something new is transformed. Try and explain the story as before: A young woman from the wrong side of the tracks tries to improve her situation by taking her boxes, but her growing attraction to the bitter, resistant father and men. See them roll their eyes at the string of clips, and they are right: it is * cliche. And I have hypnotized how this film works, because it's often a wonderful acting and dialogue and delicate direction that is 'new'. Though it looks worse, I'm away from the movie because it does not make the mistake. Definitely worth a look.
