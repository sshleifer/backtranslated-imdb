I got to see this in the NZ plane last week, and it was wondering how to measure up to both the UK film and book. I said it would be nice. In any Lean years, the favored attachment to Red Saxes works much better than the original devotion to Arsenal FC, who have succeeded over the years. As a Brit I was interested to see you do not need to understand baseball to get what is going on. In the mind a question assumes - was the screenplay written using the team as socks before they finally broke Bambino's curse? Or another team in the frame? A Red Sax fan should make me feel good (a Brit that understands baseball).
