Gray Gardens is the world to himself. Edith and Little Eddie are almost living alone, eating ice cream and liver pate in their temporary kitchen in their (apparently) shared bedroom. Cat parents talk about kittens when insulting his daughter's tenure. It should come in the way of Tennessee Williams's play and inspire screen writers and dramatists, as if strange and overlapping dialogue is 100% true. <br /> <br /> The situation at home is my grandmother and her 50-year-olds lived a decade (they were poor and cleaner). <br /> <br /> They kiss all the days, while grandmother is talking about her glorious past, and her daughter has been continually accused of losing opportunities with men, work and self-expression. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of mother / daughter of this movie. It is sad and varied, but the filmmakers have done an excellent job to get adequate facilities for Edikes themselves to be so ignorant. The real life is so rare that it is rare and occasionally considered - the remnants of a powerful family vary in the skeleton of their own building.
