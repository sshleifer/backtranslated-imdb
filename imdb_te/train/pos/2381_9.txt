"The classic war of the worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film, rebooting H. G. Wells's classic book with great effort and length. Mr. Hines has succeeded in doing so. I and those who viewed my pictures with him are not the standard, predictable Hollywood fare that comes out every year, e.g. The Spielberg version with Tom Cruise is slightly different from that book. Apparently, everyone looks for different subjects in one image. Only those who can imagine themselves as enthusiastic "critics" criticize what they can do. Some of the important locations are rated for the film, not entertaining, with many "critics" entertaining. Mr. H. Wells is reliable to the classic novel. Mr. Hines tried to make it and we found that it was very entertaining. This made it easier for "critics" to recognize its shortcomings.
