I'm very young, The Beatles is my perfect favorite band! <br /> <br /> It did not have a chance to listen to their music but I loved them since I remembered them. <br /> This is a valuable picture of trying once. I can see why it's released in the movie but it's a great movie put on TV. I filmed it through my TV guide and was to watch the film, which did not see much details of John Lennon and Paul McCartney's after Bettles and Jarred Harris were split into Stars. I did not hear about him (he acted as John) or Aiden played the role of Quinn Paul. <br /> <br /> The film began slowly but with the development, I saw Quinn very well, but Harris played their roles in particular. As a huge fan, I'm like Lennon and McCartney. The script is clever and Harris Lennon's accent, personality and accustomed spot spot! Quinn played McCartney very well, but sometimes he went into his Irish accent. <br /> As I said earlier, it started slowly but slowly began to come. It soon grew and became a very emotional film. The bit in the park was a total time waste and the musicians found out both the character too. For Lennon's tumultuous line in Italian restaurant, completely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The fact that I have lived and famous with Beatles is quite different from the other life images I've seen, and those are really never those characters. <br /> <br /> In the end, if I'm a fan of Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney, give me a surprise. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows that the meeting in 1976 really happened, send it to the 'Comments page' for this image. 'Very interesting.
