Another Aussie masterpiece, which enters the unknown and supernatural world, and it does it very well. It does not resort to over-the-clock effects such as American Flicks, which focuses more on the emotional effect. Rebecca Gibbney and Co. It broke out a couple of stories that bought an old house, an old woman who never went out, and her husband had disappeared in suspicious circumstances a century ago. Strange things take place at home, and John begins to begin into the man, who actually disappeared who is Mass Massacre. Highly recommended. 8/10
