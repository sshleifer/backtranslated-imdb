As an old white housewife, I can still appreciate that Laurence Fishburn is one of our best actors. Anyone who has appreciated his work in Deep cover can enjoy the unbelievable performance of the actor. It may be more interesting since I thought it was directed by him. All acting is very good. If you can not take the reality of the lesser Manhattan junky worlds or criminal life (fun action-shoots-ups) then you're not enjoying the movie. The general collaboration of Mr. Fishburn is very subtle relations. I would love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins go and go another day in a single day in a movie.
