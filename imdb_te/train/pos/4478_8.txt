Overall this happy, lively, romantic, musical comedy. I think a small case can be made to make the film lengthy. But I'm not sure what you will cut. Songs by Kelly and Sinatra? No. Kelly's amazing dance? No. What is the time to develop the story story and take time to develop characters' relationships? <br /> <br /> Many films in this movie are unable to develop the characters) Listen to the great talent from 1040s. So what if he is not an actor? Graceson played a major role in making him audition with him. <br /> <br /> Catherine Grayson wanted to be an opera actor. Louis B. Meyer brought her to the MGM for a screen test, including an aria. In the film she was laughing and laughing MGM brass's cloth during audition. <br /> <br /> You may want the film to be a real screen test year. The great use is made of color and lighting throughout the film. You can see why Frank Sinatra is the star he made. Sinatra (also a ladies man) is a talented man in the role of playing a role in finding a holiday on vacation. After seeing this movie you will feel good. 7/10
