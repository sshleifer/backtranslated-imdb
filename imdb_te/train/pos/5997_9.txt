Let me start by saying I have never reviewed the IMDb earlier. However, I'm in the video biz. And coming from that understanding; I can say without this shadow that the picture is small. It's a good story and another thing I love - (a better twist end). <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of B & W, but this film uses the effect it will do. And all the subjects with any movie. The flow of this film works perfectly and the album is very well done. From a technical side of things (which is usually the side of work) everything is well done. The main tech is missing. Out point. One of the only credits I have only small is that it is a little bouncy. This may cause a rendering problem. I also said that I would love to see the love but I personally (so you can chalk up to a person factor). <br /> Overall I am 9/10. <br /> If you are a fan of Indies and / or small films it is worth the watch. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the wrong grammar or spelling.
