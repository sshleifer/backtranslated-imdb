A sweet funny story that crosses 2 people as they prepare for their weddings. Even though former police writer and public school teacher marry other great people, this great New York set came to an end. Perhaps "partners" are two types of personalities, and our heroes are more relaxed. Not heavy, but made me smile. And hay for boys - Natasha Henstridge perspective, and sell gals - sell them sappy romance, everyone wins!
