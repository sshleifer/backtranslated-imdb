The best Anti Nazi promotional films made during World War II can be seen in the Rhine. Paul Lucas deserves his Oscar. Betty Davis shines brilliantly as a great actress and beauty. I would recommend this picture to those interested in that era, and, ultimately, the great, wonderful pictures of Ms. Betty Davis.
