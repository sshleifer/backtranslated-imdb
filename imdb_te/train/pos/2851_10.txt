The three main characters with Japanese indie motion humor and philosophy literally walk through the whole movie sarcastically, because of strange situations and humorous coincides with each other. As they walk, look at what's going on in the mind and see how they're there. Running action this down on their luck is a metaphor for people's lives. In some ways, they are not really chasing what they really are chasing, but understand their life and escape from their personal problems and broken dreams. Running believes that the truth is alive. It's funny in a brilliant way when they accidentally end up in the big-life-changing run adventure when it comes to something big, violent, and absurd. One of my favorite films from time to time, is intellectual director Sabu.
