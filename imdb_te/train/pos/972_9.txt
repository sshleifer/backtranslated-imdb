Wow! Very happy! Probably by Terry Gilliam all the way - perhaps a lot of American offspring, and a stretch to really call this kid's film, this film reminds me a bit of time bands. While the whole story is pretty much moving forward, Mikey's still surrenders in surreal and Bunuel-Esquire moments. The typical family life of the mainstream / family will be visible from the scene of the entire activity of the spirit world and its evil. Moreover, Michael's work has a vague element of generality, and the layers of meaning and metaphor, especially the hostile decision of anti-war / human revenge, is pretty gruesome. Instead of being the only manic and imaginative fun as other big MiG's films, instead of just a top suggestion and gore, he has an endless multiplayer adventure from CG and fiction from Japan folk-based folk-base. F'n rad, and the best of Miak!
