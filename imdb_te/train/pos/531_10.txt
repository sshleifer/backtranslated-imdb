The film has the most beautiful starting range ever made. I've seen this film for the first time a week ago, everyday from the beginning and every time I thought it was thrilled, the first time I listened to Amartya words from David Nivan's Sir Walter Raleigh's pilgrimage: <br /> <br /> My scrap- Shell, my staff of faith, joy, immortal food, my bottle of salvation, my gown of fame, a real gauge of hope; Do you know why this is a betrayal to say that the lives of Michael Powell and Emerick Pressbergers are completely justified for the creation of such a fantastic start? <br /> <br /> I can not imagine that they are facing trial during Doomsday and I am talking nonsense to a hated God: I am your apology, sir. So, do you want to know what we have done in our lifetime? Well, you'll see: We've directed and produced the product: Where am I going, Colonel Blimp, Red Shoes ?? Do you think that's enough sir? It is obvious that these two great artists are already fulfilling the fate of God, the nature of the muse, or when they photograph any Matter of Life and Death. <br /> <br /> The fact that everyone's lives are justified for their work is not clear to everyone. Old timers are tempted to say: they do not have more movies like this. They are partially mistaken; <br /> <br /> I quote the keys here, but I will do his words: one thing of beauty is forever happy.
