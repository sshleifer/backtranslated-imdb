The only reason I know about midnight cowboy is because it is in the Top 100 of AFI Critic. It's not a well-known movie on a Top 100; In fact, I had to look hard to find a copy, I got the DVD version for half the price. Surprisingly it is rated only M15 + (uncut version). <br /> <br /> I suspect most people will receive a review of this review (like comments), so I'll do it briefly. This is probably one of the most important movies I've ever seen, which is the use of mantes, artistic filming (a lot of arts) and exceptional background. <br /> <br /> Many things in the film still do not understand (I have seen it twice) and it is emotionally confusing. <br /> <br /> Film and acting are very good, the film is bigger than the characters in the memorable life. The main character Joe Buck, a 'cowboy' from Texas, is going to become a male prostitute for New York. He meets Cunningman Enrico 'Nighttime' Rizo with a handicap, and they become friends who go through normal grievances. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br> <br> /> <br /> I really felt that the film could really have any emotional connection with the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo, and that's certainly very sad and sad. <br /> <br /> I personally think this film is beautiful and well understood by its main themes. Human disadvantage (showing dark and braking down stations of city streets). Most of the characters in the movie are beyond the law (a conman, giggolo.etc) and you will not be able to help them. <br /> <br /> We are sorry for this film. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is very high because it's very expensive. At the time (and now also) it's definitely not a simple picture (most arts house). While the film was dominated by films in western, musical and dramas that were tired with exceptional themes like Midnight Cowboy. <br /> <br /> At the personal level, I like this film. The imagery is a dream-like feature. I especially liked the scene in the party, watching your music and pictures in your mind for a long time. However, as a film for entertainment, it's a little bit of thrills (really not my style). <br /> <br /> Although I do not think I'm qualified to analyze this film, the characters and their intentions are very interesting. From what I learned from past music, Joe Buck was sexually abused by her grandmother, yet it does not seem to be related to the story. He is a happy-luck young stud, suppressing his dark memories. The religious meanings of the film are also unclear. Some people suggested homosexuality between the buck and rhythm, but I could not see that they got the idea. <br /> <br /> The theme of homo-sexuality is more than what it touched in their conversation, then accompanied by Joe Buck's solo old man, but it is very small with the main story. <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of one of the best films of the decade (which has more than 70s feelings) and touches on some of the revolutionary themes. It has a simple, sentimental hero (disguised by a hard edge) of the film's weird, often psychedelic sequences.
