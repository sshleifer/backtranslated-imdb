The villain in this movie is an average sob and he seems to enjoy what he's doing, I guess he makes him understand so. Although most men betray their wife, I do not think this film is particularly important. One of those films that are pretty pretty too late. But there you go, the candy-bar is over, and I look back and say "hello hell." A good picture until the end. Ending is not the end we want to see, but it does not end until such an average start. And then what happened after that. Guess you can make your own mind about the real ending. I thought that only a single character must exist.
