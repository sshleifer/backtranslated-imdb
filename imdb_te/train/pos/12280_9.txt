This is one of the few films I have seen twice in the theater. I really like this film to tell his atmosphere and tragic hero Esteban Triba's life. He makes a lot of mistakes but he's got a chance to get free. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first time, the film ended after the election - I do not know the book. I'm wrong when the dramatic climax is still coming! <br /> <br /> Many people here do not like this movie completely. I can not understand a bit. First of all, the readers of the book - often with screen prototypes of novels - many things remain unclear, invisible and unreasonable. But a film telling a touching story - the insanity of a family story, a person's growth and fall, a woman's deepest compassion, love strength and hatred (and conservatism) - this picture is simply amazing! Also, the soundtrack is very good and the cast itself is amazing - especially the Winona Rider and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> So the movies have appeared in this movie!
