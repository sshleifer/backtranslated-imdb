At that time, kudos to Peset to take up controversial characters. For my memory, rape was still a taboo issue in the 1980s, and at that time women's rights and emotions were rarely examined very deeply. <br /> <br /> Fewet is just a woman, then actor James Russia. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwood has a bit of role as Alfred Wuddor's house member. Fawcett, a victim of rape, was concerned about legal consequences when she was a victim of the offender. She throws a frying pan of hot oil in Rosso's classic on the scene, and for rape he deserves it. She puts him in bondage and has to face the consequences. <br /> The true story that reflects the emotions and absorption of victims of the victims of rape, is physically and emotionally. Highly recommended. 8/10.
