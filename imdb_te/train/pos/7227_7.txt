Peter O'Toole is a treat to look at the lines that he's talking about and how good the sleeping stupor is at risk. <br /> <br /> Without a distinctive scene in this film - allows viewers to entertain entertainers in an entertaining social commentary. . Even though it is not a big movie by any count, its entertaining performances will be remembered. <br /> <br /> York York is also a treat to watch, eventually signing papers, silently excluding silently. The possible weakness here is Thompson's laid-back direction. <br /> <br /> I have twice seen this movie, "Brotherly Love" The film "Country Dancing" is a very simple and inappropriate title for the film.
