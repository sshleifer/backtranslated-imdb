This is the story of Scotland's legendary hero, Rob Roy, and the landlord landlords moving his battles. It is more often compared to Braveheart, which is not very historical. Despite their primarily fictitious nature, I would rate both these films and hard work to choose between the two. 13 Century William Wallace, as others have discovered, is bigger than the National National Figure, but in the early 18th century, Rob Roy is an honorable but ordinary Scotman. <br /> <br /> This story revolves around a clan leader, his wife Mary and their two sons Robert Roy MacGregor who lives in a Scottish mountain cottage. The film began, and he and his colleagues hunted some of the trolls that stole the local Lord's cattle. Rob Roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people, and thus arranges to buy thousands of Scottish pounds from the Marquis of the landmarks of the local highland, the herdsmen of the market. He donated this money to his friend Alan McDonald. When Macdonald and money disappeared, Rob Roy was in stark contrast with Mobyros, his obscene presentation, Archibald Cunningham and his infamous character and killer. <br /> <br /> Mobroes is also tested by Rob Roy's dignity when he attempts to participate in false testimony against his opponent Duke of Argyle. <br /> <br /> <br /> Attractive Liam Lasson, a brilliant, viral, and noble hero, and a respected person in honor of him, is the patron slayer of Rab Rai who is the key to this story. Personally, I think this is Nice's best acting, adding his authenticity to the average viewer and his Irish (though Irish). Rob Roy is a stubborn, proud, courageous, sincere person whose word is reliable. The husband and father of his love, and his friend MacDonald, is also confident that he is accused of stealing him. <br /> <br /> Tim Roth portrayed his main rival, and Archibald Cunningham, an arrogant and brutal strategic peacock, one of the most violent and sanitarian film villains. He is very elegant for anyone who makes ravish his main business with local women, whether or not. Sadly Cunningham indicates the fact that he does not know a bastard about his own father's identity, although it rarely defends the horrors of murder, rape and theft. Furthermore, after she had committed suicide after being pregnant with her child, he put her child next to a child. <br /> <br /> This film is a very incredible love story between a simple man and his wife who essentially portray the passionate relationship between Rob. Roy and Mary. Those who question the existence of hobbies in marriage should see this husband and wife! The phrase I use this couple is 'How Well You Can ...' is one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all the movies. <br /> <br /> Rob's wife, Marie McGregor, is the most compelling performance by Jessica Lange. Without making it, she has a pretty but natural look of her ruthless farmer's wife and mother. When the frustrated killer appears, the actress will bring great courage and respect to her role during rape with the worst Cunningham. Her speech is plain, but filled with pride and kindness. The reason I was given to Hollywood once was not their intention to reveal their cruelty in the rape scene, to the pain and humiliation of Mary, but to make a sensation. Their cousin, Alastair MacGregor, shows emotional agony when learning of Mary's rape, and her husband shows her more pain when she is secretly dropped by her husband by Cunningham. <br /> <br /> The film features beautiful scenery of Scottish mountains, luxurious long dresses and appropriate musical scores. Braveheart does not have any grand battle scenes, but the steady action of the last fight between Rob Roy and Cunningham, and the specially captured sword fight. It is an attractive film that has both sharp reaction and a beautiful love story.
