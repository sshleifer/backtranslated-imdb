This is a sharp political commentary about the story coming of age. The annoying thing is that it works efficiently on both levels. It's supposed but it does. The story of the four boys who grew up in the Communist Belgrade in 1953 and the girl's warm heart. What does this mean in classic film? In fact, the 1953 Belgrade communist society is not often fascist and dictatorial. Rock and roll music can be heard, one of the song songs "Hey Babu Riba" is the title of the film. But jeans are illegal or have some medications are illegal. Unlike the extreme criticisms of a Communist society, the film shows how it affects the lives of four major cast members. A father in exile in Italy and a girl waiting for her mother passport and she has to go to join him, because the piano is removed from a child and your home and quarters because they need your new comrades. The boys spend time listening to music. Stalin hates the fascism they have created with the fascist Charlotte, tattooed in his hands. After the release of the film in the twilight of the Soviet Empire in 1986, they will lead to all the actions taken afterwards and spending some time. A great image to see again and again. "Repentance is not your enemy, but it's not even a friend."
