Sandler is amazing again ... I'm already a sandler fan. The film is a Sandler Sandler story. Its expression is amazing. I clicked on more and more but there were some similar points. You can tell the family's value before losing it and say 'I love you' are some of the most fascinating facts in life ... It's tough, it's true ... and actually the real owner of this victory, the binder. I do not think another director would give such emotions. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle from Cradle is one of my favorites. Do not laugh or expect a very positive atmosphere ... If you're ready to face the facts of life, do not miss this movie.
