Yes, it will get ten full stars. This is plain on the day that this filler is genius. The universe sent Trent Harris a young, amazingly strange man one day and Harris holds him on the tape, you can not get a real fake fame. The tragedy of a young man is very bad, if only an alternative ending is written for that fellow story. The remaining two stages of the trilogy, the story of young men, have been put in the story with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover. The world is expanded and occasionally occasionally by the replacement of Strangenes by giving an extensive glimpse into the weirdest increase in America. Recommended to anyone and everyone!
