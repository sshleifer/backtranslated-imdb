From what critics and audiences have suggested, the Bitter Girl should be a big fat glue. Still, I love Nicole Kidmann, I decided to rent it last night. It's proven to be very worth looking. Sure, it's not your basic American comedy, and it does not take a genius to comprehend that it's a very British film, but why I liked it. A change from all the other movies around it, the breath of fresh air. Sure, there are some plot holes, but the whole task. First off, Kidman is incredibly beautiful, but it is still quite different from a very sexy character. She has proven that she is just one of the highest talents in Hollywood. She speaks English only when she speaks English, but she has long conversations in Russian and there are times if you do not know that Nicole Kidman is, you never question her authenticity. Harrison Ford should take note in "K-19". The whole little little image that works despite the terrible buzz.
