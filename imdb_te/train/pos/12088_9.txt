Hardcore and McCormick is an amazing TV show. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, The A-Team, etc. are speculative. <br /> <br /> This program is a good clean television. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is very amusing. They often take job in each episode, which adds to the great deal of comedy for the show. It's a lot of chases in every episode, but who do not like a good car chassis? Especially with Coyote! <br /> <br /> I want to make a clean television like today.
