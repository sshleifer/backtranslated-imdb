This is a plain old scary ghost story. I showed it to some of my friends in my movie club, until they were mesmerizing! Blood or Gore - just good old fashion suspense. It starts right away from the beginning, and builds and builds. The end is a real twist that drew not know me. <br /> <br /> He played well and played well. It is a "set of time" set in the 1920s - added to the weather. <br /> <br /> I am impressed by the Susan Hill book from Amazon. The book is very close to the book. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that it's not readily available on DVD. My copy is VHS. In addition to this "The Haunted" is probably the best Ghost Stories I've ever done with the scene. It just shows that little creativity will outdoes your day "your face" on your day!
