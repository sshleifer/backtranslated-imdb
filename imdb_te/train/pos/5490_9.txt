It's really a wonderful movie. The permanent struggle of indigenous and poverty people will not only earn their proper voice, but also the United States for its deception, stupidity, and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez has been shown to be a very brave and attractive leader, something different than the lack of any sense of inequality or justice. The filmmakers recorded a rebellion without witnessing before. <br /> <br /> And in the cross-hair, watching the Americans again pulls the strings and obscures all the feel of reality. It is heartbreaking to see the initial steps of the rebellion to fully understand that the degradation of democracy is seen as a tool used by subsequent American governments and their seemingly non-existent slum dwellers. The footage makes it clear that it is not a manipulation of TV or generic footage, an active document of people and struggles for its future. A truly moving experience for anyone with a conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. <br /> <br /> Every country needs to be considered to allow its governance to be elected and the development of the majority view. The first step in this process is to know what the reality of the situation is, and the documentary does a great job of doing that work.
