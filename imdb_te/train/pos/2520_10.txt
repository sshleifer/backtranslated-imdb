Although others say (* cough *), this is my favorite movie. I do not know how much time I waited to see, but once I finally did, I immediately fell in love. Sure, it's peculiar, but it just offers more exciting taste. For those who do not know, Moonchild is one of the first films of Gack and Hyde. They did not do much more, probably 3 or 4 tops each. So give them some credit. We all know Adam Sandler is not the best either. I believe that they will throw some odd situations there, but I find the best points of this film, to find emotions and whatnot. Therefore, I gave, and always gives, this picture is 10 to 10.
