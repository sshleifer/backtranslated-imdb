In the near future, fasting from Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Nordam), Digicorp, appointed by a large corporation, their competitors, secretly appointed to spy and steal from the sunways. In addition to his training, Morgan was a conspirator, traveling to Jack Guruborby's new identity and boring lectures. One of them, he approaches the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), indicating how he is. Morgan discovers a new reality, where he does not know who to trust. <br /> <br /> The unknown "cipher" was a surprise to me. The film is not released in Brazil, but the glamorous and exciting story is very complex with plots, and with great screenplay, direction and performances. In the last turn, I recall Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall". The film deserves to be viewed more than once, and I really do not like the last scene when separating the controversial disc in an independent spy sea. Director Veseno Natalie only knows from the wonderful "Cube", and this second work I see is also amazing. My vote is eight. <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
