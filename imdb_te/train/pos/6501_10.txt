If you are interested in all things that you would like to know about WWII from multiple perspectives, this DVD will distribute, you will learn to assure new things, so you will not need any other documentaries on this subject. Get it, see, learn from it. Good for school use. View it with Torah Torah Torah as a bonus, private Ryan, Patton, Brothers band, long distance bridge, tall day and other WWII episodes to see more of both. Sir Laurence Oliver's voice adds the whole atmosphere of each episode in this 26-part series. Seriously you will not find a good WWII documentary set in the case. Perfect 10 !!!
