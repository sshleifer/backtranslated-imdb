I'm a fan of Hal Hart's films, especially in 1997's "Henry Phool." "Fay Grimm" is a sequel to the film, and a similar style and humorous concept. The plot, however, is completely different. Fay Grimm (who played brilliantly through the iconic Parker Posey) tries to find his missing husband notebooks, and finds her among the plots and spies. There are many amazing artists who came from the supporting cast (the first film and the most welcome back from Jeff Gold Blum, Kunkma Burrows, and the 90s indie-darling Elena Lovenson) and the film is surprising. The director said that this is part of a trio like "Star Wars", "Empire Strikes Back", if this is true, I can not wait to see the third installment! I do not have to wait 10 years for it.
