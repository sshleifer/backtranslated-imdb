<br /> <br /> It is a very long film, it is very boring before you become interesting, but its length gives its characters the opportunity to find a permanent attachment in your roles. <br /> <br /> You will find particularly heartbeat because you are a story that guilty of jealousy and the weakness of its heroes. If you love a monster, Magnus Pyam, I cry for a spy that deceives everyone - especially his country, his friends and family - man from childhood manipulated and molded by the same person. <br /> <The whole story does not have a really fond character, does not sympathize with a reliable, 'moral' personality. But looking at the whole thing without tissue is very exciting. <br /> <br /> In the end, Well worth it for people who love curiosity about the human character.
