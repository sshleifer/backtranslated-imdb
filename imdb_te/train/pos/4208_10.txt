Every now and then this film was released No one ever heard and very little money and resource got shot in a very short time but everybody goes crazy about and becomes a surprisingly great. It's been done in the '50s with many small films, and most people have never heard of it. Some unknown to the great surprising little jewel from 50 are really worth digging. "Fright in Streets" is another image that pours out the mind. <br /> <br /> Both films are not like ordinary genres from their time and have been made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I am really surprised by how much I like this movie. This is a good and improved image of progress. It starts slowly like all the 'old' movies, but once you enter the story and the characters you are doing for a real treat with this film. <br /> <br /> There is a great story in this movie, though the film does not start the movie, but spying. It starts with a touch of film-Noir, this typical crime-thriller. But "pickup on the South Street" is not just cinematic by numbers but its own direction starts soon. It confirms that the film is astonishing but really refreshing than anything. <br /> <br /> I really liked the characters in the film. None of them are really good guys and they are all their faults and weaknesses. Truly humanity. It also has a great performance from Thelma Ritter, which is particularly well received by the well-deserved Oscar nomination. <br /> Although it is somewhat less obvious budget, it's just a great, original, and exclusive small film. <br /> <br />
