The bright use of oversted technicolor describes the optimistic consequences of today's Christmas celebration. The scenes (San And Pedro) were special (and clearly Jean-Luc Goddard, his film "Pierot Le-Fau") stealing this background, as scenes (extracting peering society behavior by Santa & Pedro Telescope). Highly recommended!
