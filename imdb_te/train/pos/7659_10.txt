Just watching this movie is finished. <br /> <br /> This is certainly a hit, and the opening sequences set the scene. Slow but slow growth increases leverage, and some light moments are perfect. <br /> <br /> Nigel Hawthorne can not be seen again. He is a very distorted person, and I realize I do not like him every time he appears. <br /> <br /> Steve-Tampe's totally agreeable and well thought out interpretations.
