I spent the last week watching John Cassavettes' films - starting with 'the woman with the influence' and ended up on 'early night'. I thoroughly and thoroughly blown away these two films. In the first minute, I was completely and completely absorbed in the 'early night'. I have experienced only a few moments, but I think that this film is going to be about two-thirds, as long as it comes to credits. From the way it is portrayed, Jen Rowlands, credits, opening, music, plot, sense of depth, pace, sensitivity, realism, characters, amazing moments of stupidity are just moments .... I agree with a previous comment to take to the desert island because the depth of this film is to be seen. If you're unhappy with having a home fire, I promise you to try the last dirty to save that money under your bed, instead of copying the image of this image.
