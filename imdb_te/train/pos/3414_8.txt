This interesting documentary tells the story of a tremendous journey to take blind Tibetan children in trekking in the Himalayas; But a personality confrontation between two significant individuals. On the one hand, Eric Weinmeyer, the first blind man to climb Everest, and mountaineers (mountain) mountaineers. On the other hand, Sabraya Tenberken, Blind Woman, runs the first school for blind Tibetans, who agrees with the trip, but then doubts about how it will happen. At some level, the Sabine mountaineer does not understand the philosophy (which focuses on the summit); She is right to identify the inability of her mountaineers' targets and the wishes of the children, but she her sympathy with her accuracy makes her sympathetic to her, especially her influential vita. In this setting (reasonably well-man) confrontation, we get an insight into the lives of children. I enjoyed watching movies even though this was a message that was evidently evident - even though it is controversial, it emphasizes how wonderful the film is to be somewhat generous. But it is very difficult to argue with that estimate, even if the viewer is somewhat obscure.
