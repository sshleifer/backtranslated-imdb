Leave me first bad, James Hanlon is terrifying to try out his detailed actions on what is happening with the training of rookies and the events of the day. <br /> <br /> It has entered into an agreement with other firefighters without the natural aspirations of their delivery. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to see without tears in my eyes. I'm a Englishman from London but I love New York and visited many times before and after September 11th. It's a second home for me and I can not help but destroy at the loss of life but also feel not to destroy part of a wonderful beautiful city. This is a real deal, with everything firefighters crashing around them. I am happy to show people how I feel on the day of the footage. It's a shame that people are not using any footage of jumping from buildings because there's friends who say it's a big part of their memory, and it must really be included to show how terrible future generations are. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy theorists can go to hell through the path.
