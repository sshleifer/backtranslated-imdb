"Oscice" is. Fascist was filmed in Italy in the Second World War (Think about it!), Which shot scenes and themes that were immediately banned from the theaters - even though it used the plot of a famous American novel. <br /> <br /> The "OCCSC" reveals the terrible war-time Italy (from the finest Italy shot in most of the fascist "Telephone Bianchi" films); But it will be the first time to go to bed after 5 minutes to take a married guy named Giovanna (Clara Kallaimi) to meet the shirtless Hunk Gino (Massimo Girito, in front of Brando's Kowalski in "A Street Car Named Desire"). We are in the Guyana and Valley Spaggio (Elo Marquo√±o - a very attractive actor, not just Pierre Clematis, who portrayed the Nazis in 1945, was not his face, at 28, the cutting-off and subtle non-denial homosexuality of the reality of the thing, in some words: sex, liar, Greed and poverty, it is rarely, in Italian cinema ever <br /> <br /> When the "OCCSC" was destroyed immediately after its launch - it was called a scandal and immorality.Wisconty was able to save the print, and when it was re-released after the war, many critics called it Rossoli's "Roma Citette Appa" Prior to Sika's "Sissusia", the front-runner of the neo-realistic movement called some Critics, especially Marcel Carney's "Koi des Broomms" and "Le Jorge Sewes" and Julian Duvier's "Pepe Le Moko" as "Italian Oscar" in Italian coincidence for "poetic realism" . <br /> <br /> "Oceanic" in its visual language (famous war shows in Italy, poverty, child labor, prostitution, booms, cheaters etc.) Although the battle scenes are portrayed in the life of Pasen, the characters and themes are already decided by Visconti. He was always interested in social and political / sexual distortion, all the more tragic, emotional, obsessive, greedy characters, realistic, "daily-life" characters and backgrounds in harmony with Dessica and Rosellini. In "Oscice" we already have elements of drama and tragedy, especially "Senso" (especially Visconti's exit departure from neo-realist aesthetics) and "Rocco e Suit Fratelli" "Really", "La Terra Trema", he is my fisherman mythological Makes people from day-to-day characters increases. <br /> <br /> "Osciece" is a good opportunity to confirm theories about great artists, changing their scenes, background or time settings, from their first performance, revisions and specific themes and concerns, starting from their first work, with Viscotti Frame or with backgrounds The essence of his art, well, are obsessively repetitive.
