Allergy is a pretty good picture! Robert Culp is very good in this movie and is perfect for the episode! It's hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do? I have seen this, and why do I think that's why to do all that stuff. It's not wrong but they learned their lesson when they chose the wrong man! Anytime watching this movie on tv is good!
