Although I have not started reading "classics" in literature for 47 years, it's not too late. Jane Eyre has been a fan of a number of reasons, since I am a part of the book I do not like, and I enjoy only a large part of it. 1983 TV mini-series with Gela Clark and Timothy Dalton Everything I can imagine. I saw a full-length movie in 2006. Dalton's' Mr. Rochester 'is great but I absolutely love Jayla's' Jane Eyre'. I was disappointed in the production, direction and dialogue, reflecting on the other 'classics' film I have seen recently. It is only reliable of Hollywood's illness and arrogance. Artistic license is not the smallest of plagiarism for great works in literature. Fraud using title after such license. Leave the brits to get this right (with others). You can not read the book without reliving the image with proper context and soul. Well done BBC.
