I imagine last night that I'm going to miss this great cultural program on Swedish TV, and when my girlfriend insisted on catching the TV, I came across (she made it easier for her to sleep!) Anyway - it must be an extraordinary idea - a Documentary on an interview with the sound only 30 years ago based on the film. But with an animated and other documentary film material, it adds a very good and intelligent picture of the 20th century - the most respected literary artists - Herzes, Georges Remy. <br /> <br /> The albums that have been compiled with a different eye (and I'll tell you that I can not get some that I do not do) after the film's appearance is easy to combine the variations and content in different times of my Tintin Hurgie life. My perception of albums has changed over more than 25 years I've already read them, my favorite is my opinion about my favorite, but this adds at least a size (at least) to them.
