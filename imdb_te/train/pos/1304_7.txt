Okay. Yes, it's great on the couch, and some small helper cast really bad (plus at least one actor has been used for two different but vibrant characters) until I loved a very close budget film (the same scenes shot in sunshine and later shade) and Nick Mancusso. But come on. Richard Greery Historical (his hair trip worth alone). Steven Ford is very fond of. Mancoso has some great songs, Nancy Allen, completely ridiculous and uncaring. Classic? No parts? Yes. Entertaining? Big Yes. I liked that they set on a day when they decided on any kind of hairstyle Guerrokon. "Are you fast?" ... "You're Not Fast."
