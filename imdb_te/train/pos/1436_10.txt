After working in Downtown Manhattan, I eat my meals during the summer days at the city hall at City Hall, where I will go and go. It was great to go beyond City Hall's doors and could be seen in the lobby and through the entire building. Al Pacino, (Mayer John Pappus), "Gigli", '03, gave an outstanding performance throughout the film, especially when he gave a speech at an African American church that killed a little boy. John Cusack, (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Runaway Jury", 03, a devoted servant of the mayor and worship him in his efforts. Bridget Fonda, (Marybeth Kogan) starts to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and gives a great supporting role. Finally, but in Danny Io (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", '01, played the role of a mob boss who has the most difficult options to make at the end of the picture! Great movie with great acting and fantastic photography in NYC!
