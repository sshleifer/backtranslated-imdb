I'm not a big Tim Matheran fan, but I have to admit that I like this movie. Some scenes are dark with a bit propaganda and a little bit confusing, the slash thriller I do not know to classify its little SF and a bit horror. If I did not see this image id is not really bad, the characters are interesting enough but their effectiveness is not really effective, this film can be much better. I know if the movie is going into the movie, but I thought it would have been made for the TV or just went straight to the video, I would buy it on DVD with my image and a little bit of the X-Files story added to it. Government agencies or Shifti corporations involved in Daddy Shadow affairs. Overall a good picture.
