This movie has always gained momentum from the video cover. In the end sold for sale to sell and the boy got a movie. The case is just a spectacular show from all over and it's pretty portrayed. Listening to such words from time to time, you may hear that you really are far from getting the bits in that story. It's really moving, often fun and very desirable. Most of the conversations are portrayed as if you are very early. From me 9/10. Must see.
