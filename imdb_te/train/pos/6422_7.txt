Military training films are very common, and they are becoming a genre themselves. Among the prominent ones are 'Officer and a Gentleman', 'Top Gun', 'GIJain' and 'Men of Honor'. The fact that this fact is not true is that the principle does not change the same fact. <br /> <br /> The story is indeed inspirational and maybe the best human-interest story in the above ones. Karl Bra≈üheer (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is undoubtedly the man of great courage and formula, and the role of his strength shines through the brightness of the film. Unfortunately, the tunnel has focused on presenting director George Tillman's characters, rather than Brasheer rather than Brasheer for the role of the different characters to show a steady state of Brescia. The main character of Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro), and a couple of scenes with Fistfight and his wife, except the opening scene, we do not know much about him. For example, on Sunday the paschess spotches the palms and assume that he will work a waist, but it does not follow at that time. Mr. Pipi (Hall Holbrook) gets us a short scene, so we can judge him. The rest of his screen shows him running around and running around. If a director makes a story of human interest, he needs to make the characters human. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary performance of Cuba Gudging Jr. Brassier. It's probably the best I've seen him. It is a more complete role and character than any part of his role, and he gets up on that occasion. In `Jerry Maguire ', Rod Tidwell is an attractive, but with a depth of a rain ink of a dimensional character. Broscher is very complicated and grounded, and the problems he faces are life crises, which has become very challenging. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is an amazing recovery from the last character of Gandy in the film "Chill Factor". The film that is almost professional suicide to take part in the film is terrible. <br /> <br /> After trying his hand as a comedian ('Annez It Is,' The Adventure of Rocky & Bulwinkle ',' Meet the Parents'), Robert Deniro reunited with his dramatic performances. DeNiro is not a bad comedian, it's just a great dramatic actor as he does not waste his time doing his comedy. Denario Billy stops a strict man on Sunday with a tortured soul. It is pleasure to see him work. <br /> <br /> Every film I see has a late Charlie Daryne. I watched 'The Legend of Baghgar Wans', 'Men of Honor' and 'The Yards' in the right line and I wonder if I had her role in every film in 2000 (actually she only did five). It was a minor role for Theron, but she managed it well and managed to stay with Deneuiro's step for the stage. David Keith starred alongside Richard Gere, where he played a guest role. <br /> <br /> There are Karl Braischer reflections on DVD and some deleted scenes. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the film despite the hacked plot and a dimensional performance. I rated it 7/10. I'm a sucker for the Underdog stories and I have a passion for stories with the central theme of the character's strength. The film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable performances that replace the director's shortcomings.
