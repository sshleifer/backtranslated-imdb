"Shower" is a story relating to reliability that infers most feelings in traditional and lifestyle rather than the immaculate development of the modern world. In the successful career of business, forced to choose between his big city life, his wife, and the younger brother in his hand. There is no doubt between what we can do and what we need to do. Ancient China vs. Modern China. Its sessions include outdoor baths, its cricket battles, shopping centers and skyscraper. Lots of older men and women who are no longer needed. China, a country, two systems, as Xiao Ping says ... One of them killed another. <br /> <br /> Tender, moving, funny moments, and bitter-sweets. Sensitive people cry and smile evenly. Actors are vast, especially the role of a retarded boy; And Yang Jong does a good job, easy, simple, let the story flow just in it. <br /> My rate: 8/10
