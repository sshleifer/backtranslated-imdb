Sitting, typing ?? What's the latest "what?" Vincenzio Natalie's Fest, and David Llitt and Andrew Miller as two losers. One has had problems in relationship, got her from the job (because of the problems associated with) and because the police are getting him (his job and his relationship problems). The other person is an agoraphobic who refuses to go outside his home, when she bought cookies from her when she met an embarrassing girl guide calling her mother to sexual allegations. <br /> <br /> Oh, the police are after him, after the girl Scout's mother calls him to arrest. <br /> Man, what a day. To make this all disappear? It's the whole mantle behind 'Nothing'. Two fools, cops, girl scout, cars, lawn, road, everything? Disappear. White space is nothing! It's an interesting concept that I feel. I have seen this time, I have been in the film for 30 minutes, and there is still a leftover hour in the film. Can 2 actors make this work and entertain us for 60 minutes? Despite actors attempting, there is more than 60 minutes of time and the air is clearly dead in the locations of the film. But the two actors, both of them together and with each other, have a great deal with each other, looking for dialogue and improving gobbing around both ways. There are a lot of supernatural elements, but it is worth seeing this movie more and more of their reaction to these films.
