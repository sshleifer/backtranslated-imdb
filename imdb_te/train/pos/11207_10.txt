This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and why it's easy to watch. After 45 years it is a very impressive job. Why is it not in print is a mystery that can only be explained by Disney. Live footage and animation in tandem good use. It was used to run every few months or part of "Walt Disney", but for a long time I did not see it in the list. * Sigh * highly recommended.
