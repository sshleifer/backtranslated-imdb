<br /> <br /> Eric Eicnick is my favorite blonde girl, and as an Italian American, t forget a lot about the plot, or conditions or other actors. I can recall the dead giant Erica and she looks better than ever in the film, I do not really care if it's a bad film or a good movie, I'm a young man in Brooklyn. <br /> <br /> If you're a cosmetic fan of Erica Ellisayak, then this movie is definitely for you.
