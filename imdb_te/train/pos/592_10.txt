In Arlington Heights, IL Elementary Schools (1961) did not have any cateteria, so I drank my bike home from school and always saw this game. The truth is, I'm 11 years old, but I thought it was great! I drew hidden images on my blackboard and see if I could find my family or friends. I must remember that if the contestant gets the ultimate hidden image game, it will win the amazing cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile). <br /> <br /> Why did this game happen briefly? I enjoyed music and hidden pictures - the only person who hid the lemon in a garden bridge in my garden. <br /> There are really good memories associated with it.
