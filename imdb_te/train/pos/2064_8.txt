Scare Crow is here on the hilarious killers I've seen so far! Plus he's really bouncy and he grew up around, it's awesome! He has a good conversation and that's right for him. Story lines are good too. I like how much kids can transfer to the spirit spirit! Plus he has a reason for killing those people that I understand after what he has done to him ..... I will be very angry! ScareCrows look is good! His appearance gives that person "OMG!" When they saw him the response! It is great that he got funny! Those people are foolish, they will always look! They are the witch and their wardrobe for their lives ... even though it is not a difference!
