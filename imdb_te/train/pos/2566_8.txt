Boy joins girl .. Babies loses girl ... boy gets back the girl <br /> <br /> Weak character Lieutenant General Webster (Richardo Last Kent Smith as the second one ...) My question is how is he 3-star general birth ... his role is <br /> <br /> Brando's southern accent is a little lower, and Kon The scenes have some holes but overall, I enjoy the movie every time. <br /> <br /> Red buttons are great ...
