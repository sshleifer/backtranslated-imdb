I really liked it while I liked the town. I'm new actor when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Jean Kelly. I have heard about them but recently I have never seen anything with them. The first thing I saw was Sinkin in the Rain, which made me a fan of Jean. I think that's very good. But I like this movie and there are some parts better than others like all the movies but in my book it is a wonderful movie and I love it. Frank and Jean make a good team. I go to the pool and see them together. But I really enjoyed my guns, and I loved it!
