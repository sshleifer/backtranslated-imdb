Considering the lack of art in African cinema (or Black American cinema). Idea provides a society with a multidimensional look assigned to hoods and dealers. But the funny thing is not all this vision or even a small thing. But many adhesions are said to have been blurred from these themes. Genre is not unique and simple expectation. This is the first departure of the eye, so it is very difficult to watch twice. <br /> <br /> It is a real art with an African voice that is rare in this movie. The film does not copy the message to obtain its message, it is invented and inspired by the pulling of new and simple stereotypes (not the race but character based techniques), from the writers' perspective. It has multiple messages that have a very fast character development. It must be remembered that this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish the character very quickly. The use of color structure and music is also good. However, the director, Owen Alek Shahada's final effort, 500 years later, requires music to be expected. But the idea from a theme point-of-view view is a departure but seems like a social problem of sarcasm seems like indirect? Amazing stuff!
