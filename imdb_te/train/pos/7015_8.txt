Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS agent, practically everyone can give the store a surprise. <br /> <br /> Many of us have heard by an IRS agent, "Hello, I'm from the IRS, I'm here to help." <br /> When you become more and more in this story, you will not recognize this person. He goes easily to those who are audited. What is his purpose? He is from another planet, an angel, a great man who wants to do good? If he is to be audited, he will help us to be our auditor. Hey, the IRS, are you listening? (Funny, just kidding) <br /> <br /> The pace of the cinema is perfect and the evidence has been omitted as to what really happened to me. Serious, repetitive extreme, visually Ben and there are. Since we tried to identify him, the whole movie was only Ben's work and I did not see any credentials (what you're talking about Willis). Do not read the DVD before watching the DVD movie, the best way to go here. At the end of the film I finally got everything together. Well, then it is clear. And, yes, above it, but still a great story, mostly because of Will Smith's. <br /> <br /> Will Smith should be nominated for Best Actor Award. The rest of the cast is great. <br /> <br /> Yes, if it is topped and good acting, and when you finally get all the answers, you should recognize that the message of the film is wrong. What's the message I believe, you do not need much clues to figure out. I did not. <br /> Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but nothing to be excited about. Bland. Nudity: No Language: No.
