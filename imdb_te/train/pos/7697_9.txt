This is another great movie I have had luck to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker and others). Back in the late 80s I was relatively new to the genre and the only three are really new about the big JC, SH & YB. What I did when I paid my hard earned money to see this in the "triple bill of classics" at the old Scala. I do not have to worry, I was breathing through this film. If you're a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies, if you do not see the movie, do it now!
