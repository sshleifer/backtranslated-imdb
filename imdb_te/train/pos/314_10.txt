This program is a great story story. It includes slavery, religion, ways, secret hiding of Jews, trial, belief in African gods in Orissa, treating women, including daughters. Even down to homosexuality. If the characters are mutually exclusive and that vandalism, that character saddens me. She is very disappointed to destroy everybody around her. It's t.v. Again. I'd like to see an improper version. Xica has become my heroine. I see her using her power to help with what I want. I love all the letters and found that they are now in contact with so many people in this century. I look forward to my Xica every night. Great enough to dub in English that Americans also love her.
