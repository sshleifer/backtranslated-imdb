Before she goes into politics or public service, Glenda Jackson is one of Britain's finest film actresses. Despite the supporting role of a stellar role that has lost the last 20 years memories of Christie Kit, a British Royal Captain's wife, the film will demonstrate her talent and Jenny American En-Margaret almost identifies as a doting sister. Allen Bates plays the role of Captain, who misses the memory that triggered Shell Shock in World War II. He plays a minor role as Sir Ian Holm's doctor. You'll see familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Pattsey Byrne, and Frank Finley. You can not help but Glenda is looking at a home housewife and looking at the captain's first true love but they come from different classes. It's not a great movie but it's nice to see Glenda's incredible talent. She is still an amazing actress, comedy or drama. She turned Margaret Gray into a preferred character and see why she was in love with a regular captain.
