The "Big Goodbye" introduces us to the first Holodek adventure, where Captain Picard pretends to be Dixon Hill as a private investigator. These episodes create a standard design, repeatedly repeated on TNG and DS 9 and voyages. After entering Holodek, something went wrong and the characters had to deal with different situations beyond playing a game (represented by the failure of the Holodek's security program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to extend the prospect of Star Trek and enable the mixing of genre. Picard's Dickson Hill stories are an example of the 1940 crime scene and their representation on the screen is called Film Noir, which is often featured in the stereoate antiehroe (for example Chandler's Marlo stories or Polanski's All Time Classic "Chinatown"). Star Trek focuses on the story (mostly how it is "how-to-do-off-of-it" scenario), but allows actors to take a different approach to their roles. The Holocaike "games" are usually used for entertainment and reflect the personal interests of the crew. Thus the technical aspect has always been neglected and the stories have never been in that view (but the Star Trek is technically and scientificly, I mean, with some utopic concepts). <br /> <br /> The "big goodbye" is a relaxed Patrick Stewart, a McDowen episode of a Star Trek episode (at least in the early days) and has a lot of great scenes (I'm very lagging logging of the lamp on that wall It was really a surprise, the fact that he did research on that period and its rituals). Wesley continues to turn peaceful Trekkies into potential assassins (why do not they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish him) but all in this one's fun ...
