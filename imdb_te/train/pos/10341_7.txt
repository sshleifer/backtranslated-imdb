The true majestic situation between the mid 70s The comedy farce was a huge hit for 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I'm constantly surprised at some of the comedy films that have been released a week and then disappear: high disadvantage, Cheap Detective, The Black Bird, now we do not see reading and do not have any profile today. Naaman's month of comedy appeared in 1976 and everyone was watching it, smile about it and never mentioned it anytime. The film was shot in a video tape and a film transmitted to the film, an experiment at that time, that Norman today is in a ridiculous political faulty room where Farrelli Brothers is going to be remaking today. If they did in the first place, there are no complaints about its content and slant. It's very funny and YES very rude and ridiculous is all wrong. That should be. The fact that a groovy 1976 film with those horror colors and clothes actually works really good today.
