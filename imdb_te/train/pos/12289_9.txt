First of all, I want to show you that I have not read the book, so I do not think it is disappointing. <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** *********************************************> <br /> of the movie Well, let's say a great deal about it. But acting, I think, is amazing. I have no experience in acting, still I can not believe how people can be considered this terrible! <br /> <br /> I especially liked Jeremy Irons, and really understood the person who crawled his character and the social ladder. He works hard, then fights against those who take his job out of his life, he only participates in this fight, he is no longer on his side, he ends up being defeated and disappointed. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Vinna is also the most romantic young couple who brought the rider to his revolutionary ideals by his boyfriend (Banderas). , He is a less developed part, I think), and Glenn Close is very good. Meryl Streep has an average performance, not the standards of other actors, it is not bad. <br /> <br /> In contrast to today's films, the only comment here is the people, but at the same time, it is not an unsatisfying movie and tries to be intellectual. The best proof I really liked, I'm writing a review after 7 years.
