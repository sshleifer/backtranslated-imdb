This is not a movie for the fans of ordinary ari lynch stuff. It's good for those who like to compliment a good story or have a lot of open-minded things with a lot of sentimentalism and Oprah-Ish, "It's such a wonderful movie! - Semantics <br /> <br /> The story has gone wrong, and we are carrying on a journey, I come to find many people and come to recognize many. <br /> Acting is without errors, cinematography (occasionally very clever!), and the dialogue is just enough for the audience. <br /> <br /> A warm picture. No more sentiment.
