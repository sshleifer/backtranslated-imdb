This is one of the funniest series ever! I laughed until my shoulders were separated. If anyone is released only in America. Please PAL but Region 0 or 1. <br /> I know I'll release it in the UK, but it's only 2 and PAL! Give this series its fair shake. America must know this series. Mafat is a genius. I loved the character of Tracy Bennett, the role of Goofy. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracey is a treasure! <br /> This presentation is released in America! Or show it again at PBS stations. I need to laugh and laugh again! Please kiss us, please! <br /> Thanks for reading.
