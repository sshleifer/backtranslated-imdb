The background details of this story are based on some, quite, quite simply, the true events of this era. The story is composed of Amy Semplal Macpherson along with the famous Leopold and Laube Case. <br /> This story starts with two mothers (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds) in the courtroom. The group seems to have the intention of causing physical harm to the group just as their sons are guilty of just a heinous thrill crime. <br /> As soon as they come home, they begin to bully the phone calls, so Reynolds open together a dance school where they suggest they move to the West. The dance school is a success and they cater to the very bad parents who think their baby is next Shirley Temple. One of these puffed children is the minorities, who smiled with Reynolds, and they start dating. Life is great. However, when the threatening phone calls resumed, she was emotionally disturbed, as she was getting close to her discontent and going further to her religion - almost continually listening to her on Winters Radio. Again, you will see the winter on the edge and finally end up in very bad deeds! <br /> <br /> The film is quite different in the 1960s, such as Betty Davis and Jon Crawford Horror films, "What Was Happened Baby Jane?", "Straight Jacket" and "The Nanny". Although none of these are properly intellectual charges, they are very entertaining and fun at the kitsch level. The writing is great and there are some good twists that make it all exciting. <br /> <br /> Winter is the softest and most sensitive lady at the age of 39 - plus she can really dance. <br /> <br /> Some waiters make a bit in the film - an inexpensive attack on the Chinese. At first I felt it, but when you met sister ALMA, she was honest and not getting mocked, so I took Witters' religious morals just as a symbol of craziness - this is my intention. /> <br /> By the way, this movie "Aunt Who's Who Pants?" - Another Shelley Winters horror movie 1971. Two great fun and very over-the-top!
