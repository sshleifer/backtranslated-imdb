It's a great movie! Although there were only 15 people out there, it was great! My friend and I laughed too much. My mom also enjoyed. There are two middle-aged women and one is between 20 and 20 years old. I love the part that Nancy likes both Carki and Ned and its beautiful lol. And when she gets the roadster and ned. Yes this great movie also thought people lol underestimate. I think you enjoy it. I really enjoyed it and my friend also did. <br /> <br /> People in this movie are very strong and they do not even see it. I will give the film and actors a chance. They have done great work in my opinion. But if you still have young children still. I'll probably see my 7 year old niece.
