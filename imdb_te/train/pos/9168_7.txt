This is a fantastic adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only problem I have is that I do not like Zelah Clark. I am very old and Jane felt very cowardly. Jane's book was a very strong character. I really was frustrated with this role. Rochester is asked to marry him after the morning and she runs him and Hugs makes me laugh at him forever. I think she made a bad choice in the cast. But as Dalton Rochester looks amazing. He makes this look of Jane Eyre's valuable. Another thing that this version is not 100% is the quality of the image. I know it made the Eighties for TV. If it was a movie, and good quality, it was perfect. But my main complaint is that Gela Clark is absolutely old.
