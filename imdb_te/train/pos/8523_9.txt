I was a fan of the book after the third grade, so I saw this movie, read the sequel, and then saw the television show. It's a good show, and now an adult I still enjoy the show. This is my real problem that it has not followed the book. I first saw it, I was disappointed, and I stopped it. But it comes from a girl who has the first part of the book. But after a while I decided to try again and ignored the book (kind of like what you do with Harry Potter movies). I found the series amazing! A clean cut that everyone can enjoy and everyone can enjoy. Really enjoyable! Clean and amazing!
