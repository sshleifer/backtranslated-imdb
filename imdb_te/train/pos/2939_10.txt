Eddie Murphy was always one of the funniest comedies - perhaps funniest. Delirious is the best stand-up comedy I've seen so far and it must have anyone who likes a good smile! I have seen this film hundreds of times and every time I watch - I'm still parting towards the division. This is definitely one of your video library. I promise you have to watch several times in order to hear all the jokes because you are very laughing - that you miss half of them! <br /> <br /> Although there are many funny comedies - after watching this stand-up comedy, most of them appear as second-class citizens. If you have never seen - get it, see it - and you love it !! It makes you holer !!! :-)
