I was amazed at this film. I touched the lives I had touched on his way to find him a little girl separated from "too". Humor is also great and it does not hurt the story as I thought it would probably do. In fact, I think it's going to hurt this movie, "Polly wants a cracker," but it's been in a very ridiculous scene, which is very touching when Pale in the research laboratory meeting. If you want to see a good "Talk of Animals" better than this doctor, better than Dr. Dolittle in my opinion. PAULIE is also surprisingly twist in the end even very well.
