Normally I really do not really like Emma Roberts, but after seeing Nancy I kind of changed my mind. Actors in the movies made the whole thing spectacular and funny. When you look at the mystery film you can solve it in the middle of the show a lot of time, but it's like you're really in the picture. Finally, all the evidence is sufficient for you to understand all the crimes. Still wondering how I found her. The whole movie is very intelligent and the people who watched me liked this movie too. This movie is my favorite part, it's very beautiful. I do not think this film will be the same until the sequel comes out. I do not seem to be part of popular girls really part because I give a nine, but they still make me laugh. It's a great movie and great mystery. I would definitely recommend watching it.
