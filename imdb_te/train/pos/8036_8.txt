It's not a good part of the action because some guys sniper is not good. Well, if you feel as an action movie, this view can be quite true as part of the action of this movive not really exciting. <br /> <br /> The film tells us that we have different personalities and different experiences within the two snipers. An experienced Tomas Beckett and he has killed 74 people. However, after Beecht's Montana's day's dream, we can clearly see his smoothness inside. <br /> Miller, on the contrary, is a new actor, a green beard, and he is also a sniper. Billy did well to show Jane Miller's contraction and fears, who first attempted the "bullet to be with one's heart" (as Beckett said). What he thought about the suicide mission today is easily accomplished, and then he can get back safely and receive the award. <br /> <br /> These two guys are different in their personalities and I have shown the difference and effect on each other because of the difference in their personalities. The two snipers suspect each other, eventually doing their job to protect each other and to protect the other. <br /> Sniper is a good action movie but a good mental one.
