When I got to the cable, I saw the film every chance I returned in the Seventies. This is my introduction to Harlem, which has since attracted me (and Bill Clinton). I am still very young, and this film gave me a big impression. It's great to see the movie about how to grow some other little girls and get some bad choices as well as making good choices for them to decide who they want. I will tell you the beauty of Lonette McCree, the great costume they wear and the dialogue. Only single mother was raised by anyone, I could really identify these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters are more realistic than Beyonce Knowles!
