Othello, classic Shakespeare story love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I was reading this story in high school, and I actually realized the fact that my favorite Shakespearean story in Othello was so beautiful that Shakespeare seized the friendship, love, and racism. I mean, when you're studying this story, you might go to a madman in an eye-blinking joke in Othello in many philosophy. But later for my report I also saw this version of Othello and that it is totally intelligent. <br /> <br /> In Othello, in his city a large time soldier, including the king, loves everyone. But when the king realized that he was friendly with his daughter Desdemona in Othello, the king was angry but avoided it. Welcome to the city of Othello and his best friend, Casio, Othello is a man on his side instead of Igucco. Because of his mad jealousy, he was out for vengeance. Still acting as Othello's best friend, he suggested that he was steeped at Odello, that he was cheating on him with Tedimonia Casio and they did not say what they had been saying in Othello. <br /> <br /> Othello is run by a madman and does not have pleasant plans for Desdimona or Cassio and Igago. <br /> <br /> Othello is a fantastic story, I have read it very well. It's a wonderful story that keeps you thinking after reading it. The image of Othello is great and once again I recommend it, which captures the whole story and has a large terreker type or astonishes what happens between Othello and Desdemona, and how quickly his true love betrays him. This is a wonderful movie, great acting, good sets and good direction, what is Shakespeare when you write this story? <br /> <br />
