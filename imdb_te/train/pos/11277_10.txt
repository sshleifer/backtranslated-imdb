Tarzan and Jane are happily living in the forest. Some men look for teeth and take back jane to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men fell in love with Jane and decided to take her back ... even though it killed Tarzan. <br /> This is rare - the better than the original. "Tarzan, The Ape Man" was good in 1932 but some terrible special effects and drag. This has a good effect and most people are older. There was a tons of blatant racism (a black shot burned and shot dead - and no one really cared) but it was 1934. There's so much blood, gore and violence (for the 1934 film) and uncut prints jane swim completely naked! There is also explicit sexual content and Tarzan and Jane do not wear anything and (as it suggested) they sleep together and have sex - without marriage. <br /> <br /> The film is well directed, dynamic and enthusiastic. Watching Weissmuller in that little lion cloth is definitely a treat for the eyes and Jane's outfit is pretty much exposed. I'm still worse as Maureen O'Sullivan Jane, but Vaisumler is perfect as Teszon. <br /> <br /> Previously the best weissmuller - O'Hara Tarzan. Not worth the kids to see!
