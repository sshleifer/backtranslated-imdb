Gabe Ryan (Frankie Thomas) walks out of the reform school and goes to the slums. His sister (Ann Sheridan) makes him uncomfortable, but it follows him. Unlike his associations with the Termite gang, Gabe follows real life gangsters who set fire to random buildings for insurance. Somebody needs someone to hurt, and Gabe is it. It is up to Termites to act in their favor and give gangsters their desserts. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Dead End Kids is really good too. The boys wander on the new living things on the street and take it to their own path. They talk to each other in the phony civilized tones and talk about drinking tea together; Bernard Pantsley takes a nap in a chair. The boys are just starting to fight with a new boy, but after he has described himself as a good warrior, they asked him to join his club. <br /> <br /> <br /> When the Billy Hollop turned into the boy's mayor, he had a dream about schooling. <br /> <br /> Angels succeeded with dirty faces with the success of the Angels The great title to wash their faces, and really tells what the kids are doing. Sensational for set and offensive behavior, these guys are good in this movie. But it does make some great laughs, rather than to be annoying. This is a preview of what many boys will have in the Boyier Boys Series. We also get some confusing words from Leo Gorsey.
