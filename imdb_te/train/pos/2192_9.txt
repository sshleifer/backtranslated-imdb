<br /> <br /> Don Cutzire has produced a fantastic film that took us on a roller-coaster ride by setting true romance in trouble around modern Israel. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is always in love with love, illness and heartfelt love. At that time, the difficulty and inconvenience of Israel in Israel is only a means of exacerbating the feelings. <br /> <br /> You are in the plight of the dawn, and you can not move deeply. <br /> You can not write like drama and passion - Don's frustration, relationship with Iris, and a state of crisis in order to make this wonderfully watchable. If you have an ounce of effect and are in love, look at this picture.
