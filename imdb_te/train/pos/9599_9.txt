I saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, there is no dry eye at home. <br /> <br /> It is not only Darius who is a great man, but the rest of the team is very young and very young. They refused, as they were given a chance to engage and stimulate the MTV positive path of the most frustrating. <br /> <br /> It is truly amazing and the true story of heart news ... Take your tissue but it is great to see how caring and inspiring young people are today.
