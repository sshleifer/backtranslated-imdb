I want to go further in their relationship with CÃ©line, Jessie, I have prepared for each other, the moment in the picture so much we tell them that they want to die for each other. We never thought of their story anymore and maybe most of us never reached. It's not about love but stupid things like "nonging hills" or that kind of image. This is life and I believe they are lying, do not believe them ... This way is brilliant and touching. I ended up watching it just a minute ago and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible again. <br /> <br /> I'm going to be a misanthropist now and love is just a fake, not a feeling, but this film was felt if I realized that somewhere, something and some, something could really happen And despite Kieslowski not well know the July delpie. "Three colors: white" ... now I have to watch her other she works because she looks like an angel and has a perfect acting. <br /> When I saw "Before the sunset" (Sequel in Paris) I had seen "before sunrise" and no matter what their days. They are two artifacts. You prove that you do not need to impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings. <br /> I'm in France in France
