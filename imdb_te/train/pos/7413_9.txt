The shower keeps in many ways. Almost all of the film takes place in the old-fashioned bath house, with Hemor, Pathos, and people who are emotionally touched. The love and friendship between the owner and his retard son is deep and moving. The way the younger brother has taken this little world is hard and convincing. This plot is totally shocking and narrow, and I feel like calling the neighbors in the relationships of the shows and in contradictions. The image that I get out when I want to believe in the world again.
