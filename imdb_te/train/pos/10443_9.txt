One of the sexiest films of the 90's best ideas at Richard Lingleter's beautifully directed youth and Paris tour. Julie Delpy spent one of the most glamorous shows of the decade, Parisian Lass spent one day, stranger-on-a-train with Ethan Hawk. Conversation (and its funies) are sometimes enchanting and overly valuable, but creating a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual link for two young children's lovers is filled with a tremendously amusing, touching and intelligent time.
