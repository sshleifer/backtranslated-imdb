Kay Polac (the man behind this movie) is a great man who shares his philosophy in different ways. He wrote good and well-written books to control your feelings and keep your soul happy. The message in his books and the movies, in fact your thoughts are causing your problems and the cause of your anger is rarely what you think. <br /> <br /> To open this story and learn the most important things in life, open your mind and listen to it. If you read and watch these parts have a lot of parts "hidden messages" (or guides to get through life). <br /> You can not learn the meaning of life, but you will learn how to live. <br /> <br /> "The mind is like a parachute, it does not work except open!"
