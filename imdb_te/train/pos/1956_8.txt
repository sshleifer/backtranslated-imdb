Really, I feel this film is an example of an easy goal rather than a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a bit muddy, but it's that style. The film is a nourish climate centered around Femme Fathal. Like all old Noyer classics, it also has a screenplay that first revolves around you, so you do not know how you originally did not make sense, and you think so deeply and put all of the pieces together. That's genre. Generally, the script will be surprised, without leaving the viewer, without the need to give up enough surprise and audiences. </ P> <br /> Sharon Stone is also a lightweight goal. The truth she looks great and she speaks of her Double Entry Laden dialog as zhuzh it to something mysterious, sexy and fun. <br /> <br /> Do it, because the direction is passable - you "did she or she did not?" The question of the two-hour question put into the audience. Along with a twisty script and a fun performance by Stone, it is effective by creating a dance atmosphere at this time, which is simultaneously dark and very rare and modern, and it is directly straightforward of sexy curves. The frame is always beautiful - press pause anywhere and it's interesting to the eye. <br /> <br /> The film is also influential in the first film, and it makes them a little more sexy, especially sex. "Catherine is a bite of the trumpet ... how shocking!" More realistic here, and generally sexuality is greatly influenced. It is still titillating, but did not do so immediately for the shock value and buzz as it did in the first. <br /> <br /> I can not say that some people in this movie are not a gymnasic, because we will look forward to this film, which is fun. <br /> It's a fun movie. It may be an easy target, but if you look to see what it is: A noirish, femme-fatale, walk, twisty, sexy, made-she-or-didn't-her-dunnit, you're committed to enjoying it (pun intended) .
