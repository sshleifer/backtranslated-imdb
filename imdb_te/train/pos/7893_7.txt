I am part of the silent minority that enjoyed this film. Is this the best of "Nightmare" range? Maybe not, but I was very fun. Freddy Krueger reaches his nasty, intelligent knowledge. I thought this final installment (called "New Nightmare" was the real final), after reducing the series 4 and 5 sequences. Breakin Meyer has a great nightmare scenes playing a trouser role, which sleeps and stuck in the video game for Freddie controls. This is a very original and hilarious scene when we look out of Dreamscapes like this super original. Freddy Belts out a liner of funny, "Great graphics." It was brought back ten years ago when it began to control the game with Powergrove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers Powerglove. <br /> The cast is awesome. Lisa Jane starred in the lead role. "Running Man" I can not see Yffet Coto and I last saw it about 5 years ago. Another great, underappreciated actor he has a great screen presence. And who can forget the characters? The best is from Johnny Depp (from the first "Nightmare") as a representative of a pharmaceutical business. <br /> <br /> Finally, the 3D sequence is really awesome! So for those looking for this film check - buy on rent or on DVD! Hopefully all the editions come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the 3D edition of the video edition has been deleted. <br /> <br /> I personally did not see many things wrong with this film. It also elaborates on Freddie's heroism. The film is a great mix of humor and horror, and macro-effects effects are great. Can this be a good deal for the franchise? Of course it will have it. But Rachel has done a good job. <br /> <br /> And in the end, I liked Montage on early credits. Fans of the series will be delighted, and it will be a tribute to Dear Freddie. <br /> My score: 7 (in 10)
