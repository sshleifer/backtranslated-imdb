La Tata I la Luna (The Brest and the Moon) 9-10 year old boy is called Tote, engaged in growing chests in Catalunya. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and most of the characters in all the BIGS LUNA movies (also the director of JAMON, JAMON). Tett reminded me of the mysterious and exciting life of that age. Even from Catalunya (Northeast of Spain) brought a lot of memories in my mind. How beautiful this film is, Katunia is a lot of people, good people, good life and many who are not special.
