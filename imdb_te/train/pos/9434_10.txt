A few years ago when I saw the film on TV, I did not have the full attention but I lost the first half. So it came to a disappointing and rated end. I decided to visit it again last night to see if I missed the first time. I made sure. It is one of the most disturbing and awesome films of all time and it is very effective for today's movies and is probably forever. I can not believe this film is felt boring! <br /> <br /> A young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds offer their career performances and are supported by Ned Beatty and Rony Cox. This story will leave you after a while and leave you with disgust and fear, which is really horrifying. Oh, and I also mentioned that the theme song is great? Well, and the film fans should watch everywhere. <br /> <br /> This experience should be viewed by everyone. Do not expect a picnic.
