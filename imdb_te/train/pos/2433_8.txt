When I saw this classic "Casper the Friendly Ghost" cartoon, I was about 12 years old. It began with Casper * not appearing on the right *, as did Porky Pig * in the 1930's cartoons. <br /> <br /> However, this episode in friendly phantom posthumous event gives him a friendship to meet a young fox known as Freddy. <br /> <br /> Casper is happy to have a friend, and a lot of cartoons are getting used to knowing that he is running away from him, "a ghost!" <br /> <br /> When Kasper and Ferdin exhibit another person ... I will leave you with semi-spoiler, but the cartoon is only seven minutes, so you can not really be very vague. In addition, anyone reading the IMDb summary of the cartoon can find out what happened next ... <br /> <br /> The finale removes a bit of heart. In fact, it's probably the saddest I've felt looking at a cartoon. But it only moves me, that is why I decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not many with others. Or heck, actually remembering this cartoon in all its emotional effect on me - I did not see it. But the cartoon ends in an upbeat note, and I'm excited to see Casper and Ferdies again happy. <br /> <br /> Let me give you this cartoon 10 out of 10 stars. The second is the Warner Bros. cartoon "Peace on Earth", which I've ever moved through the animated motion.
