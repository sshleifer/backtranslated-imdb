Ghost Story, (The New House) is a fantastic horror story. It comes from the Fierce Circle and the Ghost Story series of the early seventies. Sebastian Cabot described each story, starting and ending. Remember the earliest family series from the Family Affair in the 1960s? This particular story includes Barbara Parkins and David Birnie as the lead actors and the main characters in the story. It was recently seen and I was very scared! If you are alone, I do not recommend you look at it. This story is wonderful, no gore or curse words, but it's very scary. Barbara Parkins played a young bride. David Birney played the role of her husband. Two actors are very good in their parts. If you like scary, fun, horror ghost stories, like this little gem. I gave this high rating. I highly recommend this story.
