Though much has revealed how the effects have occurred, love and adventure is still very special. <br /> If you have never seen this film, how many will you be stolen? Later filmmakers. I see this picture with a friend who is surprised by how much of Disney's Aladdin collected from this film. They enjoyed the movie as a touchstone for most loved ones and other film and film makers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p> <p> <p> I gave you 8 out of ten instead of 10 out of 10 I have a good portion of the film because the film is slow in the last 15 minutes. They suddenly moved as quickly as possible to reach the end. Finish painting then djinn exit to the finish from the point looks more sketch from the point. It does not kill, but it weakens. <br /> <br /> A good fairy tale, or anyone who likes a great movie still needs to be viewed.
