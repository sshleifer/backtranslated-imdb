I finished looking at Kyle, who wrote and directed by Brian De Palma. The DVD contains both the "R" version and the unrated version. I do not rate it "version is too graphic graphic male nudity, including a scene of clear expression of self-gratification in this version, although I can not be absolutely sure of the difference.This sort of thing you could call this scene soft cord romance You may be a perpetrator, R "indicated to view comment from here from digress.but i digress.Annit.It rated version.but i digress.but This is a very murderous scene killing a death scene of note though there is very little torture and blood.there in a murder mystery / psychological horror / suspense film.It see the slasher image of a 70's blood real.it it does not look self I will recall that this deliberately complete belief, suppress the violence of the law, to give the budget of violence The film is very well-directed.I have a benefit to find out very rare when compared to most of today's movies every scenario, however, acting is good, especially Angie Dickinson and Michael Kane play an amazing role in this role. Excellent work in case. This film is also a great twist in my mind, but some people find the imagination. The only complaint I had (and it's more of an observation) I had Nancy Alan played was not fleshed out more, especially considering she had a fair amount of time on screen. I think she will do a good job with what she gave. It really does not stay away from the quality of the movie. It also has a good morality, which is more relevant today. It really liked the music composed by Pino Dinaggioyi. I know this is very similar to the music in the original Psycho. The film is really cinematic. For me, Killed Cook (1980) 10/10
