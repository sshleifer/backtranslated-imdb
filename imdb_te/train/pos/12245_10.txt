This is the best Emma in my opinion. Other Reformation (1996) is also good, and after reading the book, I can say confidently that this is really a real explanation, and I feel Jane Austen's best masterpiece the most trustworthy. The 1996 film is very good with G. Paltrow, which is almost entirely a different story. It's pretty light and fluffy, so if you do not look at the darker edges of the characters and you just want a fun image, it's fine, but with some intricacies of plot points like the Churchill / Fairfax maze is so glazed as if it really exists. But if you want the characters to be a bit, more realistic and multifaceted, the 1996 TV version is superior. Emma is a great man, but she is flawless. Kate Beckinsale has the expertise in showing minor quizzes of the character. You see that she usually looks positively in Harry Smith's more simplistic conversation, and she did not repent without destroying Harry's proposal until it was destroyed by her marriage at the end of the action. You'll see her Narcissus and reflect the Frank Churchill, who hurt others to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​when she lost her marriage, she went to the wedding and was a new friend of the two. Frank Cooke is making it safe for the woman he loves when dealing with her and others in secret. In the book, it's all in a rare awakening to all of her blunders. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gineet Paltrow persuaded their repentance but the awakening of Battinsala is real and intense, and you'll find Palto's more innocent and charming and change from the selfish behavior of the child to the kind and the thoughtful adult level. Two versions are pretty cool but I prefer this one.
