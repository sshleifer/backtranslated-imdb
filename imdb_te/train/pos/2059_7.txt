What a fun b-movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and Scarecrow is a unique and original one. He really brought me back to the 80's monsters. The budget is obviously less and not everybody's lens behind the pasino but it ignores once it's never taken seriously. From the trailer Trash Red Neck to the high flying martial arts scarecas, this is really a b-movie gem. Hold some refreshments, snacks and a couple friends and kick back and relax. I enjoyed this movie because I bought all 3 Scherco images. Sure, they are not everyone but everyone. Sometimes you need to set the hat and smile thinking.
