Although the film was built a few years later, the sound quality was very weak, so I scored a point or two. At times, the film is silent during the scenes in the center (no ordinary surrounding sounds). But, given the 1931 and a French film, it is very forgivable. Especially in French films - the sound difficulties from time to time (such as L'Atalante since 1934) have been working entirely. <br /> <br /> Okay, some small sound problems, it's a lucky lottery ticket and a beautiful little picture about the long list of people who are trying to get it. And, during the search, there are jaunty little songs that you can not help but like. All in all a nice beautiful picture.
