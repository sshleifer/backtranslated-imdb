Do you have a bachelor party with whom you are married and with his close friends in the Hawaiian Guy Bar? All the soft sailing until he takes off his "bachelor's hat". What do you say when talking to one of the dancers who can refer to him and sleep with her? What do you say that the perfect girl is his finance relative? A new low, right? Paul Coleman, who plays comedy by Jason Lee, leads this experience of a miniature blur and a new low. I said one of his most prominent characters. <br /> <br /> Karen is portrayed by her actress Selma Blair, Karen's character, Becky, lovely and talented Julia Stiles. When we get back to where we left, Paul must now deal with another problem. He gets sick, has to deal with some people, and his commitment to stealth or to every member of the family can get P.O'ed, one of his relatives "intestinal movement" for 14 days. * WAMYT * All of this leads to a long-awaited wedding with a happy scene. Paul and his brother repeated all the hell to return to his hell again. <br /> <br /> Overall, a Guy Thing is very funny and OK though. Sometimes the story seems to go somewhere and you are tired of scenes here and there but a mixed picture. If you're a fellow fan of Canadian and CTV Brett Butt Sitcom, Corner Gas, you recognize Fred Evauequick as a minor character who plays a happy Hank character in this series. This image is correct. It's another shoulder in Lee's hat (so far in a blank space). <br /> <br /> <br /> </
