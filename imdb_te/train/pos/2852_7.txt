The film is in a very simple and intuitive sphere - an unemployed tries to steal the shop pirates, and the store clerk takes action ... the thief drives him with a store-clerk later. At all times, the store clerk is in trouble with a low level Yakuza chinpira (gangster). Hunting for the thief, they catch Yakuza's eye who is looking for customer store clerk. This story then moves into the high gear in the form of Tom & Jerry (cat & mouse), but the cat is then haunted by the dog. D.A.N..G.A.N. The bum, and yakuja, as the whole 2nd action runner of the runners (can be translated in English as pinball runners), and by the end of the chase 2nd law, why bum, and yakus <br /> <br /> SABU's next film is similar to POSTMAN BLUES , The bulk of this movie is the whole chase, and action, with plenty of physical comedy and dark humor injecting to keep the audience engaged. What's shorter is that, when the three men run away from steam, and chase at one of the most disruptive Mexican stand-offs, it is almost as if it is paid to the courtesy of Sabu Tony Scott, TRUE ROMANCE (written by Quentin Tarantino).
