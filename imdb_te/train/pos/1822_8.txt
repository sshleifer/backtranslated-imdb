An unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of The Secret of the Land Before the Time, a very touching cartoon. It remembers it very well from my childhood, it's funny and sad and beautiful. Well it starts with a bit dark, a dog that escaped the pound, and an old friend gets killed, ends up in Heaven, and comes back. But friendship with an orphan girl who speaks with animals can make it sweet. Some scenes are different from other cartoons, such as Charlie's dream series, but the rest are ok, and songs are okay. Bourt Reynolds and Dome Dully's memorable character, I love that person, sir. And Judy's Barsis Revenge of Jaws, God may rest on her soul, poor girl, she does not deserve to die, but she is now Heaven, all the good people go to Heaven. Overall, this is a very good animated film, anime and Don Blatt classic that insults Disney. Recommended for the whole family. And if you have this original video, you will find after the movie, Dome DeLuise has a very important and unique message, that person who gotta love, though.
