Sequels are rarely up to the original. This is definitely true in this regard. However, if you're a bigger fan of this watch than you are. Despite the lack of camera work, the role of Brian Cross is worrying, and the plot is on the clock, which is more ridiculous than the first and entertaining about it. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie in the first film. Most obviously, this is a bit different. Instead of sitting in his cabin writing screenplays, Stanley attempts to direct his dream project in Hollywood by the cabin lake. The film has a very different feel, but it is still nice to see Stanley's reaction. <br /> I'll give you 10 to 6.
