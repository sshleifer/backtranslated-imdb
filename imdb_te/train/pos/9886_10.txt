This visual image. Mexican desert, old mansion, characters in their lovely costumes ... the whole value of the true work of art. <br /> <br /> This story seems to be a bit loose, realistic. It is derived from a book called One Hundred Years of Solitude, which is known as Latin America's isolated, otherworldly atmosphere "far from God and near the United States." <br /> <br /> The overwhelming debt that Erendra gave to his grandmother is the Latin debt of international debt, but there are many layers. <br /> <br /> If you congratulate a slow-moving, rich-image film, it's for you.
