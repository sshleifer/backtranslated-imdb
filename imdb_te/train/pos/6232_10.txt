Fred Astier and Gainer Rogers are one of the best of the films. Great music by Irving Berlin. <br /> <br /> The last song Aestheir unveiled a fun piano, then a beautiful dance with Rogers: "Let's Your Go," "Let's Face the Music", "All the First the Music", "My Eggs One Basket." did. <br /> <br /> Harry Nelson (later Hillier) sings two good songs and plays Rogers' sister. "Your Behind Me" songs have been sticking to you for days. She also sings "But you're u?" This entry is one of the best in the series of agile and fast paced, the Asti-Rogers series. Classic and amazing beautiful finale, "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is the best of their number. Rogers wears one of the great costumes in film history .... She's a shimmering sequined number (weighted hem) and even a little by the swirls around her legs like dances. Just gorgeous. Stevie Martin and Bernard Peters were reconstructed from Heaven to Pennies. <br /> <br /> Even though Randolph was the odd choice for Scott Auzeier's friend, he appeared in their Roberta with Irene Dunne. Fortunately he tries to sing or dance. Graffle and Ball seem to have large parts in 1936, but they have few scenes and less impact. <br /> <br /> Rogers is one of the best solo numbers in the series with "Let Yourself Go" .... Jazzy and Hype, this is a great song. /> <br /> Be fun, but after a third time I'm tired of "joining the Navy" ....
