The 1945 mystery thriller about the young Nina Fach (Julia Ross) was very happy with the film, she was not in the work and she was renting down and was disappointed to get a job. Julia reads a statement in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and tries to find and retain this position. Julia earned this position and was appointed by Ms. Hughes (Dame May Witty), who wants her to work with her boss in her home and that she has nothing to do with her friends and Julia is her family and free to dedicate her entire time to her job. George McCride, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has very strange desires to play around with swords. It's a low budget movie and a lot of scenes are close to avoiding cost and scene costs in the background. This strange family lives in a huge mansion all off Cornwall Coast of England and has plenty of secret doors and suspense.
