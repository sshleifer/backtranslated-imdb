I have seen the bit of a stick in the Mystery Men Cop Press and with the general public (Take imdb vote for example), but my overall feeling is that the Mystery Men is more fun than most films, certainly more precisely than the so-called wittier comedy films and almost 'brilliant'. <br /> The cast is excellent; Greg Kinnear is wonderful, Jeffrey Rush and Tom Wates. <br /> <br /> Kinnear's Lemon scene with Ricky Jay is the perfect 'spoiled movie actor' and he filled his character with the correct balance of comic book quality and realism. <br /> <br /> It's about a little moments - what places, and visuals are definitely more flash bang, perhaps more damage to the characters, but at the end of the day, making this high concept film - "What's Tiger Lily?" - And there are so many great people in this movie to make a repetitive view value.
