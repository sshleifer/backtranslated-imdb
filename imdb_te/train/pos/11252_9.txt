This is my second time for a perfect spy. I saw 2 or 3 years ago and liked it. I still like it. It is naturally comparable to the Beeb's other big league 'series, Tinker Tyler Soldier Spy. Tinker Tyler "game" focuses on intelligence play; Perfect Spy gives us the other axis - what kind of a spy guy. <br /> <br /> Empty - sexual, sexual, personal - genuine versus false, subjects that create inside and outside of multidimensional space, love vs. Responsibility. <br /> <br /> These characters are so happy that they are treated with a lot of frustration by love and honor - in their various short-term subjects "hard work". <br /> <br /> The theme of fathers and father dolls is also important. One of the most intriguing characters in a perfect spy is Rick, the main character Magnus' probably ersatz father. Throughout the story he is cheating and betrayal. Except as a rogue who makes sleeping as he climbs, others see what others think about him, Magnus visits them every time, "Do you love your old man?" And never, "Do you love me?" <br /> It's somewhere else, but a perfect spy is love story. <br /> <br /> Another theme is malignancy. The nature of the business is to change others - against their government, against their friends and colleagues, turn them against their values ​​and beliefs. In each of the Le Carrey films I saw, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Glass War, Tinker Tyler Soldier Spy, Smiley People, and A Perfect Spy, Turning and Changing, is the foundation of this tragedy. <br /> Lastly, not quite a piece of artistic touch - each of these films only fire a single gun, or maybe two shots book a story. Violence, violence, cruelty are always under the surface. <br /> <br /> We can not see their results as blood or donkey cells, but they are indifferent to Le Correll's roles. On the movies above, and you enjoy a Perfect Spy, you are there for a treat. I recommend Sandwagger Series (Yorkshire TV), where the 2 and 3rd seasons begin to reach the level of complexity. Although the IPCRESS file in Berlin and the baryal are lightweight, lightweight weight. A Very British Cooper for Political Conspiracy, House of Cards and Yes, Minister / Yes, Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> When a Brit sets his hand to make three kingdoms - a film with intrigue and complexity.
