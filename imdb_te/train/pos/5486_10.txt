Yes, at the right time the cameras are in the right place. It is interesting to see how a world leader (like Chavez) who supports the poorest of his country in such a low esteem in America. In my opinion, his worst "sin" is caring for those who are at the bottom of the barrel. Could this be so bad? I'm always attracted by the American government + to the media response to Fidel Castro. Initially, Castro was a good man when Batista was replaced (in 1959). Shortly thereafter, however, Castro began to turn the corporations in Cuba to the needs of the poor instead of the fat cat. We are a good country, but why do our media and government have such a problem in partnership with the poor? If these guys are "dictators", we can use more "dictatorships", especially the poor of the poor living in the world.
