This self-drama is all it's: top-notch acting, incredible photography, good story. This is often compared with "Braveheart" because in historic Scotland there are two images. Although I love Braveheart, I think it's better than two films. Jessica Lange gave a spectacular performance (nominated for the Oscars). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth played a role in one of the worst and deadly characters in the history of film (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is as wonderful as another dislikeable character, Lord Monroe. I'm always surprised at the wonderful range of characters that I play with John Hurt. This is the story of the controversy over money between Rob Roy and his family and Lord Monroe. Rob Roy was a self-made man who did not solve his problems with the Montrose to resolve his problems. Mantros, who inherited the title of his title, does not have a sense of honor. And this story is all about primarily; The nobleman is respected against corruption. The film is very entertaining, it should appeal to all. It is romance, action, beautiful scenery, and an amazing plot. One of my favorite films.
