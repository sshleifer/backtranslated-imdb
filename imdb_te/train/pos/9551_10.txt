I was surprised at the quality of the film. It's much better than I expected. Scenario and acting are great. The director did a good job. Some scenes seem a bit clumsy, which is a good picture overall. The idea is absolutely brilliant and the truth does not reveal until the very end. The mental hospital atmosphere is very good. This plot is clear, stable and well thought out. If some got some boring, it was more focused on the storyline and they took their time to develop the character and story. The morality of the story is a good picture of its style and it is amazingly good.
