In the guide list of movies for the Santa Barbara Film Festival, I see the film when I was in Hollywood. Mainly the Hong Kong Trides Wow Singh Society is an elective for the new chairman, so you can imagine how much violence this time can occur. The fight for "candidates" is Lok Lok (Simon Yama) and Big D (Tony Lung Ka Fai) for control of the oldest and most powerful threaded parts of society. Luis co-starred as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung, Jett, Chin Sue Foy, and Kun as Big Head as Suet and Lam Ka Tung. There are some good realistic corrupt themes and moments, not just about enough action, but perhaps since the cops get involved, but after a sequel, so it's a pretty excelling crime drama thriller. Very nice!
