This man is not the smallest of the wonderful. You really feel that you have spent his life with him in all these tragic events, and finally shouted with his family. He is very passionate about his wish, not just for himself, but to others who have survived not to go through this wretched pain. I watch this video every day, I'm bad or "down", making it a great and bright side of her life, just like Johnny, with her inexplicable pain. Since I have visited England 2 times in his life and I can tell him I'm going to meet him, my only regret is not about Johnny. How comforting it is to know that Johnny is sitting on his cloud and painlessly! Peace Rest, dear Johnny. You deserve it!
