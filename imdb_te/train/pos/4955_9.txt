<br /> <br /> Why do not all people ever understand a deep meaning in movies or I do not know why they are worthless? Something Morgan Freeman is exemplary. He gets a chance to show off a bit. <br /> <br /> Pazzaga earned her co-star career, and Brad Silberling made a name for drawing people to see her feature film. <br /> <br /> I think it is a good movie. There are some humor, some pathos, some bitters but nothing above. A kick came from Jim Parsons as a receptionist at the production company. Freeman gratefully said, "You want me to be a woman." He's just fun. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful, lovely image that makes you smile faster. Vega is a fight scene between her ex-husband and his girlfriend. You can do it much worse.
