I do not see much German comedy, but if there is anything to go to the film, I'm compelled to see more! The simplest but effective storyline takes two different people from Germany to Italy after two unemployed mother Eva finds her artist husband dealing with a wealthy lawyer's wife. I can not reveal anything more, but what is the most funny series of events with the exact end of the results. My interest in international cinema has expanded since I saw this film. I recommend anyone (no adult, do not include young children, do not think that it's a family image) Who does not like language - even those who do not know the language.
