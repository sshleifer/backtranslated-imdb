<br /> <br /> In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell other people". In "The Odd Couple", Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau show how accurate this is. Like Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Math created two friends who decide to live together in consecutive times. <br /> <br /> Before the departure of Felix, the smiles come in thick and fast, changing the Oscars and leaving the more active person. <br /> <br /> Jag Lemmon as Ugar is definitely a wonderful person and unselfish divorced divorce life as a single person. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the role of the Lemmon, Walter Matthew is equally good as a Slabby sports writer who wants to play poker to earn money for his children's profits. <br /> <br /> Lomon and Mattu are excellent in their selected episodes, depending on Neil Simon's beautiful script, and simultaneously they work well as a team. The two friends who are inherently different in lifestyle, but similar to relationships with ex-wives and children, both have created an impossible partnership for the last and greatest actors to recreate. In fact, greatly, the characters shouted for the same pattern to the world, before the death of Matthew and three before Lemmon, the characters returned in a somewhat sequel. This idea may work somewhat after Hollywood's frustration with sequels, but at the same time it does not come close to reflecting the genius of the original film. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is really possible to say anything that is not. With Simon's wonderful script, filled with humor and laughter, the creators of this film are already hit. The cast of Jack Lemmon and Walter Mutau as Felix Anger and Oscar Madison is the most important part of the film. "The Sin Couple", which also has a traditional soundtrack (also received a tribute to "The Simpsons"), a wonderful script and a great leader, a feature of history to tribute and remember the movie.
