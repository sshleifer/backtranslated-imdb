H.G. I've waited for someone to paint a reliable version of Wells's classic novel "World's War". Timothy Hines finally finished it! I can not believe how good it is! From acting, costuming, outside of these global special effects, I can not say enough! It's amazing! Complete first-rate shows by a top-notch cast, dramatic, intense! It has got to be seen to believe. I did not. And I have read negative comments by others, and can not believe what they say. We're looking at a different movie, huh? <br /> <br /> That vehement guy, he is someone else's bad commentary and does not know what he is talking about. <br /> <br /> Keep doing good work, Hines.
