Looking at the Disney version and looking at it now makes me think I will lose its magic touch. Other shows were plenty, then Cinderella, put it, in fact, lost their touch over the years. <br /> <br /> I've found the flawless performance of Kathleen Turner's bad stepmother and I've cast myself under my spell from childhood through the fantasy macroeconomic essay of this fantasy story. The story of Cinderella, the father of dying, was the last stepmother to go to the ball for the last chance for freedom, and she was the dead mother and the longest. But this theme takes a different twist in the classic Fairy Tale, which is trapped in Cinderella (whose real name is Jizzola, and her cousin is known only by Cinderella due to slavery) in her father's condition (still living). Slowly he cheated him to play against his wife and step-daughter and try to poison him. Hence, Jijola is able to save her father by seeing her stepfather meet another man, and by finding herself disguised as men who have left her. There is a frustrated Prince Valiant who has a heart transition from his thicker life and falls in love with a lovely girl with a remarkable rose petals (a water mammoth called mob). <br /> <br /> I am very impressed with the film. It's very old. It does not wave the uneven webpage like Cinderella's stories, why Cinderella does not want to attend the ball and does not show it to the prince as a Disney version as a disadvantage. Instead it shows more of Cinderella's selfless heart than any other product and the artwork is simply amazing! The costumes were beautifully made, especially the gizmos' s blue bungalow Marcello Plunket's marvelous beauty and soft, soul-like voice. <br /> <br /> "My only problem is that the producers and the director did not finish editing other fairy tales with a similar element, and the film is now in print not.
