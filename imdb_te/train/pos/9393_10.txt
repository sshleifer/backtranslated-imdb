Some movies you know are going to love from the first few seconds. This is one of these movies. It reappears in the 40s for "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" - a great example of the modern film noir in the 90s. Nick Cage plays the role of "his luck down" in the main role trapped in a husband-wife murder conspiracy - his luck turns bad from bad and he tries and people, town, violence and the threat to Red Rock West. Great performances have made this a real pleasure through the turns and turns, Cage, Hopper and Walsh, hypnotic slide-guitar musical backdrop, and seamless direction. Favorite Line: When looking at the get-away car at Cage gas gauge, his head shakes and says: "The story of my life" F ***. "
