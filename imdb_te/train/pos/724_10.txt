The film is fun and fun ... it's very happy with the time when the younger and the fans of the fans "The Ramones" were shot. I have seen over and over, with me and with friends, and it is still fresh and funny. <br /> <br /> As being too confusing, being a big fan of a particular band is timelessness, and high school students with some classes of respect are bored. <br /> <br /> Some gemstones / scenes ... Our "permanent record" in high school shows how we follow our lives. ("I'm getting some static" ..... "Principal is not like Togar's arrival"). Nazi Hall Monitors are a "body search" ...... "I will give you the last solution" and burning the Ramones records (Note: records came before the CD) ... and of course Joey Ramon said, "Things have definitely been removed from high school," then Togar asked, "Do you want your parents to know that you are rumans?" <Br / > <br /> Just one part of the advice ..... stars now ..... Joey Ramon sadly died young. Dee Young, a major hat trick in the movie, reminds us all of us today .... PJ Soles career has never been as we might have imagined ......... Marla Rosenfield, one of the other students in this movie (in our friends Although only one saw us in the film we saw her), I presented more than enough for her performance and she brought more teen movie characters. And, what does DJ Don Steel know? <br /> <br /> In this way, look and enjoy ..... Do not worry .... just have a FUN!
