If you go on the television show, it will be very difficult to watch this movie, especially as I do, just like the TV show. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Mottau) is the top New York City player who lives in an eight-room apartment, divorce casualty and his own stubbornly sloppy view. Enter his wife Felix Under (Jack Lemmon), where his wife threw his wife for his stubborn Neutinic idea and needed a place to live. The result is a train wreck and one of Neil Simon's play's most beloved movie adaptations. <br /> <br /> First thing first: I love that apartment! Poker Table, New Dart Board, Players of Baseball Players, Empty Booze and Beer Containers, A pair of Roman pillars. This is the place where men can be boys. Simone and director Jean Sacks open a great deal in the Oscar's room by moving the move in the bedroom and in the kitchen, giving a great job of giving mounting tension to bounce to the further mount between Oscar and Felix. <br /> Neal Hefty's familiar score has been played on the TV show, but it's not so hard as it is here, when the on-screen action is played in a number of different arrangements. Real space work and Manhattan's night shots give power to the films that feature film and time ("Budding," "The World of Henry Orient," "Midnight Cowboy," "Manchurian Candidate," "Rosemary's Baby," <br /> <br /> While Lonon and Mathou are very much compared to Tony Randall and Jack Clgmann? As fair, the film is more serious , Is characterized by an unusual condition after mid-life divorce, and a characteristic disappointment in not being able to perform an associated work.Simon Felix and Oscar is in the game of "passwords" or more than entering the battle of scholars with Howard Cassell. <br /> <br /> Lammon And Mathau both enjoyed watching the film in the film in particular films Annicce excellent comedians, but he did not understand why I have never thought to be a great comedy team. Here, in partnership with their well-respected, they will star in two different films, ridiculous play and a prayer mathaulo lamman. Matthew was initially the greatest, and his teddy-bear attitude around the poker table was lovely to us, but when the movie was over, he cleaned his apartment to Phillix and looked like Jack Torrance in "The Shining" working. <br /> <br /> "Felix is ​​not a great comedy trying to kill himself, but it's a good way to get into a great joke." , And set us up with some real-life pain before taking warmth and laughter. (Plus it has some great shots of the city's seed parts.) In the middle of the film, the scene was wrong, but it was Felix's Violence <br /> <br /> We see Oscar and his picar friends biker and fiery. <br /> <br /> Simon's lines are so great that they are the underlying force of the film. And it's real, and it's still funny. "I'm not talking, Felix comes to tell you, fearing me  ేను వినడానికి ప్రారంభించాను." వాస్తవానికి ఈ టీవీ కార్యక్రమం ఎప్పుడైనా ఏదైనా "ఊహిస్తూ" గురించి మంచి అభిప్రాయాన్ని తెచ్చిపెట్టింది, అయితే ఈ చిత్రం ఘనమైన పునాదికి దోహదం చేస్తుంది మరియు దాని స్వంత హక్కులో ఆనందం ఉంది. .
