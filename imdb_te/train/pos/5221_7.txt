I'm not interested in seeing the flock. Indue Lau directed the trio of Infernal Affairs but he was dropped from The Flack and was replaced by an emergency director, called Niles Muller. Made a good film but it was not satisfied with the study, so they baked him and appointed another director. It usually does not work well (remember the invasion) .But Flock is better than I expected. It's an interesting and entertaining thriller but it's a great movie. The character development is very well done and I am able to better understand the characters. Similarly, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and reliable. Richard Gere and Claire Danes provide effective performances. Now, let's go to negative points. There is an element which really bothers me (there is a moment in which it is irritated) the movie has more "attitude" and style tricks to the style. Their traces of place of tricks remain uncivilized. Plus, I think the film should be more ambitious. However, I would recommend Flack good thriller. It's not memorable, but it's fun.
