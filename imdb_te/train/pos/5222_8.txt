After Chicago, I lost all respect for Richard Gear and then came The Flock. So far has been a nice smile and a couple of stock facial gestures can get you, but he has finally proved to me that he must have his craft and can work with the best of them. Clare Danes is also superior to his "trainee / replacement". Some have suggested that some have suggested unnecessary violence, but I did not see it. I was not removed from the power of this film. I was really surprised to hear that I was released in theaters and came across the blockbuster instead. An unusual image with the right mix of action, suspense, thrills, and social mobility. Good by 7 years? Well, maybe. And anyone will see good performance from the gear than anyone has earned it from the pit.
