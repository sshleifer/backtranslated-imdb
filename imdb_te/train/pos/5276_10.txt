What a great film this is because I joined IMDb! This is often your moving picture and visually film and humble. Since you have read the story, I want to see the conflicts of traditional religious identity confusion because you do not see everything you want to see, because that general misconception is the son of a voyage to read people instead of simply appreciating and knowing about a father and to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and cross it before the movie comes to round 4. This is one of the few films that have been nominated for BAFTA as independent and foreign. It's beauty is that you can not refer to anything in the subtitle or use the Hollywood Formula, a great story that keeps you engaged and even manages to appeal to anyone. The only thing I wanted was to be long and see what was going on
