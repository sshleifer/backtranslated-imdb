He has some talent as action, horror, sci-fi, extortion director Fred Olen Ray. Character actor William Smith is one of the best tough / bad guys in the industry. He sees the viewer with his career best performance. For Randy Travis he gave his best Lee Van Cleef impression. He is not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis have produced the film. The rest of the cast did not really stand out. Ray has done a great job directing this movie, Smith and Travis are good, I've given this B Western to ten to ten (ten best) on a seven-level basis.
