A meteorite comes in a small town that brought a meteor jelly life. An old farmer will attack the alien in his hand, and youngsters Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (aka Corsoot) Dr. T. Hollen (Steven Chase) is taken to him. The local physician cautiously asks and asks Steve to investigate where they find the old man. When Steve returns, he will kill the doctor. <br /> <br /> "Blow" is a cult and classic science fiction, Steve and Jane attempt to warn policemen and residents, but nobody believes them. . With most ham stars and actresses (except Steve McQueen), with awful effects, but it is a happy and very, but very funny movie with low budget. I saw this classic (I saw 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon) and I really recommend Steve McQueen and fans of the Sci-Fi B-movies from the 50s. The number of my review number 1,400 is not good for the movie. My vote is seven. <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Boll" ("The Blob")
