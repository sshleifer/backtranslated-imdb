I found IMDb and saw this movie and I almost moved to the tears of all people who saw the film when I was 6 or older in 1967. I've seen before the Jungle Book, so I'm a few hours eagle boy, next year Mowgli. When the boy became Eagle, I tearred the tears in the film and wanted to see the film again. When we came home we had a roast chicken and had the desire to bone and I thought I thought? My dad then wager I wished I wanted to be an eagle and of course we can expect someone who wants to break the wishes of any more tears and the wishes if unable to fly a little angry this day ...
