My mother took me to look at me and I wanted to see for myself a long time to see all of my other Christmas wishes every year. Delil and Santa is looking through my telescope so much memory. I have watched every year after T.V. Through the guide. I usually play Saturday afternoon. I found the only movie in English, which was specially taken from the movie and was very happy to find a copy in Spanish. The film is my heart's favorite and does not feel bad as others have suggested. Yes, this is another movie about Santa Claus and makes it unique and unique. I can not wait to get a copy of this movie and see it with my kids explaining them my favorite episodes and memories!
