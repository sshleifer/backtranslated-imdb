I would have given 10 votes to complete this otherwise excellent series if Claudia Black did not continue with it! Adding her as Silly 'Vela' brought the series to my expectation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we do not need to lose 'jack' and do not really need this. <br /> <br /> I am a great fan of "Stargate", when I first announced the series, I have reservations that it can live up to the movie, but after watching the first episode I was hooked up. I always look forward to new episodes with great imaginations
