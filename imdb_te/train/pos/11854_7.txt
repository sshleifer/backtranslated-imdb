I agree with "Jerry". 2001, the secret solution was not a kind of difference (but "rip-off"), which is a much lesser estimate of the space film (actually, less low budgets?) Because a computer that controls spaceship is actually a person Something turned into a computer. And, like HAL, they tried to disconnect his "mind", but not his mechanical components, and with HAL, which led to disaster. There is at least one funny moment. The character of Christopher Cary, who finds no food, has a kind of ominous moment when he finds the abandoned pet, but then the obvious thing is not after all.
