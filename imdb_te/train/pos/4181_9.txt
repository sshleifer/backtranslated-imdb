I'm still scared about the horrific consequences of the horrific repercussions of the prisoners despite the Geneva Convention Rules since I saw this film (at least 15 years). <br /> <br /> The successful mission to set up mines in Japan harbor is an Australian underwater demolition team near Japan, which is captured in an Adelaide. <br /> <br /> These men are once in jail with other POWs but their frustration will soon learn from a friendly Japanese prison guard because they tried spies when they uniformed. <br /> <br /> The devastating consequences of the Japanese Marshall Code are executed with helmet. <br /> <br /> The request of their plea, and sympathetic prison guard, is a day of counting systems like a timbing bomb. <br /> <br /> "Write here, but I can promise you - you will never forget."
