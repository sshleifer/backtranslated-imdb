First of all, I started commenting that I'm a huge nightmare on Elm Street Fan. I think it's a great horror series so far. For me, Freddy Biogon! In fact, when Freddie Dead tried the last chapter, it was an unnatural picture. There is no better atmosphere than previous images. Freddie has a lot of time. Some people make him less scary, I agree. And in my opinion, exactly point. We know Freddie a little better so this is the picture, who he is, who he is, how he became the chasing person of our dreams. It is good if some people know it's a bad thing and why it's hard to find out why bad is bad. In fact those people do not like the remake of Halloween Rob Zombie. Really enjoy this one, you have to see things differently. It's not about a strange guy who hides your dreamland's Bush waiting for you to scare Hell out of it. This is the first, it's awesome. Over the years, Freddy kills most people and has not been able to leave anyone better. Now is the time to learn about this evil nature, the mental aspects of Freddie's terrorism. Along with the story of Freddie Past, I really liked the movie's atmosphere. In Springwood, most children grow crazy. Nightmare scenes are great. The soundtrack is awesome, especially the first song, 'I'm Now', performed by GooGo Go Dolls. In my opinion, Final Nightmare is a horror work and I can not believe it is underestimated. Maybe it's bad, or it will have different taste for me! However, all Freddie fans should see it. It has a lot of very scary moments as well as a lot of funny moments, and so many commandos! Get ready for something else and you may not be disappointed.
