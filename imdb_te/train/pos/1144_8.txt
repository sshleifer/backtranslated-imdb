In 1955, the British returned to Simone and Laura a comedy with Peter Finch and the amazing Ke Kendall. To this day, it is one of the best examples of British comedy, especially about how television sitcom is popular. <br /> <br /> Earlier in the evening, Monday, a few days ago I never heard of the movie I was holding on TV recently. <br /> <br /> However, I was amazed and delighted to see very clever sarcasm about American TV during the day. However, I was initially ridiculous. In fact, it's been a while since I was very happy. So, if you like irony, I would recommend that you look at it. <br /> The main actors? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Kathy Moriarty ?? Quite simply an excellent job, how the acting business does not stoic and shallow revealing. When I look at it, I'm thinking: how does this bizarre come into real life? If the actors are always in real life, ie? As you may know, Peter Sellers, for example, is credited with hiding his true personality behind the real group, so that no one really knows the true person. I saw Sallyfield as a Celestie Talbot playing Maggie, I played Laura in a TV sitcom opposite Ken Finch opposite Ken Kendall with a former British movie film ... Wondering that some actors have nervous disabilities? That feeling is crystalline. Eventually, her daughter (played Elizabeth Shoe's) and in an emotional moment, is facing her fictional daughter and repeats the fictional lines she used in the daytime soap in the daytime! Are you confused? That's not all, but the dialogue is fantastic for romance, comedy, bitchiness, anger, deterioration, fake and more ... <br /> <br /> The story? Well, there are many stories in this movie, which are also interrupted and ultimately in the end (of course? But Robert Altman is not like the movie!), And all of them have not finally been fixed. Life is not like, right? The pace is almost frantic, and you do not really listen and watch carefully to catch all the gags and subtle jokes. Spend 97 minutes in your life and watch it; <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is good, I have never been to Vupi Goldberg. The most ridiculous exchanges between Robert Downey and Kathy Moriarti steal so many scenarios for my money, and she will win my vote as the best player. I'm not a kid, her bitch gives a completely new face ...
