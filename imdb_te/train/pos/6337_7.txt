My 5th grade teacher, I have a morbid fascination with a tornado for over 40 years about the stories I've seen in a teenager in a local Texan. Fortunately, I've spent all my life in Mid-Atlantic states where tornadoes are rare and are not usually violent in the Midwest but I have two similarities, one in PA and one in NJ <br /> <br /> I have family scenes, I have experienced differences between Jack and Don Hutch. When the tornado is close, most people know what Don is doing, because he learned this at school because the storms are more frequent U.S. Tornado safety is an important area in areas. However, the characters in the film are thought to have done some or that they believe are safe to do in tornado, but in fact they can not be or are not safe. <br /> When Siren first alerted, Don and Arthur went home and opened the windows. For years, this is what people say, but tornado safety websites now advise against it. Also, people are hiding in the road underpass. T.V. in a weak twist in Kansas This method became popular in the early 1990s by staff. However, in the most severe tornadoes, people are sucked out of these underpasses. This happened in Oklahoma in May 1999. <br /> <br /> The tornado in the film fell in the fall, which is not a simple time for them. (One of my most recent incidents occurred at the end of September.) Furthermore, from the northwest to the south-east, such storms in the Northern Hemisphere go from southwest to northeast. However, this is not all unusual. <br /> <br /> In the early 1990s, Joliet, a famous tornado that touched the IL, traveled in that direction (as well as participating in my other fronts). <br /> <br /> The film is in the spring. The film depended on a book based on an actual incident on June 3, 1980. But this is still a comprehensive story.
