HBO began re-opening this month. In 1991, I was laughing at the theater again, and now I am laughing again in my room. If I look like it, I'll see it. There is no question. It's a lot of fun to me than other famous exploits like Airfield! (Which I really like, BTW). Kathy Moriardi steals this opinion in my opinion. Quotes like "sudden speech! The last symptoms of the brain fever! She could blow at any time!" Put me on the edge. And this is not funny since Hoop Goldberg 'jumping' Jack Flash '. Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr. I started giving 9 stars from these 10 stars, but I realized that it would be for that kind of image, and I did not have a thing to change or improve. So 10 is it. I had to get it on DVD, and it's all there.
