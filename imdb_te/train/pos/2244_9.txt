This is because I can only do why this film is not widely distributed, it's very close to some. This movie is a real pleasant surprise and sarcastic intellectual. The film turns into lights in the dark, maintaining religion and larger media, and blankets for the cover cover. If the DVD is rented and you do not see it for yourself, many have failed (in Dogma mind) that the film succeeds to hit the nose underneath the town, using both ridiculous and very clever analogues and backdrops and locations. There are some surprises in the film that can not be commented deeply without revealing some important spoilers.
