Everyone has already commented on cinematography (great to be good), personalities (bigger than life), construction (chronological, time-to-time with many references to surf culture). <br /> <br /> The rest is the big question about social importance: to keep American culture more satisfying and rewarding for big culture. <br /> I was a surfer in the 1970s. We used to watch 16mm movies in local high schools in Sokal. As long as my skin gets warm, I should remember the great feeling of surfing the day until you keep the Hawaiian shirt and short films and watch the latest surf film at night. Often, the storyteller was a scriptwriter who read the script from paper sheets. Sometimes, a surf band or proto-punk band adds music. I was never happy. <br /> <br /> When you see me playing "Riding Giants", when you get back to me, <br /> <br /> "Without a ladder, with Jonas, a happy and joyful moment "What is the purpose of life?" At least Greg Knoll, like Larry Hamilton and, like us, some of us are bold or honest <br /> <br /> If you want us to live in the best way, society is different, but it is really nice to see people who are outside their dreams. <br /> <br /> This message really impressed me.
