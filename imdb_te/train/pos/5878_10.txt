Garam Masala is a comedy film I have seen in the ages. Akshay's daughter, women's affairs 3 girls and engaged at the same time. John Abraham is entertaining at times and is one of his best works to date. Paresh Rawail is quite common in his movies. Director Priyadarshan has previously made great films. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchl Best of God. Garam Masala is his funniest movie he did. Three new actresses are on average. Rim Seni has no choice in this film. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan had painted the same time with the simple hero of the dealer with 3 girls. Two girls leave the same day on the same day and end up in the same house. Laughs loaded with loads, which is a non stop entertainer.
