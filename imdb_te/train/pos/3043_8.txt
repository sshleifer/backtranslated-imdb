This film will tell why Amitabh Bachchan is a man industry. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bollywood has reached a high level of privilege. Once again, Godfather Prakash Mehra decided to re-use his paintings. Prakash has a habit of taking backgrounds and building stories, adding to the generous dosages of Bollywood consciousness and cliches. Zangir saw the Young Young Man manufacturing. Lauris is about a bastard and Namak Halal about master-faith beliefs. <br /> <br /> However, the theme is restricted to move the screenplay through a three-hour song, dance and play control. The film's portrayal of a Haryana movie turned into a controlling hero in Mumbai belongs to the film. Amitabh's vocal skills and commentary The film earned her big bucks and thanks to her flawless stock Harinavi's voice. For me, this is the only pull in the film. The rest are typical Bollywood screenplays. <br /> <br /> Now Amitabh has some special comedy scenes in his movies. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This film has a good dose for them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The challenge of mosoling at the party's shoe caf√©, Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare is the challenge of mosquito in the boardroom and now the standard alcohol price. <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor is remembered for his moody, finicky role with an extra mile for the movie (remembering Rajaji to be "Shayadap" after the tragedy event), while Amitabh is his loyal servant, Prakash Mehra Indian knows the mind ... And Shashi tried to act along with other films in his film. It is a more developed character to make a line-up. A keper, remember? So, people came and wore Amitabh's new hat and went home happy. Ultimately, it is good to have gas and bad guys go to the gas and reassure the old-fashioned theme of loyalty once again. <br /> <br /> So w hat makes this film a neat classic? Amitabh Bachchan as Haryana. Prakash Mehra created another icon with a story name. Chuck story, characters and plot. Only my marks are for Amitabh.
