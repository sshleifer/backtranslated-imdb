Tom wanted to make a film for a long time and he did. He has a little dirty and worn-out notebook great little ideas he has filling up and it is carrying around for 10 years. No grant character transformations, no Hollywood materials just a little bit of life and magic. In balance, speed, comedy vs drama is absolutely enough. This movie will take place on an early journey to know how good it is. The music is great and your eyes are equally satisfied. The fact is that there is nothing in this film, especially the scene of the sketches associated with one of the characters, which is very fun and surprisingly entertaining because it is empty. It will be between the lines going on. If you do not want to see or see, what's that?
