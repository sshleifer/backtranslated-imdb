Brookdown Palace, the story of two friends Alice and Darlen, goes to Thailand and travels to jail after being trapped in their luggage. In this way, the film is capable of becoming a serious and moving film like "Return to Paradise", but the film is focused on the situation of girls and their friendship. <br /> Claire Dans and Kate Beckinsale have given spectacular performances, suspicion, jealousy, question mark and test of their friendship and ultimate friendship. <br /> <br /> The film is in politics or deeply in prison life (which is just a little glazed) not to be deeply embedded, and focuses more on these friendship issues. <br /> <br /> There are a few plots holes here, and some parts are simply not believable or realistic. We can not have a real fear or frustration of their condition. And life outside the jail has little experience, Bill Pullman is playing a cemetery lawyer who thinks he has the heart of gold. In short, it must be a much more darker film than all the rights. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed the whole thing. Performance is good, the soundtrack is perfect, and the storyline has enough turns and interesting. Visibility.
