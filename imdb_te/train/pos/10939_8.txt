The Five Deadly Wins is a great kung fu action movie which is wrapped in a whodunnit mystery. A kung fu movie has all the common telltale signs: great choreography, terrible dubbing, fighting variety "styles", and widespread exaggeration, often widespread cheesey human emotions. But the plot is definitely better than average. It has interesting and non-conflict scenes. <br /> <br /> Another thing I love about X's worst injustices is the beautiful simplicity of the morality and themes of the movie. What comes to them about everyone Shy, greedy, and corrupt. The bad guys who are devastated by selfish greed are eventually destroyed by their betrayal and backwards. Good guys use the teamwork, planning, and integrity to overcome odds and come out on top. <br /> <br /> The poison clan rocks!
