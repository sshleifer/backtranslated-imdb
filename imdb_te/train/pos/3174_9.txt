Very rarely come across an indie comedy that loses a permanent seal. Cross-eyed rare gem. The writer's director solved the challenge of directing his own work and gave him a delightful performance as an evil companion. The script plays an interesting role not only of the bitter writers who are struggling, but also combines a lot of humor into the writer's desolate world that you can not help Ernie in the role, but you can not help. Very funny thing. Despite the small budget, Adam Jones gave the film a serious look. It's not a problem around when it comes to making a good film. I can not wait to see what he comes next. This person is laughing and thinking; That's unique.
