Although this box office is a disaster, this is my favorite movie. It gives the family a powerful message. It contains violence and has a song with a group of bikini. Compared to other Bollywood films, the action sequences in the film are more realistic. It is an amazing combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian godfather, Amitabh is doing the film. Do not read reviews by critics, they are ignorant. The film has a mix of comic, romance, drama and especially actions. If you want to see the action more realistic than the main one (still better), this is the image.
