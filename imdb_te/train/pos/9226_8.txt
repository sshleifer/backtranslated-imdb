I read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years, but I started looking at the beginning of the last year, and I went to buy a mad movie and for whatever reason it was too late in my mind, although it was somewhere in the 15th century in Italy An amazing picture set. Definitely the medieval period (although I do not think any particular year has ever given). <br /> <br /> Christian climb time, age is totally mad time, and the film binds this well. <br /> <br /> Our protagonist Flavia is a young woman who meets a Muslim drowning on a battlefield. He seems to be a warm and witty fellow, and she's taken with him right away. Her father, a soldier standing there, immediately comes and kills the wounded person before her eyes. <br /> <br /> Her father has beaten her to a convent that looks like an open-air madness - by resorting to residents and medieval Christianity, slowly going mad. One of the Flutia Nutty nuns comes under the influence. But in a mad world, only Sene is really mad, and this sociology sister clearly recognizes her insanity around her. She takes up a string of flavia, which begins to question everything about the world she finds as she is a young man and is clearly sheltered. <br /> <br /> The film is unobtrusive and in the role of the world that shows a lot of inconvenience. We see a horse, and in a pag-painting, one of the women in his land raped the ungodly violence of a young nun. For all, Flavia examines and questions, rejecting, and finally, the Christian doctrine that creates such a process of horrors leads to criticism over the years that year. I disagree with that criticism. Though the views of Flavia sometimes sometimes vaguely reflect, for instance, the contemporary feminist commentary (the film was made in 1974), revolves really pretty clear questions. It was difficult to believe that she would have much more water in her time, but it did not make it belabor a sort of little point. Flavia is written in our era, or any era, allowing her to suit her plight. <br /> <br /> The Muslims come and attack in rural areas, their leader, beautiful new version of Islamist still visits his dreams. She soon became Smitten, and she actually led his army, directed to become the zone of arc figure in full combat-gear, and directed the invaders to take over the Christian community, and revenge on all who saw her. /> <br /> Is she herald of a new and better world? She thinks, but the Muslims in that period are not big on feminism, because she soon learns the hard way. As they say, meet the new owner <br /> <br /> This is really a thumbnail of some of the things in the FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The picture is very scary, and with a lot of downbeat, it's rather discouraging. A collective audience image at all, sure. It's very good, though, and this is not the "sannyam" pile that is often recklessly thrown. I think there is a lot of value in the final film, I'm happy.
