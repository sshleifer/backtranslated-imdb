I'm very fond of Lawrence Oliver in the past few weeks, and I wondered when I found this gem. <br /> <br /> When you divorce Lady X, it's always awesome when I run across a film that does not have my finger on the remote control. Last scenery, and in 1938 viewers had a real pleasure. I now accept people's genuine humor and prefer it to people who are terribly messy, now called funny. <br /> <br /> The Lady of the Lady X is well worth anybody's time.
