This anime is low and still exists. The picture of the notable Darcy children, I returned 10 years after I first saw it. <br /> <br /> If the animation is not perfect, camera tricks give it a 3D feel, and this story is still good for me since I grew up and ground breakers such as Neon, Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. It's clearly not somewhere near Depth but it tries to see it from a lightweight view. <br /> <br /> One of my favorites was one of the most eagerly waiting eight years I had ever been. Not to say its childish movies, there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you all need a sense of humor to see.
