This is definitely one of the greatest Disney films ever made. It's a real pleasure to anyone. <br /> In general, any Homeward Bound is a three domestic pets that live in a home with their owners on vacation. They do not know what will happen, and desperately want to go home, they escape from agriculture and try to go home through wilderness. <br /> <br /> It is one of Don's last films, starring Amesh. He gave Shadow a voice of old, intelligent and friendly Golden Retriever. Sally Field, starring in the movie, gave Sassy the voice of the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what's the matter about this film Chance! Michael J. Fox (my all-time favorite actor) has voiced, Chance is mainly anticipated, fun, playful, powerful and goofy from a dog, and every time I chase when watching this movie, Comedy is like never ending! <br /> <br /> This film is very sad many times. <br /> <br /> Sometimes they are alone or remind people when they lose their livestock. <br /> <br /> A scene that keeps me in suspense is trying to escape the triad pound. I'm surprised to see that Chance is caught in his collar fence and it's not nearly ready. There are other intimate movements to the film, but nobody is more curious about me. <br /> <br /> In whole, this is a wonderful family image. If you enjoy this movie, you probably get a sequel. I gave this film 10 to 10!
