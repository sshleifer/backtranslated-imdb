<br /> <br /> This film is not well understood. <br/> <br/> Despite some lines, it is unusual to see this movie, and the language is unknown. My friend sent a VHS and added some paper documents with all the lines translated into English. By translating her to me, I began to look at this story (actually this is a story), and in the early credits I was caught up with the first melodious melody. Some other films (Paris, Texas and Nenet et Bonnie) are the ones that can speak to the heart, rarely act (in most cases), absurd humor, slapstick, - without words. When you get the chance, see it. What you're doing - do not miss it. This is one of the lifetimes experience. Oh, the acting was great, the soundtrack was good, the story was easy and a thousand times ago - but rarely (forever?).
