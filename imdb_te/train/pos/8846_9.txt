I really enjoyed this play from the Sydney Lite. The best word I describe is mad. It throws the viewer for an hour and a fifty minutes and does not let you breathe before the credits go to the end. Believe me, this film keeps you guessing the whole path. <br /> <br /> This story is very well-inspired and inspired. This is a very complicated Tarantino kind of story. All of the acting is excellent from all the leads and even the smallest episodes, excellent cast. I also loved cinematography, giving it a real sense of being an independent film. It's great. <br /> <br /> The movie is excited, tired and removes the heart. It's very hard to see, but you'll see the happiness you've done.
