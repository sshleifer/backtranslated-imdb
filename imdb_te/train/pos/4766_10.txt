<br /> <br /> If an actor's performance is good, it would be nice if you think the film would be anything less than his presence. In fact, there are many scenes that appear to be very quick and reckless - a seemingly low budget, a strange plot about the place of replacement of a prestigious priest and the one who wants to take another week's points, the presence of Pierre. "I have never seen or can not do iomagine for better performance in the future, Paul Schofield <br /> <br /> "Jai suis Maurice Morand, Pretty Catholic" ("I'm Mariss Mormend"), "If a frailie makes a crime and does not play the inspired priest again, , A Catholic priest ") that such a brilliance can be forgotten by a madman <br /> The other amazing feature of the film is that in Morrand   కే సన్నివేశాన్ని కలిగి ఉంది - ఒక నిర్లక్ష్యం చేసిన వ్యక్తి అయినప్పటికీ అతను ఒక పూజారిని స్టిల్స్ చేస్తాడు - ఒక క్యాబరేలో పెద్ద మొత్తంలో <br /> <br /> గెరార్డ్ - చర్చికి Morand తిరిగి లేదా అతనిని భర్తీ చేయాలని కోరుకునే మనిషి - అతను క్యాబరే లో వదిలివేయకూడదు ఉంటే అది త్రాగడానికి ఉంది . <br /> He is in the midst of cheers and praise from the people who think he drinks three types of wine in four areas. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, dialogue between Morond and the worst collector is also great. "Are you also taken away by men?" Morand asks, he hates what he has just done. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is not commenting, but it is precious due to the very strong and eerie emotional atmosphere of all time created. <br /> <br /> "Le Defrak" is a very strange movie, but can be seen by all the audience - if it is good Catholics - it is a rare diamond in film history. <br /> <br />
