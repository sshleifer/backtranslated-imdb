An illustrious picture of a traitor who was hounded by his own conscience (Victor McLaughlin in Oscar). McLoglain plays an IRA Rouge, who laid down his leader to collect the prize during the Sinn Fein Rebellion of Ireland. Scenes showing mobs of combat and mob are quite realistic and keep in mind the disappointment among individuals. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford is faced with the fog and horror description of the Irish landscape, with the lack of hope for a better future, creating better and stronger atmosphere. Max Steiner's dramatic music score adds happiness to the film. Oscar winner was also nominated for Best Picture. It is one of the Hollywood classic.
