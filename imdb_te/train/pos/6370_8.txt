To my surprise, I really enjoyed Disney's latest animation installations. The film had its lows, but overall the story was very strong and the characters were very simple. The animated Disney movie is not a musical, it is also a pleasure. I went to Tarzan's limits. Thankfully they have rested the music theme. Another good feature of the film is that the comedy is not entirely (La Hercules), which is subtle, so adults can not experience greedy or plain stupid. There is a disappointing animation. With all the great animated films that are taking place outside Disney Studios, they move and feel a little more catch. There is something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities of Atlantis's story! <br /> <br /> The whole movie is entertaining
