In all breakdancing / hip-hop films released between 1983 and 1986, the 1984 film Beat Street is undoubtedly the best. The story follows a DJ, his young breaker's brother, a graffiti artist and a winter showbiz promoter, in which they attempt to bring out the ghetto using their "street" talent. Acting is not always the same, and the characters are not completely out of reach, but they are more than replaceable with down-to-earth dialogue, playful, fantastic dancing sequences and timeless hip-hop sound tracks. The film was filmed at the Breaking Dynasty ("This Is Not New York, It's Bronx!"), And Breeding's fathers, the dance team Rock Studio Crew and rapper Africa Bomba's performances. The Rock Study Crew offers the best scene in the film when the Premier Breakdown Club dominated a dance battle in Roxy in the early 80s. Hip-hop lovers must see.
