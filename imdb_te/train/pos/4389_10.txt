From the most charismatic (and most illustrious) script to the cinematography, Carter Burwell's beautiful music from lavish cinematography is rarely available in Rob Roy film experiences: <br /> <br /> There were many similarities with Braveheart outside the same year. With all the wage credits to Mel Gibson, Braveheart is often a self-conscious and Prechy epic film I've seen for a long time as a film portraying Rob Roy as an opponent. While Braveheart is an intellectual epic, Rob Roy impresses you and finds you in a tightly edited story. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy has a dramatic tension, action and occasional balance of humor. <br /> The characters reveal the dialogues and habits that are related to their authentic times. <br /> <br /> For example, when we expect the heroic rob Roy to prevail, we find out that his objections are products of his own vanity and honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most hateful bad guys in cinematic history, yet there are moments when we can understand how the events of his life are shaped into what he turns into. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a very good precious treasure, one of the greatest stories ever danced to dance and the best time to imagine.
