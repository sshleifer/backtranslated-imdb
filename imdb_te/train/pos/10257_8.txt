What can I say about this film earlier? Its a lot of fake looks like sandals and kicks. I'm not sure if this is Charlie Sheen. im sure they will beat it and if it is alot she will kick harder. But the scenes with pinch and hot oil are very real. And the last needle in the eye scene is amazing and it's no surprise to me at all.
