The film's trailers show torture scenes or mainstream sexuality, but these scenes have been chosen to attract only rare fragments and audiences. <br /> They have repeatedly turned their heads off in their jobs and lives, others they may have, and cruelly torture others. At the low end of the repressive chain, mostly women. <br /> <br /> A film that looks like a worst handstage is hard to deal with, but it's also hard to endure such lives. <br /> Technically, the film is very small cuts, but contains documentary style episodes. Without any sophistication, and most surprisingly, without any hope. Its documentary style makes this image even more disturbing because you know, such people are there and many of them are present, but our society exhibits an external appearance. Somewhere in the romantic industry has to do its business, somewhere unclaimed domestic violence is to take place, somewhere having hopes to shatter. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie without any funny scenes (some people funny who are repeating ten super markets are funny, but this is true), go watch this movie. I'm afraid when you put it in the subtitles, because the subheading can not make the transparency.
