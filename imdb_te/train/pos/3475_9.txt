I'm bettimenakak, I was both frightened and attracted to the two of us together. When I saw 'In His Life: The John Lennon Story', I was very worried that there was not one of us. The fact that there is nothing like Ida Quinn and Jared Harris John Lennon and Paul McCartney? Even with some make and with proper hairdos? <br /> <br /> But I'm more than a bit surprised. It is probably thanks to the role of Michael Lindsay-Hog, directed by Let It Be in 1970. Perhaps John and Paul are well aware of the fact that these characters and conversations are convincing themselves. (The credit for both of us is given by a man named Mark Stanfield whom I know absolutely nothing; I believe director Lindsay-Hoge has more than a bit to do with the script.) We're not both biographies of Beatles; This is a fairly small plot, in fact, a single day in New York City. In an interview between John and Paul in 1976, John stayed in New York. Is that meeting completely fictitious? In fact, such a meeting did not prove to be true. But through the expected dialogue gives us a compilation of the personalities of these two great musicians? Their intelligence, the sense of humor, their different reaction to fame, and all their relationship too; <br /> <br /> This is a talk film, except for the dialogue between two and a half hours characters, it is nothing more than the fans of The Beatles; But writing and storytelling is an amazing piece, and both communicating and touching. For the interest of these two music giants, how can you get over the shock of how different actors look from their counterparts and feel how John and Paul have got life? So close and persuasive script, and committed actors. Both of us give genius an invaluable insight into the lives of two geniuses, and both a sad and funny story. Very definitely recommended.
