Paris is also a beautiful art and music to enjoy and fall in love - even in the film. <br /> <br /> George Gershwin's excellent music is filled by great dance by Jean Kelly and Leslie Coronel. <br /> <br /> "An American in Paris" is a comic, lightweight, loving picture that is well worth watching. <br /> <br /> <br />
