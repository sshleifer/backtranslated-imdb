Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage was initially unaware of a deadly crime, and Domino led to dangerous adventures, adventure and misfortunes that lived continuously in the American West in the 1990s. Red Rock West is often ruthless and sometimes hilarious, and Cage pulls off his usual sardonic wit and easy blend mixture. <br /> Has the top floor? Yes. Dennis Hopper is a crazed, almost fond killer? Yes. Does Cage Have a Chance? Well, you have to see and see. It's never been forever, and it was first surprise me. <br /> <br /> In yesterday's second view, I was surprised how good it was and how well it was built and at the same time very scary and funny. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dal is known more for his TV shows, but with the Rounders and this film he shows an ingenious hand with sensational plots. By which it is saved by its humor, and by caricature. The bar is unclear, cops are questionable. And do not miss the really inspired kami by Dwight Yogam as a truck driver.
