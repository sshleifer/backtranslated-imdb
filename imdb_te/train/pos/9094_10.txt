I saw this independent film in Philadelphia and it was a surprising surprise. I left a grin theater on my face. One of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on the true story -Hello! It also has a great role of actors. Mindy Sterling has it and looks great. I love her at Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also amazing. I remember him from class head. I'm tired of all the dark emotional films I've done. This is fun and light, and I can see with my family and not be embarrassed. I am checking to see when I get on the DVD. I will definitely buy it.
