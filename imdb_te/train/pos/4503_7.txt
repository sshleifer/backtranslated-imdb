The GP and the amusing are the big names in the Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle comedy since 1916 - the young Oliver Hardy is a ne'er-do-well, he enlarges his wife and it's not really smooth and he can not afford. There are more wives and children; <br /> <br /> You can see part of "Olivier Hardy's Early Movies" and are now available on DVD, with a nice addition to the big screen favorite comic duo available to the corpus.
