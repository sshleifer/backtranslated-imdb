Fay Grim I'm a complete example of the so-called full puzzle movie. There are all the pieces of acting, direction, storyline and entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The film follows a single mother, Fay Grimm, who tries to raise her son to become her father and abandon her law. CIA contacts soon deteriorate to find her husband Henry's 8 journals. These magazines have long been confident in the CIA and have been associated with countries and their public works. Fay is sent to search for these journals to release them from jail, and sent to a cat-and mouse-chase across Europe to get these magazines back and she never knew of her husband's secret secrets. <br /> <br /> Parkour Posey is already an actress after seeing me in OH and Best in Show in Ohio. She brought her life style to these two comedies, but Fay Grimm was a much different role than the other two films. I believed what happened on the Posey screen, I thought for her, I was dead for her and I wanted to know more. When she is on the screen she will catch you and she should not be thinking what will happen when she's outside. <br /> <br /> I do not see other previous works by writer / director Hal Hartley, but you decide to rent a movie if you want to choose a smart movie in the next film. A DVD I'd highly recommend you if you want to choose Fie Grim. If you have any idea what a movie should look like, you enjoyed this movie.
