I spent 5 hours in this film. What I have not seen yet is that the film left me with tasty funk. Do not look at the confused women and the fearless Solomon Solomon for your opinion. Individually participating in the Ninth Degree, the film invested in an inefficient partnership concept for our lives. I got this staggering enjoyment with raw knuckle from inside. Self and others' pain in the history of humanity, it becomes more profound in different and distorted opinions. The result is that we have to face our barrage of a bridge from dead mud mud. Finding real people is the happiest profession of birth. Hard work for realism meets in the dark place of our bankruptcy culture.
