After reading many reviews of the film in the IMDb, there is a consensus between the volunteers that the film is nothing like books based on it. At this time I never read and read any of the main characters in the past. Nevertheless, I can say with certainty, it seems to me that most critics have a sense of humor bypass. Be honest here - this movie is very fun <br /> <br /> Okay? Although I do not claim the movie as a representative of the character / s, is it a clear perspective? Bemoan the fact that the same people who have been carping about this film are not even faithful to the original DC comic book character of the classic 1960s Batman series? Or perhaps most Gordon's 1980s version of the original version of the original version of the series is unusual in the same figures <br /> <br /> Point, yes this movie is a very big camp but it is definitely <br /> <br /> Former Tarzan, Ron Eli (And Gary Bassie resembles a comparison to boot!) And has a ball with their respective characters with a great supporting cast Is. <br /> <br /> Watch out for a very brief but very welcome show by the horror movie favorite Michael Barryman. <br /> The best scenery? Savage and his men check out the most but very very important expressions received by the waiter when a official case is committed to the Ultimate Fox Pass of Coke, Lemonade and Milk Order! As well as the frequent recognition scene at the end of the film that condemns his hostile captain Seas using various martial arts units labeled Savage's screen! ?? <br /> <br /> Simply put, the film does not take seriously and it is a lot more fun. Great fun from start to finish! (And you'll be singing John Philip Sosa and then sing the song for the songs of the day!)
