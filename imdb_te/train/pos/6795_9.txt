One of the more brilliant serial killer movies in recent history. Jodik Killer is the most sensational serial killer in the backdrop of history and the fictional nature of history. Filmmakers have created an unexpectedly good insight into the diagnosis of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers the zodiac will be surprised. Others want to know more about this troubled criminal. Unlike many serial killers, the zodiac is not quite feared, although most are and is self-promoter. The director plays the viewer's expectations and pulls it off. The film is a murder mystery or "cool case" - a style thriller. This is a brilliant investigative / procedural horror film that puts gore-hounds in search of cheap thrills. <br /> <br /> Some people do not like any movie filmed in the video. This attitude is very old style and regional. This is the attitude and attention of the images that retain the entertainment value or technical issues over artistic value. This attitude has survived. Jodik Killer is a low budget movie, no doubt, but discerning viewers will look beyond and find a carefully designed gem.
