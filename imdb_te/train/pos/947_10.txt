And Dickens was close to the story. I'm hard to see the young Ebenezer (who thought that the long hair, sure they were better than they did!), Scott Scout makes an excellent job. The delivery of some lines from Dickens finally brought me life. Edward Woodward is the most part of everything we expect and the Ghost of Christmas. I'm G.C. Scott's Scorpagh is far more reliable than the current version of Patrick Stewart. When the scene finds that the Christmas Morning Screws 'missed', it is enough to persuade Scott to know how to work comfortably. He is unusual here. The whole cast is amazing. In this version of The Christmas Carol, Tiny Tim is almost so sweet. Still music and scenery must see this every holiday. Have fun!
