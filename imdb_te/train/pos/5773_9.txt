I really dug this film because I was interested in lake monsters. This image is worth a look. If you love the most terrible, they check the good types of movies. The effects are just "Lost of the Lost". First of all, the film was 89/90 in the 90s and I saw in the local channel giants called "Morgas Presents". I do not have to worry, but since I was eight years old and B years old after I looked in the DVD in a circuit city, I bought it immediately because it could give me 9 to the heart of the monster squad and gremlins. Good B movie for all ages is fun.
