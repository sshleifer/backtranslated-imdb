A friend gave me this DVD, he came from the director at the festival, I think. I warned that the technical elements in the film were moving slightly and the writing was good but not great. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I am very pleased with this movie. Youssef Kerkor Ernie, the main character, curiously as good as it might be. Adam Jones (who directed) and Justin Lane Ernie were good friends. Bill character (Justin Lane), who spends a lot of wearing a panda like a panda, is very much my favorite; He seemed at least a dimensional, and reminded me of an older college roommate, I called the guy after watching the DVD. Really kind of love, and very funny. Some other acting is good, some are such, but none of them is bad. I also really liked Vigilant duo. <br /> <br /> In this regard, I am giving these high marks, though there are some problems, tell you that you have taken care of these people and have decided to make their image their way. Well done by Adam Jones and crew.
