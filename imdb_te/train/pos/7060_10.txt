Many have commented that the film is not good enough anywhere. Well, maybe it's not - you know. However, how does it affect your child? <br /> <br /> Previous Disney films are sometimes a little harder to young children. (For example, Bambi's parents have picked up the parent). The film is great for my sensitive little girl who loves jokes and happy endings. <br /> <br /> Disney's standards are past - skip this picture. <br /> If you have a sweet little girl or a soft little kid, buy this movie and see your little children if you really like it. This film is a sleeping movie for the happy dreams instead of insomnia. I am happy with a movie that makes my kid happy. Parents do not need to impress at all times.
