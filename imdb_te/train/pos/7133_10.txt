The perfect work of an image! Goodnight Mr.Tom became one of my favorite films faster. No one will lose when you see this movie, it's great! Mr. Tom is certainly portrayed as a tough elder by John Tow, who becomes a soft father-like figure, like 'Town Mouse and Country Mouse' when William Beach (Nick Robinson) sends him. A real heart-wrenching image. The director knows exactly how to make the director's book correctly. These characters are miraculously portrayed, the emotions of characters and the view that viewers are afraid of audiences from the audience, and these emotions fall upon a six-pension. These cities, which are set during the crisis during World War II, also show a distinction between cities and rural areas, which are almost entirely from different countries. A perfect must see, which is not really exciting and clever picture.
