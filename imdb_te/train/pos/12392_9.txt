It's the title of 'second start', which shows us the end of the human race. Before the end of the Matrix, this little anime written by Wachowski delves into common problems with the second renaissance human behavior, which shows us the world lay infront, not the distant future set in the early 21st century; Greed, power, control, pride, etc. <br /> <br /> It is common to use artificial contacts such as robots or slaves or servers in science fiction / fantasy stories. The second revival is no relief for this notion, but instead the general man vs. This story describes the mechanism of the machine, the story of the struggle for the acceptance of the world in which humans are ruled. Matrix films show us a human perspective, and these little animations tell each other of the story. <br /> <br /> The second revival episode 1 + 2, the original Matrix film was launched, how the sky was black, which led to the use of humans as batteries, and the 1st machine introduced to the city, which corresponds to the upcoming Matrix Revolutions movie. <br /> <br /> If I do not want to destroy the viewer's view of the viewers, I do not give the story away, but I would be interested in anyone interested in the Matrix world or anyone interested in Japanese animation. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
