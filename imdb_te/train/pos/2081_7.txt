8/29/2009 - 10 to 7 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): In China the mother is thrown into the nature of the farmers and their importance and struggles. The film depicts a family based on a novel awarded and a slave girl starting with a son's established marriage. This film is good enough to maintain your interest despite the fact that the role played by Paul Muni is somewhat guaranteed. It is the storyteller, Wong Long (the role played by Muni) and he buys more land, how he works the land, ultimately be the greatest, but returns to the originally opened land. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Luis Rainier, is the main thread of the story (along with the land) and clear Chinese non-actors, but it has a good job of displaying the country. It's clear that MGM used it money to create a good epic with this one in an era it probably could afford it. The scene with the locusts is very well done, and the rest of the film is really good at the Oscars that year's Best Cinematography Award. The exact definition of a legend is what this story is and it is pulled off pretty well.
