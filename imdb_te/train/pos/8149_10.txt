When I came in 1994, I saw this movie for the first time and it was recently seen and it's still funny. I do not know if you want to understand the hip hop in the 90s, but it will help if you do. In the 90s, when the NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal strife between groups and members, their different conditions (ice cube, Easy E, etc.). Also Wanna B's, Access Rappers (Vanilla Eyes, Freedom Williams from C & C Music Factory, etc.) to launch the scene. This movie is all about fun as it seems to be a real documentary. Case plays an interview that Lemmons spends a year in the life of a fictional rap group named N.W.H. Ice Code (Rusty Condif / Director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott / Needs Redeeman, and Tone Deaf (Mark Christopher Lawrence) The best thing about this film is that the hip hop industry's disillusionment in the 80s is very frustrating and they are fun But if you know the rack of 80/90, you know how much truth is in these things and no hip hop knowledge Da, it's still a funny funny movie, and all of them are spinel top first, but spin tap is not the first spoof film.It is better than spin tap to heavy metal than spin tap, and in some ways, the fear of a Black Planet rap and songs Hook off. This DVD is NWH's group and solo artist to include music videos Rusty and Laurie B skatce kandiyaph for making tremendous performances.
