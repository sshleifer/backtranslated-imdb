I first heard about Kali's twins and I sounded like what I wanted to do, but with all the movies I was regularly getting lost, I lost my radar. The local WonderBook roaming around ... I spotted the box for this and grabbed it. I'm pretty glad I did. <br /> <br /> Twins of the toes are a strange, ghoomy, sometimes clear creepy film, which is somewhat lesser, but it is still less fun - but it is still fun and worthwhile. <br /> <br /> The Indian-based fictional Kyle centers that provide the Taylor-Ericsson Cult Group seeks to meditate and exclude the meditation and other customs of the individual "internal giants" - but clearly these techniques are dark (based on your perspective ...) <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Pi, and then the first <br /> <br /> (SHAKTI), which are operated in a mental hospital for a journalist to visit one of the members of the spiritual. Journalist Taylor-Eriksson wants to investigate the culture, but we find that her real motivations can reach home. When the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist finds her earned on her head ... <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) is related to a violent young man who is sentenced to psychological rehabilitation. He was sentenced to a young man in a coma. The question is that the doctor actually realizes that Taylor-Ericsson is an "alumnus", his rehabilitation methods are far from the norm ... <br /> <br /> The end story (KALI) revolves around a quake -Heeler "and his assistant is a fee Heeler can not help one of his clients unwittingly, and when excommunicating a force that has her, the pastor <br /> <br /> I have said that I really enjoyed the twins of the toes and there were some errors with the image to keep them from being truly amazing - but it was original and ambitious image for what I had. Poor and enthusiastic dubbed conversation.Dubbing sub-par and I subtitle with original language track I do not believe that performance is very low, which is not really the case, in fact, some of the exhibitions are very terrifying chilling (second category "doctor", and In the third "client" will be remembered instantly ...) and important Aina. Nail FX is very well-low-budget film, some eyebrow-scissors, pencil-in-the-throat-suicide, some good (but irritating "shaky") self-just some graphic scenes-again, and some other goodies thrown in for good measure. There are some "serious" gore movies that are not tough, but definitely stronger than your average horror fare. I found the story about the cult-group admirable and simple horror-storyless nonsense welcome. There are plenty of real atmosphere and tension scenes, of which I did not come across for a while. Although some of the fundamental ways are flawed, I still urge KALI's twins "far more" underground horror viewers - some scenes may prove to be more of a major viewer. Recommended - 8.5 / 10
