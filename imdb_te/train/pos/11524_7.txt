It's a quirky short film, and I agree that I'm doing some kind of acting. <br /> <br /> It is partly about a celebrity guy Las Vegas magician, and partly about his dream of others dreams, and about all the showbiz's travails. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is always the magician of magnificence, and is amazing because he's made his master of Max. <br /> <br /> If you like movies about travel, I think you like it.
