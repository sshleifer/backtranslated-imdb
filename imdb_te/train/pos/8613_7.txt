Charles McDougel's re-launch of 'Sex and the City', 'Desperate Housewives', 'Queen's Fox,' 'Big Love', 'The Big Love', 'The Office' and so on, was his success as Megvoltzer's novel SURRENDER, DOROTHY. <br /> <br /> "Adam's current squeeze shawn (chris pine) , And a pair of bridal couple Madi (Lauren German) and Peter (Josh Hopkins) for their baby son - Hamptons summer vacation, and the band was delighted with the arrival of local ice cream by Adam and Sarah) Mother Natalie in Sweden (Diane Keaton) has an active social life but congratulates mutual mutual interaction with "Dorothy", she is playing elsewhere: when she receives a phone call from Sarah, she immediately comes to the Hamptons to create a clash between her closest personality and grief Sarah friends. Tell them about each of the secrets Natalie's thirst for the truth leads to big changes between the group and the only binding love they have left behind. Has a story. The screenplay has its moments for good lines, but it is a bit heavy and a bit of boring filling that the lines they gave are clearly uncomfortable with the cast. Yes, this story has been repeated several times - the impact of the sudden death on their lives that have been changed by their confidential expressions - but there is real genuine entertainment to make the image move along with the cast and look worth it.
