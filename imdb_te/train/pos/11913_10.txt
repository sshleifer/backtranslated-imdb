This Women's Body Builder & Wonderful Picture For Female Action Fans! I've done a great job at this movie series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and has proved to be a great battle. She has the most spectacular appearance and the likeness of iron to resist the powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). The great value and the fact that Sue Pryce's acting skills are not the best in my life, the film is also amazing, the precious gem of women's body builder action fans! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 were copied by other popular science fiction films, such as Terminator or Predator, but it is not the point. Point A.Puyn is the most talented body builder who cast in that movie and put all of her energy and body talent to show us her best. I really enjoyed that movie and watched the same excitement with Nemesis 3 (rather than a boring sequel) and Nemesis 4 (more than 3 sequels). This is still not shown on DVD :-(
