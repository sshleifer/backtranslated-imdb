I can not decide whether this is one of my favorite films. It's a good thriller and an emotional core but still I can not decide. I definitely liked it. This was Terry Gilliam's first movie I saw. My first impression? I was engaged to the very end and it was not complicated (it would be confusing). <br /> <br /> The movie is set in the future. A man James Cole (Bruce Willis) will be sent from the future to obtain some information from the past (up to 1996). A virus killed 5 billion people. He was sent from the future to get some information about it. Here is also a psychiatrist known as Catherine Railly. Love Story is beautifully portrayed and can be enjoyable in this love and continuous life. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this film is that it is a boring song commentary rather than as other posters of the movie and instead of focusing on this one person and his longing for a normal life. "You want to see the ocean, stay with her" is a particularly sharp line in the film. It focuses on tension and confusion in the mind of the person. So it does not post the apocalyptic picture correctly but instead it is described as a romantic science fiction film, which makes realistic and obscure from time travel. This is what makes the film a special film of 1990. The complex plot flows smoothly without adding too many characters. <br /> The performances are very good. Bruce Willis surprised me here, where he did not appear to be a tough guy but he gave a good performance of a chaotic man in love. His disappointment in some scenes is pretty portrayed. I should check his other movies. The tremendous Madeleine Stove is a great treat to watch. Since I have seen this film, I am very busy with her. She gave a great show of sympathetic woman to her patient and eventually fell in love with him. Even though Brad Pitt played a silly man named Jeffrey Goines, it is astonishing. His Oscar nomination performance was astonishing, because most critics of him had no compassionate words for him. <br /> <br /> The end is memorable and this is another reason to watch the movie. Length or complexity is not a big problem because the film moves very fast and there are enough events to keep people interested. Every event in the film has meaning and no need. <br /> <br /> <br /> The best thriller is 10/10
