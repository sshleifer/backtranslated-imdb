<br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a fantastic film, it is just a human story that increases the relationship between father and father. <br /> The religion is like a small window for the world of Islam. <br /> <br /> An important factor of this story is <br /> <br /> This is how it relates to a young man in relation to his father's beliefs and practices, and how the attitude toward religion will change in microscopic ways when the progress of their journey with him . <br /> <br /> It is a well-built film that I would recommend to anyone with a lot of thought, inspiration, mind and heart.
