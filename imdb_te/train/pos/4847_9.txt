This film is one of those nostalgia matters with me and I do not really expect anyone to "get it" but I'm glad I would recommend it and enjoy it. My father's father, Haythut Arthur Aske, but he is really enjoyable with this film and his steady enthusiasm for transferring the child to "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted" Ommus. "A few years later, I see every now and enjoy the familiar. I'm always surprised but I'm never disappointed, it's a lot to enjoy The whole section of the station is fantastic with what's going to have to keep you, yes, the past period and the British accents, the accents and the plot (based on the original drama of Ardold Ridley of Dad's Army fame!) Excellent character performances - including a katilin harrison The atmosphere is really bad when an Arthur Oscillator is able to get the car.The DVD is treated as cheap as chips in the UK It's a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon light entertainment. /> <br /> Old movies can be good movies!
