I recently rented the animated version of the film Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings The action trilogy directed by Peter Jackson is undoubtedly a true fantasy film genre of the 21st century than George Lucas' Starquay "Prequel" trilogy (episodes 1-3) <br /> < <br /> <br /> Now that I have read books, I understand the whole story. And it is part of the book Two, The Two Towers.The good things are somewhat interesting in action and at some times in animation. The animation is very easy to compare <br /> <br /> Overall, not a bad name, but the 2001 Live Action version was a new feature of Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi scripts took off! Peter Jackson inspired him to read the books, an animated version that inspired him to read books Created one of the great fantasy series kept, so at least for that matter we looked Ralph Thank you! <br /> <br /> The 2001 live action version is far less violent than 1-10, but it's fine now! For fans of books and movie forms of The Lord of the Rings.
