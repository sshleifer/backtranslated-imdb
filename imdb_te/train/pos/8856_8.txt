Before the devil you start with the dead standard, forms a simple hysteria, from different perspectives (in the style of rashoman). At the hourly mark, the Sydney Lumeet changed all of these images far more than that; <br /> When it comes to cold climax, it will eventually become a morphase in many versatile family dramas by exploring the full consequences of human emotions / relationships. <br /> <br /> In the case of Lumet, he is out of the cast of his exceptional performances, without the feeling of high-acting or exaggeration. Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of his best characters, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character, and is often dwarfed by Ethan Hawk, who plays his brother Hank. The hawk is not that bad; In fact he was above enough in a troubled role to fit his style. Marisa Tommy is wonderful for her relatively short appearance (she adds her flesh to her). Albert Finney's character (Andy and Hank's father) is very intriguing, and in my opinion, he deserves a little more screen-time. <br /> <br /> Before the devil you are not a spectacular film, but it is a leading career in Twilight's (obviously) yet on the top of his game at Lumet. His features and trademarks are very visible here, none of which is the use of his characters. A killer script (intended for any pun), smart dialog and pacing, and a good score you must have to see the Dead Nose. Really bad gem. 8/10. 3 stars (from 4). In my 248, you must enter my top 250.
