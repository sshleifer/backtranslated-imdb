I saw German version on German television and I was really surprised. I usually want to see the documentaries, but I can not remember seeing better than 'Earth'. I know some scenes from Youtube videos I found through random browsing. I also showed high definition TVs as I have seen parts of the film in multimedia stores. It is clear to me why the footage is very popular among YouTube users and multimedia retailers. It's incredibly awesome and awesome, help you get on the screen, documentaries or not if you're really interested. <br /> <br /> There are more exciting films without backing 10 to 10 people, but in documentaries, 'Earth' is definitely one of its styles.
