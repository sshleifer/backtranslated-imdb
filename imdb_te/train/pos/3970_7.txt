The film battled Klan members about J.Edgar Hoover on the surface, following Indian killers, attacking Nazis in the US and South, killing famous gangsters in the 1930s, American War 2 and Coming in New York in the early 1950s. Of course in 1959 we were Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., but not all of the worst, his deputy director, Clyde Tolson (like people do not know about Mr. Hoover's invasion for keeping secret files on Bage, honest Americans, if you want to know more about the subject, see). Next to Hoover, Jimmy Stewart's story of a life story in the FBI makes for the film's good, but dated film. Vera Miles as his dedicated wife is also good. But the picture of Jimmy. Hoover has controlled production and confirmed that the FBI has appeared incorrectly, while Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human side, Hoover always looks on his shoulder. Background score is also pleasant. I've read that recent online stories are a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart is one of the greatest films of all time and no one should forget any of his films. I hope that TCM is the last network to show long time and they will show it again.
