This is one of Hollywood's never-ignored gemstones. - A young WWII British Fighter Ace is about to introduce a young American woman radio with brave pilot consolation, knowing that his plane was about to crash, minutes he was dead. For some reason, the dead will find that he will eventually report to heaven when he is running away from destruction. When a sender sends a pilot to ask the pilot to go to heaven, the man denies and demands his "day in court" to argue his case. The man argues that his condition has changed during the last moments of his life, he fell in love and became a man who could live with it. <br /> <br /> "heavenly court" is a cinematic pleasure! "Companion Jury Declaration" is a definite headline. This story is fantastic, like a submerged one and you will be enchanting for about 2 hours of game time. The last scene is just beautiful and most viewers need "Kleenex treatment". This film is in my personal all-time favorite Top 10, which is my highest recommendation!
