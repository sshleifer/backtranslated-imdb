This is one of my best action films of 1970. It has only a great cast but is still loaded with impressive wild shootouts and explosions these days. The story is about a Vietnam vet (Chris Christopherson) and his brother (John-Michael Vincent), helping to clean the criminal element in a small town, and Chris began to improve his position, and the criminals hired him to get rid of. It was great to play against Chris. Bernadette Peters and Victoria Principal both give great support to the women of both male stars. John-Michel shows the role of true actors in the film. I do not think I'm on Vigilant Force Video but it occasionally shows on TV. This is a great movie for those who love movies.
