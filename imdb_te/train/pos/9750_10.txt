Yes, Giorgio, is a good feeling film. A little love, great music, beautiful scenery, comedy, (a great food fight) and Bitsworth's little flavor Yes, Giorgio's ingredients. Any movie buff is enjoying this movie. Anyone who needs heavy special effects should look elsewhere. Many of us now run quite a bit, how good is it than the eyes, ears, and heart feast? Must see!
