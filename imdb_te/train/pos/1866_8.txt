A great story based on a true story about all the problems that a young black man and road passes across. This is Denzel Washington's first movie that he's gonna live, I accept a tad is suspicious, but who's not ..? But again, he is a great actor plenty of years of experience, and the end result turned out to be great. The story is told in a great way, as you are in your childhood, and you are in trouble during the youth. So, if you're going through hell, you're hard noting letting your not only. In all, a teenager is a touching story about trying to make it into this f *** ed up world. (This story relies on Anton Fisher's life, August 3.59, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, is also strongly recommended). 8/10
