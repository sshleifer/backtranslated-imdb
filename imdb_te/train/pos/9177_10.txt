I have to say that these little books are the best commentary of the beloved novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clarke are believable as Rochester and Jane. I saw other versions, but no one did not compare it. It's best for me. Nobody can ever imagine any of these characters anytime. Last time I was in 1984. I'm only 13 years old. At that time, I read the bookworm and Charlotte BrontÃ« novel. I totally enchanted by these miniatures and I remember I did not miss any of the parts. I want to see it again because this is fine. :-)
