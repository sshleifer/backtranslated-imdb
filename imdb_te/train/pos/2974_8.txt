The film looks awesome, you can not wait for the belly laugh to be longer than one minute and much more than the film's premise. Overall, these traditions have the simplest of traditional sculmalt native-boys-good-to-overcome, difficulty genre. Do not let anyone tell you that someone is just trying to laugh through the use of pornography - obviously, there's plenty, but it's not all relevant, not gratitude. I loved this movie and it was the best film I have seen this year, so in terms of entertainment value for money, the DVD cost me only Â£ 2.99.
