This film is perfectly suited to all the romances in the world. John Ritter is never good and is the best line in the film! "Sam" hits, close to home, is very pleasant to watch together. Ben Gazzara is an amazing cast and is easy to fall in love. Somewhere in my travels I met Arthur. All around, pick an evening and pick an amazing choice! :-)
