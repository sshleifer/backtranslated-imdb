This film came 12 years ago, and there is also a revelation in people who know something of the drag sight in New York. Textbooks on drag performance have nothing to do with this conversation houses. Anthony Slide's 'Great Priestenders' did not say anything. Julian Fleischer's "Drag Queens of New York: An Illustrated Field Guide" together with Julian Elting, Minute, Warhol Queens, and the 90s club scene - and the post-pictured - completely neglect houses. Laurence Senelick's "Changing Room" - The closest thing we have with a definite book of drag function is that quickly goes past the movie and does not give background information that one would expect from. <br /> <br /> I understand from the movie that this house system searches for decades and I find various articles on the web. Mainstream film performance "The Queen" before 1990, Crystal La Bijza in 1968. The biggest missing part of "Paris is burning". <br /> <br /> It is valuable because it is ignored if it does not have a viewpoint. It was a worthy snapshot of life in 1989. The unfortunate fact of murdering Venus Extravaganza during the shooting leads to a very dramatic end, but this is not just about transfers of real-life murders. As we know now, Dorian Corey has a mammoth corpse in his liberal room, but it did not come until three years later. <br /> <br /> A documentary film about the historical significance, but more context.
