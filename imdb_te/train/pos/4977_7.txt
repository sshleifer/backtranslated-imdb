Most educational films can only protect the fact that "MST3K" ("Study Industrial Arts" keeps them in mind), rather than the mind-boggling drug. "Hemo the Magnificent" actually works very well. It is blood, heart and circulatory system. I admit that I do not remember everything from it, but it reflects a good work, it's intense but entertaining. I guess I can always count Juny Phaayi (the voice of the most famous Rocky Squirrel, she's playing a deer here). <br /> <br /> "Hemo the Magnificent" is also a good place to look in "gremlins": a class that looks like when the formation of gremlin is.
