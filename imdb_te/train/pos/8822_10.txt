Mystery, Thriller, Musical: A fantastic picture featuring an extraordinary style mix in just eight minutes. In a nutshell, we allowed to tell about the story: A girl comes into a European cafeteria and ... is a soft transit from the nonsense story to the logic of the story. In no time, despite a pleasure in B / W by Vigalondo fabrication and despite the tightest of the budget (thanks) the unity of time-space is due to the intensity of a short poem (almost a haiku) that reaches the picture. The land of quick poetry in Spain, B / W (remember the opening of Bu√±uel?). <br /> <br /> You have to look to encourage our trust in the young cinema outside the states.
