Love is over ... It's all obvious ... Gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous ... Tudor Chirala, Maria Papiestus and Iona Barba, a true dramatic story about love in all shapes, a story about the indecent ways of young hearts, about life and The talent of Tudor Giurgiu has lost all innocence to direct the eye. It's all awesome with an amazing soundtrack featuring Faultline & Chris Martin and Wamma Weeche ... It's really great ... it's really great ... is it a slow but absolutely respect and respect for Romanian cinematography? This wonderful film ... Everyone has two thumbs.
