When I was really interested in movies, at age eleven, I had a big list of 'must see' movies and I would go to the blockbuster and rent two or three days a weekend; Some of them are not for the audience and my mother's nuts come. I will identify one of the films in the list as a "chorus line" and never get it; <br /> In reality, I've lost the list, and I'll do something to see there because there are some really interesting things to see. I mean, take a "no chorus line" and become a theatrical drama film. I see so many of these days, but again it's a little different, obviously; The film is unique. <br /> <br /> Today, musicians have made many movies, the camera gives them free, creating different scenes and taking roles to different places; "Chorus Line" was born in a drama theater and it dies in one place in the film. <br /> <br /> After a large audition by accredited choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Attenborough has run a large number of nurses, trying to get a job. <br /> <br /> Everything happens on the same day: There is a quiet competition between dancers, pressure to have numbers to learn, and it occurs on stage, where Douglas keeps every dancer in the spotlight and speaks about their personal life and their most terrible experiences. <br /> When I recently saw the film "A Prairie Home Companion", a radio program's broadcast, Attenborough deals with the ongoing issue. On stage or back, things are going on, and time does not seem to stop. Again, Adenboro does not see if this shoot is too much cut, but it certainly does not; Whatever it is, it's a great direct and compilation (John Bloom) work. But in that small step, what's you wondering what to do with the camera is that Ronnie Taylor's cinematography finds this, presenting some of the characters up-to-do, displaying the stage from a different perspective and in a momentous moment, Douglas tells the left: "Before we start removing: You are all wonderful people and I am yours Calanukuntunnanu all but I can not. " I think of reality shows today, where there is only one singing or dancing talent and the jury is always going to have the perfect words for some of their competitors (though not good). It's hard, you guess; To tell some of the stories, the characters use songs and take a new life to the stage in a second and it literally becomes a dream come true. Marvin Hamlish and Edward Kleben's lyrics show the feelings of these dancers and created a theater for portraying flawless magazines by Michael Bennett. The book in the theater is also flawless and very small screen by Arnold Schulman; It's touching too many times. If it's not a song, it's a word; <br /> <br /> One of the rehearsal breaks in audition, a special dancer played by Alison Reed, took the stage to persuade Douglas. She can do that. "Honestly and more beautifully in music and literature" Never let me dance for you ".
