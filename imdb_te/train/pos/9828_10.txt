I'm honest with you ... I liked this movie. It is filled with action, original ideas, good acting, a great zombie movie, but also packed with evil zombie effects. Part IV, also known as "Death After". <br /> <br /> The horror movie fans are Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep away Camp, and other Pour Moon Pictures flicks.
