Every great gangster film has less streams of human drama. Do not expect the emotional story of guilt, vengeance and despair from "scarface". This is the story of horrible greed, corruption, and power. <br /> <br /> There is no point in complaining about the "cheesiness" of the film. Surface characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further increases this lifestyle criticism. None of these characters lives at least not at the level of humanity, but what is really important. <br /> <br /> The film is practically a boundary of irony, considering all gangsta rappers promoted to the lifestyle of Toni Montana. <br /> <br /> Brian Deppma is not a strong direct direction, but it is occasionally excellent and good- (especially memorable ending), but it often sinks into tiredness and misleading. Thankfully, it was supported by a very strong work by Oliver Stone (he probably had a good treatment, he takes into consideration the coke habit of the time). As the focus of Thomas Montana's focus, the backgrounds are consistent with the evolution of his character as he has been used with greed and power. Conversation is also amazing, look good between humor and drama. There are many stand-out lines that have entered the popular culture in one form or another. <br /> <br /> The cast can do the same, but this is really a pacific film. One of his previous short miniatures (which is more common nowadays) is a completely different world from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpiko. And yet he can be seen here in the form of a very entertaining (and deliberately over-the-top) form. After watching this film another Tony Montana is hard to imagine, perhaps one of the most memoir shows. Pfeiffer has been dull and uncomfortable on watching the first ever, but I've come to realize how she plays part of a frustrated little wife. Unusual effort, but unjustly wrong. <br /> <br /> The powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and constantly controversial. "Scarface" is one of the eighties's films (whatever happens to you). Emergency and available gangster film, and pop culture milestone. 9/10
