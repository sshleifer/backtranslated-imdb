More than just a "child image", "Holes" points out how the past events still affect us today, whether we know about them or not. When the teenager Stanley Elnets III (Shia LeBoeuf) gets sent to a prison camp where he is forced to long for the day, he discovers a number of things about the camp, and it's his personal connection. By the way, we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize (better understand this when you see the image). LeBoeuf will do a pretty good job, will do the other actress: Sigourney Weaver, John Vaught, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette, and Eartha Kit. An interesting picture.
