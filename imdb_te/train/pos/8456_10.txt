I've seen almost Gundam / Mech Ames, which was shown in the US and has the best story so far. The way it is riveted to the plot turns and turns u. Gundam Wing focuses primarily on politics and war. The series follows a group of five 15-year-old boys who trained pilot to mobile suites for the art called Gundance. Gundle pilots trained to fight the powerful rebellion called Oz. Things begin to heat between OZ and Gundam Pilot, form new political groups and spray the old ones. Older clashes will end and new ones arise. Ground pilots hold peace with the events in their world to get peace, and end all struggles. But how much people are willing to reach their goal. I recommend this anime to anyone looking for an exhibition with a deep story.
