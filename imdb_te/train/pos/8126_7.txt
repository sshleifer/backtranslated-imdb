I must confess some disappointment with this film; I read a lot about how wonderful, yet realistic future sequences, the Age of Science, takes a very small amount of image. The sets and the amazing, and some startling pictures when we get them, but this final sequence does not relate to most other ... <br /> <br /> The piece is a very good drama middle section, and it's all about 'high sense' Nature, and plays strong enough to play, play as a play. This episode has a lot more human life, great Ralph Richardson sings glorious over the top, small dictator, "bass" of reflection. I loved Richardson's habits and Kurt Deliveries, Raymond Massey's Allye, and I broke away the existence of your confident and ideas. <br /> This bass is a fraudulent, fraudulent man who can not comprehend the small-scale nature of his empire ... It's not a great role, and Richardson does a lot. <br /> <br /> Everything was probably England, or at least the Englishman, the representative of England. Interestingly there is absolutely no availability of any religious saga; The 'coming things' battle seems to revolve around the controversy between the barbaric and overwhelming edges, and it seems to be an ultimate goal, but to go on and on. In the last section there is a delayed attempt to increase some of the arguments and tensions, the more personal 'life' and the more dissatisfied. The film did not get much interest in the subtle complexity; It goes everywhere for the prestigious and obscure, blunt moralism. And, of course, recall the hedge-bet final: Raymond Massey Waxing Lyrical about Uncertainty Things! <br /> <br /> I'm thinking about placing a question about this film: It's not true, I thought that no one could find the details in life. They have great ideas; A war in 1940, perhaps imaginable ... about 30 years passed, mind! As a nuclear bomb - a "super gun" or some similar curve - in 2036 ... In the 1970s, in Britain, a technological socialist called "technically independent in technology countries" ... Hmmm, one of those near to sin, chaps! ;-) What real politics is insulted here; All surfaces are a very dignified anti-war. Generally, it is certain - it is boneheaded-luddite-fascist, under the boss, or all hands-to-pump scientific socialism - a contract * and these effects are not infringed ... There is no knowledge of how Nazism and Communism will change in 1936 - Or how they turned out - the absence of observation in this regard is beyond the scope of the filmmakers' attention. <br /> <br /> "The only thing that has come from the '1940s' is that although this section is incredibly beautiful, it is before the Richardson-Massey Parties I love to do more with Margareta Scott Who has the lowest advantage a flashing look is cutting the Mediterranean figure, a mysterious item that is suspicious.If this is a scene that I can not spoil Edward Chapman was a little bit of fun in his two roles, and, first of all, luckily arrogance, praying to war, just undoubtedly by the role of the Masses, is not a tragedy or exploitative or exploited, and her relationship with Bass is not explored, but it was not until 1930, when it was extensive institutional censorship. <br /> <br /> "The Thing As it happened to come "is arguably the most unusual film made in Britain in 1936; To date, one of the few serious British science fiction films! Its set (piece) design and resources control are hungry and excellent. <br /> <br /> However, this script is ultimately more attentive and sometimes, on this location. There is a delicate possibility in the direction, although in the event it increases a beautiful gear or two steps. Cinematographer and Mr Richardson really compromised things though; Creating an astonishing feel at technology, and an engaging, jerkie performance continuously. Such a humiliation is a matter of very little material or realistic movie concept; Powell and Presbyger are the perfect directors to take this kind of work - they are impatient visual storytellers in British directors, great heroes of characters, and dealers like dialogue in the first rate. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Things to Come' is, "It's no surprise.
