I saw this movie as a teenager and found Daniel Rott as Ronnie Witherspoon, a 14-year-old girl in Louisiana, Louisiana, Louisiana, in the 1957 rural Louisiana. She is the sister of his older sister Maureen (now rarely seen by Emily Warfield), and her lack of sense of traditional Baptist breeding. Court Foster (Jason London), the son of a close friend of her mother (Gail Strickland), moves in the next door, Danny experiences her first love, but the court will enjoy her company and willingly. Danny kissing her from her first kiss, but when he sees Maureen, he heads with the Chief Minister for him and leaves it behind. The closest relationship of the sisters will be severely eroded by devastation, which only intensifies when a tragic accident dies. <br /> <br /> Sam Watterson and Tes Harper have been together at the same time, trying to balance the dignity of their daughters. Elvis Presley, The Plotter, and many more wonderful soundtracks provide an excellent way to the atmosphere of the film's simpler time. <br /> <br /> A younger age with a timeless message.
