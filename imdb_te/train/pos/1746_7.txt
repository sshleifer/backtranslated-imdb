Bela Lugoshi gets one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based on a long time radio hit (which is the source of a film that Luagi has played in the villain role). Lugoshi did not have a good dashing figure and its regrets could be a person in command in the best way. Where Chandu returned from the east, they help Natsgi's princess Nudzi, who hunt the mass leaders of Ubuntu, who need to bring back the clergy of the priestly tradition from the dead. This is a good looking globe tracking serial. To be sure, the motion is a bit thicker, with Principals (producing studios) one with one, then having a tearing adventure, but it is still enjoyable. It is much better than the two films that have been cut from it, because "own hey I've missed something", letting the feeling of being missing or feeling its own allows them to run at their own pace. Lugosi is one of the trio of three good serials, others SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
