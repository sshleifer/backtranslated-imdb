Fabulous actors, beautiful scenery, full realism. You do not elaborate all the comments of other representatives because you will get this picture! However, this film is not a minor one. Kill pigs and other livestock for the survival of reality. I am also a resident book of Elnare Randall Stewart. <br /> <br /> I tried to buy a video many years ago and finally bought it for use. From a video store that went out of business. But Yippy! The DVD is now on sale, I bought it on Amazon.com. Not cheap, but for me it is well worth it. The film I will watch until the end of this film!
