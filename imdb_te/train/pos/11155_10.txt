Young, cute, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voit) travels from Texas to New York, where he lives as a student. He quickly learns that he is not going to go there quickly - he goes through an insulting experience after another. At the end of his rope he hooks with erectile dysfunctional, sleazy Rosso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Live together and try to get out of the city and go to Florida. <br /> They are a very dark, disturbing and fascinating image. Director John Schlesinger has painted a very horror film of NYC and its inhabitants. That way it's up - the city may be bad this 1969 but it is cleaned by now. He uses every camera trick in the book - turning black & white; trippy dream sequences; Flash forward; Flash backs (especially involving rape); Shock cuts; Unnatural sound effects ... you name it. <br /> <br /> There is not much story - it focuses primarily on friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an implication that they can be lovers (those shows last shot sort). It is only a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold, brutal, urban forest. <br /> <br /> This was originally chosen by X in 1969 - MPAA parents need to see their children. However, it was a big hit with high schools (then there was no X in 17 years). This is the only X rating film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Hofmann and Voittes have played for Silvia Miles (secretly) in a total (perhaps) 5-minute film. This was eventually reduced to a R (without any cuts) when rebooted in 1980. <br /> <br /> The song is also included in the song "Everybody's Talkin '" - a big hit. <br /> A great image --- but very dark. I'm giving it to 10. Do not watch it on commercial TV - it will be cut ribbons and incomprehensible.
