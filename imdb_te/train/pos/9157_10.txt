Jane Eyre is always my favorite novel! I was ecstatic when I made Deccan in the movie version of the late 90s! This is the best and full version of the book in the movie! This version is too small to sit down, but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is great as Rochester. They were delighted to be a simple looking actress (Jayla Clark) Jane and not a glamorous figure. I love sets and location. Anyone who is a genuine Jane Eyre fan, is the version that it sees !!! I found this version on DVD for those of you interested. I saw the VHS copy almost to break down, so I was surprised to find on DVD.
