When I was a kid I totally liked this movie. I saw it every time. It's not that weird. I have fully identified with characters. I love to see again (and hope to be disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I have really drawn into fantasy world. And for me this picture is loooong. Have I ever watched the series and got them confused? I think the acting is strong. I love Jack Wild. He was a 10-year-old (so dreaming I can still remember the obvious characters I was in the 1970s when I first saw the film, the flute is absolutely believable and I can still feel the 'Witchy Poo' in Witchy Poo in the bad woods - I want to cross her path.
