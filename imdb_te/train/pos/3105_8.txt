Bourne Ultimatum, a third and final excursion for super-spy Jason Bourne, is a man trying to kill the murderer. The Bourne Series is the most recognizable trials by critics (ultimatum is in Metacritic.com 85/100, which means "universal praise") and for good reasons - the fight is well choreographed and the deepest story is very much <br /> <br /> First, the Bourne Identity And the Bourne Supremacy, you want to see two fancy-titled prequals for ultimatum, three wires There may be different movies, but in fact they continue to do everything else: One is missing I'm alone and you're in confusion if you missed the first one you will enjoy the action and fighting scenes of the ultimatum, but the story will certainly cause some confusion. Good luck to see the prequals    ఉంటే, బోర్న్ తన శత్రువులు నిలబెట్టుకోవడాన్ని చూడటం మరియు సుప్రిమసి నుండి అతనిని కొట్టిపెట్టిన వ్యక్తిని ట్రాక్ చేయటం వంటివి బహుశా మీరు చూడవచ్చు.జసన్ బోర్న్ మాట్ చేత బాగా ఆడబడతాడు? డామన్ డామన్ ఒక ఆస్కార్ ఆమోదం, bu ఇక్కడ తన పని దాని సొంత కలిగి తగినంత మంచి ఉంది. Bourne's adventures take place in many cities; Cities are enough to keep movies from all over the world. <br /> <br /> Bourne mainly uses all the techniques that humanity has ever known to track him. <br /> <br /> I was a continuation of the first two movies because I did not upload details on the characters. However, it does not hurt the film to say a few things to audiences - every spectator is not a die-hard movie viewer who can make every little sign of story development. <br /> <br /> Many people agree that Ultimatum may be a film success: the film opened to $ 69 million, and the box office amount is now up to $ 216m - is still very strong for a movie from theaters since August 3 . It is the best action movie ever seen from Live Free or Die Hard. <br /> <br /> Good) Damon is solid but not spectacular, a very smart movie Bad) The story is like many others
