* I recognize where spoilers are! All comments: If you can take a serious film, see it. Have Open Mind and you will enjoy it. Do not leave the theater as you are confused about what's going on! The film will be fine in the second half. I will take my mother to see again when the film is officially opened. <br /> <br /> When we encourage the film, I'm fortunate to see this screening a few weeks ago. He is great - spends a lot of time with the fans. Thank you film Will! About Will's Performance: When you see an image with a really well-known actor for many other movies / exhibitions, you always think about their current performance as you think about them for their past performance. This film is not about Will Smith. I did not portray the Fresh Prince, when I was watching this movie. He is totally and completely convinced of this completely, very serious role. He grew up as an actor. <br /> <br /> About his character: Ben is very controversial and tormented. He is sad ... guilt taste ... very determined, but very scared. He is very truthful. <br /> <br /> About Emilie (Rosario): Rosario made a good job in the role of Emily, taxes. Perhaps she does not shine in the film, but she is very convinced. <br /> <br /> The plot (no spoilers): I admit that I do not like the film until the second half. I'm absolutely not sure about the image I'm going for, and it's either nothing up to the second part. But when things finally fit together, Wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. <br /> This is a very serious picture that really sticks to you. Most of the people in the theater are crying for a long time - old people too. <br /> <br /> ******* Minor Spoilers ***** The plot without giving away the main items is why it's really hard to talk about. I know a lot about this film and really feel ruins. The movie I enjoyed has a lot of marks. <br /> I would mention some of the same here (without trying to get too far away). <br /> <br /> <br /> The fish in his hotel room. At first, it does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> Ben started to hate me at the beginning of the film. By the end of it I love him and hated him. How to persuade Will. I thought Ben was a big joke to Ezra, a blind man trying to make his way out of the world. Why was Ezra treated so clearly visible in the film? But wait for it. Everything in the film: Wait it. <br /> <br /> Bean is a good guy who has made a big mistake that he can not forgive. This is still unclear if he is doing his job because he is trying to escape his own crime or he honestly asks people to help. I thought a little to both ... he wanted to help people but I think he would remove himself from his past. I love his role. You love him and hates him, because he is not amazing what he's doing. He hates what he's doing (a very good person), physically and emotionally hates you. Nice job will.
