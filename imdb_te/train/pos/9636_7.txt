The French boy Mathew (Jeremy Elkoyim) falls in love with summer and falls in love with summer, and he falls in love (the sumptuous stefen ride). Quite frustrating image which is quiet and slow. On the one hand, I realized that it was really for two boys. On the other I'm getting irritated - the film constantly keeps flashing up from past to the present with poem or reason. It is very confusing and pointless. <br /> <br /> There are tons of plot holes - Matthew, at one time, does something that will end up in the hospital. This is what - we never said! Then he breaks up with Cedric and he tells everybody who lives with him. Why? We did not say that. Then he eventually hooks up inexplicably with another person. Why? No explanation. It loves to live in the same town of Sedic Matthew and Matthew ... But it's really tribute to the movie that you care about most characters. <br /> <br /> Elkheim is not good as Matthew. He is tall, beautiful and has a nice body - but he's not working. His idea of ​​acting is sitting around with an empty look on his face - all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is great. He is very beautiful, has a very good body and a hell to the actor. There is also a wonderful sexual magnetism about him. There are so many previous nudity, more kiss and most intuitive romantic scenes in the film - most films are far from showing male-female romantic scenes. <br /> <br /> Previously for rides nude scenes - that is, a frustrating image but looking somewhat valuable. <br /> <br /> You prefer the good naked young people! <br /> <br />
