I saw some sort of "Fever Pitch" by accident; The plane that goes to Europe is playing. It's not really half bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the # 1 Red Sax fan of the world, but his relationships with Lindsay Makes (Drew Barrymore) can be distorted. This film is very interesting on how global events affect people's relationships. This was the end of their 80-odd-year leap sequence, especially eye-opening. I'm going to have all these things at all times and we can not see them. Not too bad. <br /> <br /> Another film that shows an unusual relationship with baseball is the 2000s "Frequency". Check them both.
