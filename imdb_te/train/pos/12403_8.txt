You forgot to think what a fine director from Helsinki would be any good at directing an American horror film (especially within a US prison) - see this to prove your mistake! It's the first major production of Mr Harlin and now - what is now considered a star of a modern DIY company TV announcement (and I'm practically everybody's $ 100m + action films budget unfortunately)! I still think Nordic contribution to the whole film industry is not very much about stellanstartard's screen shows (well overtrained by MrT (s) Bergman) - at least for all female audiences - but this film really shows us a movie in suspense with the right film talent outside of the US and Hollywood There is proof that there is. If you're not a horror puff try and watch this movie, IMO is definitely worth it!
