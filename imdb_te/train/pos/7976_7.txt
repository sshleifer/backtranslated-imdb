The vengeance is the theme of this Denzel Washington thriller, its underlying action, turbulence, murder and grisly bloodshed. Requirements destroy Baghard's exploration and mission, such as his charge, Dakota Fanning, which was kidnapped from school, which was precisely appointed to avoid Washington. Mexico City areas are haphazard, the storyline moves toward its imaginative, violent resolution, and there are plotting routes. With a drinking problem, former CIA operator Washington, a good co-agent from the former co-agent, is in the motion of the plot. He has a great chemistry between Washington and Fanning, and after a troublesome start, the bodyguard and his charge friends are the best. Christopher Walken, Rachel Tikotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Jeanini and Mickey Rourke are the best cast for two stars.
