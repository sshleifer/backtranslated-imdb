Roman Polans has an apartment rented in France that plays Tlellovsky. The previous tenant had been in the hospital after a suicide attempt. He goes there to see her, where he meets Simon's friend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Telkovsky begins to think of the landlord and the neighbors are trying to turn him into Simon, so he will eventually come out of the window. Lee Latataire (The Tenant) since 1976 is the last film of the Polanski Apartment Trilogy. Previous Revolution and Rosemary's Baby. The director did not do a good job as Roman Polans but his performance was also amazing. Isabelle Adani, with her big glasses, is amazing. The landowner, Monsieur Ji is made by Jolie Melvin Douglas. Van Fleet featuring Madame Dezzy. Excellent Shelley Winters Concierge. The Tenant is very scary for a long time. This gives a lot of psychological fears. This film does not make it easy to understand or explain it all makes it lovely.
