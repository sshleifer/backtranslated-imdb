One of the greatest classic comedies. Not a slapstick comedy, but a huge drama. A fun, satirical picture, buyers guided a new home. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant is convinced, filling with great characters and trying to escape him in a dream house. <br /> <br /> A good look at the life of the late 40s. <br /> <br />
