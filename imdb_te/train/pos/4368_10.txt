This is a very exciting and romantic movie. I have seen many times and never bored with it. Everything is realistic and it is good plot. <br /> <br /> I actually like the film Braveheart as Braveheart has many historical faults. There are many exciting scenes - look for bridge scenes and final fencing scenes. It's very good and surprising scenes. <br /> <br /> Music is lovely ... It really matches the movie. The setting is amazing.
