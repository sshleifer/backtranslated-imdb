It is estimated that 68 million people between 2000 and 2020 die before the AIDS. 55 lakh extra deaths are expected in sub-Saharan Africa. Terrible statistics Beyond rarely listening to personal stories. As part of an issue dealing with young people, the film made for French television is moving closer to Leo. Although fictitious, it deals with a very unlikely situation - the diagnosis of HIV on the loving loving-knit family. Leo (Pierre Mignard) of twenty-one year old his parents and two Teenage Brothers, Tristan (Rodolphe explosion) and Pierot (Jeremy Lippon) had AIDS and the family was destroyed. They decide to discontinue information from Marcel (Annie's Lester), 12, because his young man is not concerned, but he speaks and behaves in a wrong way. When Leo goes to Paris for treatment, he takes Marcel with him but the little boy is confronted with Lyon and asks for the truth. Leo says he is ill and says that Marcel is grieving. When he brings Marcel to meet some former gay friends, the tension between them suffers tension on the surface. <br /> <br /> Despite the disadvantage of the scenes in the bed with the physical relationships between the brothers, the amazing performances of Leopard and Mignard with Leort and Mignard are well suited for its help. The events that separated from the young boy's perspective will give me a reminiscent of the film Quebecos film Leolo and Truffaut's The 400 Blows. Unlike some American paintings that dance around the anguish of AIDS, Leo tells the harsh truth that is close to it, but it is tender and amazingly real.
