When I first saw this film in London in 1958, I bowled at first. I have not seen a similar image before. <br /> I have had a strange, hypnotic effect, like the ones I've seen before. <br /> <br /> I believe if Odile Versus & Marina Vlad were sisters and twins. <br /> If it is converted to DVD in radio 2 format - in the original French language, I would like to hear about it.
