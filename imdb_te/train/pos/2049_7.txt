The film is pretty cheesy, but I give credit for trying to give it a few features to the principles. <br /> <br /> There are some great moments in the film and there are some great moments in the conversation. <br /> <br /> Airborne Invasion is perhaps the best part of the film. <br /> I guess I really liked the idea of ​​having a long wait for an experienced veterinarian. It did not do well, but the premise is not all bad. <br /> <br />
