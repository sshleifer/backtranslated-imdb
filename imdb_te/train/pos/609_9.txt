The most enjoyable, most fictional, and fairy tale is the story, Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a young man's story, which is star-alive, young and beautiful. The King left a contest on his first son that a king would die of his king, and the stars wanted to star the trilogy and wanted to save the youth so that he could see who would get a ruby ​​back. The whole plot of the film combined with a good picture, dazzling special effects, and a whole picture of some rigid sentiment and humor. While Stardust was a fun movie and as Claire Danes's favorite Mitchle Pfeiffer (I had seen him strangely for a long time) while playing the terrible witch (I saw her amazing powers), Robert Denario played a nancy-boy air pirate perfectly. Charlie Cox as the main Tristan is friendly and trustworthy and we get some good work from a group of boys out of the sons that are constantly king and who are the kings who are consistently trying to kill each other. Mark Strong, Jason Fleming and Rupert Everett played their roles in both life and death (all of this is also a thread). Peter O'Toole plays the role of the killer Daddy who dies and the funny man plays the role that makes me laugh at me in the short five minutes (nice feet) for the Ricky Gervais. But the real power in the film is Neil Gaiman and his novel from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works.
