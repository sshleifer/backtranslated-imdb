'Holes' is a great image. Disney made the right choice. Every person I talk about it says they liked it. The cast was enough for everyone, and Shia LaBouf really had a future with acting. Cigarani Weaver the Warden is perfect, and I thought about her. I would recommend everybody who did not see it and assured you that it was 'dig it'.
