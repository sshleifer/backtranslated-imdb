I saw 'New York: I Love You' and enjoyed it! I'm really looking forward to seeing 'Paris Paris Ja' and I'm totally impressed with this ... Maybe I want to see 'Paris ja Tam' I do not know again .. I read some reviews about NY: ILY and Yes, the image is not without its flaws. It's clear that when you pay homage to a city like New York - it can be empowered and do not have to do justice to the city ... so what would I do without explaining the film's shortcomings? </ P> <p> Every director's documentary is correctly divided and named 'Paris Unlike the Joy TAM ', NY: ILY is not and here is the most ID reviewers seamless and overlapping stories of the characters, even the annoying and confusing. I thought otherwise. The stories were just about how one after another and I especially liked the overlapping of the characters - it could be gimmicky now because it's very often in movies. I could not find myself forced because I still liked it. <br /> <br /> The idea that all of us are connected is a bad thing, and it also has a peculiar quality - if some wheat got, I'm pretty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> It has been tearing out and I was crying across the next section - it's well acting and exposing in the end - was never used again in the past. I always liked Wright Penn, and now I am a Chris Cooper fan. <br /> When he is standing alone outside the restaurant in the first few seconds of his own, he speaks volumes before he speaks of Carrie's ability, the first time the film meets each other or the one who has recently met, the characters take 4-5 stories Apart from that the characters know each other. It seems to me that the stories are different (but I'm wrong) but they're all trying to go home, and even need to go back, and we know new people and new things for a long time in our lives; <br /> When you meet them and look at them for the first time, see the people around you and the people around you and congratulate them. <br /> <br /> The other films I like are Anthon Yelchin and Olivia Thilbbe with Brett Ratner, Natalie Sheila Locke and John Christie along with Natalie Portman and Tally Giggs, Shekhar Kapoor and John Hurt with Shia LaBeouf and John Hurt and once again in the cafe When Athen Hawk and Atlele with Emiley Ohana. I'll love him so much more by watching Youth Actually! <br /> <br /> Overall, watch this movie with open mind. Do not read reviews before you can see it! It's not about to live up to your expectations of what love and love in New York should be and I suspect any film is really alive until that feeling. Watch this movie for some good music, beautiful visual scenery cinematography, some slice of life comfort and a tug to your heart or both.
