Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and I'm going to see this I was disappointed. Instead I came up with a satirical pain of sarcastic, humor, fullness, and more like the novel of the novel. <br /> This is certainly Nolte's best move to date. <br /> <br /> The defeat and self-conflict of Howard Camel Jr. has been consistently tied to his tears from the delicate conversations behind his eyes. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is fully joyful as George Craft. Sheryl Lee is haunted in her detachment from the comel's young girlfriend's reality. <br /> <br /> <p> Cambell's pinnaeosiosk story is his unexpected tragic villain, trying to be his own ideal hero. We are people. And aside, one of the most deeper romantic movies I have ever come across. Camel is an incarnation of crazy and intelligent love. And in the painful ending of the movies, he eventually gave his true blue boy Fairy God Mother his wish. <br /> <br /> The best films ever made by Mother Knight are in my mind without doubt. It is completely confident of a beautiful poetry story that deeply eats our emotions and its original writer.
