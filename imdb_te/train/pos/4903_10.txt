Inspired at the Covent Garden Opera House at least at the age of 20 years, Ivy Benson & her All Girls Orchestra, a little bit of this, is the film at the end of the Second World War history of an elderly saxophone player attempts to reform the girl's band (almost) with him. Flashbacks that are very short for the original band on the stage provide us some amazing music and help band members fill in the background, and especially for women's relationships with single men - call-up to dodge their transstrain drummer. The drummer, undoubtedly like Elizabeth, and conniving, a woman drummer, among the greatest performances of Ian Holm ("Lord of the Rings" /> <br /> <br> "Cromwell and Fairfax") and Judi Dench. The last Jon Sims Band leader is now perfect as playing the piano on one side of the ocean, and the June Whitfield Salvation Army trambone glows as the player. Other glorious guests such as Cleo Lynne, Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Billy Whitelah make this an unforgettable experience. The movie is a romp down the memory lane, with all the rights, with all the rights, over one of the actresses of over-the-clock actresses. All I can say is, I hope to look good at their age! Especially Leslie Coron at the age of 69 is excellent fox. She certainly still goes to my pulse! When I saw it, I was mentally afraid of casting director without using appropriate age women. Later, I found these girls looked up, and discovered that each one of them was exhibited in London in 1944 (although this might be a bit for a Jedi dench). If you like swing bands, do not miss the film if you want to see how a nostalgia develops, or how a woman can manage to be almost three-quarters of a century behind him. <br /> <br />
