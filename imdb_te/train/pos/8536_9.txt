I recently got a chance to watch "The Waterwater", and I liked it very much. I can not really understand why in the end strip club is actually dancing, and there is no real dancing going on. We are introducing the main characters throughout the film, to a hospital inwolves. The story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you can not get to see movies like that day. I can not say everything in the 80s and 90s is better than today, but I think the cinematic industry is deteriorating and I want to learn from older movies I can learn from 1920-1998.
