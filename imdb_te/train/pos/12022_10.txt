As a genuine fan, when I started bad reviews eight years ago, I could not avoid this film like a plague, but I just finished watching this movie and it was really pleasant surprise. <Br /> If you look for original redirection, you will be overwhelmed with disappointment, but if you're looking for a bit differently and politically, it's a picture for you. <br /> Gregory is now thirty-four years old. She is a teacher in her old comprehensive school and has a sexual dreams about her students with her fellow teacher. <br /> <br /> When a student asks you to be together with Gregory, there are violence, breaking and entering, and all sorts of unexpected turns and turns. For something original, then I would recommend this film very well. When I was released, most people went to see this and I saw what it really was.
