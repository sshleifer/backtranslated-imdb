It's really fun, windy, light-weight romantic jokes. You can not make a mistake with Meg Ryan's beautiful Perkini combined with Albert Einstein's intellect. Generally, I'm now a fan of fictional fantasy stories about real people and I am not able to save myself, but eventually Einstein got himself caught up. <br /> <br / This is the 1950s ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story is the protagonist, Catherine (Meg Ryan), a lovely, young, scattering meteorologist, revolving around Catherine (Meg Ryan), married to James as a behavioral researcher who has children in his future father's brains. Nevertheless, her car breaks down and she has her first love and she meets Ed (Tim Robbins) an auto mechanic. She did not think that Ed was adequate, and her uncle, notably Albert Einstein, played the role of other players, and his close friends, all three ideologic physicists, are helping each other. Uncle Albert is definitely editable, thus portraying him as a physicist ... naturally combined with amusing results. <br /> <br /> Walter Mottau is his typical hilarious self-image and Einstein. It's great to laugh with his three buddies, Kurt, Nathan and Boris. The true Einstein has a real human side and the film takes just one (deadly) step. <br /> <br /> It's not rocket science (though its main character) but it's a wonderful sweet, refreshing movie. Comedy is the best of romantic literature.
