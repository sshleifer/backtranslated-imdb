I recently saw this 1954 film, Vincent Price, for the first time in Turner Classic Movies. The price portrays a wizard / creator Dan Gallico, who runs his murderer when his master steals many magical discoveries (and his wife, a lovely Eva Gourber in a small role). Though Pryce is a murderer, I'm asking him, a sympathetic character motivated by greedy people around him who keeps on doing his best. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> This is a must for fans of Vincent Price.
