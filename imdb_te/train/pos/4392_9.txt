I enjoyed this film very much. Tobey Magyar gives a spectacular performance like Jake. He is one of the best actors I've ever seen. And was surprised that there were too many comic lines throughout the film. He was very good, and I have not released a comic line earlier. The film will get you into the characters and wonder what really matters. I hoped from the performance of Jewel but I think she did well. Lots of spectacular scenes. A completely good ride. I'm a fan of Maggie. See Cider House Rules. One of the best ever.
