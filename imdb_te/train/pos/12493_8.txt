After all the worst of Hollywood (and the Indies) erupted, we eventually get a picture of some horror movements. There are some clich√© moments, but I'm not sure it's possible in days to make it completely original. There is nothing new here ... it works well. <br /> Make sure that the "subtle" fears are coming quickly and frequently. <br /> <br /> The film has a very well written red herring and, unfortunately, played a very poor role. Cherie Christian does not just make effective Julie (wife / mother). For one thing, she is totally unsympathetic. I know, I know ... she just went through a painful experience. But the viewer will never know her as "herself" and the relationship between her and her husband (unfortunately) is uncomfortable. <br /> Last but not least, a thumbsome and satisfying thumbs, the director, I thought, had some sympathy for us. <br /> <br /> It's not a fantastic work, but it's a good, old-fashioned horror movie ... very rare nowadays.
