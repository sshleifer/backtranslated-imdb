<br /> <br /> Hey, hey can not imagine before you go before "chick flick". I think it's one of the better films for the past 20 years, very big & muskulin, macho man. <br /> Acting is amazing and the story is fantastic. This is a wonderful medicine for heart and soul. Acting is not better or the film is a good cast. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter, Jon Plovirte, Dame Edith Evans, Cissy Sposk, Judi Dynch, Mercedes Raul and Mercedes Rowl are very good actresses. And of course Cloris Lechmann (also in this film) in my view could actually have surpassed all of their talents and roles in her roles. Whatever it is Amazing Cast. This movie is like a book you should not wear, and the last page you want more when you join ... and more. I can not get my life to understand why the movie is rated only in the IMDb 3.9. <br /> <br /> The rating here is absolutely amazing for me. Or maybe not. Perhaps in fact I understand it and I'm really sad. This is really the least popular of movies like "Ras Vegas" "sky sexy" and skyrocket "American Beauty" as the ratings of the "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club" ratings at least in viewers' opinion ... R is for "worst". Hey okay, I realized that there are a lot of different stories in this world for different audiences, but it's a sad commentary when watching this lovely, powerful ... extraordinarily, directed, featured and written movie. . <br /> <br /> It is at the Academy Awards. And that's how predictable. My summation is a watch if you want to see a powerful, happy, sad, beautiful story ...... preferably this movie ...
