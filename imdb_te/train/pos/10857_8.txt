Johnny makes one of his best style exercises, making it a strong film with a good Yakuza story. Start a battle within the new Yakuza owner's election organization. <br /> In my opinion, violence is the most intelligent gangs in this case. <br /> <br /> I will move around all the characters of the Yakuza family and see violence, as they see the only way to solve their problems. About, technical aspects, the movie is a good example for a film shooting paced, rythmic and planified way. One of the year's Hong Kong Films. It is like hell affair, but without the action-torture scenes, and the confusing storyline. <br /> (Forgive my English, do Spanish lol better)
