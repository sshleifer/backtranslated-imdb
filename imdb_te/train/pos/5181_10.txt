Sam Raimi's perfect comic timing and performing camp (man), Alan Arkin's camp owner's excellent role, and outstanding cinematography: I enjoyed the whole movie totally, but four things really stand out. <br /> <br /> Dialog and mood feel intuitive and believable. The beautiful golden tones of the external scenes seem like a sunset in the film. Some critics criticized the lack of a "deep" script. For me, it's definitely the lack of that this film will work on. I would care for the characters and their problems and that's what will happen to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is all about mixing up all the parts that are right.
