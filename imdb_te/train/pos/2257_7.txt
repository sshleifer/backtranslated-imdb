Sarafina is a fun movie, and some songs are very good. Sarafina is very entertaining. I usually do not like music things like this, but singing is not as lame as it appears on the box. The film was useful to learn about history, as it was an interesting perspective of the 1931 Chevatore Riots. This is what you have shown in students' perceptions of riots and they show you that they are real characters. If you see them as real characters, they will make them more viewable as audiences and make them more sympathetic to you as a victim of a sympathetic white government. Students' Stripe is correct because we know from the accounts we sing and dance before the violence of students in violent riots. Puppets in the suit are very similar to the clothing shown in the photos from Soweto. They actually made the movie sowet, which was very clear in most episodes. To illustrate this, the film is about to be shot. The history of the audience must have criticisms that describe the color history. As I said before, you are sympathetic to the students - it's less reliable and aimed. Also, it changes some details from other accounts. The confusion in Sarafina turns out when the police come in their classroom and fire at the students. The police and the army were very serious in Sveto, but this was probably an exaggeration event. The police and the army shooted the students, but they did not go to schools and there were no evidence of execution of such individuals. There is a lot of fighting streets and has made exploitation and crime. This is done in the film to make you more forgiving schoolchildren. This film is great. The teacher was arrested for being against the government, and Mum goes to work at the White House house. But there is no information about the government and they have not given any details about the racist policies and laws or any details about it. Jar Jar S, Chris and Finlay
