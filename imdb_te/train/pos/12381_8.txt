A successful model, a young woman, and is also engaged to marry and attempted to commit suicide twice in the past, is chosen by the secret and far-reaching community of Catholics, the next "sentinel" to the gateway to hell, apparently a creepy old passes, but well Maintained Brooklyn apartment building. Its tenants can step up the stairs and rebuild themselves, but as long as a sentinel path is blocked. The previous (John Caradine) is dead, so she, by fate, or whatever, next, and desperately she must avoid her to kill her to kill them. Curious details are below the surface, her relationships with her father, her fiancé and her fiancé, so this is definitely worth looking at these passes, the great cast and the tremendous level of cheap exploitation horror.
