Just came out and it's not a wonderful documentary. Rarely and surprisingly you do not have to walk rarely from a movie theater. The recent hype has become so hilarious that the thrill of appearing in something very unique and unique is rare. When the first time came, Amoreus Peros did this for me and the film is now doing me. I do not know about one thing in this matter and that's what a surprise. If you listen to the feeling that this is one of those cheery movies about the wonderful success surrounded with great music and we're trying to have a great story convincingly telling us but then let's get the feeling not letting us know. Fortunately this is not a movie. People say this story! When we enter their world, every moment of their involvement with them is a good work to capture every moment of their involvement. There is a lot beyond to climb that they will go through so much more time and everything that makes. Touching the void also shows a great deal of trekking and an intensity in an attractive way, but the film is much more in the human story. I have just watched it but it's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.
