The top five of the best John Garfield films are the Marines Pride. This is a true story of Marine Private Al Schmidt, who in his own eyes caught a group of Japan from Guadalcanas during the wounded. <br /> <br /> The story in three episodes, the story of Al Schmid's house, is a hard worker with a woman and a simple worker who does not like anything more than his bowling night. <br /> <br /> The second part is at Guadalcanal and he is captured by Japanese troops and is part of a solitary machine gun nest. <br /> And the third part is to assure him that his painful adjustment to his civic life is not just to pay attention to the people. <br /> <br /> The film is broadcast on John 95's birthday on the birthday of John Garfield and his daughter has a documentary on Guardfield. One of the interviewed figures suggested that Garfield is the most trusted actor in the working class, holding the union card and holding it. <br /> <br /> He is fortunate to have the land with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. In the studio's tradition, he gained the ticketcast in gangster roles, and Garfield was impressed by his background because he came from the kind of All Schmidt, except Garfield's Jewish background. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know what to do, <br /> <br /> This is not a super hero but a guy who thinks he's back in Philadelphia, but he's done a job. <br /> <br /> It's a great part of Garfield, it should not miss a single film, I'm surprised what happened to the real al-Schmid.
