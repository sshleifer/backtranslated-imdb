It's great! For the first time I saw it when I was really young and I was able to watch this time once a week ... Shadow is my favorite character in this movie. The Homeward Bound is really funny and it trains the animals to really do everything. Though parts of the film are sad (such as Sassy, ​​Cat, Waterfall, and Shadow at the end of the Shadow) I have seen the second Homeward Bound but I'm not so good about it. Shadow is one of the smartest, the sassy is well, the sassy, ​​and the possibility is the funny idiot. I would recommend this film to someone who likes humor, or talking to animals. This is one of my top ten favorite movies!
