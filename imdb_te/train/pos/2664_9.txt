Even though Shining is a century old, I challenge anyone who does not get rid of the madman by Jack Nicholson's madness. This is a very rare example, since no one can break it. Instead it was referenced in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of the blood, the red arrow, the silly nonsense "writing" ... do not have anything else to understand all the things in this daily life. This film is simultaneously scary, breathtaking, beautiful, and emotionally hidden. This is the hitchcock's classic mystery and the rage of a modern thriller. And it's not usually the horror movies: a great script.
