It is one of the best animated family films. In addition, all serious opponents for this title come from the same creative mind as the real heart of Miyazaki and his studio Gribli. In particular, other great films include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kiki Delivery Service". Spirited is pretty cool, but it's a bit too creepy for the typical family fare - good for young people and adults. <br /> <br /> One thing that sets me apart from the other pictures of the Miyazaki "Laptha: Castle in the Sky" is that much of the adventure ride ride with tension. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie good? Because it's a complete package: the animation is well done, and the story is really engaging and compelling. <br /> <br /> Many Japanese anime is imaginative, but decisive dark or dull or violent; And animation is often jerky, stylized and juvenile. There are no issues with Castle in the Sky. If there are quite a few exaggerated reforms of real people, it is speculating to shoot, and the characters are well drawn. (Not anybody in the kandakari coat) is very adventurous, but not blood and gore. Animation is composed smooth, instructive and cinematic friend - flat shots are not very much. <br /> <br /> Dabbing is the first act of voice acting in English version, especially the two Leeds, Pazzo (James Van der Beck) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sound engineering is also great. <br /> If you use your studio sound, use it. <br /> <br /> The one thing that I have especially enjoyed is that most of the story behind is absent. Laputa once lived, and is now abandoned. Why? We never know. We know as long as we need to know, and then we need to rest, because the world we have discovered is fully understood. In fact, it is better to say that the world is more fully understood than most of the world's exceptions, many for a single-dimensional stock utensils (e.g., general inconvenient, silly sidekick, cookie old miner, etc.) are highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60
