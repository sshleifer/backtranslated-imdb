A spectacular and sandy war film that focuses on the inner violence of the spectacular sea al-Schmid. Although it is tough and unpleasant, it is ultimately heroic - Schmid's success on disability and despair. War scene is amazing. But pick a bone. How many shots they had. They did not affect any kind of water or dust, as they removed 50 bullets! It damaged originality, but I could live with it. Elinar Parker, a good show as his girlfriend.
