The radio was not 24 hours 7 days when I grew up in the 1930s England, so I had a treat for the kids when I was storing another sensation for batteries and power. Some programs that I heard gave me a great impression in my young mind, and I still remember the 3 "toy town", about all the animals at the zoo, and --- the gray owl, talking about animals he knew, he called his "brothers". It's just recently that I realize that Gray Owl is not the real "Indian", but the Suex chief paid tribute to me "the greatest." We are all dreams of becoming the world's changing and Archie Gray Owl Bellane. A new Gray Ouvl can influence global leaders to clean the environment.
