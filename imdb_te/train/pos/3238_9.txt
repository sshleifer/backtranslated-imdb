The Finnish version of Robert Altman's "Short Cuts", set in the small rural town of Äänekoski. Episodes are eternal events, the problems of human life and the celedoscope of emotions: happiness and love, fraud and illusions, depression and death. I am especially impressed with the two episodes. The story of the young waitress originally tries to shake a love for his colleagues: she exceeds the great joy of love and life. Other episodic deaths in the hospital and the elderly, his wife tries to help him dignity with him. What's particularly surprising is that the old couple fight against the disgraceful procedures of the hospital and their loneliness contradicts the "routines" of the hospital staff (even if it occasionally corresponds). Compared to Altman's classics, the film is probably less professional, but it is definitely a great piece of art.
