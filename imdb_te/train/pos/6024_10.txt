When I first released it I saw the ZP and it was a major disappointment. Its script was forced and tilt and looked very fake '60s. This is a lot of politics and ridiculous. And let's face it, I'm still under the love-spell known as BLOWUP: I'm still not completely shaken by it. Now "love" is born with all kinds of nostalgia, which has grown well. . . <br /> <br /> But the time and time to zip and time zip is a teacher for me. I will recall this movie about ten years and it is good and good at age. And ZP is owned by it's own "experience" and it is really linked to by its creator, the late Mr. Antonioni. Twelve years ago, I saw a good natural luck that was printed in its correct size (enormous), which was revived by an Italian Government Cultural Organization, which they see artistic work well, Learn the importance. Today, I remember the gap from the audience when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. This is a thousand volt visual shock antagonistic deliberately a new level of awareness delivered to wake us up. <br /> <br /> "It's a surprise that this movie is coming into its own. <br /> <br /> When I saw the second time --- in the early 80s --- I felt totally towards the movie and especially towards Daria and Mark. Before these two, they appeared as a smart-alike shadow form of Jeffrey's Olivia and Leonard (read by Romeo and Juliet), now engaged in me --- She was a quiet slow-motion-elite girl-she took her time ... to live. <br /> <br /> The reality of the day started to separate my newly discovered "experience". <br /> <br /> I replied "80s" with "uh-huh" and my "love" secretly, spiritually, secretly <br /> <br /> But, and, if you want to have its way and want to "love it": secretly, envy, and possessively. <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies is the ZP in its March series Decided to show up. Undoubtedly, ZP can be seen on a larger screen, so this can really take you to its structured environment. <br /> <br /> The reality hit today, ZP is secretly withdrawn and replaced by whiney pranks of Alice's restaurant, hey, sometimes a glimpse of the loved ones in a newspaper photo. <br /> "It's very good", too "disturbing", too "what"? <br /> <br /> Like all good arts, it lives in everything that lives around it. <br /> <br />
