My gosh ... Give me a minute to breathe. The film takes you on a fantastic ride and does not let your face go until the end of the final blow. This is a movie for fans of Stormriders and such. The Legend of Zu has been created beautifully, although I do not like some things, they used stand-ins. I'd like to see the real guy fight but, oh well ... let me down some little, and I do not really like it until I see it again, when you understand it kicks it completely A **! I encourage anyone who wants to see a real Asian film to see this movie. I will give one of my best ratings for this movie.
