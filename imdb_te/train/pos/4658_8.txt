Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - Together - a funny, intriguing comedy starring Carl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart in "Hot Millions" - just two of the most striking actors anywhere - talk about a dream cast. Ustinov is a former con embezzler who receives a resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in an organization through Malden - aimed at kidnapping in mind. It's not soft sailing; New York and his neighbors Maggie Smith (who knew his name at their residence) attracted the attention of his competitor, shortly after becoming his secretary. She did not carry on her work and she appeared across a variety of jobs throughout the film - all of them were deleted. When Newhart advances to her, Ustinov invites her to cut an envelope to her flat, but both of them decide to immediately follow each other. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie - it can not help you, but you can not love Ustinov and Smith and be attracted by Ustinov's machinations, his genius, and he gets into trouble. But there is a twist end to show you who are really in the brain. Do not miss this movie set in '60s London. It is worth only if Maggie Smith whine, "I've sacked."
