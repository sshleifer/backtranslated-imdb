I was worried that my daughter could get the wrong idea. I think the character of "Dark-Heart" is on the rough side and I do not want him to change the look of an "average" frog, fox, boy? I'm wrong, this movie is made for my kid, not me. When it goes up my head (under ??) she "gets it". Of course I do not "get it". This is not one of the new children's films that adults will enjoy. This is right for young people, and the team knows what they are doing. There is no political jet fuel. We do not have any magic key to save ourselves from the world, no one has the right to access, and everyone is not happy all the time. And one side benefit, no one dives! ?? russwill.
