If you look at this movie, you will see an extensive video-clip of popular music. But you will find more. Incredible FX, great music and a good time to enjoy with your kids. If you compare this picture, there is a Pop Extravaganza that you remember. Clip Off "Man in the Mirror", "Leave Me Alone", "Smoot Criminal" and Beatles "Come Together".
