In Carmen, Saro once again attempts to establish between the original wishes of people in a dance company who are preparing for choreography for writing choreography for parts of opera carmen from a dynamic understanding fictional Carmen's story between reality and fiction, famous fatal mix of free spirit (read disclaim for reputation) and Wanting mad man Her ability to govern. Solar used the same motor fiction / reality in this early black-and-white movie, Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). But the spirit that inspired the bloody stepmother to do with the soldiers and the legendary Carmen during the rehearsals would never come to be believable if tensions between the dancers conducting blood-wedding dancers showed they benefited from the fictional characters of the story they need to do by their emotions, directed by the parallel carmen between the dancers of the dancers. It remains a gadget and that is the awkward distraction. Need to look at the Blood Wedding next to Carmen to truly appreciate a comparison. However, it hardly regards the rehearsals_ flamenco dance and guitar music price, some 95by% of the best flamenco dancers and music artists who know, contents, trying to impose on his carmen in play Saro. A flawed image, and a miracle: Sure, perhaps for drilling in the Keats 'negative capacity'?
