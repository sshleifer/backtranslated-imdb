Meen enthusiastically, ugly, nasty retro action thriller to find out (and destroy!), A bodyguard who is determined to find the killer of the girl he is supposed to protect. The movie is politically correct in this movie. Director Scott does not have any desire to apologize for immorality inherent in dramatic construction of the film. Scott did not care for 30 years of social awareness or social progress. I do not think I'll ever see a more violent film anymore, so you can go and see this. Despite its relentless illusion, the film is a great example of the most enormous, exploitative and influential films of the film. Scott is a tough thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of the film are very effective to ignore me. Scott's directing options are just a surprise, and he is pulling a great deal from Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls need to stay away from this, but I recommend it to viewers looking for a great, action-filled movie.
