This film appeared when my wife and I came in 1978. This is a revelation to us. We were married and we thought we were the only homosexual couple with children. In fact we are wrong. Love does not expect you and it can come from not wanting it. <br /> <br /> We have never changed our sexual orientation. <br /> When we were young, both had affairs, but not always from the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> This story is not too far away. Nonetheless, it is unreal for me that they are heterosexual. My wife and I have been sleeping together for the past 40 years. We're still gay. End of the story.
