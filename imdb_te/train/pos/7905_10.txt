I'm very sorry to have notes with a pod and pencil to keep track of the errors and how bad the movie is. I feel that I can not go back to the movie and can not suspend reality and / or enjoy 90 minutes from their boring or busy lives. Get a GRIP people. ECGTB is a very entertaining film. If you take pictures seriously, this is not for you. If you feel that the movie is reflected in any way, it's not for you. But if you enjoy the full of queen of the desert Priscilla, or Moulin Rouge's "I see hell". Or the gross out comedy of "The Sweetest Thing", then allow you to escape to the cowards. It has some really funny episodes. Really happy. It has a very good music; Kudos to kd.lang And Uma Thurman's 90 minutes I said ... I said more?
