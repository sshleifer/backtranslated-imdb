Yes it may be goofy and may not be as funny as most high-budget fiction films, but really looking at it is really fun. Tim Meadows always faced me to be funny in the Saturday Night Live program. I'll laugh when he makes this role in the show. After watching, I'm going to play at night in this Comedy Central and I have decided to check it out. I am impressed with this Oscar in all films because it will win any Oscars or comedy of the year, but it attracted fans of Saturday Night Live, who liked the role of Ladies Man. The film is packed with some of the most exciting lines that can be read in years to come.
