I felt Rachel York was excellent "Lucy." I also saw her in "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Victor / Victoria", and each of these shows has developed a very different and very real character. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by how many negative reviews came about Rachel's performance in "Lucy". Some painful TV and entertainment critics have lost the role of her character. Many people have focused on the fact that Rachel does not really look like Lucie. My response was, "So what?" I'm looking for Lucy's surface hypocrisy. I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown. And Rachel certainly gave us great deeper. I also do not want to see anyone just doing classic Lucy routines. So I have been very happy with the producers and the director's decision, recognizing Rachel Lucy's characters in this reality - Vitamate and Candy Factory. (Some critics have not realized that these two scenes are not rehearsal scenes and real skits). This approach, I thought, gave us an innovative twist for sketches that many of us knew by heart. I also felt that Rachel was scary and funny in this scene. And she's hanging up the restored routines - Professor and Grape Stamping, in particular. There is a moment in the grape scene with a definite short loom that contains Lucy in Rachel's mouth corner. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised if many of those who criticize this performance want to see Lucille Ball of "I Love Lucy". The whole movie. After all, she had no idea what she really was in the years of her early film with Lucy who got to know her only by TV. I think natural progress in Rachel's role. She has planted all the right seeds to see the clown who looks forward to the values ​​given the right set for the situation. Lucy does not fit the mold of the old studio system. <br /> <br /> She proved to be her ultimate prizes in her boring efforts to become a stereotypical film actress of the era. <br /> <br /> I am sure Rachel is a complex American icon of comedy, drama, intellect, romance, love, ambition, loyalty, sexuality, self-absorption, kid and stoicism. And she made a authenticity and freshness that she was absolutely lovely. "Lucy" a star turn for Rachel York. I hope it will bring a flood of great characters in the future. I hope to bring Emmy to her.
