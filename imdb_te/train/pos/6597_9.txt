We always watch American films with their special tunes for each region (south, west, and so forth). We have the same here. <br /> <br /> The United States and Europe are dominated by the cinematographic industry. <br /> The film tells us about a parallel world, even those who live in a big city like SÃ£o Paulo. All actors are improving and they are very real. The camera brings us their confusion around the world, the loneliness of each character and the invitation to share their world. <br /> It's a real great movie and renting at home.
