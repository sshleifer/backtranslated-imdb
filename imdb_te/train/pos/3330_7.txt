I did not only play an extra role in the film, but I had to watch a movie in Boston. A thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelli fans have seen a funny move at the Boston Common that they are joking ... about them .... Red Sox Frantics! This beautiful comedy about Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon star love and lust. Love is between two young lovers. Lust for winning the Rust Saxes World Series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. He's funny and laughing too much. Barrymore on the other hand is the same old Barrymore. Sometimes, I thought actress Ion Sky was a good actor in the supporting role. All in all, all Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie. It's just a funny movie to the rest of the world.
