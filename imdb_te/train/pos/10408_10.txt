When I was a little boy I first saw this movie and fell in love at once. Sets are breathing and some are unfortunate fun in the script: "You are sons of a thousand pieces". <br /> <br /> It's about 3pm already late at night or on TV I really woke up and it just started. TV companies need to show some respect. Everyday will get a chance to find out this good work. <br /> <br />
