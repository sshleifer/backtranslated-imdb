This is one of the 80s movies! It sticks out like a "turd in the punchbowl" !! I can not believe that Mad Magazine denied it or not. And yet, they proudly place their name as "Stuart", "no Chinese Chinese lady who speaks" and "performing on UPS person on speed". What's with it And, I love Ron Leibman-he's Foxy !! Wonder why his name was removed from credits? This is his ridiculous character I know. In fact, he is not nearly as foxy as in Norma Roy. But, in my opinion, this film is right there with the vacation of the National Lampoon. If you like movies such as Porkis, Fast Times, Last American Virgin or other 80s teen-film films, you will like it! Rent it and you'll see my point !!
