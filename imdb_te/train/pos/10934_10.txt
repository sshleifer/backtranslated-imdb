After reviewing these fierce martial arts images for the first time in almost 18 years, I have not lost any damage to its youth or that I have lost nothing of the popping martial arts to the eye that I remember from my youth. A dead martial arts coach sent his "complete" pupil to find the last 5 members of his Poison Klan, so they did not find the luck of the owner's friend. <br /> <br /> Fearing that his final students do not have enough training, one of the five "wenak" friends gives him friendship. Defeat the other four. <br /> I'm about choreography or camera work. The best of the best martial arts movies and the best of it. A classy!
