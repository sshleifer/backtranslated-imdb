The show opened with great mystery episodes. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. Subsequently, the show began to play shorts with Shoggi, Scooby Doo and scrap duo. <br /> <br /> Hannah Berbera productions had to shift the 20-minute episodes into smaller episodes. Some voice actors are not available. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who plays Fred) is not available. <br /> <br /> I think that the voice of Velma will change after the first 12 episodes since the first voice actress is not available for Wellcha. <br /> <br /> The network is a hamburger studio Shaggy, Scooby Doo, Scrappy Doo, because ratings are high. So they had to do more shorts. I am a mystery like the 15 episodes. And this is a good show.
