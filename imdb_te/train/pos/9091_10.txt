A wonderful picture. You want everything in a picture. Heavy battle scenes and other actions. Suspense, and a romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Like an old SwissBuckler movie. Completely entertaining from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The story is like a classic story of embarrassment in the royal palace. The actors are beautiful and the sets are fantastic. The costume is fantastic and the imagination of the stunt is imaginative. Special effects are excellent. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is an actor and really impressed by a great deal. He will definitely wager for superstorm. <br /> <br /> <br /> John Rice-Davis is fantastic as he usually seems. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Xish Thailand is also famous for being a voice of English for the brilliant progression and is wonderful for a wonderful woman. <br /> <br /> The film has won many awards, and I know why I can watch it <br /> <br /> All of this is a wonderful independent movie. Look at it perfectly. <br /> <br /> And give it a ton +
