"Odd Couple" is one of those films that crosses its reputation. People all know, they're theme song, they complain that they live with a sloppy "Oscar" or a fastidious "Felix" ... but they're under the unwitting movie. It's not just a nice guy who lives with a sloppy; This is a portrait that will help two friends through the divorce. It's also fierce funny from start to finish, but it's kind of comedy arising from realistic, stressful, and just plain terrifying situations. So, some viewers have found the film a bit bit uncomfortable, but I think its a versatileight is its strength. Moreover, the face of Mutt's Bull Dog face breaks me! My favorite comedy, by a country mile.
