Audrey TouTT after many films that appear to have no idea that Amelie does not understand the role - it's not actually a personality in Audrey Tatou's real life, so she is not part of each of the films Amelie Part 2, Part 3, etc. <br /> <br /> Because of the play I also got this movie. Yes, this is true, there was a big gap when I could not see for 45 minutes after the first scene, but I had so much fun with the other characters because I did not even lose her. Person who is about everything is very funny, running out of his cafe and skipping in the bill by finding coupons, such as the person who justifies the person who loses and loses .... in fact the character of Audrey Tautou Irene Amely is not overdone sugar girl. In fact, like Irene, her tenderness to the bandh was to attract me to the guard at first. In this movie, Irene is a girl with good intentions, but during a (very terrible) day, her trend becomes more sour and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining, great scenery and shots to see all this really interesting stories and plot building, which makes this film absolutely awesome, is very colorful and never too slow, and all of the characters actually work. The best part of the film is coming in about 20 minutes ... It all starts with the mesh and the ride really shakes up and everything is absorbed and makes sense, and the whole butterfly effect blossoms. I swear, I thought it was the best 20 minute film I had ever seen, and it ended ... I thought, "I'm really scared of finding this movie." The movie ends with the top line. The one who wrote this script is good because not only these other subdivisions, but in some way tie them all together (and this is the right method in this case) but the feel of each character. The whole butterfly effect is not just a short time as a coach to build. No mood, no company or alone.
