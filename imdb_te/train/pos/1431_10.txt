This is the most spectacular picture you can ever see. I thought it was another documentary, but it really was something. It does not try to teach you, it shows you how it works in nature. <br /> <br /> I do not talk about the quality of the pictures, because you will get to know from other comments without knowing it. <br /> <br /> The land is funny, tense and sad. It can make you laugh, you can cry. Sometimes both at the same time. Sorry for animals, but it's the first film I've ever had, since our planet is so vulnerable, what we've been blessed with disappointment, and we're not congratulating a bit. /> <br /> This image must be shown in schools. It's a fantastic picture you'll ever see, so go and see. <br /> <br /> 10/10, but if possible I would rate it more easily.
