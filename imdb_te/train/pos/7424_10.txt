I first watched the film at the age of 16 and this is always a huge fan of mine. In fact, you can not refuse Christopher's appeal in the film - how many people are? Sheesh. He is still. He is the evil boy who every girl wants to secretly. His acting is flawless. He drunk / druggie only played the only way anyone had gone through it - and he - '76 he finally got on the wagon, so it was all real <br /> <br /> Music was nice and in the following years I was right to him in the sense of Strysty's physiological beauty I think that is not a person, I think it's more of a problem for male audiences than men. The gals for us are just watching Chris - and naturally boys are looking for female interest - my husband can not see the movie's b / c - he does not like his looks. But I eventually sat on the road just by the red Ferrari scene, how well it worked - the camera work was very complete and you had a full blast with him in the car - you were my 50 "plasma - wow !!!" Finally, the transition quality was clearly visible with great color and very low sound, except for the darkest and most common dark areas for all the films GREAT - anarphic widescreen. <br /> <br /> "I tried to sit in the original with Judi Garland, but I I'm looking forward to seeing this picture first, I can not come back to the earlier age. '' All the concert footage of the 76 version is where I live. <br /> <br /> I work on my way through Streisand commentary, but she About the scenes in the picture Chris, or even specify the details. <br /> <br /> You want me at the same age (born in 1960), if the love of it.
