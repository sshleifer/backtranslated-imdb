The style of the film is not a poor and original, but it's very good. In fact, it appeared to be the best film on its best day, nominated for the first Best Picture Oscar (Lost by Wings). I still thought Wings was a high-profile movie, but it was pretty good even though it was defeated by Emil Junings by Emil Junnings. <br /> <br /> Jannings made a few bucks in the 1920s as an ordinary man from Jizarist Russia living in his last days. His luck changed when he received a casting call to play in an Imperial Russian general fight against the Communists during the Revolution. Obviously this does not have much story acting-wise, but it also feels like an old man thinking about the old days and the revolution. <br /> What exactly do I do, it's a beautiful picture - especially in the end. By the way, see William Powell as director of Russia. Though made in 1928, he does not appear to be much younger than he did in his next films.
