The film is a very cult film on metal. Ancestors: A Kid gets his favorite artist Sammy Curry's final recording to die in a hotel fire recently. He turned it back and called him dead, and he suddenly retaliated with a heavy metal name on b ** watches. Any fan of true metal enjoys this movie and if you have a metal head with jacks, keep Sammy off the back of the album ......... Do not wait he's fictitious, well this film and your fist in the air, your head snoring, and Watch with the watch at the volume 11!
