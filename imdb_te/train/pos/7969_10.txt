Homewood bound is a beautiful picture. The feeling that Shadow ruins the part ... I was tired, I was only six years old, I cried! It takes me a lot to cry! Dogs and cat are awesome training. <br /> <br /> A good family image to hate all the good people or animals, though not like me. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is good, 10/10!
