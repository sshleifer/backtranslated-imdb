"Malipcha" horror film is an example of how well-executed plot and more effective than heart. Its cast is not recognized by names, it does not have a big budget and is not exactly in visual effects aspect; But the brilliant and well-written script, the effective cast and director's vision replaced all of those focused more on telling the story than delivering cheap thrills. Eric Vale may not yet be well known, but with "Mulfek", his feature length was first proved to be at the level of contemporaries such as Janeet, Guns or Aja. <br /> <br /> The story of four inmates in a cell are different men with different backgrounds but one goal: Out. Carrey (Gerard Larrock) was convicted of multi-millionaire cheating; His cell-colleagues, violent Marcus (Clovis Cornilac), intellectual LaSalle (Philip Ladenback) and mentally faced Pacarette (Dimitri Rataut), have been killed and Carrell welcome a cold welcome. <br /> <br /> "Malfekwick" by Alexander Charlow and Frank Magnier is a great blend of dark fantasy and horror. Clive Barker has a lot of memories of the stories. The strong point of the film is to enhance the characters, they are very complicated and have different personalities and tension and suspense come from their constant clashes. The supernatural aspect of the story is very well maintained, and overall the film gives the feeling of reading the Gothic novel. <br /> <br /> Despite the film about four people locked in a room, the movie is never boring or tiresome, and in fact, the loneliness of the group increases the distress of claustrophobia and, specifically, the mental disorder. <br /> <br /> Director Eric Weat is a great way to calm the atmosphere, mood and his casting platform. Although the budget is not clear, he made a wonderful, fresh and very attractive concept. His subtle and efficient camera-work helps to make the dynamic image in spite of its single space, and the film has been amazing to create a slower film alone and create a huge atmosphere of distrust. Special effects Very few performances are well-made and valuable, but some of the gore's spectacular scenes are limited to quality. <br /> <br /> The characters act as the film, and the cast is definitely worth a credit. Gerard Larochee did not see the first person named Career as innocent, but hidden in the dark past. Philip Laudenbach and Dimitry Ratatou were very effective, especially Rottwood in his demanding role. However, Clovis Cornilac stole the performance as Marcus, the violent and distorted person who wants himself only deep inside. The characters have grown tremendously and actors make many of them. <br /> <br /> This image is wonderful, but it does not have any errors. However, one of the most ruthless is its low budget. Some CGI-effects are slightly lower compared to efficient makeup and prosthetics used in some scenes, however, it is not too bad. Perhaps the worst thing about "Malfek" is that it loses some vapor in the end, which focuses on supernatural black magic rather than roles, but not too bad, but weak from the end <br /> <br /> "Malfik" is recently One of the greatest horror films from France, is more deserving to be recognized. Valette is definitely a talent to follow as proof of his abilities in this modest (but complicated) story of the supernatural. Individually, this film is a new favorite. 8/10
