Okay, do you ask a 2 1/2 star movie? ... see this and it makes more sense .. Hitchcock sequences are not better together ... You can not sometimes get a bad feeling when you're doing anything from the beginning of the film without any errors and the characters you're trying to develop in movies. You know that the characters are unusual about themselves and they do not despair whenever they do. Surrealist / producer Phil Hay's surreal story of life, combines with a completely amazing soundtrack will make you think about 6 degrees separating life more than the image by the same title ... I'm looking for more good things from this producer.
