Hello Playmates. I have recently seen this movie and this is my first experience to Arthur Oske, which I have to admit is impressive in the film. The film is usually a passport for black and white films, passimco, lavender hill mob and tommy trinter (apparently a distant relative), appealing for a good old British-style comedy. I have seen some of the critics who criticized Oscar's criticism here, though in my opinion it stops testing as the best example of forty comic acting, and whatever it seems is that the simplicity is still dominating movies. If you can capture this film, I would recommend it to catch that, Not shown on Sunday afternoons. I also enjoyed a chance to see another piece by Arnold Ridley (Dad's Army's Private Godfrey)
