I have never seen a lot of movies in my life, but I choose what I like, I will choose spur Madness, a clearer reference to many films like Star Trooper (etc.), and Wits of Steel, Jason Steel unveiled the art of converting a simple picture into the painting, Frey to get the world in which Spatulus lives An-by-frame animation put together. The story begins in the middle, how is the director happy? It was originally in the middle, and when I first saw it, I looked like a shorter look, but Jason, like me, loves Loves, so it took a lot of details. If I do not recommend children or I do not like the likes of me, look up the net (to see its small image, the cow's cow), its style reminds me of the South Park, but less violent. For 10 look, 6 smiles, and 6 for the story, 10/10, it comes to good work <br /> <br /> Jason Steel, I'm anxious to watch the movie.
