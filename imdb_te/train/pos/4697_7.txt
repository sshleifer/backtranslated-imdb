Michael Keaton is the "Johnny Dangerous" in the take-off of gangster films made in 1984. Maureen Stapleton is his unhealthy mother, Griffin Dunne, his DA brother, Peter Boyle, and his friend Marley Henner. Other actors include Danny Davita and Joe Piscopa. Keaton pretends to be the owner of a pet shop in the 1930s, who stole a puppy and then tells him in a flashback to own his pet store. He began to work for a mob boss (Boil) to sneak into his mother to get a pancreas operation ($ 49.95, special this week). <br /> <br /> There are some happy scenes in the film, where Johnny's foul-pumpkin pills are strapped to riots. Peter Boyle was much more fun as Johnny's owner, as Griffin Dunne, a straight-line DA, who was unable to "play" the ball with a curved bar (Danny de Vito). Jonny's enemy, Joe Piscopo is great. Richard Dimitri Moroni is an English language torturer but you have to listen to him for reading about it. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie comes a little tired, but it is very valuable, and Keaton is superb as a good boy / bad boy Johnny. For some reason, when the film was released and Keaton's other gem, like "Night Shift", you can not hear much about it today. Some gigs and scenes with real gems, you'll get a lot more enjoyable with "Johnny Dangerous".
