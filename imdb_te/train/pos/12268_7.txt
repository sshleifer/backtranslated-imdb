Seven young men went to all of them and was a foolish venture of evil. "The Zero Boys" is going to the wild looking for a bear.Soon that has been murdered is pretty entertaining Mexican slasher that reminds me a lot of "Trampa to hell" .The film is fast and there is so good if you are a fan of slasher movies Grand Guignol fans are disappointed.However, Die as throat as the throat or neck.Unfortunately these scenes are axes to give this a rarity Ksikan horror flicks (I only saw "Alucarda" and "do not panic") are unclear, so this should be another reason to enjoy the slasher.My rating: 7 10.Highly out recommended.
