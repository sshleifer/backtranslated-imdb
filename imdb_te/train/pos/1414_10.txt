First of all, the release date 2009, not 2007 for this feature length nature documentary film. It is correctly referred to as: "Earth, 2009". Second, allow me to solve some critically accusing complaints of 2006's "Planet Earth" TV series. <br /> I do not see this TV series, this is the lengthy version of the 2006 TV series. I can not judge any movie on its own profits and its origin. I will make a decision on their results, and the results of "Earth, 2009" are really fantastic. I have rejected this minor complaint by some critics: this is an extended version of the 2006 TV series "Planet Earth". What is that? <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the fact that I had been watching dozens of my life scenes in nature, and I was impressed by "Earth, 2009". It was the first film from Disney's new "Disney Ensemble" division and Walt Disney's guidance and Academy Award in the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, movie editing, music score, sound and narrative are all excellent. There are also some other nature documentaries in these categories. What really sets "Earth, 2009" is its' scope. It covers the whole planet with seven continents. <br /> <br /> When I first watched, the documentary film was a huge effort and needed to create time and talent. <br /> <br /> "The land, 2009" should be made of three manufacturing companies. <br /> <br /> The film has two special new high-tech cameras: a camera with a 360 degree computer controlled motor for a camera and a spectacular 1,000 frames for another second HD camera . This filming technique really adds drama and beauty to the scenes of "Earth, 2009", especially the leopard hunt and the great white tunnels that jump from the water to capture the lions in the ocean, and the air view of the world's highest waterfall. In this documentary there are many amazing shots. <br /> <br /> There are dramas, sadness, humor and great beauty in this documentary by cinematography, music score and narrative. With the great music score by world renowned Berliner Philharmoniker, excellent creative and technological cinematography and commentary by James Earl Jones, I thought of "Earth, 2009" as the longest documentary film ever made. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication are really well paid here. This film is required to be viewed in all schools around the world. I am an Academy Award for best documentary feature among other awards. Really, an amazing, exciting, delightful and exciting documentary film. <br /> Very recommend
