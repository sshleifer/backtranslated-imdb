This film made me very surprised. I do not have too much expectations for it but I'm wrong. Mary & Rhoda is very funny and well written. They did not spend much time in the past to reconstruct, so they do not rely on the success of the old TV program to continue the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> My girlfriend commented this was a weekly sitcom, I think I would agree with her.
