I recently searched for the newly released Widescreen DVD of FLY AWAY HOME and I have never heard: Gray Oval. It drew my attention to being a Richard Attenborough Film (he was responsible for good films like Gandhi, Chaplin, and Shadowlands). Screenplay by William Nicholson (author of Shadowlands) This "Special Edition" was finished with interesting sounding material and the price was only $ 10.00 - so I chan it and bought it. Wow! What a beautiful image. Pierce Brosnan was cast as Archie Gray Owl, which rode in real life in the 1930s, to love and honor Canada's wild lands. Especially Bower - Brosnan, particularly in the James Bond movie, gives a warm, powerful performance. A fine score by George Fenton (The Crucible) and beautiful photography by Roger Pratt is great for the film effectiveness. And there are some extras in this DVD! There were two shorts made by Atenboro and Producer Jake Ebert's real gray owl in the 1930s as well as audio commentary tracks; 2 features; And many other additional extra plus options that can access the PC with DVD-ROM features. GRAY OWL was released live on DVD in the United States-the fact that Richard Attenborough attributed to Hollywood's lack of interest in Hollywood's violence and romance. This information is not only about informing and not getting used to, but when you think about it you will leave. In the determination of movies I have a very warm feeling - and new beers for love and understanding! Gray OWL pretty much the image - check the value! This is the one I look forward to sharing with others.
