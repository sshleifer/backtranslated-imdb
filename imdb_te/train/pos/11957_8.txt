Great Woody Allen? No Good Woody Allen? Sure. I've been with the audience that I attended, and we're laughing at some of the best Woody Allen lines we've heard for some time. Aging Allen Scarlett Johansson's "father" has created a suitable role for him ... well, sort of. Some said that Johansson would play the role of "a young Dianne Keaton". I have tried to resist. She plays Woody's conversation, which always has an equivalent feel in her funny films ... Also, a Woody Allen Comedy. It's good for Woody's admirers. She made Woody's conversation better than her youngest comedy Melinda / Melinda's young cast. Some Woody's humor can be found on the tiresome, but when it's done it loves us for that, we look forward to the next.
