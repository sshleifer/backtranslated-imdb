A long time ago, there was a two-year-old boy who released the original "Star Wars" film in the galaxy too. Remember that he first saw the film, but he did not remember the previous life. He first recalls the theme of "Star Wars" ... the complete set of action dolls on the original set of shoeboxes. He is very young to fully appreciate what a gift is unique. But years later, he loses one of the best gifts ever received today: the other is full of action figures, ten in the final ten is required to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boys' family how it's going to be the last action figure he's required to produce and managed in the shop, stores and managed, and this boy is ten years old (he's got into college) and he's finally bought it from someone in his dormitory for the beer nuggets bag ... it's a Northern Illinois University subject. <br /> I am one In winter, my friends and I will build ice fortresses and we pretend that we are in the hall (I am a star) and I can not review it as "Star Wars", which is definitely a good, fun and stupid about my childhood. I've always been a Han Solo)   క్-గాడి చెట్టు గృహాన్ని నిర్మించారు, మరియు అది ఎవోక్ గ్రామంగా పనిచేసింది. వారు పెద్ద పైన్ వృక్షాన్ని కలిగి ఉన్నారు, దీని దిగువ కొమ్మలు దాని కింద ఉన్న ఒక గుహను నిర్మించటానికి సరిపోతాయి, మరియు ఇది మేము యోడ ఇంటిలో ఉన్నామని నటిస్తున్న గొప్ప ప్రదేశం. I'm unfortunately dirty when it comes to "Star Wars" and I think people have understood or they did not. <br /> <br /> I do not get the appeal of "Lord of the Rings" or "Star Trek", but I know the thicker herds of fans who follow me because I am a fiery fan of George Lucas. I do not need to protect my view of these films at all times. I'm in the DVD player every time I'm eight years old when I'm fun, and I think what's the biggest problem I've ever found to figure out how Anakin Skywalker's character is. <Br /> <br /> Grade (for the whole trilogy): A +
