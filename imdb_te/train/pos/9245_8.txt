<br /> <br /> Jean Harlow and Clarke are some of the greatest gables on Gable's screen. This may be their best film. <br /> Yes, hold your person and be imaginative, but I do not like this movie. I love seeing Harlow and Gabbley together and in this movie they are amazing. <br /> It is clear that they really worked together and this is part of a wonderful film. <br /> <br /> This is a good picture of witty conversation, great script and attention. I first saw this movie and I saw at least one new detail in each subsequent view. <br /> During this period (in the early 30s) dialogue and script are better than most movies. I adore classic movies, but I admit that most of them just do not have an average and admire my interest. <br /> <br /> This is a great deal of the fact that your person is portrayed as a 'pre-coded'. (Hass code was not implemented after the Hands-Your-Man Holder). Well, it was not made, but it had a completely different story. Code is not good No code was implemented until 1934. Otherwise, we will miss this gem.
