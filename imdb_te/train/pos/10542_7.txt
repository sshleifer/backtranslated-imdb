Slightly light, 'Nothing' is a child's picture. It's a very clever concept, it strikes on some interesting metaphysical themes, and pretty much what you think against every Hollywood convention ... literally, is it more than "nothing"? The story of the two friends who want to get away from the world if everything goes wrong with their lives. They do not hate the rest, and the big space is white space. It is very difficult to focus on just two actors for the majority of your film, especially without any cuts outside the plot. It focuses on a good thing, but it is the main Vincenzo Natal territory. If you see 'cube', you know that he likes that kind of situation. In this film, "nothing" is clearly an infinite space, but the natalie performs to some extent claustrophobia, because nothing is literally nothing and can not go anywhere. Actors were sold, yet these guys can be friends. Here are two actors who returned from 'Cube' (Worth and Kazan), but are completely different characters. They are changing throughout the story, and they are at least believable, even though they are not the strongest actors in the world. <br /> <br /> I can say that this is a child's picture under the right tweaks because children can easily digest the weird and often intimate feel of the film, except for some f-bombs and some unnecessary bloody scenes. So the authors have decided to add a small amount of cross language and gore, which is not particularly high. This might have earned PG rating so they could easily cut some things and changed little conversation. This film is very objectionable, but it is enough to see their children to see their parents. <br /> <br /> However, even though this is a reasonably entertaining film, I support censorship because it supports censorship. With some drag-out sequences. But literally nothing about it, and both characters and absolutely nothing to focus their interaction altogether, they do a surprisingly good job for a freelance movie.
