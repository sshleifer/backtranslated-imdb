The film shows people in the hottest 2 days in Austria. This shows that it is cruel to other people and insulting people and other people. It shows people's inability to communicate or talk with others. <br /> <br /> When I was not in the movie, I was not present when they were going to go to the middle. And that's right. Because the movie is not easy to watch and is not easy. It has a very frustrating message and there is no moment in the moment in the movie. This is a very cruel film for everyone's taste. You can not speak in terms of what you enjoyed from this film. It grabbed in your throat and does not go forever and in the end you just lose breath by its intensity. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie or "I can not recommend it". You need to make your own mind based on what you have said earlier. It's not a regular film, it's not for everyone's taste.
