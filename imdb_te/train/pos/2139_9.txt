I approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised. It is well done and in recent years ballroom dancing films, especially the "Strictly Ballroom" The music is good and the dance is colorful, but this film is not about dance. It gives long-term trips to the workforce and vacation time for vacation programs that do not have their families about Japanese offices. Here we have a full-family and bigger mortgage and a flogging hobby man for life. He is featured in a young woman's charismatic film in a dance studio where he goes for his journey and leads him to ballroom dancing. Even the fact that the lecherous motives for Japanese start his new hobby are plain but at least, eventually, by the family and the audience. The attitude of ballroom dancing, as mentioned in the film, is certainly not Western, but discipline and music are obviously cultural imports to Japan. Cultural differences are the same. Without cultural awareness, the film is to see the enthusiasm of the color, the dances and the players.
