As a longtime fan of Peter O'Donnell's great creation, I saw the film with great hopes on the DVD; In fact I guess I am going to be disgusted for remote control in fifteen minutes. But instead I enjoyed this product, and I enjoyed it and how successful producers and director Modesty Blaze have succeeded in telling the story again. <br /> <br /> They avoided the trap of producing a movie version of the books they liked (except for the novels), rather than spending time in Madison's life. <br /> For production values ​​(and I'm not a student of cinematography!): Yes, the film is filmed on a tight financial and time budget and perhaps it's being displayed ... but will it harm the viewer's pleasure? I think this is not the case. <br /> <br /> We do not know a little bit about people who do not really matter (perhaps diabetes and (probably) professor lob. They are totally reliable, Alexandra Staden, some described as wood and acted as a very talented actress, It is the position and coolness of the screen modesty; her technique (when martial arts are needed), but most importantly Personality for integrity in the mainstream of Blaise Cannon. <br /> <br /> Well, the film is a modesty blaze character to Miramax's claim, which was made quickly and cheaply, but ... by these producers I waited to see the next product Can not be - until they continue to follow the main values ​​and features of the original stories!
