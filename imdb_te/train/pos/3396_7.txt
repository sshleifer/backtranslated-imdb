Very interesting. The big twist was not as big a shock as they probably would expect and it was very dated but my mind got to work. It really was thinking about the world without vegetation or livestock and I appreciate the world that lives a lot. Charlton Heston makes a good job, performing all the supporting roles, and surprising it is a very realistic picture. It does not have direction at times and requires a lot of settings and background more explanation but still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie. The main mistake I found was that I should not end at the end of the film, and I liked to see what happened later. <br /> <br />
