I was one of the best works of Monarch Cove and played in the "play" series for a long time on any network. This program has great potential and I can not wait to view each week. This is a great primetime soap. People are waiting for this kind of performance because we are being "realized TV". I've been for a long time writing and acting type of show like Dallas, Knots Landing, Dynasty, Melrose Place. Monarch Cove update this feeling very well and I only imagined getting better. These characters have a lot to expand and they are very interesting and attractive in their own right. It will not be explored and the world is removed from our world and is not lost after the cutting. It is foolish, interesting and sensual, because it does not go into or get into guilt. Loved it.
