It was originally thought to be the film that Jean Kelly would play, but when the producers did not get him they got "the highest actor in the world", and the result was very good. Generally Nathan Ditrottt (Frank Sinatra) needs $ 1000 because he has been putting up a high-value garbage dice game to get into trouble, what he was doing. So he needs to get money, he has to go with him to wager with a $ 1000 old friend Sky Mason (Marlon Brando) Sergeant Sarah Brown (Great Expectations' Golden Globe winner, and BAFTA Jean Simmons) he can enjoy Havana. Meanwhile, Nathan has a problem trying to get rid of a woman who wants to ask her hand in her marriage, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blain). Robert Keith starring Lieutenant Brianigen, Stubby Kaye Niley Nelly Johnson and B.S. Pully Big Zule. Brando is a gorgeous romantic comedy musical singing his own songs, and Cinatra is soft and nice. It was nominated for Best Music by Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge, which was nominated for Best Picture from BAFTA, and it won the Golden Globe Best Feature Film - Musical / Comedy . Frank Sinatra, number one on the list of the 100 Greatest Pop Culture Symbols, Marlon Brando is number 100 on the 100 Greatest Movie Stars, 100 Years Number 4, Number 11 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, 100 Stars - Men, Sinatra No. 35, and Brando, Number 1 "Luck Be a Lady" on the World's Greatest Actor is 100 Years 42, the movie is 100 in 100 Years 100 songs, and it's on 100 greatest musicals of the number 36. Very nice!
