Degnosis Murder is one of the only programs I now see on TV. One of the main characters in each of the episodes is to reflect each other rather than today's performances that focus on 1 or 2 people. <br /> <br /> Marc's brains are also unclear, he does not know what he thinks, and if you do, you're wrong. Each of the individual lives of the occasions but the characters. From racism and adoption, belongs to terrorists and technologies. <br /> For older people? I have 24 hours !! <br /> <br /> When I release all 8 Seasons DVDs (not NTSC) I would like to know, so I can see them all in sequence. They seem to be doing with lots of other shows from the same era they can hurry up a bit of it!
