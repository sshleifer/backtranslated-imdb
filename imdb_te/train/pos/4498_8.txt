Francesca Ans, Michael Kitchen and Robson Green !! Wow, no trilogy ... okay, so it's not Anna Karenina, but a good love story, well written and acted well. <br /> <br /> Quirky guitar music has also been added to the story. When I was a fan of Ms.Annis from Mr. Kitchens in 'Lily' (in the '70s) and' The Buccaneers' and 'Enchanted April', I Recently, Mr. Greenie ('Me and Mrs. Jones', 'Touching Evil' etc) ask me this question - why did not I see 'Reckless' until recently? !! For most part of the 'chick flick' than a man sitting, it is perfectly suited for the lazy view of the rainy afternoon.
