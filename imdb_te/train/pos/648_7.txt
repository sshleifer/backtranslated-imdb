I decided to see this because of the recommendations from this site. I have to say it is worth the effort. However, you should note that the film will last for 210 minutes. <br /> <br /> Now, what are you saying "spoilers" and if you do not? <br /> <br /> Alexander is a complex bum, a woman and a gigolo. He lives with an elderly woman called Mary. Mary has a retail store and she offers for Alex. Alex spends his days in cafes and restaurants. The story tells Alex that he lived with Gilbert in the past. Gilbert dumped him for a less attractive man, because Alex destroyed her and damaged her. At this time, Alex wanted to get a job, and Gilbert quit it and wanted to marry another. <br /> The possibility is that Alexander Veronica meets a nostalgic source and they beat a relationship. Veronica had fallen in love with Alex for the first time since all the men who had sex with her. Marie and Veronica have had to boot a managate Trois, struggling with Alex's love. Finally, Veronica realized that Alex was pregnant with the baby and Alex asked her to marry her. Alexander also gets a job (as Gilbert is told about the situation) and serves as his new love and family provider. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title "La Manmad et la Ptoine", the role of Veronica's François Librón by Jean Eusta. She was a prostitute and later became her mother. Hence, the mother and the prostitute is the same person? Anyway, what do I know? French films are mostly (not all) very chatty, non-aimless political, teaching, theatrical, insipid, lamenting and quotations. LeBron and Layouad played their heroic roles and the film starred in part because it lost some of the script and was confusing. <br /> <br /> <br />
