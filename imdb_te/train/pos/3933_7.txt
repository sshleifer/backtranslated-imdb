The problem of realizing a real life is that the performance is good, but the actor does not work if the audience does not believe that he is portraying the person. It's "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda gave a wonderful performance, but I realized that Abraham Lincoln believed him to be soft-spoken. <br /> <br /> It is a courthouse play with a young Abraham Lincoln who is essentially at the forefront. I do not know whether this is true or not, but if not, why is Lincoln a central character? But never mind. In the film, he protects the two young men who are accused of murdering Lincoln. <br /> <br /> The movie is not too much, and as a result it is empty. I wanted more story and character development. The image is 100 minutes long, but it does not. <br /> <br /> Acting is good, but as I have mentioned, Fonda's performance acts as a character, but Abraham is not Lincoln. I believe that real Lincoln is soft spoken. True, there was a big voice when he needed, as he persuaded a drunken Lynch mob to let the accused stand trail, but Fonda Lincoln played a very meekly role. Other performances are superb, most notably Alice Brady, Abigail Clay, the mother of the accused. She is a good woman who really does. Simple and illiterate, yet very sweet; <br /> <br /> John Ford's epic is to think about the film, and it is probably during its release. <br /> <br /> However, it does not have enough material to say before. <br /> It's a good watch, but not classic.
