I do not expect much from this movie, but it is very pleasantly surprising because it is light and funny and well observed. As they surprise the central trilogy of the Deepbeat bikers, they blocked Wales by their drug-centered trip. Humor is delicate and delicate, in fact the three characters (the young lady will see their sympathetic treatment of the shopper). The climate of the rural Wales has been perfectly summarized, and the soundtrack is well-chosen. Wisely and carefully written, great attention to detail - I have never ever seen a realistic role of alternative culture - I felt there with them. You can not expect from a movie about bikers and drugs - too light to touch and fun. Though I think the last two scenes are a bit lame, it's hard to be happy and criticized in all areas - the film ended when they left Wales. But overall, an image is an unexpected treasure.
