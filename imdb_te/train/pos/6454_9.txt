I have seen this Palm at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival, and I have seen 14 films that have seen this place as my # 3 movie. My ancestors from the Naland area of ​​Sweden have a primary interest in looking at a Swedish descent with a number of people, where it is filmed. In the United States, rural north forests are very small towns. It's great to look at their settings, such as more movies with rural locations. It's a very good movie and it's very difficult for me to sit with a bigger movie, but after nearly two decades of director K Pollock's directorial debut has been removed. Helen Szolmom is a wonderful performer in her debut film as an actress and I look forward to her on the big screen. I enjoyed this well-rounded cast major Michael Nyqvist. I would recommend this film and rated 10 at 9.0 at a level.
