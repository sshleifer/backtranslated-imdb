I said this story because I wrote the screenplay and it was very little until I asked to watch the movie. I wrote to the producers who sold it without saying it. Because Alan Dobby was my friend, I had to hear about it. This is the first draft written so I understand when I hear on the ground. I asked Peter Collinsson through my agent, and he liked me to do another draft. I've lost that because I also asked if I could see my original script. I'm too late. I did the only thing I could do in circumstances and removed my name. I do not know what they did to my screenplay. Then I was invited to watch the full movie. I asked my name to be renamed very quickly. It's a pretty made piece, from a tightly written first draft, I guess I was asked to do more work on it; Maybe I'm not good. Am I willing to see my original script if someone knows I love to see the film again, I saw only one time in Soho at a short view theater.
