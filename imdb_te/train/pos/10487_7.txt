Savings Grace is good for the heart in the right place. Grace is widely widowed and her husband has given her husband a lot of debt. She can lose her lovely home and find no other solution to her hardships than to raise marijuana. She lived in a beautiful village where many audiences would like to live, and the villagers love most audiences and love the audience. The wrong thing in this image is the one and it will affect the customer's customer. None of the actors or writers in the film have anything to say. It is ridiculous that villagers work after smoking and are just happy to be funny. It is a pity in the film that makes the scenes perfectly replaced by the English slapstick and it is a little less enjoyable.
