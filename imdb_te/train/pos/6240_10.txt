Dog Days is one of the most accurate pictures that I describe in life in modern cities. It is very rough at some point and it is very close to what is cruel and sinful. Alone, in despair, deep emotional dead ends, troublesome affairs, perversion, complexity, madness. All the things in today's large modern cities. You can once again realize the vicious state of having a major community of people. <br /> <br /> The negative side of life in the city is not properly screened on the screen. I'm lying. Unfortunately, it is not. Therefore ... 10/10.
