William H. Mackie is at his most sympathetic and compelling as his hitman and beloved father, who wants to get out of the family business without pushing his parents to his defeat. The Guy subsequently directs TV's "The Sopranos" (the same here he is looking to make a shrink) in terms of a mid-life crisis of a criminal background, but this Guy presents it more precisely thanks to some tat direction from Brommel), an amazing script, and great performances. Macy is always as spectacular as that. This is probably his best role from "Fargo". Donald Sutherland's dominant father is his creepy best. Tracey Ulman gave a surprisingly inspired dramatic turn as Macy's mistress. Yeis David Darfman is Mackey's bright and sensitive son (his many lines are sound free and are awesome). Neve Campbell (I usually hate) is also compelled to be Mackie's eye-catching teenager. All of these are predictable but imaginable but powerful climax and meaningful and touched by a moving score and crisp pace. I suspect this is a link to the audience, and this film is desirable for a wider release.
