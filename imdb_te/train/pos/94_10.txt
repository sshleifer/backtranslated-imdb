I'm a big John Denver fan. I have a large collection of his music in vinyl. I first saw Christmas and loved it when it was first on TV. I have a real vinyl album and a CD. My original CD was released and later. There are not many songs in the next release. I have been released with all the original songs this year. To my surprise I found the original CD was selling at $ 75.00. Wow - to think that a Christmas CD is very valuable. I do not sell this whole treasure. My favorite Christmas CD. I could not find it on VHS or DVD. I would love to have either version either. Let me know if anybody is available. Thanks
