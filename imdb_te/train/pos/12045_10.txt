I first saw this film when I was a child and had only one life in my life, remembering to have eyes on my face and eyes. I remembered again with a barrier with my Uniun's friends and instantly got my video and my surprise almost the same when I saw it (I wonder if I found it in the web in the States whenever I found it in the web!) I bought plenty of video of doubt, the perfect horror and fear And my heart is never too defeated too. It is in my opinion that this is the most extreme film ever made, compared to Hollywood films and bit pony and trap. The power of this film and the uni however is amazing when I see my colleagues watching this with twenty I never heard too much chatter, blokes as well! The view of the video also brings me to the fear of the god of a particular scene, and I leave myself feeling forever darkness never walked alone!
