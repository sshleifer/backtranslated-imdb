I have noticed that most people who posted "karching!" The board seem to hate this show, which I find really incredibly surprising. It shows that I am one of the best British children. It's a shame that ended up because it's very funny (if sometimes a bit cheesy) and has great characters. Although the main character is too small, it is like Del Boy. With his 2 best friends he started an online business and tried to make a million pounds for his mum by adopting the nickname "Roudbooy". His friends Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who is a simple mind and comic relief character). Throughout the show, there are some characters left and new, but it is always entertaining and improving.
