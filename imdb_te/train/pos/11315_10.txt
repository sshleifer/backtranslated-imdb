Luchino Visconti is more than light years of his contemporaries. The great directors of the 40s and 50s of Italy are men who understand the media, but this is Lacheno Visconti, the eye man who brought to mind a man's mind and the ability to show him the ability to do. Based on James Cain's "The Postman Always Ring Twice", Hollywood's film "Oscassy" clearly shows his genius in his intellectual career in his particular career, but the film is comparable to that of Viscotti. Visconti and his collaborators on screen are in Alberto Moravia, a man who knows about the impact of hobbies on humans. <br /> <br /> The film is recently saved in the DVD format we have seen. <br /> <br /> Visconti's vision lesson In realistic rings in a realistic ring, let's see how to translate if there is no American version, because it is mandatory for most serious movie fans. <br /> <br /> The film, the director's intensity from his key players. Wonderful Clara Kalamai Giovanni does a brilliant job as a woman married to an old man, but when Gino appears in her life, what she wants to do is give her a chance in her life. Giovanni is one of the best creations in the achievements of Mrs. Kalamai in the Italian movie. <br /> <br /> The final line of the film is Mrs. Kalamai who acts as a moral liberation for the brutal crimes she has shown in a strange twist. <br /> <br /> Masmozo Girito, one of the best actors is a hunky man who waits obsessive passion in Giovanni, for his generation appearing in Genoa. Ginto's perfect guy for Ginovanna, Mr. Girito projects did not equal the screen with such comfort and sophistication. Mr. Girofti man comes alive at a show, it's easy, and another actor may not be that clear. Jovan Delanda is an elderly man in love with Giusessa. In fact, he truer than his character rings than in the American role than his cousin, he looks more like a buffoon. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully drawn by Dominic Scala and Aldo Tony. The way they like Italian directors of the era they gave the character an inherent look. Giuseppe Rosati's original musical score is perfect. Viscotti, Opera, and one of the best directors, Bizet and Verdi Arriya are also well suited for the film. <br /> <br /> "Oscice" Look at a great Luchino Visconti at the top of his appearance.
