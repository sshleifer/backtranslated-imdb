I do not know about Steve McQueen in 1958. I know I'm very scared to see this film. (At age seven I have been destroyed by the movie "Trampatla" but now I have ten). I would like to leave my theater with the first scene crawling the Bobby farmer's sticking stick and surrounding his arm. But I have suffered every one of my monster attacks. When Steve and his girl came out of the Doctor's Office (Poor Doc), I experienced such a horror feeling, and Babb entered a movie theater and swallowed a large part of the audience. . . In fact it came out of the very front door, which is now very big. It seemed indestructible and unlimited in the likelihood of growth, and when it caught poor Steve in a sieve-like diner, he seemed like a perfect dinner. <br /> <br /> There is a modern day to say that the bubble is cool, but in the end, the little children will have a much better snow that can be frightening and mentally fragmented. In the evening with my uncle Nick, brave trying to act. I knew he was in trouble, and when it came to bed that night I could not feel the blob in the room, but when I called for dare to look at the floor, there was red shining, waiting for me to try and wait and go to the bathroom. It took months to restore. <br /> Now I am 57 years old. . . <br /> <br /> <br />
