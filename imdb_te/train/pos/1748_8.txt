I'm very glad to see this film. The poster is perhaps the funniest I've ever seen for a movie. <br /> <br /> This film was bought immediately for my accommodation in September. If you are critically acclaimed by most penis, homosexuals, and ethnic jokes, you can not see the movie often. Karel and the rest of the cast deliberately provide each indecent joke. Carrell is so sweet throughout the film, where if you want to succeed in his relationship with him, you end up firing for him. The supporting cast is cruel, everyone is facing some problems. <br /> One of the things related to the film is the abundance of memorable scenes we have given. This film is easy to remember. <br /> <br /> I am surprised to see many adults looking at this theater. <br /> <br /> I came to the 60s women group. The whole movie is filled with all the old audiences. <br /> The types of people I like are the Office and Steve Karel. A lot of comedies remind you of the kind of jokes you can see on the Family Guy. <br /> <br /> The film is very sweet and delicate for the middle aged women. <br /> <br /> If you are not an obsessive fan, you are offended. However, when you're in the movie, remember that the film is good humor. Jokes are not "homosexuals", they are just jokes. And they're funny.
