Title, The Sword Bearer, and DVD Cover (Action / Herriek The Sword of Bearer) is not a superhero film. <br /> (Little Spoilers) This follows the story of Sasha Sword Bearer, cursed with a knife knocking his forearm. You say it's cool, but it's in real life. If you have this power as a child, you have to control it when it faced a mad man, or when your mum defeated her. If you do not control it, how should you behave twice as a killer at the age of 12? <br /> <br /> When we met him Sasha. Targeted after a different killing (much like a bout de soufel). He meets Katya, the couple fall in love, giving Sasha a real reason to live and change his way. <br /> <br /> Previous story of this story, and there is no action on the screen, though much suggested. <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike most Hollywood superhero films, we get very low back story, there's no bad guy (unless you swart bearer count) abut is a lot of heart and good character development. If you can find it is worth checking out.
