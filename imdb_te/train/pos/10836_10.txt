I thought this film is fantastic. It's so happy. Kinda reminded me of spinal tap. Must see for any fan of this 70's rock. <br /> <br /> Stephen RIAa is perfectly suited to the gum when trying to capture the band, but it does not succeed. <br /> <br /> If you love music and are in the band, the film is definitely for you. You do not regret seeing this movie. I do not know. Even my family found it funny, and to say something.
