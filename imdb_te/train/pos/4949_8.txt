The honest, temporary performances by its two leads in 10 items or less under the radar pictures that have a lot of independent films have been mildly flammable - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. The great thing is that the whole film is unlikely to be a source of its 'road map' origins. Morgan Freeman's unnamed character mentally (not physically) encounters this frustrated girl who has an unhealthy relationship with his current supervisor here. (A little baby character by Bobby Cannavale) We have somehow left to witness and silence those who are silent in the magic - two people facing the society coin - are fraudulent. So, briefly, though no bang! The moments that reveal the emotions of the earth, this film is likely to be lost in the 2006 Indies Shuffle, but it deserves to see if it is honest.
