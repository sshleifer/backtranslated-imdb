It's a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater that occupies parents and their rollicking children. <br /> <br /> Based on Thomas Rockwell's respectable book, the fried How to Eat begins as a child's story: going to a new town. The new kid, fifth grader Billy Forestster, was once popular, but newly launched. Friends are always easy, especially the only Poindexter Adam. <br /> <br /> Erika is bigger than 4 1/2 feet. His patchy face and sleeve shirts shake. He fights against children with Death Ring: A crackerjack ring with rumors to kill you if you punch it. But not immediately. <br /> Death Ring breaks down a poison that dies in eight grade. <br /> <br /> Billy welcomed Joe and his bad character by stealing the slim insects in his thermos. After one finds, Billy gets it cool, he eats insects from time to time. Then he throws them at the face of Joe. Ewww! To win them, Billy reluctantly wasted his 10 worms. Fried, boiled, marinated in hot sauce, squashed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich. <br /> Each meal is called an exotic name, such as a "radiocative slam delights", in which children eventually live their living together. <br /> If you ever met me, I had a lukewarm heartfelt laugh. I felt a move when I was thinking of breaking a small kid with his "delicate dick". But fried worms are amazingly frustrating. Like a G-rated Ferlyley Brothers movie, it's vomit and happy. <br /> <br /> Writer / Director Bob Dolman is also a savvy storyteller. The worms should be used at 7 o'clock to raise shares. In addition Billy has a dark secret: he has an ultra sensitive stomach. <br /> <br /> Dolman's perspective is also a great concept. <br /> <br /> If you make these images superlative in their images, you will see that it is related to war. Freedom-fighter and free-hating proxy warfare is the only way to use a pair of adolescent boys and learn a valuable lesson in unity. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the mothers of the two mothers behind me see one another, agree and agree to each other. This is a great movie. "Great, now I do not need to register in any legitimate database.
