I love Monte Carlo and enjoyed this film thoroughly. I thought it was good for everyone. I do not know much about Richard Lewis, and I think his character (Julian Peters) is very personal, funny and attractive. Sean Young is a very good kidnapped girl with a golden heart. George Hamilton beautiful and perfect Italian gigolo. The John Candy Bond Vintant has a field day. James Belushi is as crazy as the whole jerk. Cybill Shepherd gave a very good performing housewife very sweet performance. The joyous ensemble cast. Lots of talent and intelligent script, a lot going on and beautiful locations. Just pick up a dormant day for me. Especially when you go to Europe in winter, there is no place on your horizon.
