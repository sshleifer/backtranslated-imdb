Edurkondamu; Nancy Drew was never a great literature. It is in the same category as civil club, magic tree house, goosebumps, ABC mysteries. In fact, this is one of the original formula stories. Nancy is perfect, pretty, intelligent, "good", there are no internal differences! And never changes. Ned is pretty cool. The film is true to that style and I said, I liked it. It's never a great movie, but it has the same nostalgic taste that the books have. This is my kids (8 and 10) have the right amount of suspense. There is not a particularly dangerous language. <br /> <br /> <br /> Carrick was angry with him. He is the lowest place on high school campus. I've always been in the first place and why I've always been.
