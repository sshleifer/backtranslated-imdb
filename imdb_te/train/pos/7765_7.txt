Douglas Circ is a cheerful dancer who plays dramatically. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are some kind of childhood friends who look different about life. Kyle is the son of an oil giant; Mitch works for Hadley Oil Company. Two women fell in love with one woman, Lucy Moore; But Kyle has her feet and her ways of wow and her marriage. Sister Marley (Dorothy Malone) seems to have a fire for the town's Namphomannic and Mid, and he always looks to clean up Hadley's confusion. Being so pretentious; The top is slightly higher, but the stars make a movie to see it. I was very impressed with Malone. Cast: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lourch and Robert J. Wilke.
