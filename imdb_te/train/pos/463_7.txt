Plots, scripts, and especially casting in the course are strong in the film. Very good things to see. One thing I liked is that the rival's idea - Luzini's (Turtruus) - is a former guide to his evil work. His chess rival - three pieces and an Italian dandy of cane - is a real courtesy, and is really a fine chess player. After the death of the widow (Emily Watson), the honorable chess masters, the defense of Ljuhin (he was at the last moment of the lazette), with the end of the final competition of the "rival" Worked) was allowed to play. Italian courtesy praises the drama and calls it brilliant. Discuss the dramatic "end game"
