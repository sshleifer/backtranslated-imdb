It is worth watching the whole ending of the film - the best end of any movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I found this film to be a delightful, even when it was French taking. I liked it - it's a great love story. And I like to have woven in Algerians - and in the end, the music is very good at the end credits. I want a CD!
