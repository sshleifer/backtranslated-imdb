Well, I am a precursor to the Oscesee Italian film genre, and the unique affection of mine, 'Giollo' ... I heard from somewhere. But the fact is that this is a thriller made in Italy; Both are not very good. In the sixties and seventies, Italian filmmakers have been credited with leaving every successful American film released. They can not do it here, but the Osciece book followed a single story with the film, The Postman Always Rings Twice, without giving James M. Kain the author. However, Plan Gino Costa focuses on a fine drifter, so that a woman named Giovanna Braganza slid in a cafe. She soon learns that she will marry Giuseppe; Giovanni is also a big fat man who can not stand her touching. He wants to run away with them, but her idea is not very interesting. <br /> <br /> Although the story loses some credibility for not crediting the writer based on the story, the director explains that the director of the Viscotti film Nirer performs perfectly, I love the big American Nair classics. As you may have guessed, the story is very strong and Visconti gets good performances from his cast. However, Visconti captures a little bit of this movie, and I think the story is very narrow to guarantee this type of length, with about 135 minutes running time. I feel guilty about justifying these criticisms in Oceisi because it is a good movie, but this is not a great movie. The relationship between the two central characters is not really explored, and is a distracting film, rather than ourselves, in the headings of the films. The plot that we're going to be pretty much never quite secret is, and is not always by focusing on the characters themselves; The picture is not as interesting as it was. However, it provides an interesting view and is recommended for that reason ... This is not as good as the 1946 version of James M. Coin Classic.
