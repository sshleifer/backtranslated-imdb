*** SPOILERS *** *** Spoiler *** was released in 1956 and was very exciting at that time, even more impressive on Douglas Circk's top candy drama. The plot is concerned about the oil rich Dissonfunkal Texas family, in which the elder brother Kyle, unprotected, weak, wounded & very alcoholic, Robert Stack has played a very touching & profane performance and his sister's sister, Maryle Dorothy Malone. Maloney's performance joins us through her eyes, she uses us to show her emotions that have many feelings (for rock hudson) and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall). The only actress I've ever seen in the movies first entered in our room. Now I'm not wrong, at least her performance is a perfect owl and one of the supreme campers working in the 1950s. But it's also terrible, because Malo is a favorite and attractive, she is not a very good actress, and she can deft or shading. Her appearance is a note. She's doing a bad mumbo and in a good matteze, always raising the stairs of Robert Keith, who plays a good mermaid, making her an emotional dance as Cirk makes her an emotional dance. The real stars of the film, sexual assaults, sexual harassment, and other films sets, the stock, who won the Oscar Award, and Malone, the film's "real stars", Hudson & Bachl becomes gray & brown, mainly Hudson He is a good actor, and is a good actor for his childhood and stock friend's best friend, Maloney Okka to love and for the most part goes through the rock on the caterpillars. But Hudson did not want her part, instead of being in love with Bacall, who married Stack. No one is very happy & nobody has been happy for a long time. The stock-basal marriage comes a year later with a long time and he drinks too much to drink too much because he thinks he is a stereo, and Baquel can not give a child to prove he is a man. The most intelligent man, Sirk and Germany, has a long and fascinating career in film and theaters, and ended in the mid-1950s with a series of extreme "colorful pictures" or melodras in his Hollywood career in Universal. Although they were mainly derived from pharmaceutical or worst sources, they became masterpieces of the genre in Sirk's hands. Cirk has an amazing feel of color & design, in which he fills his wide screen space with characters that show their emotional lives between weird color combinations and lightings, reflecting shadows and images. Letters in "Written" are always exposed to windows, watching doors or sneaking around. In the end, much of the violence, accidental murder, miscarriage, and more then the cirk film ends with a final and startling scenario of "a reborn" and reforms Malon in a man-to-suit claim.
