This film is funnier! What exactly is this piece about "Guilty Pleasure". The film is easy to condemn, including Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and do the math. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick have long since grown up their parts! The time young stars do that. <br /> <br /> Yvonne de Carlo, who gave her back the role of Lili as Big 6-0 (though she still looks good, still has a perfect "lily"). <br /> <br /> It is not a big part of Yvonne de Carlo. However, Fred Guinness and Al Lewis's characters are very popular! The Gavin / Lewis Chemistry, in the 2 seasons of the Mummars' lead. The cast of the cast also supports the members and does not say they do not need it. They are! Without it the TV series does not exist until the time. Choosing a choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Dormon (the original "Eddie") is easy. <br /> <br /> Although the film did not cut the original TV series, it still grows and one of the better "reunuin" TV specials suffered from boob-tube in the late 1970s / early 1980s. <br /> <
