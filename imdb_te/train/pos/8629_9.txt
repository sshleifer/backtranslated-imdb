I read a short statement in some horror magazines in the early nine years about Lybe des des Totes (love of the dead) or the like. I curled my curiosity even though I ordered Neocorothic 1 & 2 and Der Todding (The Death King). The Nekromantik films are interesting and unique in their view of the subject of the subject itself. Necrophilia (with the intention of frightening the minds of viewers, they are really very funny.) On the other hand, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made is. This is a series of scenes depicting many aspects of death. Death as an enemy; Death is a relief, like the body's very physical rotten of death. The film is a metaphor for life. It shows how fragile life and how low our lives are. This will reduce their audience to the actual children they are (we). We do not really understand the nature of death and that is not the process to die, the main message of the film. This is a very realistic picture. Butteeret does not always try to hide white roses or death. Whatever moral standards you have set up, death is inevitable, and not sooner or later, as a fiction or your reality. This applies to you, the Dear Reader applies to viewers of the movie. Some juvenile reviewers seem to absorb this compilation, which is completely forgiven, because they will live forever ... <br /> This is not a looting movie. Why? Death does not exploit humans. It crops us. We are growing for seven days, then we will be taken to an earlier birth in the Skippenhairian state, that is Death. He gave us the oldest hero of the Butgardit stories. Whether you want it to be "optimistic" or "pessimistic" is your choice. At first glance it seems very dark. Anyway, if you want to live something, you need to die. <br /> If Butchergate shows a body, it is used by mugots, not only to decompose, but also to the generation of new life. <br /> <br /> Do you have to die and keep the magnets and then the life of the birds and finally become the soil, to remain the living dead living as one of these favorite pets? , You'll see Tersking in its proper context. <br /> <br /> Seybane Taz Hat Dye Wokey, Siebmemal Legz Stunden. Seven weeks (weak, massage!), Seven times last hour. <br /> <br /> If Reaper is not scared, Betterette tells us because Reaper takes only maturity. <br /> <br /> "The Seventh Seal" is a depth and universal basis)
