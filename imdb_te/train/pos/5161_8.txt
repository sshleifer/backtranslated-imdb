Kirk and crew land on a lonely planet when the sun explodes. They intend to evacuate residents, but they will find the rest of the space except Mr. Atoz, a kind of high-tech library. Even though everyone is trying to get a direct answer from him about the track, Atos is different from their own questions and stressed that they should choose the 'time quickly.' He does not know what he is talking about, but looking at the hands-on discs on the viewers, they see the last images of the planet. Then, when the disc is in the viewer, Kirk passes through the door and the louis XIV (1660s) time on the ground will be greatly transported at any time. When McCoy and Spock follow, a different disc is in the viewer and they are sent to hell in the ice age. <br /> <br /> Kirk's tour is not so small, it's not that exciting, Spock and McCois have no more exposure, for the merit heart that was sentenced to this awful place. <br /> <br /> Scenes with Spokes are exceptional and are usually quite varied by the logical person. <br /> <br /> Spokes' departure from the alternative, a widely invented script and a very different area make this exceptional episode. <br /> <br /> Fine - Ian Wolf, a wonderful actor, played by Mr. Atos. I was a fan of the old films and looked at countless films in the 30s and 40s as a helper and a bit player, and he almost made it appear in this episode since 1969. Interestingly, the old age is looking, another 23 years old - dying at the age of 95 !!
