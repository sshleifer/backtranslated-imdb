This is a great movie if it is viewed in the right context - it is considered parody of teen-horror-devil-worship movies (and '80s plenty)! When this came first I saw this movie and I liked it instantly. Being a big fan of KISS, it is great to see Jean in the film. And not as bad as a metal-hating preacher with OZZY! <br /> <br /> Fast food is already my favorite, so it's great to hear them in the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> <br /> The original VHS for the trick or treat (which was earlier DVD) was a set of mocking, playing his guitar with "ghost" and playing a fire ring. This is a special order and price for a VHS copy at the time (circa 1987) $ 90! I really wanted the movie, but that was not at the ridiculous price. The 'Ozzy Jean' cover was created for $ 5 re-release only. It was probably released in Jean and OZZY's only recognizable people release in the film, so they did put em on the cover! The same thing with the original "Little Shop of Horrors" - Jack Nicholson is in it within five minutes, but he is now in the cover as the main actor. <br /> <br /> "Trick or Treat" is a website, and many people believe that Sammy is a real person! Sammy Curar helped to keep the fatwa by dedicating their soundtrack album. <br /> <br /> All of us have a good time, rock-n-roll film. Absolutely not taken seriously, but just enjoyed!
