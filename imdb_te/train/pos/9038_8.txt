I liked the October Sky. The thing I liked most thing should be music. It worked in two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time frame. Play songs from these last fifty years. In the second hour, it takes an instrumental score. <br /> <br /> I have not only enjoyed music, but I also enjoyed the cast. Homer Hickman Jake Gyllenhaal made me very surprised. <br /> <br /> Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam) gave first-class performance. And I enjoyed it twice.
