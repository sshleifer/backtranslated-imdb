I enjoyed this movie because I probably did not see any reviews, it was very happy and a 'romp' movie. I do not know why the splash was more than what it did. Until the story goes, I have been involved with some of the elements of Paul Ryser, and I can see my father in the role of Falk. Even though I was a kid, I recalled my grandparents' hearings many times. This is your picture if you enjoy the movies like the Grammy Old Men or the Golden Pond. A "Sleeper", one in my opinion, and one of those good stories to feel. Peter Faulk and Paul Riser have many fantastic verbal skins and have not done anything. I'll say at least one 8, perhaps higher rates.
