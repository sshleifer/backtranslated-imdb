I did not know about this film but checked it out at the video store and after watching it, I enjoyed it. A picture of many of the less visible films from director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Priel). Great story and characters. As a fan of Glen Hellel, I was surprised by her British voice. Exception to the film is over. However, it is worth renting.
