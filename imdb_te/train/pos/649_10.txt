We should not lose this movie, it's one that I have never seen before. Jean Pierre Liam is wonderful (more than normal) and the film is one of the most unforgettable of Nouvel Vogue. Jean Ustchach is not yet on the planet, we love to remember one of the greatest and most reliable French directors of these black and white images. You have to love this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> PSS: Sorry English
