I watched the first one-wave movie waves broke. Definitely a good movie but it is definitely a shadow of Europa. Europa has told a German German-American story that Germany wants to experience Germany after World War II. He arranged for his uncle to be a luxury trainer. Due to his job, he traveled through an almost completely destroyed city of Germany, killing criminals, and hunting for former Nazi party members. Society is suffering from corruption. His uncle cut his agility by focusing on a job as a partner in the train. Coincidentally, the main character was a team called 'Werewolves', who was involved in the bombing, terrorism, and pressed him to help bombers. The atmosphere is astounding. The viewer tries to view the viewer from the scene from the scene and try to keep the viewer under hypnosis and calculate to wake you up in a new scene. You feel like you've seen a lot !!!!!!! Europe !!
