Reliable adaptation of the romantic and interesting French novel about a dull and depressed mid-range software engineer (or something) relies on the first-person narrative, but not the worst. The best way to describe both the film and the novel is that it is more intellectual than Charles Bukowski (CB is not disrespectful). The tragic analysis of the social and sexual relationships, the film's great credentials, reflects real life as you ask: why are not these other movies? One of the rare examples of a good book is equally good image.
