The timeless musical gem, in the top form with Jean Kelly, stylish direction, by Vincent Minniele, and excellent music. It's great entertainment from start to finish, one of those movies that people see with a smile and "they do not make em as they have used!" But they did not like it too much. The atmosphere of 25 minutes of music without any conversation is beautiful in the history of cinema. The film magic, evident from the heart and soul of all participants. Must see!
