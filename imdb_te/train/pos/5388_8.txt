I saw this film yesterday in Turner, but I can not imagine what's going to happen, but I could not see it until the end. Farrell was great in her role, and everyone did a super job. It seemed to stretch some limits, but all in all, I loved it !! If you get a chance to see, please! I actually cried at some scenes, but I guess if you were a mom. Loretta is beautiful, and I was just surprisingly at the idea of ​​their unwed mothers out there, which seemed to be ahead of its' time. I say, if you can see and listen to criticism. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I enjoyed it thoroughly!
