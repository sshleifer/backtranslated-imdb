Wow I could not believe that this film was completely started to awake so I got it last ounce When I started watching I started having a full range of cast members as well as the Eartha Kit and Ruby Dee Forest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many more famous actors and actresses in history A glimpse It is not known about people and open to the other eye to the intolerable society to talk. I have never heard of a book or movie about this before and this black history is always something that addresses them down only because they have address and mixed race, I highly recommend this film
