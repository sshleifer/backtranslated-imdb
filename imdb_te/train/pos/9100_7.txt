If the Spanish pictures are not golden, definitely a silver age. Another example of a film that badly strips Peudros people and their conflicts. Though feelings are strong or almost at the level of life or death, they are still not really dramatic. <br /> <br /> There are different stories here that are connected. About a fallen girl, who does not have the courage to go to the next block street. About a middle-aged woman who learns the lover of his life in a step fetishist. Another tells about a girl with drug problems, a lover. <br /> Another person finds true love (about) the madam of a brothel. It takes moviemakers women seriously in Spain.
