Tipper Gore and her Washington Wives kick-enabled (this small-style other less successful scores are awesome, Black Ross and the Silly The Gate) is an outstanding example of Hollywood jumping on the "backlit message in metal music". When TRICK or Treat came out I was reading secondary at secondary school and could not see it. It was disappeared from the video stores by the late '80s, but lastly I had a budget price DVD copy of it and it brought back the most fun metal memories from day one. Any teens metal related to the trials of ADE "Ragman" Weinbour ("Family Ties"), as Prepepe "cute" people in his high school for his heavy metal fashions and music tastes him. Eddie's favorite rock star was initially a dead in a hotel fire Sammy Kour (a lot of Motley Crew's Tommy Lee). Eddie is uncertain until Sammy's final, unreleased album test from a radio DJ (Quinn Cameo in Jean Simmons of Kiss). Eddie soon learns to allow him to talk with Sammy's dead soul when playing this LP! Eddie advises Sammy how to get his prepaid harassment soon, but it tries to destroy the MDG in the messages spots ("Waste ALL ... no worse metal!"), Through life by Sammi Edi's stereo speakers. The big dancing in Eddie's high school takes the stage for the rampage and crowd to crowd and break up some unfortunate "false metals" before saving the girl of the day and her dreams. No, it's not terrible horror in 2006, it's not even scary 1986, but TRICK OR TREAT WITH A 1980 METALER face brings a smile and a kick-ass soundtrack courtesy of the movie Cult Band Fastway. It's good to know if you have ever folded your head or have B-grade horror movies (or both, like me).
