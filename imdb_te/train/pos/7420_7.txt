Although Chris Christopher was good in this role, who wanted to see Elvis Presley instead? It may be mistaken for Elvis to turn away from drug addiction and a fall from supreme reputation, which is a mistake. This was the perfect image for Elvis. Although Soundtrack is very spectacular, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand made a good job in creating the original soundtrack for this "period" piece / musical. A love story is somewhat more, it's more about the fall of grace and the gift of deliverance. Like many tragedies, the hero of the story is dead. Also, Gary Bus is once again perfect in the perfect role.
