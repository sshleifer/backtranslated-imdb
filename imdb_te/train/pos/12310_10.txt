I read the original story of PU in the 18th century. Amazingly, the film condemns the original soul, although the plot has changed dramatically. Motion picture, rhythm, special effect from Hollywood, but still a Chinese core. It's awesome how Hark Tui can combine them together. The result is pure beauty.
