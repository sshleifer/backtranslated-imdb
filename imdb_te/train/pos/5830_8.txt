"The voice of the angels" is heard when the boys work outside a recording studio. It goes with Miss Van Doran, audition and her miss Andrews, because her father is not "radio singer". However, a big big wig, her father's girlfriend Mrs. Bixby hopes that she will rent her, then he must give her permission. <br /> When she left, she was excited at the studio and had other musicians to kill them after the recording session was destroyed. Finally things are calm. "We, we escaped them," said Mo. <br /> <br /> The guy is cheated around in the studio and puts on Miss van Dorren's record and pretends to be singing and dressing in curly women's outfits. Mrs. Bixby walks, impresses and hires "Seitanata Kuchacha" on the spot! For extra $ 500, she asked her to come back to their high-profile party that night. The rest of them, as they say, have a history of acting as the opera singer with some funny results. Oh, he did "senior musho" and "senior gastro". <br /> <br /> What happens to the party is true, but before some slapstick criticisms come true. In all, a pretty good piece. I enjoyed it but it does not rate it as unique.
