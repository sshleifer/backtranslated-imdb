I think many people already know this story - Ebenezer Schaugge is his ways for those who highlight parts of his life in the hope of preserving his soul from three souls (ghosts of Christmas past, present and still) and hoping to save his life. A classic tale of Dickens stops the test as a favorite in a form or another favorite favorite holiday. <br /> <br /> I grew up watching the 1951 version of Alistair Sims, and he certainly was Scrooge, I am impressed with this version, when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays an acceptable and Ebenezer Scougg, and the actors who are playing demons are frightening and frightening. <br /> <br /> This version is beautifully portrayed and uses modern filming styles (as of 1980), making it more simplistic for my child than in 1951 black and white versions. <br /> <br /> The story is worthy of the story and is one that I see almost every year at any time in the Christmas season.
