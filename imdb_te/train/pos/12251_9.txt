It has been a while for me to watch this version unfortunately not seem to be able to rent only in the video store, the only other version but I fell in love. I'm always on the other side of Emma. Gwanneth and Tony Colelet, the British do not need to naturally make an accent, and I do not see it naturally. It seems to have been put on. Sorry but do not think Tony and Gweneth did an amazing job there. I could not afford any roles, but this version is the heart of the heart and the kind of person I was expecting Emma. This is definitely the version I will come back from now. I'm disappointed that Mr. Knightley is not good, but he's convincing. I'm also good at Jane Fairfax (played by Olivia Williams). I never warmed her up in the cinematic version, but she was shot well in this version. Come along with all the characters (along with Mr. Knightley), and think so little on the top. Unfortunately, the two departed at the same time and the Paltrow version got more publicity. Pitti ... I finally loved the new scene. Well Kate Beckinsale! If you're a Jane Austen fan, do not forget to watch this.
