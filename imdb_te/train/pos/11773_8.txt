The Bugs Buller has been performing on the windows display at the local department store in the late Bugs Bunny since the early years. After completing the day he comes to tell him that the manager will soon be transferred. Bugs is a new job taxidermy and he is happy to stick into numbers ... and that taxidermy stuffing should be done with the animals. Similar animals, a certain rabbit. This causes the adventures of the adventurous rabbit and his now ex-employer. I found this one of the best in the early 1940s to be one of these happiest and absolutely perfect one. It's funny after nearly 60 years. This animated shortcode can be found on Disc 1 of Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2. <br /> My grade:
