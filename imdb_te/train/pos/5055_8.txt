I did not expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. <br /> Ah! But the story is beautifully beautiful, beautifully photographed and opened. In this (basically) true story I was amazed and enjoyed. I would like to read more about this lovely character, which means the director fulfilled his intent, and the film was a success!
