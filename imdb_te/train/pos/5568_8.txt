It's not coherent or acceptable in smoke, but it's still very funny, unlike the nice dreams. There are some traditional scenes, where the scenes start at which they drive some gas and work for their car. Also funny cheek song (Mexican-Americans) and Chang's follow-up song. From the Police Academy Series, Jones (human noise machine), and another important scene from an old laughing man is the scenery of the welfare office with Jones. All in all, this smoke is a great follow up and smarter or when it is very watchable. <br /> -Celluloid rehab
