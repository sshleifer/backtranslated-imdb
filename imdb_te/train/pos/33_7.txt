<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this interesting, <br /> <br /> The movie is a year, directed by Emilio P. Miraglia, the most interesting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (also see my comment), the film starts off a little slowly, but in all, Do not waste sub-plot or scenes. /> <br /> The film was a German-Italian compression but was released in Germany on video in a cut-off version of the 15-minute plot under the stupid title "Horror House". At least the murder scenes, satisfying every gorhound, are completely intact and ultimately the viewer gets the inspiration of the killer. <br /> <br /> "La Dama Rosa Uccide Sette Volte" is a strongly ardent fan of Giovone Guy's fans and Miraglia's other thriller, with obligatory turns and red herring.
