I call it a tender but I really think that this is a great series. If you do not have the opportunity to experience some episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you must see it. It is more comprehensive than Voyager's caretaker, which opened the series with Cpt. The adventures of Javaye and Archer are totally different, still strange and familiar ... the music is very attractive. Any true size fi fi fan can go at least one star trek episode - and keeps waiting in these installments.
