<br /> <br /> A physician in New Orleans and a police in New Orleans has only 48 hours to identify a killer with pneumonia plague. <br /> <br /> The influential, classy, ​​thriller mad heart reaction directed by Elia Kazan. Fear in the Streets, taken and filmed and painted in and around New Orleans, is derived from the story of The Strats, the giant Em Cold by Edna and Edward Annett, an Oscar for the original story. It also has a good ensemble cast that offers top rated shows for their director. Richard Widmark [Marsson brought a StreetCard name before Cassen in the name of a StreetCard] <br /> <br> Image scores are its main suspense points, while Paul Douglas, Jack Fulton (as Walter Jack Palace) & the well-known Zero Monel, all the practiced hunters chase Where Kazan's chaotic ability to cut back and forth between prophecies Is harvested, its flow and mood. From Widmark's Public Health Doctor, with the hypodermic needle in his hand, running around trying to find the bad guys so he can do better; The bad guys who are so bad that they have such a wide range of hunting for themselves; The tension fever is stacked up to the breaking point. Thankfully, the last thirty minutes have become the cracks of the film. <br /> Three years before, Witchmark's own Tommy Yudo throws a nasty villain against one of the minds. <br /> This is an imaginative and deliberate story. The carriers of the disease. A knob on the community. It has elements of psychoanalysis, which should be combined with its basic policy thriller. Some unforgettable scenes are in line with the attacks by the Kazan created climactic climate. Some early psychological psychology speech threatens to portray the film on some talkie-based looms, but it is valuable to be late. Not necessarily a movie-noir and possibly Kazan, but certainly a highly recommended movie movie enthusiasts should be identified by a new generation, and the old Gary might have lost the day he regained it. 7.5 / 10
