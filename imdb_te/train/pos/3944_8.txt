This little movie is on my "keeper" list for a long time. Did people recognize that emotionally disturbed women (as well as mentally retarded) can be emphasized by the medical profession at the beginning of the century? !! It is hard to find true emotional feelings that allow us to understand human beings that are at all of the sacred Christian perspectives of that time and allow us to receive the suffering souls. Can you really imagine Walt Whitman's books (by today's standards) banned? Because he admitted to having great feelings for women with emotions and emotional reactions. Think about it! The sensitivity of the film is still available to me and I have given this composer to the director by his eyes.
