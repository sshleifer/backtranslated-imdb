Gundam Wing is a pleasant show. I usually appreciate joining Gundam and Anime. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Hiro is the top dog, and he is the top dog in the end, personalities will not change, The best character is Zechs, a series of all intents and purposes for the whole series, but suddenly he cheated him in this series and turns into a villain. <br /> <br /> Mecha: Wing great guy I have some designs of the OZ suite to be some of the classic geo suits but sweet suit designs have not saved the series from so many boring characters. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: , The wing has cold fighting scenes, but with the recycling animation, the shallow plots and paths Development. Fun, but not moving like the previous Gundam outings.
