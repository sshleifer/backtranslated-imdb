OK Clara Bow's silent film from 1927, a spin-off of Rhine in bowling, played the daughter of the local pineapple king's half-Hawaiian forest, falling in love with Staidy English engineer Clive Brook. Bow is competing with the local widow (Artet Kınıl) for his vision, but both men get big surprise when watching his wife (Patricia DuPont). Divorce's wife is ready for divorce until she knows that she is on the verge of her fortune. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] Bow stayed with his other scenes and had some great scenes: her early nude bath, her hula in grass luxury, and a rescue rescue dog with bow and bruk. <br /> Note: IMDb credit list wrong. Image Credits (I have from the DVD) Patricia Dupont Mrs. Like the Haldane Play List --- like the IMDb list Margaret Troakes.
