Leslie Charteris' novels of portraits of the Sydney Templar ("The Saint") came to the end of the 1930s and brought George Sanders as a templar. Saunders is usually rarely played by villains (in Rage in Heaven in Robert Montgomery's Frankford "best friend"), rarely "nice characters" (Fosszen Kerpeppen's Phosphotite, in The Insel Harry's Stranzes Case). Here's his good looks and happy behavior, Templar Chester Morris as a shadowy shadow hero like "Boston Blackie" and (somewhat) Peter Lorre's "Code of Motivation" Mr. Moto ". <br /> Film is not the best series of Mystery Mystery Serials - but they work. Like Rathbone's Holmes series or the series of Oleans Chan, the show often repeats the characters characters (Which acted opposite heroine Wendy Barry in the second film of the film), and the little familiar image sets plot the dialog buzz (always sanders' brain in placing a foot forward Showing) a comfortable experience for viewers. <br /> <br /> These secrets are inaccurate due to the fact that the best writers of the rhetoric can not be repeated again without repeating the old ideas, and she agreed to Barry that she knew it for a long time and shortly after her escape from the police. But when dealing with the cinematography of a criminal conductor, it is clear that this person is very easy to be admired as a mysterious mastermind (ie, the script disguises him as the least suspect). <br /> <br /> <ref> Bare after proof that her father (a jailer in prison) is made up of real culprits in a robbery gang. Her cups such as William Gargan are with many people who help her - and she received advice from the conductor in the planning pesky burglaries that did not pin her. D.A. Her father was convicted (Jeremon Cowan) and she decided to get Bari and her gang. Jonathan Haley, the only detective who has the possibility of solving the case, will shade the suder and reluctantly work with him. <br /> <br /> There are some good moments in the cast in the cast - Hale (now in a special diet) was tempted to eat a great lobster dinner made for Sanders by Willie Best. Sanders and Barry Saunders are forced to flee the apartment, resulting in severe confusion. <br /> <br /> Sanders must remember him better to go to a place where he had to go for some time. <br /> <br /> Gilbert Emery also has an interesting role. Generally good people (such as the Beaten-Beaten husband in the world) he is socially famously weakened here - whose death reminds of a character in a Bogart movie. <br /> <br /> A film made in 1939 was a well-made film for house billing second half. It will give you entertaining, even if it's not in your memory.
