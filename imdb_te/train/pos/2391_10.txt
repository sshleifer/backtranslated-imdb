My husband and I love DoodleBops like our 8 month old baby. We bought him DVDs and CDs, so we can see them and we can hear them. They are fun, powerful, and very entertaining. They encourage children to be active, share and preserve. They always have a positive message, along with pleasant entertainment. Every time our boy turns his song to the television and enthusiasts come up with enthusiasm. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has a great voice. Mo's great dancer. I would like to use DoodleBops for children with kids. Our favorite song The Bird Song. You can not help but smile and want to dance when you hear it.
