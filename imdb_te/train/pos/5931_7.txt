Although Stephen King wrote, if an overtraining writer was already present, it was actually a bit entertaining for the B-movie. The candle-lit house Vampire, the invisible creatures virgins, the great burial scene, the heroic cats and the life of the most beautiful virgins. Soundtrack also has the music of Enya, the idea I've found most ... nice. I am undoubtedly disappointed with this small film, yet it has bad words and ideas from all of the real and dismal King Paboiler. (Although sleepwalkers, I understood that there was no script or short story behind it). Still, the sewage-odds touched on that show he did not use a ghost-writer after all ...
