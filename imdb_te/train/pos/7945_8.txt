I'm a fan of animal films. If you take a plot and make the animals the main actors, you can usually win me. Homewood bound made this. They were old by the time and took a plunge by putting a new spin on it. It's a complete success. This is an arctiple image too. You have a clever and logical group's mood-wan (shadow), you have lovable but ungodly and untrustworthy chans, and she has a pampered and famous princess who wants to be praised. These three people bounce off each other. I also liked how I made dynamic characters like Chance and Sassy, ​​and they did not overtake it. Many people do not think it's good because it's a lot of children in the movie. What they are forgetting is that this is considered a child's film and it is still far away from the best film. A good picture you see when you're bored and you want to see a movie. It is a Disney film without cartoons, an airy film with a good plot. I, without a doubt, will advise you to see.
