The 74th Oscar is very good. Job's work as EmCee is very funny, and light. I personally received some strong reviews due to coarse language and salacious jokes, she loved past apperance, but it's fine. The audience liked it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen, and Sidney Poitierre recalled Oscar for recalling this.
