My 2-year-old Doodlebops likes to show the show, which seems to keep her attention for a while. Characters are of basic colors and are of interest to everything. There is no academic purpose that can benefit from the intended target audience, but they try to teach each participant and teach the children about sharing and respect and other basics, so I like it. It is well produced with high production values. But really like the average performance of most of the presentations on TV today. We do not buy into the commercial perspective and our son has Dooblebop wearing everything. If we ever get to town, I do not think we will spend money on going live. Going to a zoo or science center is a good feeling for everyone and money in my opinion is good.
