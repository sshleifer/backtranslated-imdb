I do not know about this film even if it is not for its "surprise" Oscar nomination for the best animated film. Thankfully, I can see this animated little treasure. <br /> <br /> There is a story about Ballon Brendan, nephew of the solemn and exaggerated Abbott of Kelly's Township. Abbott's predecessor is the building to build a wall to protect the Keles from the invading Vikings. One day, Aiden, a famous painter from Iona, Aidan opens Branden's eye illustration and the appeal of the outside world. Also, Brendan White's friendship with the sprite eyeliner, he tried to restore the precise art of book scenes as an ancient crystal. <br /> <br /> "The Secret of Kells" is a part of the animation released today. This is a throwback, with precision geometric lines and drawings in design, without much precautions for illustrations and realities. The movements of these lines are initially reminiscent of the simplest yet fluid animation style used at the beginning of "Kung Fu Panda". However, the spectacular use of color is the main source of astounding audiences. The Reds used in the Viking aggression is unforgettable haunt. <br /> <br /> Try to catch the silent gem of this film. It's a welcome break from all the fraudulent explosions of the current animated fare like "Animation vs. Aliens" and such. As the film stimulates the penetration of fantasy, the Celtic musical score is less effective. Well, the story is a little disappointing and a little wanting. I'd like to know more about Brendan and Aiden's book. But the clear star of the film is clearly depicted in its excellent sculptural masterpiece, the Real Book of Kells.
