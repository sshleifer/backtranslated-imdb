This is a story of Winchester Rifle Model 1873 "West the Gun that the West". This is a wealthy possession of Winchester 73, for Ashman, the authority, peace officer or soldier. <br /> <br /> Winchester 73 Director is the first collaboration between Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. A new, psychological depth for the genre. Lynne MacAdham sees Stingworth chasing the guy who killed his father. His loyal friend, Johnny Williams, goes to Dodge City with [Millard Mitchell], Lynn runs to the Dutch Henry Brown {Stephen McNally] who he wants. But while White Erp {Gerer] took all the firearms from entering the town, the two men are unable to fire as they are ready. In the competition to win the Winchester 73 Rifle instead of men, Linn finally won the competition. Before he left town with an amazing gift, the Dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle and the city rapidly chases. <br /> When Lin man and gun fills filling, the rifle changes hands several times, each time adding another dimension to the calculation of all the procedures. Benchmark for the so-called "psychedelic", Winchester 73 is a story of a good man who basically casts boundaries through his earlier incident. Tho black and white paintings [only one of the western nations Deus] landscapes are still breathtaking treats for the eyes. The opening scene, like Lynn and Johnny, sets the tone on horseback and in Silhouette, they go to Dodge City over the hill. <br /> <br /> Man is the starting point for using his vests as a way of running simultaneously in the emotional states of his characters. <br /> <br /> Stewart is one of the best and most versatile actresses in the United States for his finest and most serious performances. Supported cast is not too bad either. Michelle, McNally, Gear and the great Don Durrias are always related to other categories. Here are bit parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, an Indian brave playing an Indian bravery. <br /> <br /> This film is a script ready to run a project of Fritz Long. But Long walked away from it, proving that it was a blessing to the Western fans. Long directed directing, directed by Man, with a new script from Borden Chase & Robert Richards}, which set wheels in motion to change the way of the genre. In addition to the efforts made by Man & Stewart, who also influenced them. Bead Bottic, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller took notes for everyone, happy for Western purists, pursued and pushed further emotional flames. <br /> <br /> After Win Bigster at the box office, Winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still prepares a punch in the modern era. 9.5 / 10
