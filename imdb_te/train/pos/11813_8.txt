It's not difficult to take Warren Betty's take on a "dick tracy", the 1990 film adaptation of Chester Gould's famous comic strip, anything less of a genre classic. <br /> <br /> In recent years, superhero films come out of the woods, and may soon become a genre in their style. <br /> <br /> The Beatty film is entirely influenced by the basic materials of Gold, the primary colors, and these trigger-happy mutant gangsters and baggy, seductive ladies giving a lush visual style and the unique yet familiar world of the tone. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" looks at his appearance and deadly characters, Beatty himself, <br /> <br /> Visual gifts and Oscar winner Apart from makeup, the plot and the big boy caprice (Al Pacino, the over-the-top in the Oscar nominated performance), tries to remove the trail <br /> <br /> Tracy once again juggens her relationship with Tes Troyart Magnanimous. Glenn Headley), who has his name, is loyal to him and cares for The Cry (Charlie Corso), who eventually sees a father who appears as our criminal-destructive hero. Tracey's credibility with Tes was tested by the enthusiastic breakthrough of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), also the Big Boy's main squeeze. At the same time, all of these go downstairs, when the new criminal comes into town, things turn out to be hot and decide to play on both sides of the center. <br /> <br /> These performances are fine in Beatty View Leeds is the centerpiece of everything between sexy and romantic relationships, as well as focusing on meaningless action and special effects. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is the best and most neglected movie of the comic books. <br /> <br /> If Chester Gould is still alive, I feel proud that Warren Betty is taken into his beloved crime-fighting detective. <br /> <br />
