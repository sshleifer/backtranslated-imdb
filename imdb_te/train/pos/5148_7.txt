I do not know what these pictures are. But movies about history or religion have always been criticized for their accuracy. But it's not 100% accurate. It is difficult to make 100% accurate images these days when "experts" disagree with each other. <br /> <br /> I want to make a film for this film, and it will pick up all the bugs. But I agree with his criticism that his childhood years went very fast. The series has a three-part story, the first part of his childhood. <br /> <br /> I have only one problem with this film, it is the fact that it says in a history. The book is the way. Particularly the second part is the amount of events that took place. I'd like to see more Hitler more humane (more questions he asks for himself). I think it's good to play 'Max' in Noah Taylor's film. I am happy and still own it on DVD. Remember what has happened and Carlyle should look the best. 7.5 / 10
