The characters I loved in this movie are people that you feel. The man who is once again is in love with a girl in love. Tom Drake is always in love with his life and precisely in Donna Read. He is hungry by her and thinks she has many feelings for her, such as her contraction and confusion. The rest of the quirky characters at the store are perfect when they try to bring them together. But a very touching scene, a young couple in his great-grandfather's home. I laughed in some episodes and enjoyed watching this movie. In fact, I saw 5 times. Must see for a perfect amount of romantics.
