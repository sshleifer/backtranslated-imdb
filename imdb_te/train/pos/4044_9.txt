I have seen this film very well. The campus is very imaginative, and as a journalist I pulled along with the development of the characters. In the beginning it is enough to keep hidden from the viewer, and from both the action and the production of the most thoughtful and most satisfying image <br /> <br /> Some people seem to be looking for a non-stop roller-coaster ride with the movie - collecting from the gate One of those. First you slow down the hill slowly to have one another in the coaster - creating an imagined feeling - in the end, in my mind, more in the beginning of the foundation. <br /> The best image.
