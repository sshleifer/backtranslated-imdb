Not Swayed by Naysayers. This is a fantastic horror movie. This is the author / director J.T. This is the thesis project. He did a great job on my edge. I never really expect what to do, and for a disgusting horror movie lover, this is Nirvana! The tree lays a special lag about an old man living in a cabin. One day, when Woods is looking for his cat, he's a child killed, or he? He mocked the rest of the film. There are no conversations until the last few sequences. I found this secret. The author is able to capture your feelings and give them a relentless tug. Give this image a go, you will not be disappointed.
