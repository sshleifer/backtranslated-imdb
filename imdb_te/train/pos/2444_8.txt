"George LOPEZ," in my opinion, is a perfect ABC classic! I do not see every episode, but I'm still enjoying it. There are many episodes that I enjoyed. Amy (Sandra Bullock) is one of the machines when moving into the moving piece of machinery. If you want to know why, you have to see it for yourself. Before I closed, everyone always gave a good performance, the production model was amazing, the clothes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. At the end, even though new episodes can be seen right now, I strongly recommend it to catch it in case it goes off the air for good.
