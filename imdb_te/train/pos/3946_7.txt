I've found a single comment about this film and I'm absolutely strict, so I decided to write my own. When I first saw the film, I first saw it and it has been found a few more times since then. First of all say, overall, the film is right, that's worth it. It does not matter to have some low budget quirks and other defects. It's worth watching. An excellent Miss-En Scene idea to visit a detained, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Walt Whitman's Southern Ontario and build a movie to bring people to life. The film is about the inspiration of the humanitarian catalyst type Whitman people. And that is exactly right in that sense. Acting - especially Rip Torn (Whitman) and Cole Foyer as Dr. - is great. Scripting and dialogues are strong and the timing and reflections of the time are appropriate. Overall, what's not like? In addition to this, should another name be brought to the most obvious way to the life of Whitman?
