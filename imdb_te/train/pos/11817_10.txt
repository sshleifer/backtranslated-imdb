I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I do not know that I have no actors, and I do not know it will be different than what is being previewed. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty's 1930 Detective Dick Tracy is a crime fighter in the city for the biggest mob's superiors. During this time, Big Boy Caprais (Al Pacino) killed a very powerful man and captured the city with her singing friend Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) with her eye on Tracy. It's a new criminal invasion and the worst part because it's even worse: this criminal is not the face. He or she does not know much. Plus, returned from the prominent Willis comic book collection. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was very colorful and creative. It's especially fun and fun to watch as a child. <br /> <br /> Charlie Corrsmo, Glenn Headley, William Forsyth, Dustin Hoffman, James Ken, Ed O. An ensemble cast of the film: Warren Beatty as James Bond in the 1930s. 'Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning. Plus more! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a fun movie to enjoy for a movie and a family of all ages. Take my word for it.
