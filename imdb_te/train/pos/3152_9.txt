This presentation is absolutely cool, and I'm always looking forward to seeing it.All the characters are funny and awesome, each episode has offered nonstop laughter, and it's completely different from entertaining and other programs that can help you but love this show, just perfectly insane and breathtaking funny . There are some dead weight episodes, but the 70s always managed to create a kind of atmosphere where you really do not really like it. This is one of the best shows ever to broadcast, and anytime I can see this presentation, never old, never ever and never incomplete.
