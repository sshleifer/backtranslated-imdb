Good luck to see this film - it has not yet been released on tape or DVD. I saw the release of the early 70s, lucky enough to catch it by the American cinematographer's preservation efforts, and for some thirty years had some obvious moments with me. <br /> <br /> Ravint is the perfect comments here. Shortly after the success of Five Easy Peas, as the director of the upcoming success, Jack N is said to have made the low budget effort as best as possible, some of which would certainly be backward and cut back in the meddering. But it's also a memorable sign for time: 60 final college sports, student movements, sexual revolution, and more all very serious clashes. <br /> Why do we see this movie? It is perhaps a ground breaker in some scenes: the dust of the game is the dust of the game; The scene of Karen Black with a stroll in the car can guard you a bit - but the first use is that I do not witness in the movie. And general and unexpected use of general nudity. <br /> <br /> See for a good surprise of Cindy Williams, one of her earliest films; A slim David Ogend Stairs; Mike Warren is ready for a fresh and dark blue TV uniform from his dry-blue UCLA uniform; Robert Town - actor; <br /> Now: Any relationship between Harry Gates's last name, Robert Town, and a role between Chinatown and Two Jacks. <br /> It counts "7" based on Karen Black. Why you will see.
