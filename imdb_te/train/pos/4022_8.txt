Dr. Dwivedi's other descriptive work on this topic takes us to Punjab, which was previously supported by us. Dr. Dwivedi chose a difficult thing for his film. He has completed all the details to bring the story to life. <br /> <br /> Even though we did not come to this area at the time, the sets and costumes were real. Unlike many movies on the partition, it does not focus on the details of the torture of violence to attract the audience, but on the later effects. Characters come to life. Priyan Chatterjee has done a wonderful performance. Manoj Bajpai showed his heart's misfortune. The rest of the actors did a good job.
