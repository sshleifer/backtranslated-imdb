14-year-olds have now been able to make fantasy films that look very good and they are all angry with the loads of Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia at the box office. This year's looking (and has already seen) many, especially the Golden Compass, is the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust based on the novel by Neil Gaiman, has seen a little more than a pip in theaters this week. I saw only ads, and only saw two commercials. Critical response is blah type. I can not see that a friend does not have to wait to see Bourne Ultimatum and I can not make this weekend interesting. Well, if you forgive the terrible pan, the stars should be properly aligned, because I have gone to see stardust, and I enjoyed it. Not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is full of barriers to your very basic fantasy quest (the hero directs outside for a fallen star). But within that basic shape, the story is lively and imaginative. It's just too fun to be, and a lovely little romance. And it was a wonderfully successful one. There are a lot of movies this summer, but none of them are fun. It's going to be quite a lot, but the story is well told and fully cohesive. It's not a masterpiece, but it's definitely like a princess bride but it can occupy the same kind of playground (although I did not like it before). If you're a fan of the genre here is very fun.
