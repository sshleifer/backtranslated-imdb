There is a pretty good low budget horror film to exploit fears associated with abortion. Although the supporting cast was pretty average for a b-grader, it was well-played by good-looking Brooke Adams and b-filmmaker James Karen. Music is very good for all people by Gary Numan. The script of Henry Dominic is very intelligent for this type of thing, yet there is a reference point for it. Rodman Fender's direction is just enough, and there are some unnecessary cheap fears. If you're a fan of Adams, his movie career is not as close to somewhere as possible, check it out; She is as great as ever.
