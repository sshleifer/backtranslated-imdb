<br /> <br /> Sidewalk ends Very good film-Noir crime scene and well-shot in black and white and city. <br /> <br /> When a copper accidentally assumed the murder and he shaved this, he blamed the other person who did not like the person who had previously committed a lot of crimes. <br /> <br /> 'Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (The Streets of San Francisco, Beside the Poseidon Adventure) and Craig Stevens (The Deadly mantis). <br /> If you get the chance, the side-by-side edges are being checked. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.
