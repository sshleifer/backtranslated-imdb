Last night I had a night out feature of "Before Sunrise" (1995) and "Before Sunset" (2004), and I saw two pictures in a row, really the meaning of each film to catch my breath or think. <br /> <br /> Before Sunrise introduced us with young actors, Ethan Hawk (Reality Bites, Dead Poets), I refused. Society), only when the film was released 25; And Julie Delpy (The Three Colors Trilogy), then 26 (who are very young). A famous American writer who travels in Europe after leaving his girlfriend; She is a young French student who goes to Paris home. They meet on the Budapest-Vienna train and decide to combine a sudden rail. <br /> <br /> The film, written in the 1990s: Together with the beautifully captured streets in Vienna, overnight, technology rapidly hit, the new millennium awaiting all the hopes and dreams in the corner, filled. Saline's accent is wrong or intended, half American-half French, and it swings from one spectrum to another, breaks the character, all the flaws and inequality (hayk) and Celine (Delpy) reliability), the mirror of time. The film was really working for me, making all the clich√©s and romantic and managing to have audiences for audiences, watching such a meaning and enthusiasm as a rare pair. <br /> If the director is not familiar with you, you do not know whether it is more valuable if the film is in direct direction. <br /> <br /> Sunrise urban scenes Vienna, a scientific romantic meeting, and for some time in the future I will come back for more insight.
