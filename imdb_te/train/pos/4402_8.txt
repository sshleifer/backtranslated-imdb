After watching Jesse James, Quentrel, Jaya Harker, and Fifty films, the film is thrilled to see a new perspective by director Ang Lee. Laurence, Kansas's assault scene is awesome. Romantic relationships between Jewel and Toby McGuire have become one of the best episodes, and Jonathan Rice-Meers is as dynamic as the bad guy. The film will feel the horror of the horror and you will not know if the next hours will survive. Definitely worth seeing.
