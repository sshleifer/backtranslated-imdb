Zorro is the best of serials and one of my favorite serials, as long. It's a serious set after Mexico was born. The new country republics will be counted on the gold produced by the town to keep the solution. However, a gold god, Dan del Oro, cut off Indians and stole gold. To protect its zorro and his team. Reed Hadley winner Zorro and he cut a brisk figure as he gets into a good choice of scraps (most likely later reunited by Zorro serials as well as other serials) .The story is merely a real bad guy who moves and is not clear of its well - There is a reason I've seen most of this serial most seen, its just a great action adventure movie. The only thing I could compare with is Tyrone Power and Zorroch Mark or one of the other switchbackers in that period. Its super and highly recommended.
