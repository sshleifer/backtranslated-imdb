I L.A. I do not know what the film is until reading about it in weekly. I generally agree with reviews from LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film. Movies Molly Parker (from my favorite television show Deadwood) and Lucas Haas - who I suspect will see more in the near future. This film is funny, hearty, great acting and beautiful photography. I do not know if the film is distributed, but I hope it does - or will - soon. It was decided that it was a real indie gem. It is also my favorite band silver Gentiles music! The only disappointment missing at Molly Parker's screening. There's also without her ... hands down the best picture I've seen at the festivities.
