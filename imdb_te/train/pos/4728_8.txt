<br /> <br /> I laugh some fairly belly and some characters (especially Eric Roberts) scream. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, but mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations. The script is soft and patches, the plot is effortlessly developed and acting is still fresh and comfortable. <br /> The film is at least 10 to 15 at the Film Festivals. <br /> I recommend 'break a leg'.
