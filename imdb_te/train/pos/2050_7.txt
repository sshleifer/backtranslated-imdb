Everyone has to pay bills and Christopher Walken. <br /> In Vietnam, a soldier learns that a soldier ends his war and returns home when he finds some POWs, including Christopher Walken. After Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderstorms Fight, and then a small massacre. Wallen and some Colombian person separated the dollar bill that some or other promises were made. <br /> <br /> The present cut (1991) has led to a revolution against the Colombian Guy El Presidency. He first succeeded, but El president threatens to destroy them with a tank, who surrenders and filmed on the head in live television. This is entirely described in detail as a news flash in the American tail that leads Wakeen to attack the Columbia and thousands of guns and build the old test. <br /> <br /> Mc Bain is a monumentally stupid movie, but it is also a good laugh, and a lot of action packed. One of the films that has been given a wide berth for logic - how can a wake-wave be able to shoot a fighter pilot from head to head, or even a window break? Similarly, the number of dealer dealers in New York, New York, New York, is struggling. <br /> <br /> The B-movie chewing to chewing from Michael Ironside's cruel acting in Vietnam is much more than a fairytale division between the Sequence, Veerren and El Presidency, the heroic but completely pointless death of one of the leaders, and in television in America, the sister of the rebellious leader Do not forget the awkward speech. <br /> <br /> It is there for a quid. Buy it if you have a sense of humor. See how often you can see the camera staff.
