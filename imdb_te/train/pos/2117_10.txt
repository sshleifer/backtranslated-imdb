Every time I watch this film, I'm attracting more to the whole product. I decided to be the best romantic comedy I made. Everyone involved is accurate; Script, acting, direction, sets and compilation. James Stewart can always rely on good acting, and the supporting cast is fantastic, this is Marzaret Sullivan, which tells her a lesser motivated actress. Her tragic personal life is not easy to gain comedy acting skills, where she deceives her as an actress. Lubitsch managed to get the best and he clearly gave his best. See the number of scenes - this is a tape - breathtaking.
