I was entertained throughout this brilliant documentary and I was waiting for a good time to get through the pipes (my local video chain), and waited. I like a good documentary / special interest piece, but it's definitely a hearty, honest, and nostalgic, if you want, look back in the life of a teenager. A child's imagination is lovely, and it starts with a great story. Rent it or buy it if you like a good, humorous and entertaining documentary. Mr. Steyn and the companies are sure to convert people from the neighborhood to video camcorder productions bank hold-ups, and from a gloss from homosexual rings. It's good that they are all successful in the respectable fields and they are still good friends. The DVD has some additional trailers for other good documentaries, and is Darren's most popular productions, including Crazy News.
