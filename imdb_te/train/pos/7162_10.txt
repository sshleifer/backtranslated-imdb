This is one of my favorite films. I've read the book and liked it, but this book is spread over what's popular. This performance is amazing, especially from Mr. Jon Vaught, who played a very bad role. The film has a certain way of telling you that you are hooked up, and everything is pulled together for a great end. Even today, I love the way I'm directing and backing Stanley's ancestors' stories. This story was written by Luis Sachar, but it seems that the story was created for the film and made a great job directed by Andrew Davis. I definitely recommend this to anybody enjoying good movies.
