Yes, this is a chick movie and it moves very slowly, but it really looks great - and I feel like a manly man. Are you in love with Judy Davis, and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural, persuasive performance. <br /> <br /> The scenery of the small, coastal spot is beautiful and the main theme of the film. Unknown (at least I do not know) Actors and actresses are a realist of the film that will keep you eye-catching and keeps your attention. Overall, I give 8/10. Let's see.
