When I was in high school many years ago, I saw this movie with my mother. I'm definitely not at least bit of interest at opera in time, but he changed my views. I enjoyed this movie too and really enjoyed opera ever since. I also bought a number of his CDs. He was asked by his acting abilities, which he basically just played, which is adorable. He is pretty, attractive; I wanted to be honest with him. I feel very sad, so many people are strictly criticizing him. It's quite simple, people around him are not round him or he has not ruled out his actions. He deserves to respect and praise his talents. He's definitely gone !!!
