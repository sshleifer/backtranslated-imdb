The 1986 Italian-French remake of the same name, which began with the same name in 1946, was initially hot and could not get us to the wind. The story is about a high school student (Federico Pitzlis), who can not keep his eyes from the lovely beautiful young girl (Dutch phenomenon Marius Dittamers) who lives next to the school. One day, he follows her, and his consistency off payments. There is only one problem: she or a brutal offense might not be committed, and if he praised, he probably retained a sketch character (Ricardo de Torreburna), who had a chance to lose a slap on the wrist. Also, this is confirmed when the young woman is a little "funny in the head", and we realize she has seen the boy's father, who is a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability is similar to her fantastic sexual desires. From the hot, hot, hot, hot form, a bomb shell performance from the beautiful leads and dummers, from scene to scene plays to us as yo-yo (like a boy), and then - the end. R and X (!) Rated versions.
