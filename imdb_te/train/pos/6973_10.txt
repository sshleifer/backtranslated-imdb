BSG is one of my all time favorite TV series. It was lucky enough to start looking when I got the series last season. It's a marathon from completing me and what it's a wonderful ride! <br /> <br /> When I saw the Hulu Pilot, I know what I did with the Capicca - title. However, if you have not yet added some of the two sequences, it is still pretty much implemented. <br /> <br /> Battlestar does not mention Holobands in Galactica or about virtual worlds, but why are not so far away for them to explain them? <br /> <br /> Universe, technology, alternative worlds of our world. This program is very interesting and you want to see more!
