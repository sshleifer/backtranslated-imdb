I just never tire of watching FREEBIRD. My husband was an add-on I was involved in the beginning. The zon was kept in touch and the film was aired in the movie and now promoting DVD release. Cross-Channel ferries across France and distributed postcard postcards on different locations. The FREEBIRD is directed with a definite combination of expertly written and pleasant and intense movements plus selection casting. Phil Daniels is more likely to fit in the role of Grouch. In January, after the premiere, the party had a great lead in the zone and cast. Anyone can ask you to do the money, email or phone, and you will know how to get me. Sue Xx
