HOLES is not your average Disney stuff - it's also great fun for adults who are usually awkward at the cutesy, Focus-group design "Family Entertainment" that goes with Uncle Walt's studio live-action. The original book of the mystery of the success of this movie is perhaps its loyalty, which is a little darker than its average kid stuff. This action starts when Stanley Yelnats sends a boys prison camp, where all prisoners force the ditch to dive under the desert sun. But as the story progresses, Stanley's story is associated with a legendary treasure, and the adventure is ten times more fun than any Disney movie about a boys' prison camp. Jon Voight is particularly nasty and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.
