The film is the first film when Ashley Judd and I see the first film of Victor Nunez, I have always said and I am happy. Its silent tone, its relaxed pace, the original depiction of a youthful woman is just the beginning of life, the best depiction of the struggles to make his mark in his life, the decisions that make her real decisions, the people she meets - the film is nothing wrong. I've always seen outside the "Star Wars" films, the film is close to the magic, and the one thing that the movie means is that this film really deserves a higher rating. Ashley Judd's Acting, Mr. Nunez's Writing, and its' great storytelling story makes this a good upcoming story and a fantastic movie.
