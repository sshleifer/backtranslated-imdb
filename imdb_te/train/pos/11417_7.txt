The film hit me as a project that has a lot of work for me, but now they do not come together too. I do not know who it is, but it has a slightly Disney-esque feel. The components in it are inconsequential (while walking for the front office of a teens) and preventing the story from being taken seriously, but there is a normal healthy dose (anyway) to keep balance and perspective. Good acting. Strangely, it is to convince the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit ... off. She is interesting to see how her best friend, her grandmother, and her work to keep balance between her two wishes: ballet and baseball. Being a baseball player, Frankie is very painful to see her catch in the boy's team, but does a good job of showing her the fight she faces. I read somewhere that she is not really ballet, but the editing of the film has done a lot of work to make her dance look rather natural. Overall, a good film about honesty and ambition, but its star Mitchell Barton does not achieve much of the realism level that she plays in "Lawn Dogs", "Lost and Deliras", and her little but surprising performance "Halle Joel Osmond" .
