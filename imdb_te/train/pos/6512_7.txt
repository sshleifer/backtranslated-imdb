As my baby sitter was a fan, I saw a lot of old parts when I was growing up. I'm not sure why I gave up the TV when I performed this presentation so I'm not a Scooby Doo fan. I was enjoying my surprise. Shaggy and Scooby are only interesting characters * Dodges tomatoes from others fan * I like that they only focus on those two. However, the actual performances may cause fans to hate it. I like voice acting, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I also liked listening to him before he knew Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen sounds with me as he really enjoyed his job as an actor. I get a kick of techies with their little autistic individuals and their desires to play Dugins and Dragons or Star Wars (of course not, that's not by those names).
