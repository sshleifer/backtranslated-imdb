For you who have read the highly respected novel of Rohiton Mistry, this film will surely impress you, because it is an admirable adaptation. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a small subplot, Sturla Gannersson's first book (late line) is almost dead entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've read the novel, it might be a little tricky for you. This is definitely not a big movie drama story. Instead it has a strong element of realism, but I can not. The best way to explain such a long journey to fans is to say that the Hindu version is smaller in 'Fidelhar on the Roof'. Gustad Nobel journalist, instead of a Jewish / Russian poliman in Bombay in the 1970s during the Muslim / Hindu war with Pakistan. His unborn daughter, his personal eldest son, faces a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his unfriendly neighbors and a distant friend who is associated with unhealthy neighbors. Ending is not a joy, it is not a sad thing, but the reality is that it is essential. <br /> <br /> Such a long journey is a good little picture, but if you want to see, it's good luck. Unlike the novel, it received very little release.
