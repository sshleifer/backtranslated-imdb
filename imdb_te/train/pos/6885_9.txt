It was a surprise. . . The impact and criticism of this movie came in my automatic way of reacting to people & situations. The confusion of emotional anger is very clear. Being a bad baby when responding to not getting their way out. . If you are angry as an angry. I am hiding this anger from others is a very ridiculous purgatory. What did this cost me? So much happiness. . Many blessings. Now how can I feel proud and have a continuing attitude towards life? . Without a certain path to my wild expectations for life, for what is happening in the moment, I have to be "to be" the way life or people think. The film has contributed to the freedom I now have to connect with others without limits and expectations. . And connect with true love. . Without fear of loss. . First love, and accept what is given to love.
