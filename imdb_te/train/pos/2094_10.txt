65 years since Thalberg's last production was shot. But fellow IMDB members come, this film is definitely one of the masterpieces of 30! It was the first film in the New York Museum of Modern Art in 1970 (I was a teenager). Watching such poverty scenes is expensive, talented, often thrilling, and always appealing, for me it is the best of MGM's making. <br /> <br /> Last week, the Academy Awards watched by a devastating attacker, a man by destroying a man, horrifying poverty, and a "senior" Oscar winner, Louis Rainier. Well, she was one of the most masterful, haunting performances that argued Grandma to look up an actress, not a year ago (great Ziegfeld) should not have won. But do not blame Louis. It was only a decade-old talkie when it was released, and her conversation was limited. But as Olan, her use of visual and voice was memorable. <br /> <br /> What do you want a movie lover to be big and touching?
