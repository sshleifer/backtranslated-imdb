I'm 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluis are a great pair. This movie is really funny and I love songs. My favorite songs "You Can not Have a Good Dog" and that song about sharing, I feel "What is mine is yours". This is the final film with Judith Barce, who played Anne-Mary's voice. My favorite character Charlie but I find Itchy's voice is very fun to hear. I've found some scenes really scary, and it's hard for me to look at the Charlie's eyes, and the carpets made me out of me. Other characters like King Gator have found that I am really funny. The end is adorable and actually sad, it made me cry a little. I give 7/10 to this film.
