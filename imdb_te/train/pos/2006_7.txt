At this time it seems almost unnecessary that a company like Jon Bon Jovi Derek Bliss reveals a strong, patchy presentation. His ability as an actor was established by critically acclaimed earnings in other movies (The Leading Man, No Backs). But, if someone is still wondering, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can work. He could work well and came to anticipate him. <br /> <br /> I usually see horror movie. I have come to focus on the dialogue and the plot rather than the dialogue gore. I'm so happy with this film, where there really was a real plot. The film is not too much to focus on, and there is no realistic quality that can disturb the images with high technically effective budgets. <br /> <br /> Unlike the action movie like "U-571", the conversation is a "good guys", taking the back seat to the bomb and actually guarding what's going to happen to them. Some scenes are unexplained (such as Derek's hallucinations), but you'll find some things like laying the foundation for the sequel. Unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by Hollywood in the film, the sequel will never happen. <br /> Is this the best film ever seen in my life? It is good to have fun for forty hours. Yes. It insomned the scary movies of insane films, and the horror filmmaker should not be completely disappointed. If you are somewhere between deeply and horror style lover of horror style, this picture is for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
