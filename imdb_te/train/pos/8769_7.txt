Gentleman Jim Erico Flynn is playing a famous brass as a brush, but the attractive social climber stops for breathing. This does not mean Flynn's The Charge of the Light Brigade is looking for historical accuracy - it all pulled up stops, filmed at a surprisingly luxurious level and gave the real feel of power through the bright direction of Raul Walsh. Alliance Smith takes the Sidekack task at this time with Flynn's father (this time he'd guess he suffered a light heart attack during production), with a pretty romantic sparring partner and a good sidekick Alan Hale along with good measure. In fact, the pirate Géléon has been somewhat out of the boat on a pile of frolic from the earlier paintings! 103 minutes just breeze.
