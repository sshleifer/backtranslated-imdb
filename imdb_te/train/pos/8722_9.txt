For starters, it is a very funny picture of some silly characters running around are laughing (do check Russian Russian leaks). <br /> <br /> A Bugs Life is a classic Disney storyline, but it's good about the film. Family values ​​are appreciated, and in the final part of the film the main characters come to stand against the grasshopper. And it also has great voice-overs by Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Space (of course) ... but actually the most amazing thing about this film is the animation. It is amazing. All details, great colors, different ant with each, beautiful backgrounds ... and boys and girls at Pixar made it look realistic. All in all, a very good piece of work. This is the best animation from Disney to Aladdin.
