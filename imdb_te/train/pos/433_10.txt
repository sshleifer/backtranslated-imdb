This is one of the rare films, it's lovely, compelling, respectful, and quirky, true gift. I feel it is necessary for any trip to Italy or any vacation, because this will remind you of a wide range of experience (Find Euphrates, Magic). I especially love Jottie Lawrence as Lottie Wilkins, but every leader and supporting actor is not blameless in this film. If you are attracted to fashion and textiles, exceptional things are good. I want to release them on DVD because I wear my tape version! <br /> Make sure to settle down to see if it is worth your time, without any obstacles.
