Death was the first film I was scared of. When my brother (r.i.p.) saw it, I caught it. It was a black and white TV and was not really a good image but I got interested. Shortly after, my folks purchased the color set and luck, the million dollar movie it showed on Sunday. <br /> <br /> I forgot so many plots, but it did not last long ... And I was so scared that I was sleeping that night! I do not mean exactly an image but it comes from space not just a living, but you can not hear it or see ... and once you get hold of it is too late. Even now, this time it still shakes my spine. A classic classic, and also a classic that I have seen frighting off a new generation pants! <br /> <br /> The long blob live!
