Bob Clumpet's 'Yinch In Time' is seven minutes away from a very small fraud. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he draws scratches once he is given a terrible bath. For the unlucky dog, a relentless pumpkin makes it all but impossible to stop from the looks. Flea's progress within the dog's fur and the dog's frustrating attempts to deal with it will change the cartoon. In a great sequence that captures the irritability of really scratching itching turns red from red to brown to blue color. It sounds ludicrously surreal but it certainly evokes an indescribable feeling of an itch in Clampett alone. There are many other things that make the 'clock' an 'inch in time'. There is also a strange feeling that leads to some graphic scenes that crush the pumpkin on the dog's meat. Any scene that shows the cat has an upside-down violence. In particular, dogs have a big shot of dirty jokes that can cause a foolish sequence that attempts to pull the wolf away from the wolf-whistle and behind the back of the dogs. He addressed the audience, saying: "Hey, I've cut off a lot, I like it"! With a very limited conception, Clapton can make 'an' in time in 'a unique, mini-based cartoon. Like Seinfeld's first episode, 'An Atch In Time' is practically fun with it.
