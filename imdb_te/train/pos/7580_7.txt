Just as I enjoy Hanna's The Razor movies, three are perfectly: 'Who's Got the Gold?', Japanese Lawyer's final adventure with the catchy package, the most delightful piece of pink movie, but the newest <br /> <br /> The film is a female Opens the ghost form, and it seems to explore the supernatural landscape, take the series in an interesting new direction Uvellaru; Sadly, the spook does nothing but the Scooby Doo-style Rouge (cooked by a corrupt Treasury official who is attentive to keep people away from the lake from where he's stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue known materials Recycle content <br /> <br /> Once again, Hazo headed his investigation, questioning women through his powerful penis, fisting enemies, His bosses are doing the useless. <br /> <br /> We get wild animals, good-natured rape (Hanzo strengthens women in the air that appreciates his acceptance) and bloody sword-fighting. <br /> As you have already seen and the first two movies, you can see this installment in order to complete the set, but be warned, this is probably one of the least satisfying one of them. <br /> <br /> 10 to 6.5, rounded to 7 for IMDb.
