This film is ultimately a great way to end it. Peter (boy from Puppet Master III) has all grown up and is now the Puppet Master. Well, this girl comes to destroy toys and learn the secrets of Toulon but instead listens to the story about her puppets. Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Puppet Master's Curse, and Retro Puppet Master (sorry ... but I do scenes them in Paramount 1). Personally I wish Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys are finally made, but the film ends with "the last film in the series ..."
