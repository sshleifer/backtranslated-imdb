The film is an excellent job of describing the victim's plight as an ALS (Lech Gehrig's disease). This thing is done with compassion and humor. Helena Bonham Carter persuades a man with ALS, and I believe it is only her acting. Kenneth Branagh is stepping out as an amazing actor, an unfortunate artist and forced to co-operate Helena's role as an alternative to prison times as part of his "community service". Looking at the development of the relationship between the two is from beginning to end. The fact that it is a fairy tale does not actually deduct from magnificent performances. Both of them care very much.
