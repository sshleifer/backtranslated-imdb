I should say, I loved the Vanishing Point. I've seen the original, and it's a pretty good remake. <br /> <br /> If you do not follow the original storyline (that's why I gave you 10 to 8), it's still very good and it's a good storyline. <br /> <br /> For the car, the DJ's comment about Chiller at 185 mph for the bulldozer was pretty unlikely (and if you see, the speedometer needle is 145-150), but I did not see one of them at home but they started to show the engine , The original storyline was supercharged to Hemi, so this is possible. The Chrysler 300C, which usually does not allow aerodynamics, can go at 168 mph today, and if you look at it, it goes on a road, such as pushing a brick wall in the air. Plus, if you make a dam dam on the challenger in an air tunnel it will be more aerodynamic.
