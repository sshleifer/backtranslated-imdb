It is a shame this picture is very hard to get your hands in the US. I found it through a rare video dealer, and it is definitely worth it. The best film in the pre-early era, and the best film of the 1930s was a doubt. The master of director Frank Borgez made spectacular images of Depression, and he created a fairy tale between man's casts and the ages. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have an amazing chemistry between them, which makes the film a fantastic romance. Young's trina is sweet and hopeful, Tracy's bill graph and is closed. <br /> <br /> In this film, the fascinating, Bilze's Bill and Train will move to the village where a palace lives in a palace. Uses fascinating and dreamy technology. Depression's hardships have not been neglected, in fact they are perfect for the film. But the film of the bourgeois craftsmanship is a mildly fantastic story, the romance between the characters seemed tough. It makes the movie warm and affectionate. <br /> The postmodern success of the prehistoric man of the human race. Only most people can see.
