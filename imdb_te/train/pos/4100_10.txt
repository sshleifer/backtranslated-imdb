"La Bete" by Valerian Borovikic is based on the short story "Likis" by Prosper Mariei. Luisbeth Hummel, an American heiress, married to a poor Marquis son, intended to scare the family's inferior chateau and intimidate the forest near the mythical fiery beast. It finds that the former Lady (Cirpa Lane) is once engaged in immense sex with life and that Lucy will lose her through the event's dreams. "The Beast" is an art house blend of surreal horror, clear paddle and porno. This genuinely romantic movie is wonderfully photographed and uninteresting to the beast with high finesse of the animal, attacking and perversion, sprinkled on the breasts, muffled with pink and most graphic nameless beast in everything. Here the women are stunningly beautiful and they have a lot of time Naked. The whole "La Bete" is a visual dinner. This may be viewed with the fateful details or visual models that are pregnant with information, with care and attention to Borovikki's masterpiece. Must watch for the fans of European cult movies.
