I was a great movie I had seen in 2002, but I'm using mainstream movies. This is wealthy and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 small pictures. From technical information (selected directors), I'm scared to have an anti-American basis, but ... it's a kind (11 times) personal tribute. <br /> Weak Point Y Chahain: He does not manage to "swallow his haughtiness" and does not feel this episode is a well-deserved punishment ... It is really a weak part of the film, but it tells the true freedom of speech to the whole episode. Mexican comes from almost every conceptual-painting ... I still do not know what Gonzalez is. Those 9 others are definitely (K. Luch, S. Pen, S. Makhalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and smile to me, or cry or make me stunned. I do not know yet that the story of Esma Imamura is not really really related to the September 11 disaster, but its ending place is so beautiful that it 'makes it'.
