I admire horses love and hand drawn animation, so I guess nothing surprising little from DreamWorks new animated film Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron. I can say I'm a bit depressing. You have excellent animation and seems like a perfect story at first. A knight in nature but nothing about the story altogether. A cute plus - the animals do not sing or talk beautiful songs. Unfortunately, the film is inappropriate to comment on Matt Damon; Bryan Adams is an absolute soundtrack; And compares enough action scenes to a Jerry Bruckheimer production. If the filmmakers are lively, we have a masterpiece here. It's not a great movie, but it's good entertainment for young children. The film is recommended for families because it is the only thing that is in the right place and not for the youngest children. Not bad, but may be better. Very beautiful visuals.
