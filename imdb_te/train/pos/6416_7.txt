Men of Honor stars Cuba Gooding Jr., Real Life Navy Diver Carl Breezer, a man division of the Navy, becoming the first African American Navy diver. Sometimes on his side and sometimes his adversary Karl Braischer is a person who really appreciates. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert Deniro). In many ways Sunday morning, escalated and Karl helped him become the man he wanted to stay. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this film. His role here is strong and strong because Denzel Washington is in the hurricane. Through each scene we can see his passion, motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dreams. When we face difficulties to earn his father's pride, we can see our struggles. I also liked how the director created and put a lot of pressure on key diving scenes. Brasser's encounter with a submarine during a salvage mission is the heart stopping and brightness. <br /> <br /> The only error I can see is in the supporting cast. Cuba and Deniro's characters are very complex and exciting. These are a little bit sad when they have butt heads with two-dimensional supporting characters. Evil lieutenant Cmdr. Hanks, Sunday's wife (Charlize Theron), the unusual diving school Colonel (Hall Holbrook) and Cuba's love interest are the characters that I do not have too much depth. These characters had only a few more time to develop more substantial and more effective ones. When is that colonel always in his tower? <br /> How sad was the wife on Sunday and was always drunk? <br /> Another interesting question is this. What happened to Carl Breiser's wedding? If this film is chronicling the life of this person I mean that his wedding is not an important event? Maybe it's just me. Men's Honor, however, is a perfect example of success and faith that covers the human soul. This film is inspired and makes you feel for this man's fight. The reason I was told is this powerful story. My hat goes to Karl Bra≈üheer. <br /> <br /> I truly admire your strength. <br /> <br />
