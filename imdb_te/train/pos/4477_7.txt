This is going on a lot for a - Sinatra, Stein, Cahn, Pamela Britten and the lowest amount - Iturbi, Grayson - plus little Ho ham - Kelly. Sinatra's first film, which was a producer's buck, and you could see on screen (in the past he appeared in two low budgers, Higher and Higher and Step Lively) but they relied only on the Sinatra tubes and the eagle-tripping piano spots of deep Sirard Grayson Plus Very tough film and good phenomenon for Sinatra Sanalato think it should remain. He scored the best of all his songs from two duets with Kelly - we left her, I worshiped her - her own solos, Sunset Meeks, The Charm of You and I Fall In Love to Meakes. Despite this phase Lively was the best Sinatra music of the Forties in a tenth budget.
