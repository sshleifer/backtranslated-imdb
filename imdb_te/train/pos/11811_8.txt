Dick Tracy is a comic book by Chester Gould in 1931. He is a common detective who tracks the crew of villains from Blunton and The Big Boy Copiers, from all visible visas. (These villains have created tracey-scale villains in cartoons like Warner Bros. Daffy Duck in the 40s.) Tracy's comics gun playplay is known for its free use and innovative technological advancements. Particularly the watchwalker), which gained a fair share of the screen time in this amazing film. Danny Elfman made this music great, Madonna's original songs were interesting, but they were not the top of her career. As you look at the movie and watching the happy moments, the movie is very much like Batman. Because Elfman's memorable sound for his pieces. <br /> <br /> I love the tough talk boy, boy caprice (and that beard!), Madonna's villainy, and cinematography and direction are impeccable. The film was made very professionally and there were tons of great actors who had been known for some time before the film (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forzi, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Katherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). The film is directed by Beatty, which is interesting. <br /> <br /> Betty had been seeing himself as a Tracey in past life or something. <br /> <br /> I gave the film 8/10 to the film which brought the film. (Whatever the reason). There are errors in this film's rating on IMDb, and I still do not understand why. The style characters like Sets, Wardrobe, Lighting, and everything in this film are completely original and powerful. Buy it today. You can not forgive.
