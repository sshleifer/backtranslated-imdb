Fantastic cinematography with classic drama / action film will go ahead (1954). The product is very good and I tell you that it's done with pride and love. The special peak in American North West West pioneers is very educated and entertaining. The film is very small because many people are at this particular time and place "lawyers" in most curve / corrupt countries. Action scenes may be more realistic, but still, this film is really essential. Those who have a sense of history and philosophy have testosterone type Westerns for this film.
