Professor Jonas Rouck (Boris Karlof) discovered Radium X - a powerful force for nuclear energy. Unfortunately Rukh is contaminated by radium and begins to glow in the dark - and his touch causes immediate death. Doctor. Felix Bennett (Bela Lugosi) develops as an antidote - but begins to go mad because of Variy and Radiant and believes him unfairly. <br /> <br /> The "impacts" of carloaf glow in the crazy and darkest of the plot are ridiculous, but it is still a cheerful little chiller. It moves quickly, some great weather (the "house" of the notice of Rukh and the film starts with a dark and rainy night) and Carlof and Lugosi (as always) give great performances. Frank Drake (Ruh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (also his mother) have a good performance. So it is less than other carolof / lugosi movies. The plot to swallow me is very far. I still do this. I will give 7.
