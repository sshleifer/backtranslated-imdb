Doghi is an amazing film and Renuka Doddar is amazing. So most of his roles are the great Baba North Baker. Along with Kairi, its best example of Marathi film. There are some parts of the two suspicious films - this may not have some scenes with a social message. These scenes are probably out of the political productions of the filmmaker but the film is realistic and moving enough not to need it. But unlike such small quibbles, an image that deserves to be seen more and I strongly recommend it. Sumitra Bhave's anxiety and humanity shine through.
