The film is a delightful, light hearted form on either side of the New York art, music and exhibition art worlds ("guest kid" in a guest role with the "Miss Bunny"). It is called "torch song trilogy". . <br/> <br /> <br /> <p> Fast and funny, and the costumer of Parker Posey - at least if there is an Academy Award - "Wave" a stadium. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film is based on Miss Posey's very stylish platform heals and she is definitely cast. Like her acting work, it may not be too deep, it is often self-referential and, well, posey ... but it works. She is a talented comedienne, an excellent entertainer, and this film entertains her on the shoulder as a fox cheetah, and never ground it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] A deep level, story of a girl and her friends who are defenseless in every sense of the word, including others; And that caring learning process requires life. <br /> <br /> The script is beautifully designed, witty, and only one actress known as Auntaki, in a role, in a dimensional and heavy hand; The more active show from her, the more the relationship between the two ... But ... hey .... this comedy. Surprisingly deep character, this film gives some material and attention to the world, Falafel selling boyfriend. Should we be lucky to everyone ... is he one for Mary? Or one that gets away? <br /> <br /> Do not forget that it is not a classic, because this is not a great moment in the history of cinema as an 8 and it's great art (it's not all to get deeper and richer on the back view). Seeking Susan "desperately" as it refers to something very real about it, but may be irrelevant with time. Still, it is everything that requires amusing image, and is worth watching several times for clothes alone!
