Dumland focuses on the lives of an (American) family ... father; Sexually exploited and pornographic or pornographic and has no ransom attributes. Mother; Who looks a mysterious mentally, never really says much. Son; An obscure annoying minor fellow. The animation is easy and raw, but suite makes stories and characters. These parts are actually available only from the davidlynch.com website, but are now released on DVD. <br /> <br /> "We meet neighbors' neighbors, learn about three things about him ... he really good shed <br /> <br /> 2 - The Treadmill: We recognize that wife is associated with exercise, <br /> <br /> Doctor: Father is an unfortunate accident, and the doctor's examination is very thorough. <br /> <br /> A friend Visits: When a new dress upside down, a friend comes to visit (believes or not, he is, he spoke to him, his mouth Unfortunately, the removal of the stick from the mouth of his neighbors ends up (and more violently) difficult than expected ... but in the end he is successful Tamayyadu ... Jesus is not grateful for that! 6 My Teeth Bleeding: It's my favorite episode ... and it has a lot of charm, repeated and annoying (Hmm, what to say about me?). I do not know why the son's teeth started bleeding, but trust me when I told you that the story is less. This is a quadrilateral because there is no story for this story. <br /> <br /> 7 Uncle Bob: After Uncle Bob's meeting, and Uncle Bob's wife, we get a unique feel that the Dumbland gene pool is too shallow. . Uncle Bob is a sick colleague (I will explain if I do not spoil it for you). Uncle Bob's wife definitely wears the pants in her family ... and the father certainly ends up on the wrong side of her fists (and the rest of their yard visits back to hunting a tree in the yard). <br /> <8 - Ants: They get curious with the intruders trying to break into the house ants and bug-spray ... he starts off with a bug-spray in the face of the crash and illusion. Ants put on a wonderful song and dance show ... He tries to kill them, yells a full body plaster ... and the ants finally get their vengeance. Because these stories are bad, there is something that can force me to see them. They give me another insight into one of my favorite directors. David Lynch Maybe they get an outlet for him, get rid of some of his violent ideas ?? I really do not laugh at many points in episodes. Many items are absurdly funny !!
