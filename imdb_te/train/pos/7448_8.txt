I have not laughed on that in a long time - especially since the film has a lot of sad moments, especially since it turns from being hyper-funny to honesty and extreme. The letters are sometimes quite common, many times, but very believable. I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer Show - sorry for participants. <br /> <br /> The movie is aired on public TV, but it is very fun. <br /> <br /> I'm going to rent to enjoy this movie completely. <br /> <br />
