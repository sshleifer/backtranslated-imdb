Overall, I was impressed with the pilot. The first fifteen minutes were initially concerned because the creators were trying to create the science fiction version of the OC, but the fear was corrected when the terrorist incident occurred, and the performance stages from here I rarely see in the background and circumstances. <br /> <br /> BSG is a monopoly, existentialism, and reality Such as death and terrorism But they are basically sabtekstga was salato, the viewer think or they choose to ignore. On the other hand, the program's focus on these matters is and I personally find that the Shell and the Matrix is ​​inspired by the works like Ghost, and they are surprised to wonder how the themes are discussed. <br /> If I'm a fan of two things or other films / television shows, I would deal with the things I mentioned, and I think at least something here. <br /> <br /> I have explained to you what the situation is known in the BSG, and I believe that they have managed to do it in a very interesting way, especially where the belief of Silan comes from a god and the creation of the Capricorn simply enough modern and contemporary. <br /> I'm the Greenstone parents and the actress 'Lacy Rand'. When I personally liked Eric Stolts and Paula Malcolmson, their scenes seemed to be chemistry, which at this time can only reduce their roles, but I think this work is needed. I realized that Magda Apanovich was unbelievable in his role. This can reduce the time needed to experience and develop, but her performance in the episode is not entirely compulsive and totally confident. <br /> <br /> The pilot is based on the 'Caprica' future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that BSG once done.
