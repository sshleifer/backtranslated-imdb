I looked like subtitles in Russian, but really enjoyed it. The main character Sasha blamed her body with a deadly weapon. Because he was different, he lived happily for the rest of his life and was angry at him because of the worst things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally sees love in a young girl named Saffani, everyone will end up in a fierce battle. <br /> <br /> Regular Old Hollywood movie is not for those who love it, to enjoy independent movies. The concept of Kinda Asia Fantasy came with.
