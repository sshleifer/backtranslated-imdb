You can survive Christmas. I thought it was a slightly modified way down the television version. I liked Ben Affleck. He plays the role of a family-less adult Drew Johnson who is ready to pay for strangers. Valcos Lisa Valco, who plays James Gandolfini and Katherine Hara, is the daughter of Parents and Cristina Applegate. Drew was alone on holidays because he did not have his own family, so he rented for a quarter million dollars in a family in the Chicago suburb. Mad's husband, Arthur, was employed to play the most memorable Bill Messi, grandfather and robin. When the whole situation comes down to crash, the truth is painful. The walcos house is drowning apart. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprise trip. You can not buy what you want! Acting and writing is mediocre but pulls into the final scene in the first rating.
