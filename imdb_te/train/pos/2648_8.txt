The story of both confused brothers and mercy from their respective waters (through drug addiction) and later liberation. A brother, a self-proclaimed genius played by James Franco is your typical sensitive and intelligent man-child. The other brother is a hard working future physician, while he is suffering from addiction when children are struggling to live up to his family's expectations, and he deals with less discretion. The drug is not as heavy as the fiction, and everything in the family is telling about the problem of the problem is in a realistic sketch of dynamics. I would recommend anyone interested in such a role in studies and James Franco must appreciate the worker who is in love with his efforts.
