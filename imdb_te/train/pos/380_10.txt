Steven Spielberg, who took a break from his escape in the early 80s, was co-hosted by Alice Walker's "The Color Purple" in 1942 on the disappointing presence of the African-American woman in 1942. Goldberg's play sele is silly, believing that this is the same woman acting in films such as "Sister Act". Can not be part of the curriculum in black studies and women's studies - not the easy film. It may be the most exciting editing task on the screen anytime you know when you find it. I can not believe that it did not win an Oscar; This may be Spielberg's second best film behind "Schindler's List" (possibly associated with it). Danny Glover, Adolf Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pug, Akcuaua Basia and Laurence Fishburn.
