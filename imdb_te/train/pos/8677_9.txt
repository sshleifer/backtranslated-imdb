The film is reminiscent of Tom and Jerry signing a peace treaty. Things do not get idiot for a time but, in anticipation, it goes sour. Probably the most memorable moment is an endless struggle with a hose, a frying pan and a two-plus butch dog with a baseball bat on the short start and end. I enjoyed a bunch and you should try to catch up on the cartoon network.
