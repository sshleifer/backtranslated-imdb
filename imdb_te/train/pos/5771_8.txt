This is one of those movies you have been doing while you are surfing on Saturday afternoon, and you end up drawing it and watching the whole thing. I thought this was a great deal and I really think it's for the characters. Boney and Clyde and their family members were not boring, even though it was slowly moving. We can not see all the exploits that they are very legitimate, and there will be a lot more firing when they are being policed ​​by police. Tracey Nehmam, who played the role of Bonnie, has done a good job with her character. From a nice country girl to a cold-blooded killer is a challenge, and I enjoyed the subtleties that I brought to the role. <br /> <br /> Overall, an average effort was made, especially for a TV movie.
