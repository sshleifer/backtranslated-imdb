Just watching the movie and the horror thing, the people who speak in the movie are just like the actors. The film has its moments, but also lagging and rather sick. This means that it is a farce, but once you look at people's enthusiastic lives in the movie, "You're like these people around us" are another stupid thing to do with the audience's efforts to get the audience's sympathy. On the plus side, there are some great (and funny) insults. I think I'll wait for the video- but it's a good laugh. Warning - Jerry snaps his shirt in the picture !! (Not beautifully visible!)
