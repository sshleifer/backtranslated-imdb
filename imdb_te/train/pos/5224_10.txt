The film should look for "Jean de Florette", whether it's worse or any story. Hello! The film is made up of humorous comedy and does not have a plot in shape or form. I want to recall these movements, if you can not read the trash of this film, they seem to be missing the point. The film is clearly visible to people who are not known as "American Comedy", which is a lame and worst case. The point is that everyone has an opinion and you have to be a bit more appreciative of the comic in your own line may not be a sense of some people before shooting your mouth. <br /> Thank you
