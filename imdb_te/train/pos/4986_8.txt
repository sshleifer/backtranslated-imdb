Tenho and MK Lensman from the studios is less known as anime gem. It relies on the novel, but reminds me more about the game "Metro". <br /> If you want to see it, see it in Japanese with subtitles or plain Japanese. The English dubbed version was almost cut and the edition was edited. <br /> <br /> It is the 1st animated feature to combine CG-graphics, with hand-drawn animation, but it is fun to watch.
