Sarah Silverman's program is similar to Sarah's own stand-up; It is topped by the bias that you have not taken into your heart. Nevertheless, many people "will get it" because they do not mean all of them will appreciate it. It is very polar and a dimensional display, so if you do not like 10 minutes later, you can leave there as well. If you like after 10 minutes, each episode is the last one so far. <br /> It's not the same as all the shows. Personally I love the program, but it has some huge flaws. The racist songs are funny, but it's more old than Silverman's identification - the problem with "Jesus magic" as well. Silverman seems to have given quotes to the episode that does not require him to upload. <br /> <br /> The songs she wrote are good, but the music is not good. <br /> <br /> If fans appeal to this event, Monty Python, the steep citizens are the brigade, etc., there is nothing like those shows. I can see Monte Python all day, but I love this show, I can not see a half hour at a time. It's flat too flat. The repetitive value of this show is very low - the second time in an episode is a lot of fun, and for the third time, in my opinion, it's boring. <br /> <br /> Still, that very first time, very funny. Try and see.
