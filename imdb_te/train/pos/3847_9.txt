At this time, the film was controversially written on its entirety (similar to Verhoov's projects). <br /> Death-scenes containing many graphic images; A parachute that is not open * the body of the boys * on the floor. A lion chamber * in the throat. <br /> <br /> But there are some amazing (and superb dances) scenes shot in the gray town of the gray rather than the gore. <br /> <br /> Tens of thousands of roses flying on the screen, a somewhat absurd section of the picture, a beautiful charming woman with flowers, blood-dripping meat and <br /> <br /> The story ends in a spell, but takes about 10 minutes You will leave yourself with a silent silence, which will not be disappointing and relieving. <br /> When pros coms come, some special effects are over-the-top, and the veroovan gore-factor is clearly visible to see how far away (eg from their sockets). Also, the two main actors (Zeron Krabbe and Ren√© Soudindic) make their life breathtaking work, Herman's character (instead of the un-lovely Thom Hofmann) feels really booming, <br /> I've done my best to give you a little idea about what the film's ambition is, and you can easily Not in words. So if you happen to find this movie somewhere, make a favor, watch it! And enjoy this masterpiece special style and ingredient.
