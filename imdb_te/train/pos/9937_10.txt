This TV series is one of those I love when I was a child. I have now seen it through the pink-shaded glasses of nostalgia, but I can say that this is a very good quality but still quality show. I did not see the original French version, Swedish only. <br /> <br /> The premise of this program is to show you how the body works. I swear, the school still does not teach half of what I know in this program. It is related to other matters, what are you going to do if you are eating and not eating unhealthy food, good examples inside the body. Do you want another chocolate bar when you know that small virus tanks can attack you? : D cartoon Many kids of course looked nice, nice, but carefully done. <br /> <br /> The cells are viruses, cells, viruses, brain signals, antibodies and others. The series about history (especially the environmental scary end) is the key parts of my childhood. I'm so glad I found them here.
