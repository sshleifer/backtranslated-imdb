I have recently seen this film, a lazy Sunday afternoon, with some friend of mine and we have so much fun! This movie is the best work of Trash. Try to see this with this purpose! It did not expect, of course, but the actors presented the performance (and Alberto Tomba is absolutely the best), the weaker script and the low cost budget created incredible mix of ingenious things. Tomba retired from Alpine Sky racing, where he was a major technical skier in the 1980s and 1990s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two world championships and nine World Cup season titles. About the director seriously: no one knows why Damianiya Damia was signed in the film. All other orders of Damia are substantial.
