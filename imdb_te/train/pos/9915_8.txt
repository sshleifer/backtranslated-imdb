I do not have to go anywhere. I'm on a flight to Vancouver. If I did not choose Air Canada, I would lose this movie. Seeing on a small screen behind the front seat, I found these attractive and mesmerizing. I drifted in some places, had to skip but eventually I had to watch. Now I'm looking forward to DVD release in Europe, when I get out of the door I think there's a lot of blemishes yet not yet found! <br /> <br /> The photographic composition is fantastic and the film gives a lot of insight and fills the story telling the photos. <br /> Recommended (if you have time on your hands).
