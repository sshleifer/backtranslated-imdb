Hitokiri (which translates as "murder"), translates a / k / "tensen", translates it as "divine punishment") displays his own form of hyposecouse. Do not miss this one, or Gosha's other classic, Goyokin! It is not one of the best movies of Hihokiri Gosh, one of the best "Samurai / Chambara" films ever made, and one of the best Japanese films ever exported. <br /> <br /> The storytelling of Hitokiri for the unknown to the 19th century Japanese history is very difficult. However, the underlying human drama is open and open to all viewers. According to the criterion for Gosha, Hitokiri is the "obedience to one's Lord" versus another with his traditional theme. "Doing the right thing". <br /> <br /> "The action-driven story, you might want to see Goyokin. (Ok, ok, there is a huge power plant between the many samurai clans in particular in the background of the historic background.)

It is contradictory, with a bigger set of gosh. <br /> <br /> The "Hitokiri" Gosha's maturity cinematography is that each shot is thought-out, and (like Kubrick's Barry Lyndon ) For each frame of the film are still composed. However, this particular gosa. Hitokiri is filled with truly amazing buttocks, of whom (including goyokinto) many riveting seascapes. Just look at the opening sequence, and you are hooked up! Do not make any mistake, it's not an English period: hitsokiri is very violent (do not say you did not warn). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Performances (me) this looks a bit more subtle. Katsu Shintoo (Jotocchi / Hanojo the Razor Fame) will change in a star show like Controversial character / Antihero, Okada Ezo. Katus managed to teach humanity to a character that appears to be more wild animal than a villain. Throughout the film, you may never know if you're engaged or rebelled by the character of Okada. At the same time, Odaa's appetite for the honor of appetite cuts of appetite and his curiosity in the ransom, you can not help the human being, but you will be sympathetic to sympathy / sympathy. However, after playing Nakadai Tatsuya's torture hero in "Gookokin", he is good to play such a cruel villain in "Hitokiri". <br /> <br /> Do not miss the final screening of Mismia Yukio (Yes, the Cloned Gay). The right-wing ultrachenist novelist who committed suicide by seaport before a crowd of Japanese military personnel was "kidnapped" in 1970, painting his life and work by Shinby Tanaka for a respected (killer) by Paul Schrauder.
