"Opening Night", released in 1977, seeks a prestigious production. It succeeds only in Gena Rowlands's really spectacular performance. Theater actress Myrtle does not require her role in real life. She is self-absorbed, often bad, and makes life difficult for those around her - in other words, unlike some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the edge of the fall - if we are real or imagined in the fight, we are secretly in the beginning. Rowdulls is a direct director of his beloved husband, actor / director John Cassavettes, who also has a role in the film. This film is not without errors - it's overly long, and the drunkard looks almost as cruel in the last episode on the Myrtle platform. In some conversations, "improving" - at least on stage - goes too long. Some of the supporting roles are especially good performances from Ben Gajrava, who is the producer of Myrtle. Jon Blondell's character is fully developed, and I can not figure out why she is in the movie unless I forgive Myrtle. Look at this picture for the Rowlands alone - she is fascinating throughout - and you're tough to take your eyes at her, although you'd at times want to.
