This game is fun and contains the story you want to see in the comics. Spider-Man was created by a mysterious cheat. The city is occupied by a strange gas, and campuses like Venom and Carnage appear throughout the city. Who are behind these crimes? Could this be oak ok? Well he seems to have turned on a new leaf. He was frustrated that Spider-Man had spent a good photo opportunity because Venen was not participating. Characters from other leaders and villains will spin out secretly. Fighting is basically, not difficult to pick up, fighting with officers is fun. If you collect comics, you run out of the web and have fun running the city. However, this is also a weak point. Spider-Man suddenly tunes his wheels into the sky and makes all the things you can do in the city. Compared to Spider-Man 2 Movie Video Game, you do not have a lot of motion web site. However, other items are especially badly swinging, rather than stories. So be ready to watch Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Dr. Octopus, and Carnage for a wild action pack ride.
