I have never heard of the film despite George Clooney (whose company is produced and he looks very funny assisted bit) and his Ocean's 11 director Steven Soderbergh. Worse, what a great and pleasurable surprise we picked up this in a discount bin for $ 4.99 (at those Canadian dollars!). But William H. I think you are not disappointed if Macy is in it. It was a reminder of the eeling comedies from England in the 1950s. Okay, even more defilement. It's an oddball and sometimes gut-splittingly funny movie. It is very difficult for me to actually cry out. Perhaps the ludicrous use of lingerie in film history. Maybe I'm going to have the lowest expectations but I've seen a group of people and we have a blast. The best $ 5 i spent at age.
