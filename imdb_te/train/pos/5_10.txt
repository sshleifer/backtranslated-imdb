I am in the middle of this film, so I do not know about its sequence or its title, where I've received a mixed reception by your commentators. I'm on the positive side about this film but one thing really caught my eye as I saw: the beautiful and delicate score was written in a Coplandesque American style. My surprise was great when I found out that John Williams was the one who wrote the score for himself. True has written sensitive and sharp scores, such as Schindler's List, but generally associates his name with such bombers as Star Wars. But in my opinion of Williams, I have heard about softness, sensitivity and aesthetics. And his another recent score, you will catch more, will show more wit and sophistication. I like academic films such as Stanley and Iris, How Green, My Valley and Conorac, John Vogue and his African African American Charges in South Africa and the Renaissance of Danny Divo. Spiritual awakening, enough storyless story. This is a fantastic addition to a genre.
