I agree that this film will usually escape, but I've rented it for the stars. I certainly did not forgive. In fact, as you can see, I rated it five stars. <br /> <br /> Andy and Hank Hansson are brothers who are convinced of the unlawful offense of stealing their parents' jewelry store. The crime goes terribly wrong - the trials of the Hanson family have begun. Through past lines, we learn about Charles Hanson and understand the damaged relationship between father and son. <br /> <br /> The little brother, Hank mainly screw-up. He always has trouble having the job and pretty much goes in the wind direction. Hank is unprotected, shy, and very much with his big brother's influence. Ethan Hock Hank's role is "a tie hanging" and so far his best performance. <br /> <br /> Andy - on the surface - is seen as a successful businessman, but he is influenced by external forces. But he immediately finds that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his institution to pay for his habit. This confesses the scheme to capture his parent's shop, and he gets a weak-hanging hank to refuse the job. Philip Seymour Hoffman - is certainly one of the greatest actors of our time - Andy. Hoffman is an actor, on the surface, a fascinating entrepreneur prefers his acquaintances, but is capable of painting a real mud ball. He is absolutely perfect for Andy's episode, or by his superior performing skills, Andy makes the perfect piece. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays a father for his generation. Charles Hansson is not a bad or unhappy person, but his sons have difficulties with him because he does not really understand what his sons and the need to build a positive bond between him. He is always quick to criticize and reprimand. He clearly stated that he liked his older son who caused a widespread emotional dispute between himself and Andy. When Charles and Andy learn about it, Andy is less confident about making a plan to rob his father. <br /> <br /> In personal note, Charles Hanson reminds me about my father, and how Andy and Hank are my own brother and I recall. Perhaps this is a very long, complicated father, and more successful brotherhood story, and I'm very happy to be close to my little brother's home. Fortunately, my brother and I have never been to the offense against my parents - we have made discouragement and more moral issues. <br /> <br /> The group of individuals and actions is expertly directed by Sidney Lumette. During the eighty-three, he still chaps the eye-catching characters and hinted edge-off-seat action. 12 Angry Men was the first film to be devil's nos before 50 years before, but he never lost the magic touch, which shows the characters we need to remember. <br /> <br /> Devil advance events and characters you're dead is not tough and unattractive, and it's definitely not a good movie. However, I finished two hours for ultimate entertainment.
