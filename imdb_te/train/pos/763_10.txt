The film changed me all ... I heard about breddoning and hippop, but it was not done professionally (from the Hend I was 11 years old!) This change changed when I saw the film. I was actively involved in the hippa-movement in our city, started bridging and writing works. <br /> <br /> Until today, I still considered this film a personal favorite. Certainly, the importance and "cinematographic" importance is not so important. But if a wide-shot is shot seriously or if someone can see the mike hanging on the ground, who cares? This will make you personally count ...
