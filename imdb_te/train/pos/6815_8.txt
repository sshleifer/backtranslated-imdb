Elisha Cuthbert finds it difficult to speak to her father with a fourteen year old girl who lost her mother, she finds a secret magic elevator that takes her back to the end of the 18th century up to one day in the apartment's basement. <br /> <br /> I clicked through channels, discovered. I read the compilation and suddenly read Elisha Cuthbert ... I thought it was okay ... and I did not realize that Elisha had made movies ... 'The Girl Next Door and 24' Elisha offers satisfactory performance, the plot is a little cheesy, How wonderful this miracle is to become a hottest baby in Hollywood!
