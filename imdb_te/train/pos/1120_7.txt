The British black comedy of the same name in 1994 should not be confusing. But this is valuable to Shawlove Grave 80's Backwoods Slasher. <br /> <br /> ప్లాట్లు = 4 కాన్వెంట్ ఒక ఫ్లోరిడా లో జీవితకాలం యొక్క వసంత విరామం ప్రణాళిక, కానీ వారు ఒక స్థానిక మహిళ హత్య ఒక వ్యక్తి సాక్ష్యాలుగా ఉన్నప్పుడు వారు ప్రణాళికలు ఉంచారు చేస్తున్నారు, మరియు అతను చూసినట్లు తెలుసుకున్నప్పుడు, బాగా కేవలం అది ఒక ఘోరమైన అవుతుంది అని పిలవబడు < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In my opinion, This is when some of the slashers went downhill, which is not certain and this film should be very familiar, it is not a pity. The fact that the film is actually a dilemma gatavalini (just try to guess who is going to be the last girl - I was totally wrong). The principle cast is all the favorite and you are one of those movies that they all hope they get away from, which they do not of course do. The film is the first half an hour of the jar (in a good way), the real nastiness of the few flashes (the second murder of a real jolt to offer) and some unexpected sleaziness (which is not high, however, with a fluffiness with budget thriller I am a woman of his own, BRA (a silly vote in addition to the radio broadcast of the show), the last in a movie from the 80 sissulo scene of the spill had not strangled. <br /> <br /> one of the film T or two bad things, just a little is not bad, to go anywhere, and the stupid and plus the deputy inability logic to follow the two young boys in the sub-plot as such. However, sharp moves, nothing, but, at least in my mind, it's a Slasher film through and through <br /> <br /> The hunters hunted by hunters by riot victims were rigid and enthusiastic The. <br /> <br /> everything is very enjoyable, Sheriff.
