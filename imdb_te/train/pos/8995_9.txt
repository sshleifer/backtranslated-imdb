I can not see DG! I know that no one knows the bands of the bands. If you like the music of Dandy Warhols or Brian Jones Town Massacre naturally everyone can enjoy this movie, but it is from truth to far. You only need to be interested in music and / or pop culture. There is a definite representation of the ways one team takes, as the two sides are parallel to the careers, and looking at people and spitting dandhi warhols is attractive. I agree with other reviews that Anton is good to get the last word because he is clearly described as a bulwark of the band's ability to be his own worst enemy and apparent. <br /> <br /> For me Dandis respect for BJM (despite their absence or mutuality) and for Anton (despite his anonymous conduct). Dandy Warhols now hates the band, although Dandy Warhols can now stand up with the band, respecting the art of producing the group. Dante's drummer says, "I can not be anywhere again" and the guitarist is the best way to say, "I will still buy their records". <br /> If you do not know anything of this band, definitely watch this movie. They develop about the themes of rock music and the film is very interesting. It is rare to follow a very close group for a long time.
