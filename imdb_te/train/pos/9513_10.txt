The gorgeous actress starring Tom Gongs (Michael Sullivan) made an excellent job. He again acted by him. His performance was Legend. Great Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. Chasting is very good. The history is very good.You will enjoy the movie. Gangster's great character of the 1930s, the era of all the gangster movies of the era. The soundtrack film is pretty good. A great picture showing what a father does to protect his son. I have been underestimated for my liking. Totally deserving 10.
