Everyone does not like it by reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series ever! It's great shy when it's canceled, and I hope someone will pick it up and have a good feeling to start the series again. The good news is on the DVD! I went to the store and chose a copy and I was happy to say that it was good and I was fine. Gary Cole is an incredibly dark and creepy character, and all the actors are very good. It's a shame that the network did not. Shawn Cassidy, it's a masterpiece. Those who enjoy the genre can not see and do so. Do not be disappointed. When this was on television (she was 20), she was very interested, and my daughter, a very young age, was getting up soon. She feels "too twisted" and enjoyed episodes that she saw. I can not wait to see parts that are not broadcast. <br /> These show rocks!
