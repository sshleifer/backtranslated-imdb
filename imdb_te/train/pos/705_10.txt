While looking for offbeat independent images, I came across an insomniac nightmare and was happy to say that it was not disappointing. This silly half hour ride is all the way to me wondering, and the end is fantastic - one of the nooooo moments that really are with you. I have shown to many people and it seems that everyone will accept hands. The little ghostly girl is very talented and I think she stole the show performance. She kills the heck from me, I can say a lot. Nanavathi did a small job. All the pieces just fell into and you can let her know that she is a great writer from what this script does. Well written. It is undoubtedly the strongest part of the film. Directing is good and acting is fun, but the most important thing here is the strength of the screenplay. This girl is a good job, I can not wait to see more!
