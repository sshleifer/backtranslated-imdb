I'm not clear why this film is such a big "flap". Sharon Stone has certainly not lost her attractive and "touch" from "the basic nature". I gave 10 votes to this film and I am telling you: The game opens in London at this time. The city moved from events in London Catherine Trauma BI1. Again she proved to be the master manipulator of her own class. <br /> <br /> The technical part of the film is: B-rate staff of real setbacks actors. In the first episode, it's really big in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas. I also would have been BI2 Sharon Stone a bit shorter but she still thinks she looks so incredible and only has improved about her attractiveness. <br /> <br /> If she wants some big names for the B-rate "assistants" cast, it is not bad. <br /> <br /> There are many good improvements in the basic platform. I think this is a much better thriller than delivering this distribution in the run-off-mill worst Hollywood. The plot is good, technically easy to see, you have half way through the film and it is very important - is Heath.
