<br /> <br /> With David Lynch's film, one of his films has the idea of ​​portraying most of his movies as a troubled mind. This is a very straightforward reference to the title. Generally, after the last highway, usually the general lion's vacuum of the inability of the norm should not be emptied. It's a simple movie but it's a really great movie. It's both an innovative and an entertaining topic for both. It is not innovative because it is innovative. But maybe that's Lynch. He prefers to twist our minds and hence puts a picture that is very important from the lynch and very distant. Being a very disturbing director, he only makes a film to hurt his regular audience, because he knows what they really want but he does not give them. It is artificial. <br /> <br /> The speed of the image is slow. I will say almost the lawn moth speed ... do not imagine an action nazi, but this movie is really entertaining for those who go with the stream. Lynch plot of our small entertainment films look carefully to those little details. Look for the great cinematography that came to life in this film. And listen to the score of the Blondie and really listen to the main theme of Ovo and Wisconsin landscapes. <br /> <br /> Forwardworth is one of his best performances in the film, making him one of the most favored people in the film. He does not have to say anything to express his feelings and ideas. His enthusiasm just shines through him and his performance earned him an Oscar nomination. Is not that I did not perform his weak health in the film? He was suffering from cancer and shot himself immediately after completing the film. That knowledge is more focused on the image, because it becomes more commemorative for forewarning. <br /> <br /> Motion picture is a good film that is suitable for all types of people. Being a clear and not a bit innocent but it can be asked for homilies that can not destroy the whole picture, being a memorable motion picture. 9/10.
