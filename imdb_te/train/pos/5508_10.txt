Year 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, disappeared from the face of the earth for the past five years, declares that he died for declaring a Glum Fidel Castro, in fact, Cuba went to Cuba to live with an expected identity for Bolivia. While living in La Paz, Guevara makes an idea of ​​the corruption of the bourgeois government. Once again, Steven Soderbergh takes on 'Che: Part One' (this time is only good). The motion is high, the job of acting is very good (like Che Guevara with a disease called Chicago del Toro). If you see two pictures, Guevara's true story and what kind of man he's (a rare open window with a chance to see two images in a picture!). Like 'Che-Part 1: The Argentine', the film does not have any MAPA rating, but it is easy enough to move the 'Ar' with the surge of language and violence.
