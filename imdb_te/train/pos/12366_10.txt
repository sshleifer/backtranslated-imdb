Wonderful movie, one of the best horror films of the 70s. Her realistic settings and environments. As always, it's common negative comments. I have seen that for a while I have not been able to get too many horror films at all times. As the most horror films are old and dear, it is a psychoanalyst that moves the minds of the likelers of music critics. <br /> <br /> Before you read, already know what the final judgment is. This film is a good gift because 10 is good. The Rhines read very well, and it reminds me of Kubrick's images as a film that has been produced. He really stamped. Stunning image really. I thought it was a film compilation over the years 70 years.
