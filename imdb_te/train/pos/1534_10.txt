I love this show with adventure, love and witty action. Very few times love! It works well together with all the characters and it is good to see a presentation that they respect each other. See Dick Van Dyke is also a television role as I only saw in Mary Papins. The main characters, a mix of Marc, Amanda, Jessie and Steve, are very close to the audience. This is the show you need to see!
