I thought I was enjoying the show, I first thought I was totally different from what I was saying about 'All That' (I'm not sure if I'm going to do it anymore) but I'm just like the show and I can not classify it as a progression, it's so lovely, (Including a supporting cast) I absolutely had the guy I really had Wesley Jonathan loved to see on the screen because it will be great. I also saw a woman who plays Valerie's friend in popularity and when I think it's a okay show, I really do not like her role in this show because she is not my cup of tea but she pretty well rounds
