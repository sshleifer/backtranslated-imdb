It is one of the comedy TV sitcoms that came from the States of Raymond's death from the love of everybody. Warburton is always happy, and complements the rest of the ensemble cast to this perfection. David Slade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his very unique delivery of his lines. After the British arrays, the "crew" creators of "Engagement Rules" came up with their original idea, but this was not intended to be "Brickbot", where a completely intelligent dialogue and way would be entirely separate set of this particular series. But comedy will take more than a competitive cast to bring success to a new series of field. I have been part of the best television comedy writing team in Australia for 7 years, especially the role of director and camera crew and I appreciate creative talent. One of the few complaints I've had on this series is apparently a "canned" smile. This series of live audience can be used in filming.
