I grew up watching Scooby and was always a fan. This cartoon moves away from the same old routine that can get boring to the audience. Crookes is oldest in the mask routine and a cartoon from this cartoon. It's not meant to replace the interval of the Scooby gang from the same old crime scene for both the audience and the writers I'm sure of. The focus of the cartoon is in Scooby and Shaggy, he receives a huge amount and uses money to win the world from a mad scientist and his goons. Small memories of the gang and the gang are displayed regularly. If you are a Scooby-Doo fan, you can still congratulate the relationship between a boy and his talking dog, along with the jokes that come with it. This is not the last scoop cartoon, as it is supported by Just Enjoyth Cartoon and creators / writers and producers.
