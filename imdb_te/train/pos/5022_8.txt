Frailty - 8/10 - It's a non-sensitive title and next to the "Bill Pollston Directions" title, it's a pretty good old fashioned chalet for biblical horror thriller bathing. In the end, it ends only Kubrick's "shining" - inverted southern gothic cousin - but hey, there's a pretty damn entertaining concept. It also has an unbelievable skeleton of a storytelling twist and a very vague moral message. This film is now the kind of film that people catch at the end of night in the basic cable and scare the beejesus looking at them. Very bad director Bill Paxton must pretend himself ... Oh well .... a good rental ghost.
