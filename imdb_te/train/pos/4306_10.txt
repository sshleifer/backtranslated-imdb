About a decade later, I still think about the film, talking volumes about the film. To me it proves to be a movie Grand Canyon that strikes you one way or another. I really believe there is a Grand Canyon before the movie crash. In my opinion the main difference between the two films is their release time. I'm not going to argue that good, but they fight because I think they share the same message. I'd like to hear from the viewers on this topic. I'll start commenting on you at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. Because I love the movie, you can also find me posting any other items about the movies we share.
