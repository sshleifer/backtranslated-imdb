With some exceptions, these days George Bernard Shaw's plays almost disappeared from the theater. To arch, the most talky looks simple judgment. This BBC version, one of Shah's comedy plays, did not deny the ruling. It's definitely tilt and spoken, but it's also amazing. And because of the quality of the British theater, which cast the perfect actors - except for Helena Bonham Carter - most of us probably never heard of. Cartier is a professional "Chocolate Soldier" (Pip Torrence) shelter and later looks amazing as a Bulgarian girl in love with him. Sergius (Patrick Rickert), the charge of the enemy cavalry of the opponents of the Bulgarian cavalry officer, could only succeed because of the charge of enemy guns. However, this role invites over-acting and Ryecart is clearly stated. The other players finish the letter. Carter is at the center of the play, as they are turrets like the self-dramatic Bulgarian "excellence" and Swiss soldier-of-fortune, and they are awesome. Yes, "Arms and the Man" comes across a filmed drama. But you do not have the chance to see a shaw film that does not betray its origin. The plot is usually intelligent. However, the Shah is all about dialog. The action is low (also in Saint-Zone) and the sets are incomplete. Enjoy it for anything.
