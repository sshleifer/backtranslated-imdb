I thought Max Payne's style was just a bit like a bit like a weird arcade of wanting not to bullet (it was the first time I play Max Payne, so I read countless posts about this game). So I realized how much fun I played for a couple of hours! And no matter how different from "Max Payne", yes the bullet time is a bit like that but I think it's enough for the game genre. This game is a non-stop action - like a big fan of Max Payne, it's very fun between a shoot'm up and a fight ', the story of the DTR is that the greatness of Max is not near to Payne, the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same , But you definitely must own this game if you want a bit more "bullet time".
