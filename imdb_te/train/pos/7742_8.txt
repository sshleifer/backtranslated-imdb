Serious actors such as Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward make this modern film Noir a winner. In all three, I do not know that good performances and secret characters that are good for everyone are interesting. <br /> <br /> Patrick is a former boxer and mentally challenged person in the noir. Wow, it makes for an interesting person alone! He looks dumb, but he is not. Ward Slicky has a kidnapping plan of attractive, dull, intelligent. Bruce Dern is also in the mix and Dern has never failed to attract any film. <br /> <br /> The film is considered to be a damaging average viewer, but I found it to be so lovely .... and I do not like movies that are desperately disappointing. I recognize that a kind of quirky crime movie. Take a look and see if you agree. Not everyone knows because it's just a good story and well done.
