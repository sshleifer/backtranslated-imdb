I thought this film was a good job. It's not the creator or origin of the first one, but it's expecting. It's a whole Lotto fun. I like the more I think about it, and when it comes on the DVD I'm going to pay very pleased money, every last percentage. Sharon Stone is great, as she always does, her movie is horrible (Catwoman), but this is not like motion 20, this is one of those movies that will be underestimated for its lifetime, and it's probably a classic yrs. It does not wait for a classic, now look and have fun. Expect a masterpiece, or something gripping thats and touching the spirit, just get out of your life and theirs. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is entertaining and I recommend it, did not see it. Critics and the box office does not always count what you do not know, people you know, you never know maybe. I'm screaming my hat for this movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
