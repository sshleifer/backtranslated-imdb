The Paper House is the most moving and sharp image I've ever seen. Often classified as "horror movie", this is a big drawback. Some magazines once called "Elm Street on Thinking Think the Theater Nightmare". However, I agree with his conclusion, but I can not help, but I think it's an unpleasant and misleading tag. <br /> <br /> Only those who see the horror are really here and they only work to show that they can not really think. <br /> In fact, it is probably a bad idea to try to classify this amazing work. Quite simply, the paperhouse is perfect in every delicate detail and always has a special place in my heart. As the brilliant man once said to me, "This film is totally emotional", which explains why my comments are coming in uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I have not apologized for this, so if you think that my words are too holy for your taste, you are now coming for reading. <br /> <br /> The heart and heart of its heart and the struggle to overcome the horrible feelings of loneliness and loneliness can completely overwhelm us during this fragile time in our lives. Child actors can be recognized as extraordinary and their roles can work fully with sensitivity and intelligence. In Charlotte Burke and Eliot Spears we have an inspiring award and the permanent effect of the parenthouse has a lot of ability to show childhood (often neglected) tragedy and alienation that is rare and persuasive. <br /> <br /> Two fantastic young stars have fallen out of the studios' silk and have somehow gone away. <br /> <br /> All of these are the most talented director (Bernard Rose), the imaginative cinematography is the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you would ever like to hear, and why do I talk about what words and relationships are there for this movie?
