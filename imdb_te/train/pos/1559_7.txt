This special episode of Smallville can be the best episode of air from the reunion. This is due to many reasons. For example, some of its roots will recover the series. Lionel was welcomed back to Lutourcarp Plaza's office in Metropolis after a long period of time. This room is not a baby for a long time, and the little ones that have seen again bring much memories from the past. <br /> <br /> Lions conversations with Lex are always admirable. <br /> Another nice return, Bart Allen (Aka Implus), AC (Ek Akman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg). <br /> When Steven Day Knight reunites former League leagues, he combines them in a special way with the Smallville Formula, which seems to be a movie length. <br /> <br /> From there you will find the basic story, Green Arrow League, 33.1 Blast attempts, Bart seizes, Clarke protects him, and this facility falls to the com in the kingdom. All good and elegant, with stealth, good combination of action, pace and suspense. Oh, and the Cyborg Justice League has some cool new updates to the role. <br /> <br /> Music is probably the best of this episode. If you remember correctly, the first episode is Agless from Season 4, directed by Steven Dayconight. This is a normal episode. Perhaps the music, or the acting, or actually Clarke Saius "We could not find you, you did not find us", the people who make the formula lose confidence. But fortunately, Steve Day Night has redeemed himself in this Justice Episode. <br /> <br /> I have some quizzes about justice, which is in full volume. Ridge facility exposure. I took off the green arrow and Cyborg Oliver's bike (rememeber from the arrow episode), it was too cold. Clark and Impulse must clearly ran, and the aquaman should swim through another path. <br /> Second, another cheesy moment, the first one is not so bad, but the green arrow sauce "protect the world". This made me afraid. Judging by acting performances, music, direction and production values, overcomes Pros Cons, and is one of the best segments in short history and may be the second best episode of the 6th season. <Br /> <br /> 10 to 7 ...
