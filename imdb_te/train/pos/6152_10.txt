Fabulous, amazing, perhaps the best musical adventure of Disney. It is for the 35 years that the film is loved, because it is speculative, intelligent and fun. Despite the silly "flying bed" scenes, other scenes and dialogue are magical and funny. Did anyone choose to play Eglantine than Angela Lansbury? I am fit to anyone for the role. This classic remake is stupid to rebuild Mary's papules. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, though he has some quality movie roles, completely shines in this adventure. He is a comic intellectual who often forgets these days. Fondness, the first and the right English - no one really do the slapstick and he could pull it off gracefully as he did. The film is tragic to remake because Tomlinson has died for a few years and nobody goes to his feet to do his role. <br /> <br /> Dancing nightgowns and armor are not just capturing other magazines with a magical aura of witches. <br /> <br /> I would especially enjoy parts of Germany attacking Eglytown's house and she would have to save it anyway. <br /> <br /> Getting along, Richard and Robert Sherman fell into the music scene. All of them are wonderful and memorable, one of my favorite is Portobello Road. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that still stands today!
