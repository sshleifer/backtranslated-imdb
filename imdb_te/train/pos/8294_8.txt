The film has great fighting scenes. Acting is a little sharper. But I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills, I see cheesy cinema like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with real martial arts and throw waves of air like many more films than using wires and flying with the Amazing Battles without flying now. Then look. Now it shows Power Rangers in the two main stars kid at the show and another cast member of that show is a bit part in this movie. But hey fight scenes are enough to make jet linds pants. Jackie Chan is the best thing to do to thwart and adore.
