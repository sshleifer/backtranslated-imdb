It's a beautiful picture ... Yes, some parts are dull and exceptionally favorable, and the film does not support a big star cast (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, I really liked the actor ke ke manan (singer KK was not confused). In the scene where he first met Amitabh, I'm looking at the person looking at AB, not a word, yet strong, certainly a good actor. In fact, he again proved himself in Sarkar, along with AB for the second time. <br /> If you read any other reviews in IMW, you already know the plot, and I agree that Akshay Khanna has entered Pakistan. Very easy. And the little love angle that he shared with "his face" is absolutely unnecessary. But he is a very good actor (as seen in the DCH), and Sundy Dutt is always good to see. And AB ... what can I say. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it's the biggest fan of the world, but I know I will compete for the spot. <br /> <br /> It is a considerable watch that can be considered Bollywood. "The Great Escape" and "Bridge on the River Quay".
