Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, most notably he has some staggering politics in his films. "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" America's deception and stupidity and "The Big Red One" portray the horror effects of the war, "Merrill's Marudes" battle as a necessary hell and the "pickup on the south street" of communist intelligence risks. All of his movies make a lot of entertaining, and although he is often pigeonholed as a b-filmmaker, Fuller is good at any of the major studio contractors. "Pickup in South Street" is no exception, and despite the dated themes, the filmmaking style is remarkable in its time. It is also a very fast-paced, tight and occasional brutal film. <br /> <br /> Performing across the board is excellent. Richard Widmark is a great anti-hero and Jean Peters makes a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend very sexy. Show Steer Thelay Ritter is a joyful performance as a Police Stool. The angles fuller employees are good, the acting sequences are more exciting and cruel (which is very violent for its time). The camera is constantly moving after Tarantino and his school forty years. "Piccad in South Street" is a great action-based naval thriller. "Shock Corridor" is my favorite Fuller movie, but it's the second most. (8/10)
