This is a great concern for me when I read reviews, but it really is very disturbing for me .. But this animate art fan is completely confident that this perfect art form is against my cultures, but believe it, but hey, it's world art .. !! The film is very strong in the beginning, strangely and confusing. It is difficult to understand the things that make up those who make it. Only anyone who has opened up a lot can do such a daring image .. not sure for kids. While the characters are beautiful and adorable, remember some disturbing adventures (sorry if spelling is wrong) that they do not erase.
