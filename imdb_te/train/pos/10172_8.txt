Fridge Freleng's 'rumors' is a wonderful private snaphoo cartoon that warns spreading rumors that are frightening during the war. Like all snapshorts showing military audiences as the entertainment of structured films, 'rumors' are very imaginative and tons of thoughts in a short life span. It was the last rumor that the American war broke out when a rumor began about the Snapu bomb. It was brilliantly portrayed by many strange and fictitious creatures that chanted Snaphoo with more horrific news about the long rabbi baloney and his country's military. 'Rumors' inventions, fast and funny, all of which help to work hard, "Miss badmouth the military" message. This is the best of private snapshots.
