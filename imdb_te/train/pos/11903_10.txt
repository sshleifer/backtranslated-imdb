While volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival, I'm fortunate enough to grab this film. I'm always a fan of classic horror movies and especially a fan of William Castle's, so this is definitely a must watch. <br /> <br /> It is the director who is the lowest in my opinion of William Kassel's life and work. True, he made some cheap budget schlocky horror films, but he added something to these movies: The real live theater gimmicks that you do not see anymore. For example, he has a heart rate in his films and he has nurses while putting the wreckers on the chairs in the tingler. <br /> <br /> It is a really well-documented documentary and this shadow director is light into the light, and the horror movie is celebrated in his works. <br /> <br /> Many documentary filmmakers, rather than documentary filmmakers and sprinkling tailings, are many! His family members and directors, who influenced his performance as John Waters, Joe Lantis and Joe Dante, showed more interviews. A classic horror and sci-fi fans must watch.
