All of the film leaders in the 1940s and 1950s, it's one of the most difficult and most fun to watch. I have four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hewervar, Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> If the first two names are familiar to everyone, this entertaining entertainer is made especially for Anders. His character, "George Grissby," is the two people I've seen in the film. His voice, and some of the things he says, will have to believe and listen. Slain in the "strange" category is not lag behind. Hayworth is not attractive with small, blonde hair but you're still hiwever. Wells' is always attractive. One Tip: If you have a DVD, start English subtitles. His role in the film is an Irish man and you need the subtitle to understand everything he says. <br /> <br /> Wells also directed the film. You have great camera angles and excellent facial expressions. You have a special edge in a shootout at a house with mirrors. Great thing! The film is fantastic in the film and the breeze-like carnival atmosphere in the end is very high and is far from the severity of the scene. Except for this, there are no complaints. <br /> <br /> The name of this game is great entertainment.
