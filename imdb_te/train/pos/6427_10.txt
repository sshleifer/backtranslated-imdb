If you're in the mood for fun ... and just want to relax and have fun ... bay Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies to watch. Amitabh is pretty cool ... but Govinda steals the show from his hands ... fantastic time and good dialog delivery ... inspired by bad boys ... but it has Indian spice. .. People are messy and stupid ... but David Dhawan is directing and Govinda starring ... There are no questions ... David Dhawan / Govinda Kambo in the same style ... Shola Aur Shabnam, Anken, Raja Babu, Sajan Chale Sasurale, Deewana Mastana, Koli no. 1, jodi no. 1, hero No.1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Garra.
