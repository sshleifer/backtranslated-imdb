Marquis de Saade What do Egyptian archeology and masculine worship traditions do? <br /> <br /> Genie is a young cut of her attractive archaeologist in Alexandria, Egypt. Genie worked with a mysterious hut (and blatant Lesbian), who was daddy in service. Daddy is sent back to the site where he will remove the tomb to see a dead body. Genie meets Marquis de Sade's descendant, and falls for a hunky Egypt (providing the film's hottest scenes). In the end, Jenny finds herself a sacrifice and long and bloody climax. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marquis and his successor, Robert Inkland, are amazing. His acting abilities are always erroneous to his makeup needs, so he is allowed to light up here. His best performance is still in "Killer Tongue", and if you still do not see it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast including the young genie is pretty and average. The script, though, is troublesome. Unless the filmmakers have access to the cool set, you will quickly discover that the Marquis landscapes are completely unnecessary. Finally, there is no sense of Mermaid cult that protects the genie. The mermaid has never been described and there is no image associated with Christianity (which spread throughout the film). Although the archaeologist is a biblical wearer father, the film is very anti-Christian but prefers to be built by a local prostitute. There are plenty of deprivation and violence scenes, but Hooper probably has little idea of ​​what the screenwriters are trying to say. <br /> <br /> Why do I recommend this film? This is unusual. There is a wide sex scene. For ladies, the hunky Egyptian horse runs completely naked. England is awesome. Do you like snakes? Complete them with this picture. It is like Roger Corman with a big budget. Hooper came with something "crocodile" after this bleak. <br /> <br /> It is rated for physical violence, certain sexual violence, gore, obscenity, female nudity, malnutrition, and sexual abuse. Content, sexual references, and drug abuse. <br /> <br />
