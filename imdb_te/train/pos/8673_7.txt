WWE has produced some of the worst payment-view-views in its history in the past few months. Cyber ​​Sunday, Survivor Series and December to December are terrible to say and its B brand show, SmackDown! Try to end the year at high note. Armageddon has two major gimmick matches in Large Raid and Inferno matches, featuring Batista and John Cena against King Booker and Finlay, and three of the Championships line of battle and an interesting main competition. However, Teddy Long has not only participated in that night when we gave fans an early Christmas gift but has now changed the year's contest to one of those championship competitions. <br /> <br /> The T-LO WWE Tag Team Championship tournament has been moved from Champions, London and Kentucky to Razzle and Taylor for four team matches, including MNM and The Hardy Boyz. <br /> <br /> I do not live on this but I can do it because I have nothing to say. This belief is to be seen. There are many high spots and very cruel bumps and awkward landing. However, a move I had to talk was taken directly to the emergency room by the Joey Mercury Contest. Jeff Hardy looked at the full spectrum of MNM's two members to take full part with Matt Hardy. Unfortunately, Mercury did not get his hands to protect his face and took full force in the nose and left eye. It's a bad thing. His face was soon seen and opened to Messier's night. After we found out he suffered a broken nose and cut under his left eye. Alert. This is not for heart rate. Paul ended the roller-coaster match for Paul to capture two championship belts for London's win. I'm looking for wrestling for nearly 15 years and it's not better than this match. <br /> <br /> The night 4th was always started with Inferno match. Kane took MVP in good match but it's not really about action and action about that. There were some close calls with flames for two competitors, but eventually Kane forced the flames to fire MVP after they were out of the ring. The MVP ran around the ring, but his butt was on fire and was unhealthy in me, it looked and laughed. Can I suggest Michael Hess that MVP will come in SmackDown next week? Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire. <br /> <br /> The second match of the other gimmick match and triple main event at night is in the Last Ride competition between Mr. Kennedy and The Undertaker. It was a full-fledged match from the start, and the series's best of the Undertaker and Kennedy. The used pillars, chairs, and a view were considered to be a 15 feet thin concrete floor from The Undertaker Armageddon. Unfortunately it is plain to see that there is nothing a crash mat and the group does not pop for this. <br /> <br /> "In the other fierce competition, Chris Benoit defeated Chao Guerrero in Benoit for a time in Choao This is a very good match when Germany has hit the Splex, Benoit even thinks whether or not he's putting the Wiki Gerreiro in the Sharpshooter.Luckily he comes to his feelings and let her go. <br /> <br /> This chaw is another cracking match, WW, Gregory Helms The cruiserweight championship was a championship match in the current championship, and Jimmy Wang Yang, which had a lot of flying and dangerous spots, some of which were out of the ring, deserved audiences' answer rather than more suited to him. A boring shoe at the time Helms started duke after a jabrker type maneuver to SmackDowns with his knees! <br /> <br /> Boogeyman pinned Miss a futile match, I hate boobs with a passion. The only jumping of the JBL about Miz is only listening. JBL Comedy Gold. <br /> <br /> The main competition number three is the World Heavyweight Champion, Batista and WWE Champion, John Cena Finlay and Champion of Champions, King Booker. The tag team championship has not been match since. But no one has played so little. The match was even more memorable, how many times I have told you about the WWE this year, even though it gives you an additional five to ten minutes. This was a large boutiquebomb pinned by King Bucker at the end of the match. <br /> 2006 ended WWE with 2006 pay-view-view schedule. The year began in a fierce note with the New Year's Revolution, but it was overwhelmed with Armageddon. This ladder match will be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time. My hat is off to eight members of their body but not in the line to give fans a match in a match.
