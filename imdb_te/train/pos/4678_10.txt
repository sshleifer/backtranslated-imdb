I chose to watch this movie on Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and is one of the best films on this festival. Two well-known actors deliver a well-rounded gentle performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level. The director has done a great job of bringing life and stories into life, which is not usually seen in production for the first time. <br /> <br /> An interesting factor of this film is woodwork and the city of New York (specifically Brooklyn). Making the film Family Furniture Moving around the business and connecting the smoother cinematography of the two carpentry and ordinary Brooklyn life? <br /> <br /> This gem and I will wholeheartedly recommend it (I'm sure it will be on the screen).
