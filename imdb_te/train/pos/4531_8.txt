A clever picture showing love at this age. The film features Keaton seeking a woman's love in ancient rock and present (in the 1920s) rocky. In all three cases, he is a regular wimpy buster and he fights against Wallace Briei for his lady love. In three periods, I thought it was best for Rome, but I agree that it is also cheating. I really liked the scenes with a lion that was race as a person in a dress as well as the weird chariot race in the snow - but I really really enjoyed seeing all of Keaton's spectacular stunts. However, for three years she has been a good old-fashioned and fun film, but not his best, yet exceptional and enjoyable movie. Check it out!
