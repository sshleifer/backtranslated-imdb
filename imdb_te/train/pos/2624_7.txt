In this film we have the wonderful opportunity to see what to show Timon and Pumba - this is a lot! The film also goes on before and after (certainly) the birth of the kira. <br /> <br /> The first movie is very real, "Lion King 1/2 (or other places Lion King 3)" is a funny, entertaining, exciting and surprising image (or sequel call). <br /> <br /> When Timon and Pumbaa are watching the movie in "Timon and Pumba", Timon and Pumba begin to look in "The Lion King" in which direction Timon comes and Pumbaa and wants to go back to Pumbaa when he wants to go back to the start. They have a very pleasant compromise that they see in their own story, what it does ... it begins with the first beginnings of the Timon ... <br /> The first pictures of any age, enjoy the "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
