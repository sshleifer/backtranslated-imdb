One of the best episodes of Sundance is watching movies that you definitely miss. Unless you devote a true art house, you probably will not catch many documentaries. Get only a significant distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has developed its commitment to documentaries in recent years. <br /> <br /> Barchead Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production team at Luther Lacute Correctional Complex in Kentucky, Kentucky. Each year a group of prisoners will demonstrate Shakespeare's play. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with lovely revelations that do not reveal the jail surroundings. . Despite the labels (punishment, the criminal, the murderer) we know. We immediately began to respect these people by looking at people. Structurally, the film selected for the filming year The Tempest, which focuses on forgiveness and redemption. The actors overcame their lives with the importance of drama, their characters, and the meaning of parallels and drama. <br /> <br /> For a documentary film, like a book, we will experience changing our lives. Shakespeare Behind Bars is my personal revelation. "The brave new world, there are such creatures."
