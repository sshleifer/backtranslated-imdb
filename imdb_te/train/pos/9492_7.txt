This movie is cheerful but for the wrong reasons. Action scenes coordination is ridiculous and the film has some funny slapstick moments. Robert Giant and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene at the end, Williamson told "You'll definitely read around a friend!". I enjoyed this movie only for Saint and Williamson, but one of the four lines for the storyline could have been written on the back of a handkerchief and most of the others. More than 30 parts have a credit list of just 10 or more. There are some ideas on how nobody counts in the film and how it will look at the finished product. One of the things that this is going to do for the film is very violent, so it's for the precious film that has been seen by Fred Williamson and Robert Giant.
