Like almost everyone commenting on this film, I can only think it's never seen in the video. <br /> <br /> I saw this in 1972 "The Late Show" at the age of 12. I also remember the poison gas attack and weirdly bend horses. (I do not know the more horrific bits that I have described here, they may be cut to the TV audience). But the scenes I really liked were almost associated with the death of Lord Kitchener in HMS Hampshire, 90 years ago. <br /> <br /> The scene of the battlefield ships that have come to the ground in the storm really recalls. <br /> <br /> Do not recall a musical score, but the comments of others are very interesting to me now. Get it on video!
