Only a horse lover will appreciate the film. There are a few movies showing a horseman. I find out if Brian is riding his own. He wants to know if he's got horses. Brian is in many movies, where he runs. Where did he learn to ride? The horse's scenes are always bent, because the horse runs forever in steam. Camera carries the first rate and the horses as shown by how dangerous things can be above horses. It is very interesting how they went about casting this movie to find out all of the good horse riders.
