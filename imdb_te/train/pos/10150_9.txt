Sure, this film is sappy and sweet and full of clicks, but fun, and that's what I watch movies. For fun. Natasha Hainstridge is amazing, even with short hair. Her smile is brighter and her beauty disguises. For Michael Voorton, I'm sure women love him. Both of them are really Iqbal in the film. I can not understand that there is no chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to see if the British accent of Olivia di Abo and Michael Rigoli D'Amo penetrate into his Bronx speech. I did not really recognize until I read these comments, but I went to the DVD and now her dialogue sounds more British than I am American, but that is her best for her role. <br /> <br /> It is the story of two good people who are getting married to important people, but their soul mates will find another. It might be a rare story, but who says that movies should play as all documentaries? This is no more unrealistic than any of the plays presented at the tube every hour. So let's look at them and escape the daily lifestyle and enter the world of characters on the screen. I thought these actors would do a good job, but hey, I'm a sentimental person who is easily tears. <br /> I'm saving 10/10 for myself because I give 9/10. Even the super-senior film I have not seen will come a few days. If you advertise on a movie channel or lifetime movies, or create a note to see if any. I love you.
