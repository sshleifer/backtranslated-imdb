I love this show. Period. I'm not looking for a long time, maybe only six months or more, but this is now my favorite show and maybe for a while. Unless I take care of Donna, I love all the characters. I'm not sure why. I can not see her funny, and I do not think Lara Preston is a very good actress. Other than her, I find the rest of the cast is pretty good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Dup, who are Eric's parents, are very funny. Tober Grace is also a great actor. Unlike most fans, I did not totally hate the 8th season. I can see it, it smiles at me. But, if you compare pre-season seasons, its not good. Randy is terrible. The end is good, nothing is wonderful, but good. =] I think it's better to cancel the show after I decided to leave Ashton and Taher, but oh well. I have a fourth season on DVD, and I hope to have all the eight seasons on the DVD anytime. Some of the most fun episodes of 'DN & Dash', 'Grands Dead', 'Red & Stacy' and 'String' have loved every episode I have ever seen. =] 9/10 stars, I will definitely recommend it. =]
