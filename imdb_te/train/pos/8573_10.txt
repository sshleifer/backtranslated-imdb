In 1996, "101 Dalmatians", Cruella de Weil, London Metropolitan Police (God Blessing them), tried to steal 101 puppies. All covered in mud and hay, she can "tin can." In the next 4 years. Now, 4 years later, she, unfortunately, was released from prison. <br /> <br /> In 2000, Disney decided to release a sequel to the classic Live-Action version of Classic Classic, and it was similar to "Dalmatians 102". That's it, family (Oddball name, I should know since this recently showed up on TV), and the puppy has no spots! Included is a 102nd Dalmatian !!!!! Furthermore, when Cruella (again Glenn Clock played) again escaped, she wanted another big and good coat from puppies! <br /> <br /> I especially liked the theme song - I'm sure everyone loves the song "Atomic Dog" from the '70s. <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" I wonder what a great movie - when "103 dalmatians?" ??? <br /> <br /> 10 stars
