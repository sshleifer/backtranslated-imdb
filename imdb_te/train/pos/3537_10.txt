<br /> <br /> This James Bond game is the best Bond game my life has played since my favorite James Bond game is so far: <br /> <br /> The missions in this game are really fun, having lots of fun activities to play missions Weapons are really good. Cars in this game have lots of action on car missions are awesome and are really fun to play. The voice over the actors is really cool and it's cool that Sean Connery will also make the voice of James Bond the way Bond looks as good as the Sean Connery featuring James Bond and the other character looks really good on the way the movie looks good. The graphics in this James Bond game are pretty good. Even the game is pretty much an image but it all but a lot of which makes it cool. <br /> Total score ********** out ***** *****
