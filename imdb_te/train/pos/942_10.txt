This is the best film version of Dean's classic story. I saw in and out over VHS, and recently bought the DVD version, which was formatted for TV (not wide screen). What's interesting about this teleplay is the cast of the most recognizable English actors since I have been in other films / shows in North America since 1984. My big surprise was Edward Woodward, "The Equalizer", the Ghost of Christmas.
