This witty, funny, sly swashbuckling sword fencing and the knockabout antics jumped out of the comic screen as the Gerard Philipe path is way too young to die. Charmingly resist, its' story loopy is impossible. The sweetheart is a sweet romantic comedy with very young Gina Lollobrigida. The movie will remember with a great passion.
