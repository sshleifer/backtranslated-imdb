Tintin is one of my favorite leaders as a kid. I borrowed books every opportunity I got from the School Library. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a wonderful spectacle of Herz's background story and the development of Tin Tin. The story of his relationship with the producer's personal experience in interviewing Henz and the artist who inspired the role of Chan. <br /> <br /> The great documentary of the most talented and well-liked artist. A great example of internationally renowned person, has brought millions of children (and youth at heart) to the world.
