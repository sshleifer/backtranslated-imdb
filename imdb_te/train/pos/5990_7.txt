No need to add to the predefined, but it's a very long time, it was the first (and possibly) time to be studied entirely in Dead End Kids. With almost a magical cast of supporting actors from Warner's directors Ray Enright and the 'A' Budget, the boys have helped. At every turn, we get one of those gem demonstrations from the real pros. They have a lot of inventory, but most of Warner's (Sans biggest stars) are just about everyone to walk through this film. <br /> <br /> The mess bass is a Messianist Complex from trusted Edairado Sinelli, only the top performer. He is almost sure to play this role as a Thuggy hero in "Ganga Din". He has something to watch! <br /> <br /> Marjorie Main is excellent from "Deep End" and she gets the best role. <br /> For this, my bid for this double feature is the second feature of "City of Conquest". <br /> Hooray for Warners!
