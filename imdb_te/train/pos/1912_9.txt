I keep short and brief, people who write stories in this program are perfect for genius and actors characters (mythical voice of CJ) and they have a lot of chemistry on the screen which is a very successful comedy. </ p> <p> When I look at the new episodes, perhaps over 6/7 months, I'm thinking what happened to Paul. I was cut off to know that he was dead when I was browsing Google. <br /> <br /> The comedy, I think, has gone from strength to strength, and he is a conservative father who wants to be his daughters and stay away from boys. <br /> <br /> Plus, I think most people will see it.
