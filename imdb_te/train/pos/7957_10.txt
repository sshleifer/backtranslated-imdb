<br /> <br /> Where do I see where these two movies are available and I can not find them anywhere in my local area. (I'm Australian). Please help me and tell me where I can buy from. Bound in General Home Ward 1 and 2 are the best movies I have ever seen and are good for people of all ages. When I was 5 years old, it was my favorite film and I was still young. It's a great movie for the whole family. I love my whole family except my parents because I have seen many times of her illness. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and can not wait until I can buy again on DVD. <br /> Sally
