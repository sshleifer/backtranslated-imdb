Joel is a heck of choice around this cast and Joel in this script. The story is well written and well laid out, and this completely new cast is perfect for the characters between 10 or 12. It seemed to support 6 "leads" and half a dozen, and the latest film about this film, fresh young faces tomorrow. This has been a long time since Hollywood's controversial Vietnam War touched the images, which tells something about "the story of war" (as stated by the smither) and the Tigerland lands of the Great War Wars. It is not labeled as a war film due to more dependence on the human spirit of Boaz and others. I think anyone who wants to see a better movie than just the special FX, but the good, sandy drama in the last 8 years, Tigerland must see Shumaker's best works.
