Although the title character is artfully played by Ashley Judd - the passionate "someone," after a law Madonna (the mother of Jesus) An intuitive, adult self improvement of note: It is not an action movie !!! It's her journal (Ms. Judd) occasionally while writing in - and oh, I just read readers out there half of the female, but be patient with this lovely picture where a pleasure can find - oh, I'm taking you water and clapping clapping. <br /> <br /> Actor / director / writer Todd Field who played the role of Nick <br /> <br /> The great love of Ruby Lee Like co-actors, "Eyes Wide Shut", she helps her to cure her thinking about the connections fitted by nightingale and youth. <br /> <br /> Ruby Lee: There is no external hero to her. . <br /> <br /> A supporting cast is also a stellar, and music used, especially the cuts of Santos Sam Phillips (wife of T.
