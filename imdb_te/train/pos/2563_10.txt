I have seen many comments here using the southern narrative about Brando, some of which seem to be wrong. When this film is taken, racism and discrimination are very strong in the south. Jim Crow laws are still in force. Civil rights are in its infancy. It's probably a micro-social commentary, a southern man in love with another race woman? Similarly, the Matt Viete Naam was fiercely criticizing the war? <br /> <br /> Myoshi Umeki has made another comment about "Chali". Anyone in Japan understands. Japanese people, at least in my experience, did not show emotion before strangers. There are strict social rules, especially men meeting the same woman. Ladies were amazed by the blasphemous efforts of the Americans in Japan to be aliens to this culture and women. A feature of Japanese was embarrassing when it was embarrassing or uncomfortable, as a sign that many American servants welcomed their progress. Remember that, during the representation of the film, Japan just defeated, and the invading powers were reluctantly treated with approval. I gave a very reliable performance for what would be her condition. Seeing her interaction with American actors has brought many memories of my own experiences in the country. I was able to meet a lovely young couple, convincing them that I was not ordinary American men and taught me their language and their culture in their language in their country.
