Despite its budget limitations, it proves that a great image, effort and lack of imagination can overcome a lack of cash. Initially, the cave-paintings show how some dinosaurs survive at the age of human beings, a nice red herring. After that, an asteroid falls into a lake and makes it hot, causing hatching of frozen dinosaurs egg (perhaps cave-painting instead of the first time). When the prehistoric beast appears, it is well animated Plesiosaur, causing the disappearance of the local area immediately. Alright, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still a real fun for fans of monster movies.
