Cutting to Chase: One of the most amazing, most serious film I've seen in a long time. In the years that left me the first film was completely suspected. <br /> <br /> I'm at the screen for trying fifteen minutes to explain the power of the film, and just fail. Any one of its elements - documentary-style video diary format, the unreliable role of events, the power of characters - it's all trivial. It may be ridiculous that some may have general attributes as a murderer. But then killing all the killers in the mouth is gaining momentum. Many are very simple, ordinary people. They wander with a different contradiction. <br /> Moreover, it is the most serious idea for everyone.
