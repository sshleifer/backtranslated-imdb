Anchors AWEIGH will enjoy an entertaining MGM music genre but I can not rate up classic here like RAIN or BAND WAGON IN SINGIN. It was the first of three musicals starring Jean Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kelly and Sinatra are playing two seamers Joe Brady and Clarence Dulittle on Holidays in Hollywood, where he is dating a young boy (Dean Stockwell), who introduces his attractive young aunt (Katherine Grayson) as an exorbitant worker at MGM. Although the two boys initially fascinated Graceson, she eventually gave Joe the preference, but Clarence then made Hooks with a waitress (Pamela Britton) who learned from her hometown Brooklyn. The paper-thin plot "We Hate to Leave" leaves the room for many great musical numbers that Joe and Clarence's harbors cry, Grayson's dried composition of "Jalousie"; Sinatra's dreams are "I Fall In Love To Acesle" (removing the sin from some prints of the film) and "The Weary Song", a fantasy dance from Tom and Jerry fame animated Jerry mouse. Kelly also makes a pirate's fantasy ballot, which he later makes his Pierreet's Ballet rival. Kelly is the strongest and strongest in a strong and energetic performance that garners his only Oscar nomination for Best Actor and his sensational cowardly role in Sinatra, which is undoubtedly sexy. An entertaining diversion for MGM music factory fans.
