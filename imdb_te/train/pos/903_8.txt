Honestly, I can not think this film is good. I do not like family pictures. I'm away from Shahid Kapoor's fan. Director's final film (MPKDH is full of stupidity and music is very boring and crisp but my favorite character is Amrita Rao after Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher <br /> <br /> I finally saw the film and He was impressed that he brought MPK's younger lovers with a pinch of heck marriage and we were the winner. Initially, I felt that the director had played the role of the director.The characters are not so strange that Shahid Kapoor was impressed with his good performance and this is a big improvement, and especially for his role. That's true, this is her best performance N's presence is very powerful, you are acting with Sameer Soni, Amrita Prakash, An Apk Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas, but one actor does not get out of the ground. <br /> <br /> The songs are very disappointing but they are good to see Muju Hak Hai Do Anjaane Aznabee are good folk songs. It is good to see Milan Audha Adaara Hai too. Songs are not colorful and dance, and they are more folk. The exception is Hamari Shahid Mein, which is committed to HSSH and HAHK. So what is an image error? The picture is very slow, and the end is stretched too. But this film is still a good pace, it's a perfect family movie.
