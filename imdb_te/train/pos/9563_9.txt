The first of all I say is that Edison Chen is very hot and better than Sam Lee XD! This is one of the most original films I've ever seen. Cambodian's poverty displays a lifestyle background. Cambodian (Edison Eka Pong) kills people to resurrect himself; He did it throughout his entire life. Sam Lee's (yi) duty is to capture Cambodian for good. There are tons of violence, but there is a good story. The film shows the struggles between these two characters; They both beat each other as angry dogs. Pipiel. Go watch ... strongly congratulations! (HK Films GO)
