A little girl in Mexico during wave of kidnappings for man-to-fine ransom tells a story of a former special forces person with a drinking problem that accepts a job as a personal bodyguard. At first he is not friendly, but they decide to stop friendship, drinking etc. with each other, etc. ... Then one day she gets kidnapped ... and killed ... <br /> He can not do anything to take revenge. <br /> <br /> It is the story of Fire on the Man but a few big turns at least some conclusions. <br /> <br /> It is with great music composed by Lisa Gerard (Gladiator), Harry-Gregson Williams. <br /> <br /> But the strongest part of this film ... Wait .. <br /> First - acting. Denzel Washington Best of all, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken is always good with Mitchell and Amazing Young Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> Then came the cinematography with an incredible and ambitious way to win an Oscar award. <br /> There is nothing but a revenge movie. The story is clever, this story you can think of ... is pretty beautiful. <br /> This is one of the movies you should watch at least once in your lifetime!
