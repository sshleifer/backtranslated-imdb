I can not say that this film is frustrating because I read some reviews before I could see and I did not think about it. The bar did not set too much, so the fact that my expectations were fulfilled is not very high. <br /> The Good: The New York City. If you live in a city like me, you realize that you have certain places and feel that the city is considered one of the main characters rather than just one setting. <br /> <br /> Bad: The first thing I thought after leaving the theater is that I wanted more, and the positive "leave them more" fashion. There are a lot of skits that fall within the "middle-in" category, in fact, much better than the good skits / scenes, but in the end, which brings the film down eventually. Also, the diversity of New York City, where many distant panels of the city and the movie are mentioned in conversation, is not actually realized or is not analyzed at the time of city justice. For example, many skits aged whites do well to do. I belong to many of the city's population but it's coming, the plots and character variations of Paris Jitrim will make New York City Lancaster, PA or somehow whites. <br /> However, after saying this, I would recommend New York and I Love You to give a perspective. Who knows, maybe you disagree with my opinion and maybe you're not. You never know until you see it for yourself. This review is not for anyone to see anyone without seeing this review because everyone's opinion is different from art. I give you the most vague heads on what you expect.
