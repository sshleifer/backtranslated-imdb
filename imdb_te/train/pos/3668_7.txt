I recently saw this movie and enjoyed it very much. It's an indie movie making and if you have a low budget, you really need an actor / actress to get people, what people can come and give film exposure. Modin and his partner Sal - Bobby Myers made an excellent combination of an "NAME" actor starring Michael Beats and finding extraordinary Miyakele Bates in the film. My favorite cast member Sandy Ryan starred again with her special appearance in the film by the amazing and infamous Debra Kara Under. If you think of comedy, it's for you. Low budget combines low budget with high buffet content.
