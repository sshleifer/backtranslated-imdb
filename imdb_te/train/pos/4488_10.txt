Here is the perfect Tom & Jerry cartoon for Halloween. I know I'm very early, but it has a "trick" in "trick or treat," Tom is blind to the window and a ghost to make vacuum-cleaner something like that; But still want to put on my list of Halloween cartoons. In this short story, "Witnessing Hour," listening to a ghost-story program on the radio, and horror by the horror story. In the story, Halfway occurs to dramatics (hair falling on the end, stroking the heart and cold cold on the butter). . . Literally. <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br And you know, in these small little cartoons, the first Tom Tom hides mommy shoes; Others are The Lonesome Mouse, A Mouse in the House and Nit-Witty Kitty. This is the first of twenty-five cartoons Tom is talking about. The Mouse Cut, The Body Guard, Mouse Trouble, The Mouse Comes to Dinner, Quiet Please !, Trap Happy, Solid Serranid, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Macho Mouse, and The Cat and Mouse are directed by Chuck Jones.
