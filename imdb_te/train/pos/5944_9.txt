I first said: ... why, oh, why do not these short film directors do? Sandy is obviously an excellent director, and deserves some credit from WB and DC. But I guess they put it on the edge so much when a man with a $ 12,000 budget could dump a superhero fan. <br /> <br /> The World's Finest is one of the best movies I've ever seen, the trailer or the best. <br /> <br /> The choice of a genius that has chosen a bodybuilder (Mike OHher) to play Superman. This is not the Superman super model. He might be beautiful, but he's not a GQ stud. And I do not know what that person has some comments above me, but Superman is actually pretty beefy (have you ever really read a Superman comic?). I just guess myself to the ground alone ... It's a perfect choice, not a super-hero with a real muscle-mass, but with a pretty-face. The same thing for Batman, Bartram is an outstanding shape, and an amazing Batman ... I do not know the boys ... if given a big budget, and his own film ... I'll have Neck and Neck to be Bale and Bartram. Bottom line, there are actually only some of the super-hero films with actors. <br /> Acting is pretty cool. I do not know that I'm talking about everybody, Ohhhh not that bad. He was convinced as Superman, and Bertram ... well, he was Batman. I mean, if it comes to people, the movie has a $ 12,000 dollar budget, what are you doing? Both look great, tad crazier than the two-face simple ... but hey, we only have Tommy-Lee Jones as reference. Oh, Lois is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> SFX is Fliplin 'very sweet. I mean, lift the Superman car ... MAN !, how nice. "Tank" scenery in Grayson Versace, I might put this one on top, as Mike actually flies, and with ease. The flying sequences with some big budget, but once again, utilized a batsmobile (this was probably a model, but it was decided). <br /> <br /> All in all, the only downfall of this trailer is the lack of a serious budget. And WB Cororo is a loyal director, and has refused to agree to be a separate project, but they (they are just like marvel projects) are just fans of these hawk directors and what they crave, and keep these gaml movies out. Thanks to God Superman Returns is a hit, or that has ended it badly. The best of the world is wonderful, and my book is considered superhero movie.
