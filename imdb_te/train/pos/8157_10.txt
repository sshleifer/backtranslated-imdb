Rated R for strong language, violent content and some nudity. Quebec rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> Fear is one of the funniest and most original comedies I've ever seen. Many people will not hear about this gem of this film. If you want to find this film, do not hesitate to buy it anywhere, even if you do not like rap music. There are not too many comedy films. I give 10/10. The film, Clers, The World According to Garf, the 40 Year Old Virgin and Chasing Amy. The film is a lively stereotyped culture of gangsta rap.The film is about a woman named Nakki Blackburn making a documentary about fictional rap group NWH (N **** z with hats) .They made a number of controversial rap songs about a rapper, Being a gangsta. The Fare of a Black Hat is a wonderful comedy film and I would recommend if you're not a gangsta rap scene fan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
