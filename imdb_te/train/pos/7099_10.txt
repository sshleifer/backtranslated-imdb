Willis' best performance as a brilliant, dizzying and most stylistic film featuring Bruce, a man who was forced to move them to the underground and destroying some of the Earth's terrestrial, destroying the terrific, twisted story of Terry Gilliam's virus. The 12 Monkeys that are far from time-saving science-fi movies means that the character of Bruce Willis is actually the psychological effects of time-travel, what is the real reality: the time-traveler or the place that passes. Furthermore, the film recognizes that things in the past can not be altered and in this case the prevention of a disruptive event that the virus release can not be stopped or changed. While Willis was in a psychiatric hospital, when it was clear that "earlier," the main chaos in the movie was not in the shadow of the plot, but the plot was not enough to save the world; Instead of the intrinsic struggle of Willis just to live himself. It is a fresh, innovative concept, and thanks to the beautifully written script of Dementia's special brand of peoples and gilliams. <br /> In addition to, 12 Monkey heroes are absolutely simplistic, and instead of curve the story tends to skillfully combine with the scenes of different times: a backdrop, dreams, memories, current, past, future, and scenes from Hitchcock's Vertigo . <br /> <br /> Visually, Gilliam is a desolate umbrella and shadow rival Tim Burton's main character in his magnificent disaster scene and imagery. With a cool, wide and sinking cinematography, Gilliam drops in colorless surroundings and the darkness of his characters. Scenes are often baked antiseptic, dead white bathing and are often used differently as waiting-on-the-mad characters. <br /> <br /> By performing performance, Brad Pitt steals many scenes, a patented loony, off-the-wall performance earned him an Oscar nomination. As Bruce Willis gave his best performance in his career, his heroic clich√©s and cardboard hero did not change back and Colle was portrayed as a simple, sharp and tragic one. Similarly, Madeline Stowe is a goodwill psychologist. <br /> <br /> Gilliam's expert, she overwhelming her own role as she performs overwhelming and complicated handling. What could be a simple action / sci-fi movie 12 monkeys makes a nightmare, a compelling sight of the futuristic landscape. It was a madman, with a rich, well thought-out, critical storyline, along with the whole cast and its breeding, gray cinematography. <br /> <br /> In my top ten rankings, there is a dark scene that is dark with 12 Monkeys bright image. <br /> 10 to 10
