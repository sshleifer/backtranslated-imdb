This is a manga's visual adaptation with very little conversation. In the Magazine it is seen in the word dialogs in the balloons. This theme exists, but it is only obscure. The collection of explosives, the comics underground Japan, has the problem of the manga available in English, and it has the actual dialogue that describes a little more than the story here. I recommend that you check the volume if you like it because it describes some of the "plot" of the film, which is different. It's pretty good by animation, good use of computers and most of the pictures are realized. Characters, cat and his brains, the eldest sister of the cat, are wandering in and out of the odd pictures and it will jump in episodes and outdoors: the boat, the circus, the desert. Just half an hour they go through several semi-plots and settings, and I believe that the director chose many problems of the long-term manga to take it randomly, but the primary choice is visually. Knowing what will happen will increase a little bit of appreciation. The cartoon sushi on this Mets show reminds me of things that they use a cat that is chasing a man's severed butt-shoe in a small little room. In this case the cats are more similar to the Hello Kitty and their adventures extended to include death and rebirth and other themes [though not so easy to say what happened]. The director's commentary and "Making of" features of this DVD have the features, but I can not comment on them because I did not get around them. I'm just giving it 8/10, there's not much to compare in the anime and I like it more.
