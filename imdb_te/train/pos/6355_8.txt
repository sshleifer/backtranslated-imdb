I loved the "Grinch Stole Christmas" when I was already released and five years later I love it. <br /> <br /> Previously, many people seem to disagree with my opinion. This film has never been so much love. <br /> <br /> The movie is so lovely and fun to watch, for the very same reason to close the movie. Sets, clothes and characters are all fun, never really ridiculous. It is a visually stunning image to watch. It's the best campie film! Director Ron Howard was really surprised with this fun little Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so fun to see and see why Jim Carrie is grin. He really does the film with his good and pleasant character. He helped with contracting make-up, also receiving an Academy Award. If you hate a gym curry, do not even think about watching this movie. This film is really his film and he's all working and it's great to watch. Other fun and memorable characters are played by Jeffrey Tambour, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans Young Grinch. <br /> <br /> The film has a good courage, but it is very difficult for me. We do not celebrate Christmas that is enthusiastic and big here in the United States or England, because I'm Dutch. This film was just fun and fun for me and I was very cold to be honest. <br /> <br /> James Horner's musical score is good and fun, it still works perfectly for the movie and helps to work some scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas Fun <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
