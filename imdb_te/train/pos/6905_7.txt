I thought Mr Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as an actor and dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia played his role equally perfectly. It is interesting to see how Richard Dreyfus's rejection of dictatorial position against his will. But as time passes he becomes more confident and comfortable. Everything is happening for a reason in life, he believes he has to replace the dictator because he was meant to be there for the year he made. I stood up because he saw how good his life was in comparison to the poverty that he saw in Peradow. <br /> <br /> He has taken many things for granting him life and he has to survive as long as he did and had to get a serious reality check. Anyway ............ Why did I give this picture to 7 to 7?
