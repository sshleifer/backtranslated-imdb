EL MAR is a rigorous, full-blown, absolutely magnificent, brave work of film art. With the connection of Antoine Aloy and Billy Mesquita of Bleu Boet's novel, director Agusti Villaronga created a film that ruined the effects of the war on the minds of the children and the exposure of adult lives. Despite the focus on the worst tattoo of the war on children, the transition that shows the effects of soldiers and adult citizens is clear. <br /> <br /> "Spain's Spanish Civil War threatens blackout and attacks night by killing civilians, killing men, and killing and killing <br /> <br /> When we meet three of our oldest survivors, there is a week of dying (nil mor), Taur (David Lozano), Julia (Sergi Moreno), and the Franciscan Ruma (Roger Casemaker) survived as a prostitute rescued by his 'Joan' Morale (Julie Meera) and kept his lifestyle private. TÃ¼r (Bruno Berggonji) became a weak sexual repressive gay man whose cover was a Catholic His commitment and the greed of self-mutilation / crucifixion is unclear. Nea Torrence) became a nun, and patients in sanitarium reunited with the environment in these three environments and slowly exposing their childhood experiences with war. Ramala wants for a long time to be freed from her morale, and Franciska has her own nanny Internal requirements will face The. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The arrangement of the sanitarium is a graphic plane, between life and death, between lust and love and between devotion and destruction. For more details, the individual audience will destroy the motion of the film, but graphic sex and full nudity (portrayed in a very rare raw footage in the film) and every form of cruelty to the viewer is predictable. These scenes are of great significance for the viewer, and director Villaronga should be appreciated for his perseverance and courage to make the story intense. The actors, children and adults are both excellent: Roger Cassamore, Bruno Bergangini and Antonia Torrens are particularly good at the hardest roles. Cinematography by Jaime Perakaula and the sensational musical score directors by Javier Navaraty provide attention. It is a tough image, but it is highly recommended for those who do not agree with the horrors of war and its consequences. In Spanish with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
