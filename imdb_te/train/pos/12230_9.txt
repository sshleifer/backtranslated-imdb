<br /> One man (Ber Dibening) fired on his arm. Mening Man ... The tragic victim of the space race, the kitchen stove. But instead of being an ordinary man shouting something, he said "AAAAATCH-KAH !!" Sounds like something like this movie you painted ... not a simple image. You made your first step in the famous 70th episode of Gore, featuring unpredictable Melting Man and Rick Baker's amazing makeup effects. Baker is on the verge of becoming a superstar, and at the same time made his famous "castin aliens" in Star Wars. For some strange reasons, STAR WARS has become a surname, and the best meltingman did. <br /> <br /> The film may be anything but mental-bleak stuff. Chabby nurses running through the door of the fisherman, jumped into the waterfall, jumped in the waterfront, and opened the opening credits ("Alex Rubber as an Incredible Melting Man!") ... The rocks, the film offers many, many moments of awareness. "Why they ... but why did he come ... why are they ...?" After a while, you wonder why and see what it is - a very entertaining trash piece. <br /> <br /> The astronaut will return to land in a melting, radioactive state; He escapes and, after he breaks his mind into his body, begins to kill a mad meltdown. The authorities are quick to decide to stop the mass, but (perhaps not "want to panic") wanted him to be taken as silent as possible. So they send a guy with a giger counter after him. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in a surprisingly small film. The meltdown revolves around people who killed him. A doctor searches him with a giger counter. Various characters are introduced, ask questions, leave. Eventually, the physician holds the meltdown, but explains that he is "Dr. Ted Nelson" and shoots a security guard for no reason. The melting guy finally goes away and eventually dissolves in Goo's big ditch. End. <br /> It is very unhealthy, somehow it is very fun, it is very slow. Suppose a widescreen DVD release. Very unique image.
