Alright, before we review it, I have to ask: Why is this not listed individually? It may be just a TV item in Italy, but it is his own film for international Lamberto Bave fans. In America, the film is distributed in VHS and DVDs as "The Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know that I did nothing with "Demons" from a ghost member and crew. But yes, I was disturbed that I personally found it very difficult to be very useful on this site. <br /> Finally, review "Ogre". I've seen this several times a trailer on YouTube and honestly found it scary instead. The film (which is the length of the film, thus becoming a feature film) has many strong parts and is organized to frighten. I was dissatisfied by the last action, but I did not regret the purchase of the DVD before (see Shriek Show). I explained the final action of the TV sources of the film. <br /> The plot is somewhat familiar: an American horror writer is holidaying in an ancient horror castle with husband and son, which is exactly similar to his childhood nightmare setting. "The Shining" has a vibrant echoes, but this is a supernatural horror different brand. The woman (Virginia Bryant) finds more proof that she is the real life place of nightmares, but her husband does not believe her. <br /> <br /> The multiple nightmare scenes are quite simple. Ogre Coconut effect is great, reminded me of the first "Hellraiser" of Uncle Frank's resurrection. There are some good shocks and well underwater scene. I give them clues that the film never gets cheated to imitate American films with such feelings as "A Night Street on Elm Street". "The Ogre" is original. <br /> <br /> He is his classic "Demons" series on the Lamberto Bava interview on the Shirk Show DVD. He has given a lot of credit to the actual fortress he portrays. In fact, the film is good for this setting. Simon Boswell's music is very helpful. <br /> <br /> There are good things here. "The Ogre" is not accurate, but it's very valuable. This was a low Lamberto Bauwa.
