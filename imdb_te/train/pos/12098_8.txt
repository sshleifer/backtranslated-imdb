I actually saw this film on Saturday afternoon as a boy in the Old Rialto Theater as part of Triple Bill, in which Vincent Pryce's "Last Man on Earth" and Mario Bava "Nightmare Castle". I got nightmares about ghosts ghosts after a week! Although not yet known, three films have proven to be classics of the genre. I was very scared! Even though three films are horrifying for me, it's a fortress of blood that has a very profound effect. <br /> This is the first of the bill. For the first time in 20 minutes we started going to the film and I could not see from the beginning. The editorial print is just 79 minutes (87 minutes of unfinished runs), so it will not miss. But despite this, the bejeepers scared me from the dark creepy atmosphere (ruined castles, fog enshrouded cemeteries, full of shadows and cobwebs), gothic set design, strong acting, and suspense (especially last 20 minutes) and lasting impression finally getting the last film for my collection It took me years. This was not a French-Italian import, but it was not a feature film in Winnipeg. I could not remember much of the title (early in the film and was scared of intelligence), and to make matters worse, the film literally appeared in dozens of different film titles (Donz MacRabre, Castle of Terror, Castle of Terror, Terror's Long Night, Terror Long Night ...) and USA / UK-based "Castle of Blood" dozens of other " B "horror and suspense movies, ghost. But thanks to the internet and perseverance, I finally found it! After a long time, finally, the whole film will finally see the whole movie! It does not have a pretty much emotional effect when I am a boy, but as the Haunted House movies go, it is well-known for "The Haunting," "Innocents" or "Black Sunday," the film's best start to Italian filmmaker Antonio Margarethi. It stars 60's screaming Queen Icon Barbara Steel and has a well-written screenplay by Sergio Corbusi about the suspicious writer (Georges Rivier) to be part of a night in a haunted house and part of an ongoing grooving story. Hypnotic Steel is a very romantic love interest - Arturo Dominici has acted as Julia in the role of Dr. Carmass and Margaret Robesham. <br /> <br /> In Markherty, multiple tricks appear to be a clue for modern audiences, but they work more efficiently in black and white than they can do anytime in modern color. Apart from using body counting and special effects, the film will disturb the old fashioned way, good story, stylish direction, slim set production, interesting camera work and strong performing performances. <br /> <br /> Margarethi takes these things and produces spectacular images, revealing the film's suspense structure to the home as horrific paranormal secretly unwitting writer. <br /> <br /> This film is not without mistakes. Pace initially dragging the film (ironically, I missed the first 20 minutes). This will further deteriorate by trying to synapse images to restore the original length of the film. While congratulating the fans to restore the film - introductory - it is more interrupted than help. English Voice cans are simply passive and restored scenes, and the language changes from English to English (French subtitles in English), which may cause some audience audiences. <br /> <br /> However, for the print quality of the Synapse Films Wides. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> Rob Rowbottom Winnipeg, MB Canada
