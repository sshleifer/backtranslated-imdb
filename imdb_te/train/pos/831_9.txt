When I was limited, I saw the film, mainly for the novelty that Pierce Brosnan was looking for, but it became one of the funniest films I've seen all year. It starts almost as a thriller, but gradually increases with a humor and great comedy thriller between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Also, when I say the movie is comedy, it does not have a heart at all and it's not as impressive as it should be. When I went into the theater I hoped more than you did, but one of the best films I have seen for so long. I left the theater and I thought I was very much out of the movie. I would recommend anyone to appreciate a good comedy with a well written script and a big mustache.
