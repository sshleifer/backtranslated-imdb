Best picture about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflection of the couple coming to the dangerous and contradictory world of marriage and family. This decision is better or worse in our lives and in our child's life. True intrusion or 'friends' help - when we leave. The real role of families: they can help or they can destroy us. A mad priest who is not mad about telling what can happen according to statistics and reality. <br /> <br /> The couple who thought in a "special marriage" would have a painful story in their future history. No one, after the priest tells their own history ?? If they leave the future in different hands, they do not know what they are getting married. Problems are real, demanding real life and commitments from each other. The real victims are the children of the divorced, Andre film with the original name- or names. Abortion is only an easy departure: sadness, sadness and dissatisfaction will be there after abortion. Each of the real issues of states and social security families is considered less likely. Stefhenia's weakness and frustration was 'friends' gossip, because he was not alone because he lived alone. <br /> <br /> Someone might think this film is a pessimistic film, but Stephania and Tomasso, deep in their hearts, are they like a beautiful marriage and family, if not, why they'd marry? A true and beautiful marriage depends only on them: each one has their own decisions, each one of their lives. The family may be the place where everyone loves, because only his or her being. The screenplay is awesome. The performances are great: Stephania and Tomasso, Â¡almost dull priest! Excellent direction and script. Colors and cameras management, excellent.
