I was expecting age before I read all the reviews that I had read this terrible! I rented out as I waited worst, occasionally the best sandler film there was rare! Sandler often speaks to the camera and the film does not take seriously, but it's all part of that fun! A great way to waste an afternoon, and you can even laugh at you twice a day! A good picture, well worth a rental!
