I disagree with Oliver's fondness! As a young child - it's a long time, and the story is moving a little slowly because of all the musical numbers. As a teenager, I learned that I enjoyed the film's entertainment. Think of it as a celebration of the classic story, rather than the idea of ​​Oliver Twist. If you see a music, it's not good for the story. <br /> Music is the main part of this film, and the highest percentage of it is stellar and very impressive. Many or all of the cast participated in the musical stage version, and it shows in their shows - and I think it's a plus. All of these shows belong to older versions of the "Old Platform" style, and they are very entertaining. <br /> <br /> The exception is Oliver, whose job looks pretty and looks like real performers. <br /> <br /> Fagin and The Mode are the real stars of this movie. Oliver Reed also makes an excellent job of performing a scary screen size. Six's dog bullsy also features a good performance. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone. Those who hated musical powers would despise it, and the musicians were taken very seriously. Anyone who wrongfully misinterprets the historic details or step-by-step behavior of bad acting can ruin anyone's happiness. Sit back and enjoy the entertainment - it's very good if you remember a fantasy, a strict adaptation, as a musical, it is loosely organized around the book.
