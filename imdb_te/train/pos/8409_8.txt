A good picture, and I'll watch it many times. Rich (the previous commentator) is correct: it's more going to be here than what's clear from title boards, and how much I feel in translation. Is there in the original? Or do the local-language audience expect to talk more? Or - Since it's written by the author of the novel author based on it - is a well-known story which is already familiar to the audience? In short, take a look at it, but it requires more work from contemporary audience who induced the audience in 1913. <br /> <br /> Alpha video release has a new organ score, but the music does not match how the story progresses. Sure, it starts promising, but a repetitive, reflecting nothing in action on the screen is a decline into the philip-glass-like unity. After hearing it for a while, I turned off the sound and looked at me: Improved!
