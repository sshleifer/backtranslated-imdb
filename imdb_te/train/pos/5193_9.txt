Sword fight survived from this world, with mining scenes Wire techniques (up to the end) are spectacular scenes. The scene with Chan and Prey is probably the theme of this film. The evil guys are clich√© to attack characters on the building but the image is comfortable with it. An injection of humor from the woo. <br /> You can not tell the plot with its twists and turns is unpredictable and exciting and good or bad or what's on. <br /> <br /> The good sense of suspense, the depth of the story is very intense for the film of this genre, and not much kung-fu fox To you.
