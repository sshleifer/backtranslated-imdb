I am surprised at the negative comments that I read, and people who make such comments may feel less than honest. It was the most moving and real character of then-known Joseph Smith. It has forgotten that I'm looking at a movie at times.

If anyone of any Christian religion can see this film if it has some positive impact - it should be said that it is not a reflection and image of the person. I give the movie "10" and encourage honest souls to view it. Very little is the heart of the person who gave everything he trusted in ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs are ridiculed, this film is a permanent reminder of the people we want. We have no religious beliefs.- On Pruitt-
