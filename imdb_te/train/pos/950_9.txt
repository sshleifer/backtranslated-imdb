Fittings and actors The television movie will make me better translate the classic story of Dickens. George C. Scott is quite believable as the rest of the cast. His scrag film can be damaging to the very end. Then his character will change to the person who really repented. The 19th-century English town selected for this set creates an atmosphere for Dickens and adds to the power of the film. This is a movie that will be accompanied by a real Grinch and It Wonderful Life.
