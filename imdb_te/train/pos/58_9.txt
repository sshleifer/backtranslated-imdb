<br /> <br /> This movie surfaced through the movie channels and this movie caught the end of the channel, and I wanted a later look. <br /> <br /> When reading the program summary, I did not really know what to do, but I was very unhappy from this film. <br /> <br /> It gives me an adult who attends high school in 80 years, a little better understanding of what our kids are supposed to do today. <br /> <br /> The fact that you can not see shooting is the only sensuality. Child and adult are both worse at times to experience a combination of learning and learning rules. <br /> <br /> Overall, I do not want any movie, but I'm happy to see you anyway.
