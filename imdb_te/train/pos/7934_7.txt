According to this board, I love you or hate you. Usually it goes with all the movies. But there is no need to get tested with others. All the opinions we are making here give feedback. I had rented this film last night and wanted to make my impression in the mix. Yet I am surprised how many people killed it. There is a difference between a film fan and a horror film fan. I'm a horror film fan. Most plain olay movie fans do not like horror movies. Watching movies with a very low budget cam card are coming nowadays. It's hard to keep. And how bad they are, how difficult it is to be in these films. I wanted to make a review of "The Dead of Living Dead", because it's good when compared to the rest of the waste. It's nothing special but it's horror movie makers that try to make the end of a terrible horror movie too intense. I really liked this one. Are you saying that I have no effort in this regard? And another thing, I bet you all bet you all of these great DVD collections, but what would Major Motion Pictures be proud of nothing right? Nothing wrong, but you need to know how to appreciate the low budget independent. I know when I saw this movie. I thought some 100 million dollars because I was upset. Some of you will continue to look in matrix again and try to compare with the matrix. And if you are more than 24 years old, it will explain everything. Good movie folks, check it out.
