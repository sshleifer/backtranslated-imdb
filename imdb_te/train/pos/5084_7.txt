I'm amazed, the Secret Fury is a happy and good movie ... Perhaps there are no expectations for this film ... However, the plot holes for the film ... I say, I can not imagine who is behind the whole scheme At the very end of the film ... First, Robert Ryan uses the same technique as "gaslight" when the husband attempts to fool his wife, but I'm mistaken ...... With the main issue picture, they are going in the direction of the first that they do not give any evidence. ..... I thought, Robert Ryan and Claude Colbert are doing their roles well ..... Plus, Vivian Vance, a good character who steals scenes in this role ... movies, you keep guessing ......
