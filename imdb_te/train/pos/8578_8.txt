The film is one of the best American B-movies of the 90s. If you're looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you see a tongue for cheek variation on some actions, laughs, and gangsters fighting cops, this is well worth looking. Everyone smiled a bit in the scene, but that movie was really all about, and everyone was very funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have a great chemistry and have to do another film together.
