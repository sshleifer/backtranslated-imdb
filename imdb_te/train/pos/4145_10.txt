This is not a masterpiece theater. You should not wait. This is a pure girl FUN with the most amazing cast of female leads. As someone said here, this movie is meant to be baby mama. And the only downside Tina Fey that I see in this movie is that it's not- it's the brightest and brightest stars on the planet along with the stars. The film is pure silliness on the surface, but if you look at it you will know there is no messages and deep meaning to us that you want to go back to it all back in life now knowing what we know now. . PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.
