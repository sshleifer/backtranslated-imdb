The plot is never a Fred Astier and Ginger Rogers film's strongest content, but the screenplay of "Follow the Fleet" is exceptionally mediocre. Fred and Ginger come all - they play the "Bread" Baker and Sherry Martin, their personal and professional partnership dancers joining the baking navy. When they meet again, their love-hate relationship creates some entertaining comic moments. But for most of the film, they are Sherie's sister Connie (Harriet Hollard), Sailor Billy Smith (Randolph Scott), Biggie's silence with another woman, and Connie is an old Scuncher father who inherited from her. <br /> <br /> But at the same time "Follow the Fleet" is an exceptional Irving Berlin scene that can show their talent. "We Saw Sea The Sea" and "I Need Reader Lead A Band", Astr√© gets two good solos. He manifested and, of course, danced with electrification - and the sailor's suit appears to be more common than a kid and athlete than him. Rogers sang catchy "Let Yourself Go" and then makes solo tap-dance for the same tune. <br /> <br /> The three duets will save the film, although they all bow to the story with crazy excuses. Fred and Ginger "Let Yourself Go" won another dance, a dance competition by doing a powerful routine. Later, they sing and dance "I like my basket at all my lips in one basket" and sing and dance, which choreography is a comic effect. At the end, Fred and Ginger will see how to get romantic duets in evening dresses - finally in the film - it will be part of the show-show-show. This situation is fictional, but the song "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the most beautiful beautiful ever written by Berlin (which reminds Cole Porter), and the dance is elegance. <br /> <br /> It is a function that sits a lot through the dialogue sections of "Follow the Fleet", in fact, it is not necessary because the plot is rarely mutual numbers. But I can watch songs and over.
