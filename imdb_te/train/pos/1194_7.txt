The film is mostly intimidated by Robert Taylor, a cruel buffet hunter and people who want to meet him. The buffet is set in a hunt for a decline, which draws the end of the tragic era of innocent slaughter and is full of drama and remorse for buffalo and native Americans. Taylor tries to hinder his hatred towards his Indians and finds his innocent innocence that the buffalo herds can not be disappeared. In one scene, he shoots animals after animals, on the other hand he kills Indians and then eats the food cooked in their fire. In this brutal exterior, his colleagues (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan, and Russ Tomlin) should not leave him as an unprotected person who has disagreed. It is not a very pleasant film and it is reduced by weight through the play created, which leads to a tedious and well-suited end in a blizzard.
