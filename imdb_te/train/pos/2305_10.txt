I thought it was a very good movie. Knowing about the liking of the same boy before he was killed, 2 sisters had seen a little over the film about the sisters. I'm sure the film would have a very different ending if this was done, so the film became a good film. It's good for you and your parents to get you to know what's going on in your life and how it's going to work between 2 sisters (the same boy) to deal with a child. It's good to see love stories that have a terrible thing in one's life, and it will be even closer to you when you can get it. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I'll still do it when it comes. Every time I see it I see it looking. It would have been nice to have a part 2 for this movie, perhaps because the older sister had a baby and he had a great end to the story since he died, so it will continue to be alive even if he dies.
