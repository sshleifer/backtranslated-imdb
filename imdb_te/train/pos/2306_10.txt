Never seen a man in the moon until the last evening of this HDTV channel. See, my taste is like other people, eclectic. My likes from Blue Velvet to Dr. Stranjalove The Ghost and Ms. Muir through the Wizard of Oz and the Loved One, Erasherhead, Repo Man and The Spy Revolution. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon is a beautifully portrayed, sensual, heartbreaking, happy and tragic film, beautifully portrayed in which actors live in the moment without being real. This sweet story will soon be in our private library. <br /> <br /> In this beautiful era in rural Louisiana, this lovely story of life is literally transported to its religious order. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to be confused during the last few moments of the film. <br /> <br /> Instead of refusing to spoil pleasure or to suffer from my mysterious proclamation, If you do not buy any other movie, please buy a moon in man. This moving story is the one you enjoy time and reliving again. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida < <br /> <br /> 05 April 2009
