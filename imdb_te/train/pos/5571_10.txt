After seeing "a bit" at the screening's screening at AFM on the other night, I should say I was totally impressed. The audience are laughing all the way. Unfortunately, every field has already been sold, so I can not afford to buy this movie, but I really believe it will be a big hit on the domestic and oceans. I agree not to be called "wiped" male "sex and the city" rather than "sex and the city", "sex and the city," "wiped" is a satiric film without ever dancing. Very romantic comedies are fun and fun on relationships that do not dare. Also, I have had more plot and stories than the "Swales", "Clercs," and "Sex and the City" featured in the AFM. The "stalled" beat did not slow down and did not provide audiences with non-stop comedy. Amanda Peet's performance and the rest of the cast are all rock solid, which only impresses on the budgetary consideration of the film.
