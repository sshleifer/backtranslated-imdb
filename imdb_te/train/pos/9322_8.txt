I was delighted to see someone painting about how difficult it was to risk your heart for the second time. Or third. This film is exactly what it promises - is lovely, fun and it gives you a good feeling of rounding your heart. This plot is not quite inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not been used yet. Although Scott Wolfe does not appear to be a father at the age of eight, this cast is definitely selected when he wears a suit. So, sparks are all right places, the support is a lovely support for the cast and you probably will not want to switch to the channel if you guess the whole movie. It's the perfect sort of entertainment on a Sunday evening.
