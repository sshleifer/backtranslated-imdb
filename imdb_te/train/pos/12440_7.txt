Recap: This is common in Lacci Casino in Tangerine. The casino will close and prepare for a big deal next day. The owner left Louche and some staff, leaving the Modesty Charge. Suddenly the armed gangsters' casino is badly damaged. Modesti is unaware, they have already killed Lochini, after the money is now hidden in the treasury. But no one knows right now, and still alive, the code to open the treasury at the casino. The treasury is also explosive with explosives, so the attackers can not leave the door. Suddenly Modesty's eye is eyeing the eye of the gangster leader Milos, in the game of roulette with the survivors. <br /> <br /> Commentaries: Modesty Blaze, either as I have seen or read none of it. The first point I'm going to do is it is slightly misunderstood. It was a thriller with struggles that was a major storytelling between Modesty and Micklo. <br /> <br /> Looking at the scene already filled with the main storyline and main suspense, Modesty and Micklos. It is an innovative and intriguing way to reveal the background of a character, and most of the story takes place much before the casino outside. Someone is talking almost like a pilot for a TV series, and that it really is used. But I thought it was a good way to introduce a role than most other characters. <br /> <br /> I did two well-known actors Alexandra Staden and Nicolas Coster-Waldo. <br /> <br /> Staden has particularly painted Modesty and really has this confident and talented character. <br /> <br />
