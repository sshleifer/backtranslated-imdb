Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, Rostov's Ripper, who was 8 years old, mainly women and children killed 52 people. This has prevented the Soviet authorities from investigating how difficult it is to investigate crimes. It's an intelligent way to leave a unwanted one which will do the job. In the beginning it's probably a bit slow to pace, but the story unfolds as it really does. Next to "The Silence of the Lambs", I can say only about the best film about a serial killer I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult for the rest of the actor to act in this movie. Stephen Rhea is really intelligent as an experienced Forensic expert who is responsible for the investigation. Donald Sutherland is the only person in the Russian government who is working with his acting superiority and is ready to help him. What to Say About Jeffrey Dumman, who played the role of a seaflil killer? Created a more enthusiastic role than hate dual intelligence. Yes, he is a monster, but he is his wife, his employer, his colleagues ... He is tortured, is ashamed, as well as a very bad man, ridiculous and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie for everyone who liked the good documentation of the docu-drama, where the actors are more important than the special effects. It deserves at least a 9/10, maybe you ask me.
