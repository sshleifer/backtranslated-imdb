I entered this amazing show on Season 4 and since then, I have all episodes on all episodes DVD and are better and better with 9 and 10 seasons. Now it may not be Richard Dean Anderson, but with Ben Broder and Claude Black, it has given more strength and originality after 10 seasons. Sadly the sci-fi channel now got rid of this spectacular performance with a hope relay for a 11th DVD film and both are hopefully more direct. Atlantis is still strong in its 4th seasons. And a third spin of the stargate franchise is not anywhere near dead. This TV show must be seen in all sci-fi fans and genres because it has such a wide range of appeals to all ages and all kinds of people, see it! 10/10
