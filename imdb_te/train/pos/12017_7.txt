"The Last Hard Men" is a typical Western of the 70s. Many of them were inspired by Sam Peckinfo. In addition, this director Andrew McLaughlan is a John Ford student and it is clearly shown in most scenes. The beginning of IMO is very good. In a certain way, McLagan wanted the audience to show a trip to the wilderness from civilization. In the third part there are some unethical errors and I complain a bit about Charlton Heston. The old former lawyer, known as Sam Bourgety, was to play, but he was in an amazing physical shape. I've been on horseback or on a stone and really hurt the problems. He does not seem to be too motivated for me as much as his legendary films are as simple as he is. The same goes to Barbara Hershey, who plays the daughter of the sheriff. Both the director or the director may be unhappy with their characters. Harshe and Coburn are their best but they are still cool. If the script writer Sam Bargard had John Wayne in their minds? Michael Parks uses some of his role as a modern sheriff. On the other hand, James Coburn is the unlawful Zach Provo. Cobern this is a great villain. He is portraying a bad guy between hatred and intellect. <br /> Landscapes and shootouts are terrific. The gunfire scenes are bloody and violence is realistic. Zach Provo and his gang have some gory and violent scenes. The normal Western act in the middle of the film I'm missing. I was bank robbery or somehow respected. Overall, this is the entertaining western film. Not a great movie but because of a great coburn, a very good start and a few ghre and violent sequences than average.
