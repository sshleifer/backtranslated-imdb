If I'm going to watch a porn movie, I prefer to have some sort of plot, and descent conversation. <br /> <br /> New girl-next-door scandals on the nature and weakness of the neighbors, there is seduction and sex worrying. Chelsea Blue, (I mean Brooke Lawless) is an actress to act as part of the blackmail seductress, and that part plays a wonderful role. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and very beautiful actress. In this movie she will get all 10 pictures. Her partner Monique Alexander is the perfect stylish guy in the film. Both should work together. In this movie, Monique, who plays the gigi character, does not have much to complete or say. That's very bad. It seems to have more talent to share with her. After I liked the girl (possible) after DA's wife. I forget her name, but she looks good and is not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out what some are excited about. Her portions were obvious to her purchase. It's okay, but she's done? Sorry, but come on! I'm afraid of his performance as Chelsea dropped some performances here, except for overriding any negatives of talent and beauty. Overall, this film is fine.
