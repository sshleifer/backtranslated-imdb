Sydney Lumet, though ancient active directors, still came to the game! A few years ago he "found me guilty", that Win Diesel was a proof for all who could actually act, if he had the opportunity and the right director. Nobody can blame him if he retired after this movie (a true masterpiece in my mind). But he is still strong, and has already announced his next film 2009. <br /> <br /> But let's have this movie right here. Their performance on the cast list is top notch, not ridiculous. The little mood in their acting, the "real" dialogue and / or the evolution of events throughout the film is just fantastic. The time (time) of the film, which puts your calf all the time, keeps time-lines smooth, editing is natural / flawless. The narrative has been greatly increased by this story, but it is at least a good movie (drama / thriller) in "normal" time production. I can only highly recommend, the rest is up to you! : O)
