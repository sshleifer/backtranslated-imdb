I have some reservations about this film, which is a simple fare charge --- a formula about Christmas. <br /> <br /> When we were in the middle of a hot wave in late June, we decided to fire it anyway, we would see some ice. <br /> <br /> This film is laughing at someone else. Ben Affleck believes in his role, but this is the real star James Gandofini. <br /> You sent his lines with the true intellectual knowledge of him and made a great "father". <br /> If you would like two hours of enjoyment, be sure to check it out.
