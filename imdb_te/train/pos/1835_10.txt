This remarkable picture is that I do not have words to explain. I do not know how it got to the rating of the film 7.3 It should be 9.3 but no one can do this film anyway and acting through Akshay is just unusual in the second film half u cry and the film is really good unexpected ending makes the movie correct. You should watch this movie once, I think up to two until u is up to u. Anyway, I like this film and it's not just ludicrous and it's not funny but it really makes good sense and I think this is the best film in Bollywood history. But I know that people will choose the representative. I do not like the film about music background music but it is not good.
