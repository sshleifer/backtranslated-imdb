I'm currently studying movies at the A.S level and "It's Not a Love Song" is a movie we've seen and in my opinion it's a very simple story, but a complicated anticipated story. <br /> If you scratch the surface, you will see the thriller-chase film of the two people who walk through rural areas from the farmers: - "Outside". <br /> <br /> You will find a real sense of true style. As this suggests, it is a love story of homosexuals, trust, deceit and betrayal. <br /> <br /> The film can not be directly told about this "love" but events outside, for example, the spike towards Hayton acts in the face of this obscene love affair in our faces. <br /> <br /> This is a good example of why British films should not be removed as "rubbish" if they make a low budget. <br /> <br /> It is not enough for a good movie with a complicated storyline, and for the average fan of Hollywood blockbusters.
