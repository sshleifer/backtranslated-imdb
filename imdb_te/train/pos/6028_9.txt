In the midst of Antonio, the film was quickly dismissed by many critics, a 'flawed' look at 60 American American culture / politics. It was valuable, and I was able to identify more memorable and memorable than his acclaimed films like El'Viventura, because here it shows more emotion and empathy than somewhere. This story is very simple, but it is used as a frame for American consumer culture, student life, counter-culture and anti-entrepreneurial opposition, Antonioni's spectacular observations on anti-war resistance and is so prominent. <br /> <br /> This is an unusually trivial image from entire technology. Using a 17-inch camera set-up with a cametary finale (powerful as climax, wild bunch), when the desert 'Love In-In', using billboards, and jaws down the right. Moreover, Antonioni chose a hell of a famous woman with Daria Halperin, which is beautifully beautiful on the screen. It does not involve much of 'acting' because it feels like a document-drama, so the use of professionals as a mainstay is very effective in that case. And the soundtrack is not full of fantastic music, its use is very impressive (I'm Pink Floyd - Visuals is very good) I can not forget the movie because of the choice of music. Contrary to popular view, this is a great achievement in the film, and I am excited about anyone with an enthusiastic taste or off-beat. One of the most important films of the 60s that have been looking for a well-sought value, and a refresher / release of the DVD.
