Thomas Copano is not Tom Carper's owner, Anne Mary's owner, governor. The reason for the Fed's participation was that he called Clinton and asked him to take the pedals involved in the case. I lived outside Philadelphia at that time, so this case was the first news every day. I also read the book on Ann Rule and saw the "City Confidential" section of A & E. Tom Capano is a megalonic (sp.), Uber-controller and a monster. He said he loved Marie, but he could control him. Although she did not allow him, he killed her and killed the ultimate control. I think he's still worthless money.
