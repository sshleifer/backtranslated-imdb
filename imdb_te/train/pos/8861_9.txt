Andy says: "No one is hurt, everyone wins." Before he says, we know that the opposite is true: everyone will be hurt, no one wins. This is a new trend in American films, or maybe the old garment was brought back last time. Think of "Eastern Promises", "Will Be There", "No Country for Old Men". These films are dark, intense, well-made and do not care about happy endings. I love them. "Devil Knows Before You Dead You Dead" fits the general description, but the atmosphere creates. Kelly Masterson's first script, a Hollywood movie, always meets with a Greek tragedy. Fellow celebrity director Stanley Donnen, paying tribute to the Sydney Lumette, transforms the elegant story into an exceptional, old school character. Opening shots, a obese accountant Doggie-styling, also has the look and feel of a Dutch master painter, although his trophy wife. In contrast, the drug dealer's condo looks like a string of mandrians. Great shows all around. The character of Albert Finny only Charles is a little more entertaining, eyes wide and nearly feels almost on the screen of the mouth. But he is in deep trouble, many of us are more than difficulties to know anytime. For compensation, Marisa Tommy is super hot. But of course you do not need me to tell you. Why did she want to be with a guy like Gina Andy, we always said, but it's OK. Action, the character after all. The unique and magic touch of Carter Burwell's music makes this a great masterpiece. Do not miss it.
