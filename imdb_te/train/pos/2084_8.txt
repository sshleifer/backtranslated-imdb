My main problem with the picture goes too long. Other then, it's very good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is about to marry through the marriage he married. Lewis Rainer is a servant who is married to. They live in Munich's father in a farm and they are pretty bad. When he finally earned money to buy a little land, drought hits and nothing is growing. Everyone who goes to the north through Muni will come back at first. When they go to town they find that they do not have jobs and they are worse than before. They think of selling their younger daughter as a slave for some money but must take a decision on it. When some people start looting the town, the military show and people start to run. Paul Muni did a good job and Louis Rainier won the second Oscar for the film.
