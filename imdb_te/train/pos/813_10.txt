<br /> <br /> My second favorite film from Star Wars series went to Luke to protect Han Jolla from Jabba after 'Empire Strikes Back' '' Return of the Jedi ''. At the same time, the galactic empire is under construction, the construction of a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this station is completely built, it will end the rebel alliance. Wader and Emperor are impatient due to the new Death Star delay and they have to kill many commanders to have a project on a schedule. <br /> <br /> Send a message from Luca to Jabba, where R2 and C3po are in the Jabba building, where Hans plays to discuss life. He gives Rb2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan. The jabba was not accepted as a part of the decoration of his palace (hidden in Han Carbonyin) and was hidden under the guard of Lando Jabba, and Chebbaa also rewarded Jabba. The same hunter attempts to save Han Solo and put him back in human form, in fact it is revealed that Princess Lia in a disguise. <br /> <br /> Jabba discovers Leba's plan and takes her as her slave, who is thrown into the cell chebba cello. <br /> <br /> Luke arrives at a Jedi horse to save his friends. In his first attempt to kill Zabba, he falls into Jabba's monster's cell (Banta), but it easily kills. Jabba is angry and decides to leave Han, Chaabaka and Luke to the Shalakak, which has a large creature from the desert, which lives about 1.000 years of life. Luke, Han and Chevy again succeeded, and Bob Fett dying even when he accidentally threw him into the mouth of Sarkack. Leah kills Jabba and Han, Luke and Chevi goes well after the c3po and R2. <br /> <br /> Once again, everyone is safe, Luke decides to finish his training as a Jedi and go to Dagba to complete his promise to Yoda. Yoda is very old and ill, he is already at the age of 900 and before he dies, Yoda does not need much training with Luca but he must fight again with Wader. Luke was the father of Luke, and he confirmed to Luke that there was another skyscraper in Luke. In his last moments, Yoda asks Luke to recall his suggestions for the dark side of the globe, and Luke sent his Jedi knowledge to others. When Yoda dies, the soul of O'Brien shows up to Luke, and Luther's father tells him that Anakin has changed his name to Darth Vader and he has more than one engine. Luke is worried about killing his own father, and says his father feels that he still has mercy. Obi von tells Luke that his twin sister is Lea, and the reasons why Luke and Leah are separate from the kids. If he refuses to kill Wunder, Lucas gives his final advice to the Emperor to win the war. At the same time, the emperor Wader needs to mimic their efforts to bring Luke to the darkest, since it is stronger than Luke. <br /> <br /> Now we have the best fights since the Star Wars series, when the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station, "Death Star 2", Luke Wader and Emperor, and Leah, Han and Chevy 'Death Star 2 'Power field needs to be turned off, EWOKS's help. (Small creatures found in little bears) <br /> <br /> It is definitely one of the most exciting Star Wars!
