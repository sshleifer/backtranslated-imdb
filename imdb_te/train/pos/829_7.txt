I agree, I thought this film was not good, but I soon changed my mind. Continue to guess what the image goes to. Pierce Brosson is amazing in his role as a hitman, suddenly becomes gray & he asks the guy who met at a Mexican bar for help. Greg Kinner begins an innocent conversation with Pierce on a Mexican bar, as a lightweight man from Denver. <br /> <br /> When you see Pierce when he finds himself in the imaginary, especially the bull's scene in the film, you will be guessing the film. His last jobs.
