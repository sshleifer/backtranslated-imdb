Two years have passed and mostly everyone looks different, some good and some different. <br /> <br /> Some of the defects they have had to change the Joker are now red lips and more like black hair and black pupils, and he voiced Mark Hamil plus I guess. They show poison ivy more whiteness, she becomes a plant and Catwens is quite different and not originally "attractive". <br /> <br /> Batman, bat girl, dresser like Killer Crock and Scarco Badassa, especially look scarecrow. <br /> <br /> This program is not original because Batman is not alone. A lot of time is working with Bat Girl and the new Robin, Tim Drek. Nightwing (Dick Grayson) often comes to rescue. Batman has dropped the yellow logo and black wing on his suit and looks like a kicking tons of teeth, although he is a bit bigger. <br /> <br /> In this program, some restored characters but stories are exciting and dialogue is still great. <br /> <br /> Make sure you check it out as one of the best Batman episodes of "Over the Edge". <br /> Total 8-9 / 10
