Oh, no fun here! <br /> <br /> There is a flair for Amy Herringing-directed comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, LookHus Talking), but she tells her actors to say and have fun. Michael Keaton winds through Johnny's character, easily his best screen appearance. Joe Piscotta is a great name Danny Vermin, and these unhealthy directors did not take any decision on this. I also mention Ryodim Dmitry Moroni and the unique vocabulary of the character. <br /> <br /> Good lines throughout the film are scattered with Peter Boyle, Griffith Dunne. Marin Stapleton, Meryl Henner, gave good lines. <br /> <br /> Actors are also a good song with little characters like Dick Bucks and Alan Hale.
