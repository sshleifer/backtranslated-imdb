Van Trota film Ronstrasse is the best film I have seen over the years. I'm not really interested in movies with the historical background but this she won my interest at that time !! <br /> <br /> The only annoying thing about the film is the scenes in New York, and the seal I use <br /> <br /> "I try to be as American as possible" ... I feel totally unsuccessful. <br /> The scenes that came back really came to my heart. German actress Katja Rieman is well worthy of her award. The most attractive actress I have ever seen. In the future I will see more about her movies. <br /> I'm a native German speaker.) And for only one year, when I'm back, I'll buy some Rimon DVDs. Have not seen this movie yet: see it! I think it will be a long time to explain all about, especially when all flash spines and switches of times are difficult to explain, but just watcxh it, you will be zesty !!!!!!!
