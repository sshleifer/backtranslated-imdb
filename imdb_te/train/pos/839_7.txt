Think of Pierce Brosnan and think you're happy, dapper, clever James Bond. In this movie, Brasanne plays against the type - and doing so much fun (makes the audience). <br /> <br /> It has very good sequences (a riveting, on the edge of Brasnan and a good, compliant "off" -Id-Edge Kinnear have some good lines). My only cavill is that Hope Davis, OH-so wrestling wife ("Can I see your gun?) Is not very often seen: she had a wonderful foil for these men. <br /> <br /> The film is like a matador: it plays with the audience, But it's "going to kill." A storyline (with a positive morality!) Will emerge because the ending is amazing: it is desirable for a wide audience, , Success and thoroughly entertaining.
