I really wanted the film to be amazing. History is not correct, but style is luxurious and more intimate. I'm a fan of Victoria Emily Blunt and how she retains her soul even though she is forced into a real boycott of her youth. Blunt describes Witchcraft's glamorous and sometimes dogmatic manner for being well-known (perhaps infamous). The romantic aspects of the film are very real and pale, and you really understand why Vicrostria chooses Albert's mourning for the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the picture are worth the notice as well. I congratulate the beautiful scoring of the story with the dramatic move of the story. <br /> <br /> I think cinematography is also the best, because some scenes do not have too many breaths. Because they shot this picture. Best of 2009!
