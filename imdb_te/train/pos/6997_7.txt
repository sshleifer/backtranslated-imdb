One thing is perfect ... You can not watch this movie if you have a bad day. The story is based on a tragic event and follows a sinful character that he can not handle. Instead of thinking about what the story is going to happen, you will drink instead of a simple dumb. The drops eventually end and the performances are meaningful. <br /> You do not have any questions. However, if you get him ill, he must accept what he chooses. Unless you agree or disagree <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, at the end you are a good picture of a little sad. I think you would recommend this film, where you would like to see explosions and fights.
