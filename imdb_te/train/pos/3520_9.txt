It is a "B series" film noir, and my vote reflects its membership in that genre. Last night, I saw this movie in a left bank movie in Paris, which opened a two-week film Noir Run. <br /> As the previous reviewer commented, the drumming scene was fantastic! (B-movies banned to record A-movies!) And the plot is secretive. However, about the franchtote tone, I beg to not agree: me, he is suspicious of the attacks; Correct shade of creepy. Here is a kind of German expression (director, Robert Seolmar, a German language that came to Hollywood during the war), so the whole of the film comes in exaggeration air. <br /> <br /> However, this is a great revenge for Ella Ri√±as, her third credit performance, the viewer entered the film. It is a miracle that Jean Tirne is a kind of "Girl Friday", which is strongly similar to her. But she's very good here, I can not wait to see another of her ('Impact') Internet and see it.
