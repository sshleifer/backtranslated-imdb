There are four words on why this movie was created - "she's done wrong". The gay commercial vehicle's huge commercial success convinced the studio brass, the gay 90s melodoras is a viable proposition. Here we are aimed at the celebrities of its talent with the fast moving and well-written love. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beary and George Stroller are amazing as friendly rivals; Jackie Cooper is a bit harder to take, but Fay Wray stole in a movie with her stock-in-trade damsell. Walsh proves himself - a great director - a wraps punch takes a lot, and is absolutely reliable as the object of her rafting and bakery's love. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere, beautifully designed, is a valuable forgotten image of this revival.
