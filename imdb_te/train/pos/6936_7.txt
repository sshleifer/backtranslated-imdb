Winchester 73 received credit from many critics to bring back the West country after WWII. Director Antony Mann should get a lot of credit for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart is doing an excellent job, but both Stephen McNally and John McIntyre both stole the role of bad guys. This is a good script, with many stories going on at the same time. Look for Young Bulga Rock Hudson's very first appearance. Thanks to God for a few years, let's start playing the Indians in Western films. The film was filmed in black and white and Tucson Arizona. <br /> <br /> I do not want Winchester 73 in Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane, but this is an above average recommendation from me. <br /> <br />
