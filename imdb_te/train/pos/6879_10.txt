"The Grove Tube" is one of the two Ken Shapiro movies, the other being the foul "modern issues". It's just a full-fledged simulation of TV. From Shapay - "Modern Problems" was not explicitly clear - the film included Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler's cousin Richard Beller. Three cast members (plus some other people in smaller characters) appear different skits. Chase is ridiculous in the comedy-spoofing trade, where he explains his wife Stripes medicine, and ends with her humping. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is just like a real owl. In my opinion, this is one of the three best TV-spoofing films, plus "TunnelVision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (I also have the "Truman Show"). <br /> <br /> I've been to Ken Shapiro.
