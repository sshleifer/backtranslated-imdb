I bought this cheap from the rental residual at our local store. It's almost in the mint, I never heard before. <br /> I can not believe my luck. You go through the whole realm of emotions and try to get a complex message - the moral and successful attitude of the Mandela Party, undoubtedly. Despite its enormous length (I had to look at two sessions) - it should not be like a book. Maybe all of the songs are not that memorable, but the spirit of the subject is always glowing on. I can not understand the fact that a musical (obviously designed for the platform) is not realistic! I've seen "South Pacific" and can read the book and assure that it's not as true as that book. I'll find this small up until it wears up. <br /> They are doing this again in a better budget. <br /> <br />
