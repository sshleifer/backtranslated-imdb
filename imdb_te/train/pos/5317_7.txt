Before this little black and whiter, the touching item of crime rape has never been on the American screen. There are a number of these items that hide the Hollywood and Production code until the 1960s in the rebels. So it will not be surprising to increase things like Independent company Ida Lupino's filmmakers. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that director Lupino Coded has worked with the demands to release the film, but it is somewhat compromised. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, many of Walton's (Mala Powers) can not see her, but how she looks. And the heavy weight she was carrying. Will she ever associate with people again? Will they see her as "spoiled objects" (after all, which is 1950)? Even though family and friends are generally backed up, she runs away without having to face these concerns at home and work. Overall, this first part is supreme and well done. Hype injected some action into the chase plot, but then this picture - notice how the annoying neighbors fail to respond to the honking horn near the end of the chase. If there were shouts of alarm from the Powers instead, the lack of neighbor's response would have been an interesting raised while the issue was complicated. <br /> <br /> The second half is pretty much given to the product code in the sentimentalized person of Rev's Ferguson (Tod Andr√©s). It is he (who once quoted a sentence) who "will give her courage to face life again". There has been some effort in manipulating him - he has an interest in Anne or her confusion. Nevertheless, his sensual and perceptual existence is little wonderfully and much less likely to appear in Hollywood. Fortunately, in the end, Hollywood escapes the cop-out, which is the only hope for Yan to be happier than just perfect. <br /> <br /> <br /> Let me give you a credit tonne dealing with the first thing. Given the overall results, I feel that she is dealing with honesty with her subject to being allowed. I also believe that today's viewers are mainly interested in the treatment of Powers' excellent performance that brings out the human drama completely. However, the film works best in its time document, and the cultural watchdogs of that day are suitable for adult viewing.
