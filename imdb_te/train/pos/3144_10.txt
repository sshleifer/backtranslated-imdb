This is one of the best jokes in television. In the following seasons most of the season is happy with one. I gave this presentation to 9/10 due to the unfortunate last season. The final part is the last part. My favorite part of this show is the scenes that cut people's imagination, often portraying roles in popular TV shows or movies of 70s. It's a rare show in those that I liked every role (except for the last season ... try to develop a new character is too late and fez is not nearly as funny). Red's foot is never old in your asshole comments, even though Kelso has not been stupid. For a long time, Bruce Fox has done such a good show for a long time.
