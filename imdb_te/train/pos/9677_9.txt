This film appears on the surface to see mill children in the film by watching parents with their most entertaining little children. The movie is over and does not focus too much on the kids and does not stop at this level. I first saw this movie as a little boy and found it funny, entertaining and heartbreaking and did not see it again for many years. I have seen again at the age of 18 and it is almost funny and heartfelt and entertaining. The film has been underestimated and has many messages in real life. This movie is a sensational exploration story. Epic for the child is in its own right. I recommend this film at any age.
