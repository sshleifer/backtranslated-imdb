As a disclaimer, I have seen the film 5-6 times in the last 15 years, this week I saw only the music scene. <br /> <br /> When I saw music or it was not in music, it allowed me to judge the film, even if it was not tainted. <br /> <br /> I believe that Michael Douglas works well, along with Cusi. I think I'll dance her for 'scene,' which is one of the best parts of the film, which is valuable compared to music. The dancers and songs in the film are musically superior, and the cast is at least 10 times bigger (making it easier to do in the film). Deckers, lighting, dancing, and singing are also superior in the film, which are predictable and originally distributed. <br /> <br /> The songs with musical in this song are good and are new, and the whole movie is more than just music in my opinion, musical with some dicks. The actors talked to the speakers and some singers for singing, their dancing being sinless, and enjoying more than the final product music
