I thought this was a wonderful movie. The theme song is sweet! :) Anyway, the only thing that hurt me a bit is the beginning, everything was normal. It's very strange and unreal. The big cable company is basically talking to me. Also, this film is very creative. I did all the acting well and the actors did their characters' personalities well. Everything is well suited. It's a shame that this is not really a soundtrack. That's great! Because this is a Canadian movie, and because it is one of my favorites, I give this 10 a 10 of 10!
