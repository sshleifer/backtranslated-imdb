If you do not see this movie, I would highly recommend you. This is a fantastic story. I loved Alison Lotham as a very talented note: I also loved her in the 7th heaven too. The whole storyline is amazing and the characters they have chosen are amazing. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film is very exciting.
