Nick and Kelly are ready to marry, but Travis (Kelly's dog) Nick leads to a strange blue wall that turns into a honeymoon for Kelly. Richard Burke and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good pair. Nick loves to drink, smokes and fun suddenly, but Nick suddenly gets away from this kind of fun. Sex is one thing he loves because he needs a baby. We discover that an alien species is dying and they have to be combined with women from the earth to save their population. This is associated with the population of dogs and survival between humans and aliens. Good picture.
