Young is a delicate, repetitive bit in the history of Victoria, which gained some fine arrangements of Jean-Marc Vall√©e of Julian Fellows, the youngest of the young lasers of Victoria, who was England's longest ruler, from a solid direction. While Victoria is a child of her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir Victoria Carrie (Marc Strong), most of that part is the variations of the dress and scenes in that part. But once Victoria comes (Emily Blunt), and the film is attracted by the Blooms Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). Blunt is a strong actress and finds a delicate line between infants' passion and royal dignity, which she finds a good foil for those in court who want to control the 'child queen', including Lord Melbourn (Paul Bettany). But she plays the role of her eyes, her eye is active on the German prince Albert and the love affair that continues to be remembered for her subjects is a matter of royalty. Albert sensitivity. The film is the first of nine children, followed by various royalties throughout Europe with some advertising about Queen Victoria and Prince Albert influence! It makes a beautiful dress drama evening and allows us to recognize the rise of two young girls in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. If a solid epic is not transported. <br /> Grid harp
