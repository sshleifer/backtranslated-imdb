Must see! I've seen WHIPPED at a press screening and it is hilarious. We laughed nonspop. It does seem like a thicker drama about Mary. Amanda Peet screams star quality with its combination of beauty, brain, and extreme performing ability. Peter Cohen, director, has made a sharp edge film that shows within the world of men's allies in urban dating. For all of it's comedy, it's successful with the wit's success. This is rare for the director for the first time, especially with a romantic comedy. He is a major talent. Judea Dompe, with Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams, and Joe Barber cast in a very strong performance as actors and men of deep women. You go to work with these guys and get trapped on the web of Pete. Check out the trailer on Whipped.com, which will value 3 minutes of import.
