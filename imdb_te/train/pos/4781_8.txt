Mulholland Drive made me a perfect fan of David Lynch. He is a modern intellectual, he is not a filmmaker. His stories and his style are a spell that crosses the screen. So Straight Story was a surprise to me, it's easy to follow its stories and sunny sets. And yet, Lynch is, and, this is not his best, it's a film that does not fail. <br /> One of the reasons for Richard Farnsworth's performance. <br /> <br />
