The film is absolutely awesome and cool. The graphics are amazing and it is amazing, especially, the flick is fantastic and wonderful in the movie and he is funny and he and sometimes he is brilliant. Circus bugs are colorful and they are fantastic in the movie. The dazzling pleasers of the film are fantastic and cool. Hopper is a pure and perfect villain. Also, the dot is beautiful. When the bird comes to eat bugs, the scene is amazing and good. Also, the last scene is awesome and cool. Also, Flik's discoveries are good. Building an artificial bird is a good idea to scare the grasshoppers. When building an artificial bird of ants, that scene is good and nice I really should appreciate the creators of "Bug's Life".
