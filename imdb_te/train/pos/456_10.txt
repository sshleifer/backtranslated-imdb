This is a lovely, soul-restored movie. Since Elizabeth Arngry's original villa's induction to write a novel for inspired casting in the 1920s, each choice is perfect! The silent joy of this film is not old enough after recurring views. Josie Laurence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowwitz seem to be born to play these parts! I love to watch Enchanted April, which is released on DVD in an innovative format.
