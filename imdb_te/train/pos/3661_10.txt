Snobs and fake experts will find a problem that connects this work to those suffering from a serious lack of innocence considered "too cry from the best of de Sica". De Sika spoke very directly. His Italian Italians do not have a self-examination of the chaotic self-parody of the modern Italian filmmakers, or the stupor of Beytro Jermi, Mario Monuelli's awkward sweet bitter, the scorching of Visconti or Antonioni's cold observations. D'Sieka told us stories like his father sitting at the edge of his bed before going to sleep. There is no effort to intellectuals. Il Giudizio Universal realistic fairy tales in Miracolo and a low degree, or today we call magic realism. From the beginning of the film to the end is a gem and the type of character to accept with an open heart completely but, naturally, you need to have a heart. Cinematic in its purest form. Excellent.
