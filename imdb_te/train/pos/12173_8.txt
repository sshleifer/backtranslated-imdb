First fast 'shut up!' Those who are sticking to the film. You can not go to every movie that 'Citizen Kane' is waiting for. It's actually a fun movie. Jason Lee is a good man in his work. I thought there was enough surgery between Leila and Julia Styles. They live most of it. Besides, the film is good. Selma Blair needs something to eat. She regrets me. But she still looks beautiful. So yes, I recommend this movie for fun on the date or light Saturday afternoon. See. <br /> <br /> Ranking: ** 1/2 out of ****
