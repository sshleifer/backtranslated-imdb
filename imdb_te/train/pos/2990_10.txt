I think Ebert gave Stella four stars out of four stars, other than I, love, and sacrifice (great romantic stories or movies in three themes) <br /> <br /> Here is a story from the Stella Recession era America Such reminiscent manner that the remake (if you ask a Stanwick fan or two) is not well appreciated The original version of Stella's version was made in the 1990s, the time of great financial difficulties in America (the recession). <br /> Now rosy-colored glasses /> <br /> In the middle of a new era of recession and poverty in America, and this powerful story is still true that the rings are true, in its corrected format, <br /> <br /> Yes, class division is the main theme here Stella's big dreams, single, big dreams but a little hope to get to know those dreams.He worked in a bar, not much money, a crummy apartment Lives in. You'll get motion. In the morning, she should not really get out of bed. <br /> A man sees his dance in the bar. He is wealthy and educated from upper class families who have nothing to do with Stella. His main concern is the Ivy League College attendance, how she has to pay the rent, how 'happy'. They have an affair. They like each other. Stella ends pregnancy. Stella tells the news to the person. His response? "How about abortion?" Her replies, "I wanted a room full of bubbles." He supplies bubbles and proposal, but she is not in the heart, and it is very proud. <br /> <br /> Her daughter eventually crumbles between two lifestyles - her mother's love and the benefits, happiness and love she has with her wealthy father. Stella, alone and unwilling, and not wanting for her daughter, she becomes happy one day, makes the ultimate sacrifice. <br /> <br /> She gave her the only love and pleasure she knew only to be sure of her daughter's happiness, and she probably lived up to her daughter and lived with hope, finding something to live for her daughter. , For the film. Everything is right about it. Betty Midler, particularly the Oscar-worthy, fantastic acting, artistic cinematography, great set design (contrast between two lifestyle, outrageous apt and decorated buildings), spectacular and heartfelt performances by the whole cast. <br /> It is the most important and well-made image of what you have done.
