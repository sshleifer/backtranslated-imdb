Soldier is not a great movie, and everybody who hates it has good reasons. <br /> <br /> First, art direction is very tight and well executed. As far as science fiction backdrops, Soldier made 90% of the work with more design. Sets, textiles and accessories are stable and competitive; I did not like their future military style, but I was impressed with the effort. For me, it's time to watch a worthy film. <br /> Second, I'm a Kurt Russell fan. I grew up looking at this guy in the most memorable movies of my youth ... Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter movies. Soldier is an action movie, and Sergeant Todd is an important action hero. <br /> <br /> Third, fighting scenes and battles are well-choreographed. This is not an iron monkey or matrix, but it once again exceeded quality quality in the genre. <br /> If you do not see it and you have science fiction action movies, pick it up if you pass at your rental depot. Just do not expect the next blender.
