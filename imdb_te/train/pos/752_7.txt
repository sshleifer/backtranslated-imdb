Four teenage girls from the Los Angeles suburbs face difficulties: parties, drugs, cops, mixed-up parents, and old friend. Jodie Foster, the mother of Hen's sort of pack, tries to keep everyone like "a family" (like the family unit she always had), and the heartbeat about the film is not herself. Slowly, everyone grows up and goes away. The exact plot point, though undercover, was unfortunately broken. Do we need a really long sequence for putting a car thugs on his skateboards? Or longer - even with Bayo - Foster has a strange nature about "pain of illusion". In fact, some conversations are apparently huge, and I do not take much care for the last edition in the film that includes feelings from death to a marriage. But these are hardest in a more sensitive story about a tight binding loss. Finally, Jody's face speaks volumes. Eventually, if the audience regrets, the film is gaining. It does not ask for pinter or sympathy for tears. It shows us an example of friendship and the hopes we understand. **** from
