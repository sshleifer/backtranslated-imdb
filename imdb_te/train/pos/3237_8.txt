The Finnish society's nature in the picture is very clear, less than a week after my experience of Finland. I know the phenomenon of a young couple-with-child-serious-troublesome phenomenon, as I personally found myself in Finland as long as I was in Finland. <br /> People's relationships, problems, marriage company, alcohol culture, unemployment, ascension money issue are all well kept. It is not easy to understand the movie and build it together, but the bigger picture is a gift. Each of the smaller stories is neither exciting nor deep, but as noted above, the big picture fails to provide the concept of "real life" and has attracted the viewer. I happen to think in a quiet moment: what's happening in the lives of these people on the street? Well, that's what's going on. Such films eat your imagination. It is safe to assume that the film can apply to life in many countries, but this is especially reflected in Finland and is very good. <br /> A comment about acting: The Finnish fan movie I have never seen other actors in this movie, but the performance in this feature is exactly right for me. Perhaps not a masterpiece, a very good effort in the whole group. <br /> <br /> I'm putting an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast. <br /> <br /> 7,5 / 10
