In my opinion, this is a completely erotic disc masterpiece. If you ask me, the stepmother (the voice of Lucille La Verne) is really serious. If you want to know why you should watch the movie. On the other hand, Cinderella (the voice of Illen Stanley) is the most beautiful woman despite her much house-keeping. To me, the scenery is beautiful, the cast is well-chosen, and the writing is strong. Before I close it, I would like to say that everyone involved has done very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend you all this absolutely erotic disc masterpiece that I have not seen most of it. You're out for a while, go to the video store, rent or buy, kick back and see with your friend.
