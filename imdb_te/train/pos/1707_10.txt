This film is not for everybody. You are not bright enough to get "it" or you can not. If the fans of science fiction films do not take them too seriously, the film will enjoy it. I recommend this film for those who appreciate spoons and parodies. I recommend this film to everyone. If you enjoy the Monte Python or Mel Brooks movies, you probably prefer it. Voice characters are in a tongue in a cheek manner and a liners fly fast and angry.
