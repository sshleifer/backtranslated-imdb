This is a fantastic political caricature. <br /> <br /> Another good image from this era is rounded, because it is completely <br /> <br /> A war machine that harasses, murders, and harasses citizens in his quest for US global yoke. <br /> <br /> The film is a brilliant plot, good acting, some big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tommy for anyone?) and some scenes are delightful. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they commit mass murder.
