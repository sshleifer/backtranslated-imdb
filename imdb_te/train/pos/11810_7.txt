I still like it. Warren Beatty is a comic book hero. This is what sets the image, excellent cast and it's a simple script offshoots. I really guess something more substantial in terms of action, or plot but I got so little. The main reason for watching this film is to see Hollywood's biggest actors in such an extraordinary film. <br /> <br /> A man who has done a terrible job and does not even have the role of Madonna in this film. She is not part of this film and her acting job is very bad. The picture at some points still stands. You have something to do, you have nothing to do. Al Pacino really plays the bad dude and he does it pretty good. He and Beatty make a wonderful guy and a bad guy. <br /> <br /> Other films like Dustin Hoffman and Irahar are also of interest to Warren Betty. I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things. It's nice about this movie, but it's pretty good. I liked it as a child, and visually the film looks fantastic, the sets are fantastic, the only fair for writing, and with such a cast in the movie I would expect a little better anyway. <br /> I thought I would not be big enough for the ending. It's interesting but for such a grand scale film I thought I could have ended a bang slightly longer. The reason for watching this film is the atmosphere. This image is used only for 7 comic book colors. <br /> <br /> Textures and decorations are flawless. Face makeup is good for villains. Bitti Life is not bigger than the character. However, this is a good picture of being very good. This is better for me than Batman, and other comic book adaptations at the same time. But the film is grossly large.
