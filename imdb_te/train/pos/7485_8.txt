I heard a little about the film and I saw a low score in IMDb and I'm away from it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and I had nothing good ... and it turned out, I had hard time finding anything good to do. The Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching feature film, which is actually the best I've seen for a while. I was surprised to see how it impacted me. It's hard to explain, but your feelings and changes towards the characters are during your awareness of what is going on and it's a very emotional journey. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is very rare for a movie or any media really touched me for that matter. <br /> <br /> I am really recommending everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you heard about it.
