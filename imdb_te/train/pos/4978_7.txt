A good Shirdi temple is small. Child actors had to shout their lines that day and time seemed odd. Probably designed for "not seen and heard". This is fun from now on. Having the era of images is a social point of view, something that will hit me as progressive and liberal. I'm going over here, I'd like to spoil it for you but let's see it for you and recognize those things. It is easy to see from the little hardships that have already developed for the temple. If you're a fan of the temple it will be worth watching. It's a cool way to kill others for your ten minutes, waiting to warm up your good night's glass milk stove.
