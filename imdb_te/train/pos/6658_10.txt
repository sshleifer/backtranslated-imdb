Mahatma was portrayed as a man who neglected his own son. I did not condemn the movie. It was a wonderful movie and my throat walked out of the movie with a lump. We need to understand the spiritual condition of Mahatma, he is a true spiritual leader. Only a full-minded person can separate himself from his loved ones. Such a skilled man leads his family and followers as an example. According to the film, he speaks with his son and tries to understand where he comes from, but poor little Harilal can not understand his father. When things went wrong with Harilal, Mahatma was calm and accepted that his son was a big tragedy. <br /> If any other parents are, they will compromise their values ​​to help the son to go to his feet. Mahatma did not do that, he is the true leader who leads the example.
