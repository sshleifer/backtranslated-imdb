The 60th image represents what really is (that's lots of who's growled around America's belly during that period) is the crisis and diversity of the decade. <br /> Despite the exaggeration and stereotypical roles, the realities of the problems are obvious. <br /> <br /> The radical period of the changes is not only the most confusing times. Two basic things have changed our world: the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and the Media's High Impact. <br /> The two new liberties initiated social changes. Soon became institutional. <br /> <br /> There was tenderness from chaos. They have worked, they played, they saw the news ... and slowly influenced by the trials and struggles of the minorities ... civil rights workers, political activists, anti-war efforts, war on poverty ... <br /> <br /> The representation of the press and the power of TV is well reflected  , సాధారణ ప్రజల వైఖరి మరియు విషయాలను మార్చుకోవాలని కోరుకునే వారు నిర్లక్ష్యం చేయబడ్డారు ... మరియు చెత్తగా, తప్పుగా సూచించబడ్డారు .. మధ్యతరగతి అమెరికన్లు అన్నింటినీ కోపంతో బేసిల్ బ్యాట్లను పట్టుకొని లేదా వారి అవిధేయులైన కుమార్తెలను తొలగించలేదు. They are very confusing. Folk singers suddenly became a protest singer, and do not forget how to start an attack that killed the Beatles folk anti-movement. <br /> If you do not live in this decade, you will not have any idea about the film, the overall picture is a little bit dimmer. I worked steady at a time when my sister went to Woodstock at the Hugh Farm Commune. On another occasion I worked at Height Asbury and Detroit Routes, where she worked as a housewife in Main and Connecticut. The characters are changing from time to time. <br /> <br /> The film portrays three siblings belonging to the middle class family. They refer to hippie child, political activist, and active military personnel. Dad refers to the general trends, and the mother refers to reason, patience and sometimes compromise for peace. <br /> <br /> The black family has been minister and his son ... uneasy, I think. I think the producers knew all the variables and wanted to settle on the limits, otherwise it was a long, boring, documentary. Dad's message produces that bitter bitterness, and produces bitter chaos. <br /> <br /> When we look at a particular solution to social issues and how we divide the problems ... In the 60s, that's unusual and compare to 20s. In other words, the film is morale after all. And finally, it's our collective personality. <br /> Everyone is a god, a Guru, or a liberal intellectual in 60 years. It's magic and mad time. No one ever slows down the 60s downwards ... It's very different (this picture is close). At least we are ashamed of it, that's what we learned and grew from it, and simultaneously, in a generation of shapes and America has changed ... Good.
