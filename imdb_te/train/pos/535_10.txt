A Matter of Life and Death, what do you really want to do justice to the film's intellect and beauty? Pavel and Presbyger's visual imagination has no boundaries, each frame is bizarrely filled with bold compositions. The strong colors of "real world" are the innovations of heaven's black and white. The final court scene is also spectacular as stairs descend to heaven to seize the court over the operation of the court and jury Peter (David Niven). <br /> All shows (Roger Livessie is a standout), and the romance of the film is beautiful, there is more romantic image than this (I've seen). Matter of love and death is all about love power and how important life is. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is amazing enough to see the film alone, he makes the lights all the more beautiful in the face of Kim Hunter, what a genius, he looks amazing as he can make simple things like a game of table tennis. And the sound design can not even sin; <br /> <br /> It is a true tradition that was originally released and appreciated by today's audience, but one of my favorite of all time, which is why I give this film 10/10, in a word - Beautiful.
