The Secret of Kells is one of the themes that I have seen, beautiful, and eye-popping animated films. Before looking at this film, I could not give a run up for its money and it was convinced that it was a shoo-in to win in this category, but I found Kells a serious contender. <br /> Tell the story of Kell's Secret Brendan young orphan, his uncle, Kel's Abbott. Abbott is a dear guardian, but while the boy is making the bit of imagination, it is a bit too hard to be able to strengthen the wall around the town from an upcoming attack by the Vikings and much more attention. The gorgeous brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly like Willy Nelson) looks and captures a boy under his wing, going to Brendan's forests and attracts a man named Iyling, a beautiful wild nymph (more than once his life saves). With the help of icing, he tries to save the town and Brother Aidan attempts to complete the spiritual book, which becomes dark in myth. <br /> See my full review: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of-kells.html
