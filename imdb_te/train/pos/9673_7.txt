Even if you find Pauli's most sophisticated, lachrimmus and santiminal rubbish, it's far better than you expected. The theme of the plot can set the tone for the whole art, but in reality it is lovely in many other sections. <br /> <br /> If you are wondering, Paulie is a parrot. Buying for a little girl with trouble for the speech, Pauli becomes her best friend and goes with her everywhere. He sat on her shoulder during Speech Therapy Lessons, and eventually became a super intelligent speaker himself. <br /> <br /> Polly leaves the little girl's mother and spends the other part of the film trying to reunite with LA from LA to LA. <br /> <br /> Can the image of this awful-sounding film be relatively successful? First, it has some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. The second (and more significantly) is the courage to adapt to its ridiculous campus, and often the funniest, often humorous story, without worrying about the obvious flaws in the story. Third, there are many surprisingly strong performances, including a Wild Crook, Jay MÃ¶rr, Jenna Rowlands, an elderly lady, and chef Marin (yes, dope-smoke cheek Marin!). It's not a classic, but Paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages.
