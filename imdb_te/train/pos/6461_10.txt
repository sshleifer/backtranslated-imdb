First I was completely saved through the film's opening songs, and then I became a witch with the story that was completely unfolding and dazzled with excellent direction. Where the characters are not bigger than all, but not where life is, we are in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey, or in America, to fully trust in people and to live with the Lord. Hollywood can learn a lot from this beautiful movie. It shows that there is no need to go into every little detail behind every action that takes out the whole background outright and bright, and that shows the brilliance of the director! Kay Pollak and thanks for the wonderful actors for this amazing treat!
