As recently as I was shopping, I saw the American Gothic box set, and 'I remember it!' I used to set my alert to back in time at 1.30am (when I was 14) at CH 4. I remember a lot because it was really scary and weird, no one would ever be as scary as Lucas Buck (with a B !!) no one ever anyway. <br /> <br /> When they were on TV, they did the same for the box-set. Funny sequence parts, I kept thinking when Doctor Matt left ??? - They made it so confusing. <br /> <br /> It is not wrong for writers, producers or directors (their TV people are still doing the same thing in the background - they do not like programming in the studio, such as Carnival and Farcape, <br /> <br /> To do - if you do not see it and you're calling it a siz-fi fantasy, horror, supernatural drama .. Fan = you should. They are also in the SFX when reviewing.
