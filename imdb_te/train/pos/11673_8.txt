After Charlie Bourman appeared in the Long Way round with Ivan McGregor, I was very interested to see what Charlie had on his own show. I thought Charlie was a very radical and beautiful lander. Its nice to see those celebrities struggling with their weight and fitness, which just show their humanity too! I do not know much about bikes, but I was caught up in the opening of this show. Preparation and management of the show is immense. The event also seems very dangerous and I'm fascinated to see Charlie and everyone doing it and how well he gets. I loved the performance and fast play music. I can not believe he broke his collar bone, I really hope it's not the end, I cant wait to see the next episode ...
