If you read the books, Tolkien forget the characters built on your head. Having a 'Disney' treatment represented by hobbits, dwarves etc Dark riders are fantastic, and as I always imagine from books. <br /> <br /> This cinematic movie is a cinematography that combines live motion and animation to produce amazing effects for the year. <br /> <br /> It is great to have a video that they will enjoy bit after the Lord of the Rings in 2001.
