B-and c-film producer Roger Corman's great cult Classics Ramones Vehicle (originally commissioned for Cheap Trick), Rock N 'Roll High School. This is a simple, technically dated story (but provides additional dosages of nostalgia humor), considering the type of funny things that Napoleon Dynamite plays about young people who love rock n roll. <br /> <br /> Students at Vince Lombardy High School are blocked by the nasty Principle, Miss Evelyn Togar (Cult Classic Favorit, Mary Voronov), Rock n 'Roll Children for Uninterrupted and Innocent Fatalities, Rock n' Roll-Free zone. <br /> <br /> In fact, she intends to wipe out the rock n roll for all schools, with the help of a number of people who are in school and her plan to succeed. This will help RF Randel (PJ Soles). A Romance fanatic wrote some songs (including rock n 'roll high school) that she would give to Ramones, and when trying to do so, she would not be rebelled by Miss Togor, playing in the town of Ramones. This ends up as the ultimate revolt between fun and abusive adults and adolescents (somehow recalls somewhat of Edge Over). After Punk's years, garage rockers fame, Ramones (and others) recall another change in the evolution of music, it's great to see a movie that is fun of all and celebrated in a comical, exaggerated way. <br /> <br /> It's a very light comedy, but a great feeling-good comedy when you're in mood for entertaining. Directed by some of the participants Jerry Zucker (of Airplane's fame) and Joe Dante (of Gremlins's reputation), you can say for any kind of humor (and not to mention Dick, if only a few minutes at the finale of Miller's movie). <br /> <br /> The 90-year-old comedy is inspired by Detroit Rock City (and updated accordingly), which changes some minor characters in the Glam Rockers Kiz in ages. Corey Feldman's vehicle, Rock n 'Roll High School, passes on Forever, was released almost a decade later. The original is still the best.
