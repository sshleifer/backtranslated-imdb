Meryl Streep is superb. She has excellent knack for her accents, and she shows an amazing skill in this movie. I really felt for her when Lindy was persecuted. She also acted realistically. Her cranky, upset, and unpleasant when the media and the government continued their wildest witch. Initially I did not expect much from the movie, but I was really interested in it, the film depended on the real person and the real events. It turned out to be better than expected. Sam Neal is also outstanding; This is the best work I've seen from him, and I've really liked him for other movies (for example, piano). I gave the film 7, but if I could rate it, I would give it 9.5 and 10 for the strepp.
