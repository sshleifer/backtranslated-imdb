I saw the second half of this film a year ago and in the end it was very happy to be available on DVD. Recently, I have seen many reality series about Ranching in PBS. None of them came close to telling the story. Depending on the real reality, no punches, tragic, cheerful, tragic and brilliance, it's a picture of students or those interested in early border life. The fine acting in both Rip Torn and Kochka Ferrell was added to a good script. Funds supplied by the National Endowment for Human Rights were made according to early loans. If this is going to be some kind of product taxes I would be glad to see more. I highly recommend it and encourage people to tell you that you have seen it and enjoy the film.
