<br /> <br /> In contrast to the comments that I read locally, I really enjoyed the movie and would like to see it as a weekly series. /> <br /> If I'm a Judson Mills fan but a huge Chuck Norris fan and I admit that I might have extended the line in action sequences, the storyline is currently being broadcasted by the other weekly series. <br /> <br /> A lot of steps have been taken after the explosion of their missiles from bad people for fifteen minutes starting with the Deiki. <br /> <br /> I do not see many "experts" fail to break a moving target, but the work is perfect and being deeper, hero, survival. About the need to "get the movie to fill the slot after playoffs". The film was not originally managed by CBS for January broadcasting and filming completed in May 2001, completed four months before the terrorist attacks against the US. Instead of trying to escape, the film's story may have been realized: Rashid planned to establish a nuclear device in the United States, as the role of Bin Laden. <br /> Maybe the author must watch the movie before trying to comment on it. <br /> <br />
