No delightful love does not have a lot of attractive film and attractive comedy. When Einstein brilliantly portrayed Volta Mathau, while Meg Ryan's Catherine was unforgettable? What's better with Tom Hanks than I saw in those films? <br /> <br /> Catherine's struggle to understand her and that she does not have to be a young girl to sympathize with her sooner, and it's easy to understand what the younger is going through Ed's (Tim Robbins) in pursuing her true love. These emotions include the Universal Appeal, I.Q. It all keeps light, fun and fun. <br /> <br /> It's too big, but if you see, there are some subtitles. Albert Einstein was remembered as a scientist, but he was a great spiritual leader; His words, 'If not impossible, why do they do it?' He suggested a believer in fulfilling the high goals without realizing an instant grasp. In this film, what questions are there in an accident? Whether his whacky sidekicks' interference in catherine prying, such as Alper and strongly eloquent, loveless James (Stephen Fry? This gives the cardboard character life and you can not help but feel for his lack of feeling). <br /> <br /> We can not see how much interference we have in our lives, and we come across our minds. <br /> <br /> Of course, we know, we want to think in real life, we get Edwards Catherines and James have to learn how to defrost the icewater in their veins. How good it is to know that the Eisenhower era of the I.Q's innocent (and embarrassing, especially Caucasian) work in the ground making land.
