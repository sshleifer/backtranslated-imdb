Beginning in "Hot Fuzz 2007", which began with "Shawn of the Dead" in 2004, Pegg has had a few hits over the last few years. <br /> <br /> The film is named Sidney Famous person's fun-acting failing magazine. Because he is not one of them. However, one of the most successful magazine magazines (played by Jeff Bridges) invites him to work in his magazine (in Nostalgia). Sidney is excited and moved to the United States, where he meets a girl who currently writes a book, and pleases the joy. <br /> <br /> I hope the film looks good and will like more in the near future. Peg once again gave everyone another good movie and I could not see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy "Paul". I rate this film with 81%.
