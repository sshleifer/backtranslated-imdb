<br /> <br /> The story revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Peyor and David Kubitt), who eventually saw each other and their father was gone. Ryan and Theo argue first what happened. But later, Theo finds that his brother, Ryan, is not only gay, but dies with terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time doing their differences. <br /> This is a fantastic picture. In the 7th season of 24 years I saw only Komme Feor but he was unusual in this regard. <br /> <br /> David Kubitt, I never heard of an extraordinary performance beforehand. <br /> I would recommend this to those who are interested in gay and lesbian style. This is a movie you do not want to miss. <br /> <br /> I will give 10 to 10 people for this film.
