Yes, some plots are a bit difficult to follow, and Bill has a tendency to get violent, but in fact I try not to miss a missing show. The majority of episodes are very exciting and long lasting, and acting is very good, but I would miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Karty Gabriel Kent. I like the old episodes for new episodes, and it's a shame that after the water shed, it's easy to see when it's around 8.00. Still, I do not like why Bill just because it is absorbing, but at the end of the cliff hangers makes the next part unmissable. Although it is true, it is more dramatic than that, but I really like this program like an event that does not try to take seriously the program too. 8/10 Bethany Cox
