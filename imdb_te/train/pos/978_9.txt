Takashi Mike's "First Family Picture" - presents by people who have not seen Bilban. Yoko Daisenso takes more things in the family friendly direction, merging gloom and hatred to create a grand fantasy fairy tale. A young boy is chosen by fate to protect the world from monsters and monsters, in which they do not know much. The movie is clearly bigger than Mike's, with CGI's for creating the fictional world created by odd creatures (Yoko). Perhaps the lack of serious content is the consequence of more nervous investors, but I think he probably wanted to do something different. He's never really a trick pony, but often it comes with allegations - perhaps YOKO is designed to silence those critics. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Miyaki is a great project for his infinite imagination and innovation. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of cartoon feel to the producers of Mikey's. Yokoi is based on the old comics that are based on Japanese folk tales, which also have great influence on Miyazaki (especially Spirit Away). Remember that there is no such thing as the Harry Potter film's budget to do it, so special effects are not an unheard of Hollywood style - some blue-scrutiny is particularly evident. There are some special effects with some special animation creatures (CG Alloy, Stop-Motion and Automation). I think the movie looks like the little little pug-puppet * really cheap * * and think it's all cuter :) The heroine of the movie plays a very good job - it's really hard to find the teen beforehand who understands the feeling of acting, but 9 year old Ryunosuke Kamiki has a real talent (I see he has made voices in the last 2 magic films ID!). The cheeky curia is a well-known villain of the piece, although the Mai Takahashi Piagi-Hare River Princess - Yum Yum! Those looking for another violent, disturbed gangster movie are unable to find Yokoh, but you can satisfy if you are a Mickey fan but his imagination and intelligence. And there is no extra bonus you can happily put on whatever company you've got :)
