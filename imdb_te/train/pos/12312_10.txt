In 1987, a film that could do well was not believed and virtually unknown in the West. Other reviews can not be repeated here. The score is very good and moves. Literally "Dawn Please Never" - when it comes, the cute ghost and lover will be forever. 24 years later, Joel and Leslie still look great. I enjoyed Joel in Leslie's Jubblers and many other films, including Better Tomorrow.
