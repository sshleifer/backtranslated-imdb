The film pulls deep into two main characters. I popped into my laptop without reading the cover (let alone the reviews) and had two solid hours of interest. Two ships were lost from two different worlds. Sexual tension between a secretary and a criminal is almost untouched without any physical contact. In the end I could not decide what I wanted more: our hero and heroine removed their capers or just added their hobby. RML was completed without an interesting subplot and was a traditional 100-minute plenty. I'm just stumped. After a series of Netflix series, blockbuster and local library duds, this film revived my faith making a great movie.
