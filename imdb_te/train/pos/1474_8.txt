I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's not as loud, it's a three-part documentary featuring Slovene Superstar philosopher / psychologist Slavoj Zaisk (each episode 50 minutes). Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic movies, exploring the aspects of sexuality, fantasy, morality and death. It is directed by Sophie Fannies of the multi-talented Fennes Dynasty (her sister Ralph and Joseph is her sister) <br /> <br /> Because I have such a recipe for ideas to digest it on this DVD. Freudian and Laconian analysis can go pretty heavily and see the entire series at once and a bit awkward by the end of two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> It was not a disadvantage for me, but it helped me to get the advice of coffee and urine. Apparently filled with Freudian themes. He spends some time on Hitchcock and David Lynch, not exactly sensitive masters. <br /> I really want to see only four and five and six episodes, yet I try to define his ideas using a wide range of films. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very funny, and part of the comedy is currently looking into what amount of lecture he is currently inserting into actual scenes from some of the pictures he discusses. So, for example, we see him in a motor boat sitting at Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock Man) or in the basement of Bates Motel (from Psycho). It does not say his theories are provocative. Although I found that I disagreed with him, it was definitely a bit deeper about the movies. This is exactly what he's trying to accomplish.
