I do not care how many bad reviews I get purple rain, this film rocks! Fantastic movie, it has great music (coarse Prince!), Romance and Drama. <br /> <br /> It stirs a lot. I do not want to say more, I do not give the plot, but I say this thing - the movie is very realistic, there are so many romantic relationships that go through these troubles, many families are similar in the film. This film is very much like being real and real, it makes a lot of movable movie. <br /> <br /> My generation has loved this movie, most of which is the prince's love and what kind of teenager it has, through simple problems. <br /> It's not just a movie for young people, it tells ID to groups of all ages. And it's not too dark, the film has some great music, band performance sequences, and sexy fun scenes between Prince and Apollonia.
