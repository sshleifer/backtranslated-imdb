Motion picture producers should not expect too much from the broker in the form of a low budget company that produces and distributes DVDs. <br /> <br /> What's more remarkable about this overall achievement is the release of James Cameron's DVD and the extraordinarily fine presentation that comes with extra insufficiency. <br /> In the next case, comes with a broken anamorphic transfer. Otherwise we get the image at its original 1.85: 1 ratio, demonstrating any technical flaws and looking pretty much too much. In fact, Ferrari's hands on the approach in putting this disc together can make you pretty much such a guarantee. <br /> The truth of the same soundtrack. Here we have the combination of DD2.0 and DD5.1 ​​and I am uncertain as I think it is "original" and the fact that Ferrari interfered in both should not be considered low. In fact, the method used by the DD5.1 ​​score can provide more atmospheric viewing experience, both equally fine and without technical disadvantages. <br /> <br /> The disc for the extras is very positive. Take a look at the sidebar on the right side of the screen and you'll notice many comments, movies loads and different galleries. In fact, in a lengthy documentary rather than compilation, each one of the minutes was broken down into a fraction of what was discussed. For instance, the 'anatomy of the stunt' feature claims to be exactly the same, and it goes to the other parts. Such broken pre-production, production and coverage of the most product of post production is provided. <br /> <br /> In this way, we have easy access to a special feature that we want to see them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Then again, there is a predictable wind of chat tracks. An overly joke involving actors and the film does not take seriously. Ferrari's pieces are enthusiastic about the whole thing. And technology is very technically, very well. In fact, we get some crossovers covered in the rest of the disc, but only 19 minutes are missing. In fact, in all, a fine extra package.
