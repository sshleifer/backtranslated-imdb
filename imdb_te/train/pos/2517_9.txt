This film came after I had waited for a long time from Niflix, so I'm looking forward to it. My worst fears will be plodding on it, well ... well, do you know what all the screaming fan girls are obscure about? GACKTnHYDE = Halt Yovoy Love? Is that kind of thing? It's scary. I was very pleasantly surprised, too. Though the film is going to make Sun-Chaks in each of the two scenes, and if the act of playing Gottt is good, film and music are also surprisingly watchable. Hyde, Um, Hyed, was a partial-fiction friend / gang member, rarely anyone watched him on stage. He was one of my two main beef with the film. But the rest of the cast (including children's actors in the opening scene) is good on what they did - it's mostly shot dead. But my second problem is too small, it is related to stupidity. It seemed to me a lot of suspense-horror-when someone killed each scene, they really burst into a very heartfelt, or where they burned the Babylug there for a long time. But Shah is just ... shots, repeatedly, takes ships, he talks, and Hyed cry while most bubbles. In all, if you're a fan of any of the actors or a j-film fan, it is definitely worth a watch.
