Director Edward Mantegne is less than an hour, failing to do other expensive and hype movies. Mr. Montagne shows us a police story written by Philip H. Reisman Jr., however, is not the best of the genre, it keeps the participant in all the participants going on. Apparently a B type image. In fact, the best thing for "The Tattoo Stranger" is the possibility that New York might take a peek to see those years. The crystal clear cinematography of William O. Steiner has been put on or restored in love for years. <br /> <br /> In the opening sequence there are great views of New York. Then we take Brooklyn to Dumbo Division, then the film goes to Bronx and Gun Hill Road, which houses many souvenir shops. <br /> <br /> <br /> John Miles and Walter Kinsella are a great detective team. Patricia Barry is certainly a plant specialist from the Natural History Museum. Jack Lord went to big things in his career, but in the role of the speaker. <br /> <br /> It is very entertaining looking at a city.
