Many people like this movie and many people like it, but it's all wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> Many actors say that over the top, but over the top character Al Pacino. There is a simple description to say that Pippo has gone over-the-top here. But he will do well, he will bring the inside out of your ghost. His character is not a great man to start with Tony Montana but his thirst for power just bring his illness to greedy another level; An inhumane level. Pacino seems to be a bit cartoonist and surreal in time, but it is not at all responsible for me. The supporting cast did his job well. Michelle Pfeiffer is not at her best but she certainly fit the role she played. Steven Bauer on the other hand is his best, yet he is Steven Bauer. Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio is good and Michael Pfeiffer makes it fit for her role. Robert Loggia I saw him shouting at me. Other than the Pacino are not really any standout or memorable appearances. Everybody seems to fit their roles by being there. <br /> <br /> They have done a brilliant job by directing Bryan de Palma. An actor can change his performance much longer than his life. He should give some credit to the director and I will definitely give him to D'Palma. While Brian De Palma, did not respect me, my count is very versatile director. He knew how he viewed movies according to their genres, but did not appear well at times. Here it does, it takes into consideration all the gangster images, but de Palma is much less than this. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone stated that writing is fantastic. At least I'm not surprised at Olivier Stone's writing when I see the credits at the end of this film. This is a testament to him. I have always been a great writer and I have once again proved me with a scarf. <br /> <br /> Who does not know how to write a surreal reality for the movie than Oliver Stone. This is definitely not my favorite from Giorgio Morodar. The music is very 80s-ish but it does not annoy me. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the most influential films of the last 25 years, but it has been mentioned before for the wrong reasons. . People should realize that the character of Tony Montana is any hero, he is a monster. He is not inspiring anyway. He is greedy, bloodthirsty, illiterate and self-conscious. Although he is a role model for many people, because he is in some way or another insurgent, but probably because he is a cheat gangster. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this film is that it shows that Tony Montanas is not a real problem. We or the people of the power want to shut people like him but we can do that. In a frayy twist he needs our society. He could blame you for someone else and did not drop well about yourself doing it yourself. Tony Montanaas of this world are the victims of our society. In this way people will see him without any excuses. Instead, we do not do bad things or we measure or compare it to a gangster or drug dealer. I love this movie because it is more than a corrupt picture, it is a picture that makes you reflect self in a strange way.
