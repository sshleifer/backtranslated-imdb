Alain DeLon Duiko Tescir dismissed the thriller "Big Guns", accidentally refusing him to the brutal criminal family after the assassination of his wife and child. Tesary and scenes Roberto Gonds, the Ugo Liberator of "A Minute to Prayer, A Second to Die", and Franco silly of "Ring of Death" is a guitar gun for the killer about this aerial armament, in fact, "big guns" is imaginative, but It still deserved to be a solid featuring solid and frequent sudden murders. Allison Delon's "The Godson" was not perfect because he was sentenced to death by the mob family who refused to retire to live with his younger son and daughter. Richard Kant Dylan of "The Godfather" plays the role of a Sicilian criminal boss who wants to bury the ax, but his hard-closed colleagues wish Hitman to die. Like many crime thrillers in the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Guns" is a member of non-reputable film morality. Interestingly, the man who has nothing to do with the murder of the wife of the hero and the son survives when the hero with hypocritical one another. The Tesary did not waste a second in the 90-minute filming. In addition to the death of a car bomb for the mother and son's father, the worst worker is in a vehicle salvage yard. Directly, "Big Guns" is a rather bloodless outing, but it has a high body score for a 1973 mobster play. At the last minute our protagonist left his guard and the moral of the eye to the eye would remain intact. The Tessary haunts a better car and Don's death in a train passing by train tunnel is like this violent yarn. Photography and compositions are excellent.
