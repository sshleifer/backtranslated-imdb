A few years ago, I saw this movie in the video store a few years ago. <br /> <br /> My husband and I are very happy. We bought VHS. It has enjoyed it since then. <br /> <br /> The plot is well discussed. Point deserves repeatable views on this picture. Americans, in particular, are not going to get all the jokes around for the first time. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, touching and sad - at the same time. When Ray was offered to drink at his daughter's wedding, it was a terrific inspiration. While trying to kiss her, Karen Tony calls "Brian", which hits the heart. <br /> <br /> And the music: It sounds like a movie soundtrack I have heard over the years. I'm dancing in the living room "All Over The World." <br /> Each show is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy is congratulated for his role in the guy Ray, who has just so many bad tours. Stephen Ria is the perfect friend of the friendly keyboard player Tony, who is carrying the fire for Karen this year. He has a glamorous handgun look, which women want him to be around. But all the actors are equally good. <br /> Do not forget any pans you've read about the movie and see. It's a gem.
