"Lion King 1 1/2" is a ridiculous theatrical release from Disney. I saw it again after seeing this movie in so many years. <br /> <br /> "I'm better than symbolic pride" In many ways, yes. <br /> <br /> "Simba Pride" is not exactly bad, it encountered some problems: the lack of good script and bad characters, which showed the effect of the okay film. <br /> Anyway: Timon and Pumba's personalities again blossom as we love (or exactly) in the film; They were totally hurt in "Simba Pride" and I did not like the "Timon and Pumbaa" sequences. <br /> <br /> This film is easily stupid, but fortunately the filmmakers did not take the wrong turn and instead focus on making this film at very hilarious. There are some jokes that adults enjoy on their own. The score is very good. There are two new songs that are impressive and two new characters, Timon's mother, (recognizable Marge Simpsons' Julie Kaverner) and Uncle Max. Friendship between Timon and Pumba was filmed. Emotional sequences are well integrated into the comic strip and do not stay away from the place, which can be done easily (especially in comic films). <br /> <br /> Do you want me to vote for you? Yes it is. Though they were not luckily affected, I mentioned: 1. The scenes in the first film were used in this regard. <br /> <br /> Personally, we are fortunate to see old scenes connected with the new ones. <br /> <br /> 2. At the climax, some jokes become lame. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, even though the story and filmmakers of Timon attempted to combine his story with Sima, some of the screenplays seem to be coming. <br /> <br /> But hey that detail is this entertaining movie. It's really acceptable Disney sequel in every film collection.
