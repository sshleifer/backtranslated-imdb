Back to back two films dealing with Indian POWs; Veer Zara and Devar. Veer Jara is a love story for everyone, though, Devarwar focuses on the important topic. Many Indian POWs have come out of Pakistani jails. Time or sympathy or the other side. There are some Pakistani POWs in India, but focus on the movie. Complete the actors. Some of the actors like Raghuvir Yadav and Rajendra Gupta. Amitabh Bachchan played the role of Major. Akshay Khanna did well. There is nothing to do with Amrita Rao than a few late and couple songs. Even though Sanjay Dutt's character is very great, I feel that it is very great. He did well and his dialogue delivery was also impressive. If you compare LOC, it is not one day film in all directions (if there is a story) - Devawar has good acting and justice for all actors. 7.5 / 10
