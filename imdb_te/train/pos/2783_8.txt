Not one of your hardest hit stories, it's the real strength of this movie. There are at least two relationships that have the least amount of romantic tensions in the least amount of authors who have lesser confidence. They did not leave the audience, but at the same time dismissed some surprising ones. Some Disney-Ish moments are particularly close to the end, but they are managed. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you take the DVD, you can see how the director, Aloe Gobi, is preparing for you. We obeyed her orders and it was brilliant! This is a dish that is full of a night in a fridge to allow spices, because we make the day before we plan to eat it!
