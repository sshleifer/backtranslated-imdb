May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Mussolini.Emotions, tensions and preparations for self-certification forms historic appointment. An empty town, a housewife and a journalist. Meeting two different worlds. Refuge for mother with sad life. Give a scientific victim a little filling. A story about privacy and silence. Looking at the look of desire as the nooks of life and the form of struggle. The great character - a book gave a gift in the spring afternoon. The film is a poem, special to the art of describing the shades of general loneliness. Appeal for the inefficient relationship with reality. And with your inner world. The pictures of Il Duce, Antonietta's clumsiness, Gabriel's Patience and Weakness Tension, give the script the grace of two great actors of the director's art, makes this film spectacular, subtle delicacy of the foretaste, an incredible image about hypocrisy and tyrannical judgment, the essence of life and About the repulsiveness of any outrage. Lorraine and Mastroni are masters of an incredibly brilliant acting. Clear artwork.
