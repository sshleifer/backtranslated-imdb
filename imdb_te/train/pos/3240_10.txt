I found this film a lot of years ago, and why was it not surprising then? Well written, beautiful acting, one ironical twist after another, and there is no placability trying to get fuzzy characters. I do not recommend this film to people with little attention. This story requires enough intelligence to understand that there is a kernel of truth.
