Also known as "stairway to heaven" in the US WWII British Peter Carter's (David Niven) is shot dead in the airplane but he survives. He meets lovely June and falls in love (Kim Hunter). But it seems to have been mistaken - he was dead! A French spirit comes to get him but he refuses. He begged his case before the Heavenly Tribunal, who must be allowed to live. <br /> It's ridiculous but it's actually a wonderful movie. Actors who run the script are absolutely fine and it's pretty directed - the earth's sequences breath-taking technicolor (I've never seen such beautiful blue skies) and the scenes in heaven are black and white! Neven times are a little bit harder but the Hunter is just great (and very pretty) and is amazing as a doctor trying to help Roger Lively Archie. The pictures all over are fantastic (especially during the stairs and final trial sequences) and the special effects are really great (examines the age of the film). There is also a very strange scene when Nine fully naked young boy runs into sheep sheep! It's very beautiful, thought provoking image - highly recommended. It is notoriously unknown in America.
