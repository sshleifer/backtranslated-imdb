A beautiful, funny picture that gets a solid grade all around. I recently worked with the film director of this film. It's great to see this film in contrast to all the crappy horror movies I see every day. I do not think it's going to the theaters in this way. But this movie is going to theaters. It is a good image to see with friends, its attractive, and some funny jokes. This acting is wonderful (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Darf, directing it is not good (it's not over-directed film) I really like the fact that Neil Simon, Seinfeld, and the characters are smart and a nice rhythm between characters, as an amateur screenwriter Those things are noticeable (I'm a dork) anyway, I recommend A truly beautiful image.
