Gong Ho is one of those movies you want to see over and over again. Michael Keaton is responsible for the arrival of a troubled car company into his town to employ residents of Hadleyville. What happens after a happy moment after another. Two cultures confront and hold things together as it is up to Keaton. See great performances from Keaton, Gede Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Saab Shimomo. All are definitely cast. Do not be fooled by a low number rating. This is in my book 7.5. Note that the town of Hadleyville's town was also used in High Noon. Yes, it is in true Hadleyville but Oregon.
