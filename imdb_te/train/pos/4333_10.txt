The great movie - The Wonderful Characters - Witty and Clever Dialogue - the actors are fantastic - for Peter Faulk Oscar - Paul Riser was beautiful - we had a fantastic recycler theater when we saw the film and he made a clear explanation of the film's production - Write a semi-autobiographical description of relationships between fathers Writing more specifically between him and his father- this is a dramatic and entertaining fashion-supporting cast that is well-chosen and gave a feeling of film family- I recommend this film to anybody who wants to see the brilliant drama and amazing performances
