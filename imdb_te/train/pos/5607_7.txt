Once I looked at the tenant, I thought it was a horror movie. It uses a number of trophos of the genre: the offender apartment, suspicious neighbor, attractions, secrets, hallucinations. The hero's life, Trevlovsky, was seen around the evil forces, trying to drive him mad. <br /> Last time, I challenged this initial explanation. If the film is a horror film, it's only a horror story that is the Kafka novel horror. <br /> In fact, the film is slowly becoming a verbal figure without any external influence. <br /> <br /> The madness that made three films in his career to Palancines: the opponent, the madness in the heroine, Rosemary's Baby, in which the heroine drives mad by the evil forces; <br /> <br /> When a young man in Trevlovsk, a woman hired an apartment that killed herself. He is engaged to her and slowly begins her: she dresses herself, puts it in the dress, talks like her. But is he possessing a soul, or is he able to get him the best of his wild imagination? It's true and imaginative, and it's this heap between Polanski never ever solved, this makes such a fascinating image. Many of the events in the film are common reasons for supernaturality, and the viewer likes it when deciding what they believe. <br /> <br /> It is a good example of the ability to create suspense and play a madly mad character, even though it is not my favorite film. And technically speaking, it's incredible. He is enough to tell the filmmaker Philip Sarde and work with the closest director of the filmmaker Shane Nequist (Bergman's DP) to produce the film. Slow pacing and sometimes unnecessary sections may make it difficult to enjoy the movie, but this is an experience.
