Well, this is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen and I want to see for the head love still Jerry Lee so much that I've remembered with the script too (especially the scene of the storage unit when Jerry lee breaks) and also the script is German crazy shepherd is crazy and really is put to the test to see who's smarter . The tag line has the same as true. Although Christine Tuckey is different in Whisper, acting is very good, but I do not know what I think of the filmmaker under CSI). The film is only in the film to work together with Dolly and Jerry Lee, which is good to see the trio of Zeus and Wells having their sleeve.
