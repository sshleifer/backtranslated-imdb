Animation is always so old. In Japan, this is not the case, but there is a very large "KIDS" tag in Europe and USA animation. France is probably one of the comic-liberal countries, classic home and other things like tin-tin, asterix, lucky luke, and valorone (if you do not read them, it's not too late and they do not carry DC-Marvel's nerd-stigma) It seems natural as a movie goes out in France. It's my favorite film of French-loving anti-American and talented filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you've got the Renaissance and have been French and French. If you are a normal person then be afraid of this. But that's not necessary! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br I can not imagine a confusing, sometimes boring and very attractive movie, but luckily I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the Neo-noir stuff anyway, but it's worth it as well. Note: I've seen a fine French dub as long as I can see it. <br /> <br /> The final term for the animation. It's awesome. Futuristic, well-designed, good camera-working, smart solutions (for example ice seemed very good, it was very difficult) and visually awesome I said "It's great!" Then again, really like animation and I appreciate the work I have done to suppress the studio, so my verdict is bit biased. <br /> <br /> It is a good film which is beyond "Jimmy".
