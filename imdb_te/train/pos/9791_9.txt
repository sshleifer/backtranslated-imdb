I will not stay away from explaining the story of this film than the two young girlfriend and two young suicidal young people who committed suicide return to Israel. She tries to find out why she ended her life to her friend, which emerges as a detective story. Following her inquiry and when the information accumulates, it can lead to a devastating end. The film is dazzling and acting, especially by Talia Sharon, the Blind Woman, as Yaya. Israeli film must come from ages and have a full competition for other foreign films, but some U.S. Found a large audience
