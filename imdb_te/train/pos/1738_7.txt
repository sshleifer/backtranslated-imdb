It's a happy movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who has signed a sponsorship deal with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pit restaurants. The deal includes all kinds of insulting clauses, and the burt forced to wear a chicken suit in the race! Jim Nobor is his (not very convincing) chief mechanic. Lonely Anderson (Oh, yeah!) Reinholds will be allocated by Beatty to be honest and perfectly committed to the contract. This is a funny film that Burt proves to be not very proud. It's my wish!
