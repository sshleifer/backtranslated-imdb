Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet" hits all the marks. The performance is amazing, the 70mm cinematography is gorgeous, the Oscar nominated clothes and sets are excellent, the score of Patrick Doyle (Oscar-nomination) is also sensitive and moving. Oh - screenplay, a man named Will S., is not too bad. Film critics praised Bragg for accepting a fourth Oscar for "screening" the screenplay, but his decision to use the full text was tough. <br /> <br /> Almost every decision is brilliant: Brahanheim Palace of England, Edwardian clothing and should not be in the hall of glass or "to name a few." The cast of Hollywood audiences, such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in minor roles, is quite disorganized, but it is not. The main actors: Derek Jacobi binds Claudius's contradictory nature; Kate Winslet deeply describes Ophelia's infection as an epidemic; Julie was interested in Christie Gertrude's role; Pitch-Perfect as Richard Bairr's pinning polonius; And Nicolas Farrell increases Horacio's hopeless role with the overwhelming interest of true friendship. Each speech, each line, is delivered with each word passion and confidence; There is a wasted moment in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> Brang's "Hamlet" is an adventurous, prestigious, ultimately successful attempt to perfectly match the greatness and poetry of Shakespeare's language. Equally eloquent depiction. This is a great Shakespearean adaptation ever shot. Strong praise, but well deserved.
