When I was 3 years old, I remembered this, then my parents accidentally looked at me for a few moments with some other cartoons. Then when I re-invented it at the age of 8 or 9 and I was able to understand good things, then I thought it was a good movie. A few weeks ago (June 2006) I found a few thanks to some internet articles / video clips and it's not just a single movie. I'm still good with the kids, but we have 20-30 somethings written on it exactly "cult status". It's a shame that the original product went through a painful process; If Fox gave enough time, it probably became more popular today. They can be remade with a completely different story and may be a voice cast of all stars, but it's determined by Fox. I'm rambling here, I know. I think it's still a great movie, but it's better than great.
