In an attempt to find another "hot property" for simulators, Perfax made the most successful attempt in the newspaper comic strip's world with the production of the Pfeiffi The Sailor (Fleischer Studios / Paramount) of Brothers Fleischer 1933. Although it was part of the Betty Boop series, Miss B. had just a brief appearance; <br /> <br /> Now the most common knowledge, Guff, Squinty Eyed, and Brolin Sunman became the most successful cartoon series. <br /> <br /> It is very good to give the king the features for another attempt at luck, Henry's comic strip role in Betty Booping; The goal is to be seeking another series. The next argument seemed absolutely sound. Henry's most popular factor in the Henst Papers lineup; Daily and Sunday Color Comics Supplement, PUCK, The Comics Weekly, both appear. You know, "Fool's these mortalities!" A, remember Schultz? Chubby, quite a bit, watching Bald Boy's comic strip hero and Miss Batey appear on the screen both in solo and tandem; We were amazed at how well we handle the role. Both the story and the director, Dave Fleischer, gained attention to comic strip-like situations and the visibility of Henry's role. These mostly silent voices are important for the animated film, putting them confident on the printed page; <br /> <br /> Henry: The Finest Living American (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corp., 1935), with the Betty Boop in the Cartoon See what we do; Primarily a relevant exercise; Dave Fleischer's rapid fire, the machine gun, is a punctuation of the usual array of clothing. In short, Henry found a puppy in the window of Petty Boop's pet shop. This is a kind of love when Henry tries to buy a little puppy with only money in his pocket. He was formed by Miss Boop $ 2.00 money in the anguished era to buy. <br /> <br /> When she was playing in an emergency business, Betty asked a boy who remembered the bookstore, but a postponement would soon be on the horizon. Instead of his services, Miss Betty gives him back a small dog. <br /> <br /> The Fleischer team gave the opportunity to fire a whole new string of clothing as they came to work in the cage for cleaning and livestock feeding; This time push the bird seed, Henry's bald pate and brooms. Henry enthusiastically literally saddled over his head for mass feeding of the avian population of the shop (but not once just Schultz!), Which immediately leads to a bird's mass defection; <br /> <br /> BETTY returned to this view and expressed disappointment and anger with Henry's provisional care. All bets, Henry is not dogie. He did not depart; dejectedly; But soon the owner persuaded the owner to give another shot at the fixing. His head covered with bird seed, he operates all corral of small feathered creatures; Return them to their pet store cooperation. Happy, little feta leaves; But this time he has the face of his favorite, small, puppy licking. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly this is a combination of winning. We are carefree, power-filled, free-wheeling of the boy, Betty's kindness and emotions of the situation and the 'boy and his dog' situation is a matter of doubt. <br /> <br /> <br /> Max and Dave Fleischer gave us a short story with a small little masterpiece. <br /> <br /> What a Honey series? Determining by the most reliable treatment of the character, it may definitely last for a while. However, the band is in several ways to try the best pictures of Betty Boop. The first, the PPSC The Sailor (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933), was the most successful (and any Betty Boop, not saved for Carnival Hula Dancer as Cameo); Two of Henry Short's are King Features "Tryouts", Betty Boop and Little King and Betty Boop and Little Jimmy, both better than 1936. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
