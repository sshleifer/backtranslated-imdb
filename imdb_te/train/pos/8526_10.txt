I loved this movie! Chris Shomman has done a wonderful job! He is not only a wonderful actor, but he is beautiful with a wonderful body! He did great work in distributing his lines, and moved to George rather than Fraser. Great performance for his first major role! The film is filled with happy scenes that every child loves. My kids have seen this movie many times since we bought the DVD that we released. In addition to this movie, the DVDs are just delightful on DVD. This one two thumbs up! I highly recommend to everyone!
