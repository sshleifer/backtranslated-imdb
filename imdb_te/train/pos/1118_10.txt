Well, it's one of the most laughable films of all time, and Sandy offers a tour-powered performance! In the end - she has always been remade of her three films: "The King of Comedy", "Dallas Doll", and "Without You You're Nothing". She created a biting and hilarious criticism of the popular culture of America from different people to New York Social and Diana Ross. Sexy and gruesome, tender and delicate, philosophical and melancholic, convincing viewers in every scene, and she really is "really beautiful". Look at this one (if you're not from Iowa), you'll definitely enjoy it !!
