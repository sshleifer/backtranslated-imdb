Yes, this film is not speculative and is definitely a reward-material. But do not try anything it does not. A funny funny one-liners, Peter Voule, star and fun filled with funny shows, land plots from Zone Plourest to ground down. The performance of the band is on the spot, everyone performed their role in the acting, humorous manner. The music is very good but it is filled with good picture. From some negative comments I saw some of the humor's subtlety in their heads. About the "strange baseball game", my beloved American, which is cricket-it's a ridiculous for those who know cricket about explaining the baseball-and the intelligent US band. Also, if you broke a window of Karl you're not supposed to wince; It's funny how Lord Foxley says "Oh yes!" To get more money for the breakdown and the manager at the same time "Oh no" is also referring to money. Geez, it seems that every joke will explain to some people ... all in-all-I enjoyed and have some great laughs! Well worth seeing.
