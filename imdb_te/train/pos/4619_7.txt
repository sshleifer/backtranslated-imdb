First off, I'm a huge fan of 80 movies, and Jennifer Connelly as well. So yesterday, I wandered into a local used book / movie store and found a VHS copy. I read it again and it would be better and for $ 3.99, it's a good deal. I took home and it popped on VCR. No sweet picture! Now at my age, I have more relationships with movies such as Last Night or St Elmos Fire, but I still remember what I was in love with 15/16 and older. We are young. And if it does not work, we are sincere and we will never get over it. But of course we are. Many times. It's sort of sweet quality I've really taken from this movie. The concept of "Oh! I remember when this happened ..." It's all there. Characters are interesting and well developed. I would recommend anyone who likes 80 movies, teen movies, or anybody who wants to remember the simplest time in their lives.
