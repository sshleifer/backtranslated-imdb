I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. The two performers performed the show from regular and recurring actors. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between all major characters is just awesome. After the camera rolling ceases, the actors get the feeling of enjoyment. <br /> <br /> The RDA will give the role of his 'O'Neil' credible personality. He never knew he could rest when he was resting. You see some of his words come to their eyes. <br /> <br /> However, they know that he is around him when the situation is calm. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things on the surface between 'Carter' and 'O'Neil'. They manage to keep the lid, but often just simply. Season 1's 'Solitudes' episode has the best drama on television. <br /> <br /> 'Carter' and 'Jackson' often have to do some of the turbulence created by 'O'Neill'. Yet O'Neill's strategic instincts seem to always sound. He understands what he can do without thinking about this matter. <br /> <br /> The quality of the 9th and 10th seasons has fallen sharply this season. The original story arc was largely used and the new villains really attracted my interest. Ben Broder is too small for the RDA involved in the program. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but it was all there. Amanda tapping in her performances during these two seasons. You can see her well-changed appearance after the baby. <br /> <br /> Spin-off 'Stargate Atlantis' has a few moments, but it is a rather weak effort. The main characters do not have the chemistry of the original cast. The villains (Vraits) are incompatible with being ridiculous. Perhaps the Amanda Tapping Program could absorb some life or exceed it for the fourth season. <br /> I always have a problem with special effects for the show. The design of the pyramid-shaped spacecraft is similar to the size of the site. Using torches for brilliance on these ships is just bad. <br /> <br /> "Season 2 in the opener, drawn by 'Daniel Jackson' And his uniform was a hole in the wound he crawled in a coffin and healed his body and restored his uniform when the wardrobe left the rock in the closet. The device 'Daniel', 'O'Neill' and 'Doctor' may have been used in several episodes: Frasier '.
