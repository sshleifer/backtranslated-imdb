I do not know the name of the movie, though I have read many comments that I remembered this movie and wished me a lot to see again. Fortunately, finding a search and title on this site, I read the comments I left here and realized that I remember this movie. I did a search and found the movie and I saw the movie 40 years later. Because of this site and your comments, you have helped me and I want to thank you all. I want to share how you can find this movie for all of you looking for a copy. It is the VHS version of Wonderful World of Disney's "Call It Carriage", featuring 2 paintings, the second being "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". It smashed me just 40 years ago and now has my own copy. I'm only available on VHS. I found in Ebay and there are many copies of it. <br /> <br /> It is a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle he sees. When it was time to sacrifice Eagle, the boy set up Eagle free, because it was not allowed to be killed. After leaving the Eagle, the boy left the punishment, Eagle also taught the survival and survival of the child's life more and more. The intimate intimacy of the boy and the eagle in the jungle moved and the shooting was really great. What is this amazing time. Never seen this movie.
