Man, I really love the new DVD put out universal. I never saw this good as Sentinel, because years have kept the clock, grainy VHS tapes. Unfortunately there is no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse to wear. And avoid Goodtimes DVD at all costs. <br /> <br /> However, troubled fashion model Alison Parker (Christina Ryans) moves to comedian NYC Brown Stone, which is just haunted. It also keeps the portal a portal and keeps the Vatican keeps the old blind priest (John Caradine) and make sure that the devils and arch-angels do not escape. <br /> <br /> It has all the cast members of the vintage actors like Eva Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jos√© Ferrer ... and Christopher Walken, Jeff Gold Blom secretly overturned) and Tom Berenger. And you do not even recognize Jerry Orbach from Law and Order. <br /> <br /> Alison's nude gore scenes had a double-take on his dead father's deadly dead body with the eye and nose slicing. By ghost. And the bizarre, depressed individuals try to hunt Alison for suicide, so she does not have to protect her portal. It seems Alison's troubled past makes him a major candidate by the Vatican to become the next Sentinel. <br /> <br /> A fantastic, creepy 70s classic from Michael Winner, who missed missed director. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />]
