If you feel "Wired al" Yanquik happy, you will not be disappointed by COMPLEAT AL. The most memorable videos of Yanquoque ("Like a surgeon" and "I love rookie road") are not only a part of these rare mockumentes, but they are among the funny vignettes named for Parodyst's fame. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is hazardous and even non-fans are fantastic enough that at least lightly amused. Die-hard fans are not only for their content, but now in its three-decade career, Yvonquik has its earliest look. Suitable for all ages, kiddies will no doubt love funny visuals.
