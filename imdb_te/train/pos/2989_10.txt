First off, I'm a big fan of Bette Midler. This is one of my favorite films of all time - Stella's excellent cast (Betty Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alardo, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason). It deals with her own baby-grown mother, who has many ways of playing her daughter Jenny's trii Alvado's awesome play. I'm suggesting this movie is very cool and a copy to see. 3 1/2 stars given by Roger Ebert! And it deserves 4! Excellent! I give 4 to 4!
