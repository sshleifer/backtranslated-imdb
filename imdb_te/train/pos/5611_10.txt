I thought I was thinking of moving in my own apartment and thinking of starting life in my life. Perhaps the reason I have taken it seriously may be the reason. I fully believed in the mental decline of the poor character, such as Paris, dirt, shaved, selfishness, misfortune, itching and decay of permanent construction sites. His direction, his play and his inexplicable script I give Polanski's art for all credits, but in the fierce final scene I was stunned and the Cognac in the theater manager's office had to revive. Fortunately, my life is not unfortunate in this regard, but I have always respected a fanciful artist who has so far tried to inform (fake). Simply put, man is a genius in the first order and a credit to the human race. The film is a series of many acting, great performances and great actors. I saw audio from French to English and Vice versa in appropriate scenes by watching a splendid transition to a bilingual, Paramount DVD, as some of the shows in English (along with Shelley Winters and Melvin Douglas) and others (with other characters) and others were dubbed in English and French change. The film is part of Polanski's "apartment building trilogy", which includes "repulsion" and "rosemary baby". Unfortunately, "repulsion" is still not a good DVD transition in Region 1. These three films make excellent Boxettes.
