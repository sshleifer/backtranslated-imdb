Loot is the best film to exploit the filmmaker in a great grade Z drive. Adamson really smalls deliciously tedious and dopey depths in delicate celluloid silliness and jaw-dropping stupidity which outdoes himself in this greatly ghastly sci-fi soft core music comedy rape. The idiot controller (an amusing Goofy Erwin Fuller) is considered an illegal act by the innocent laws of the Sex Big Brother in the fierce autocratic future of 2047. However, sweet'n'sexy Cinderella (Catherine Erhardt on the bright golden cutie) is determined to change the good stuff. With the help of the Fairy Godfather as actress, Cinderella reaches a gorgeous gala ball into a beautiful glaal ball, which is a cheerful and fully acceptable activity to chase the beautiful Stud Tom Prince (Dirky Vaughn Arm Strong). <br /> <br /> Adamson directs his ridiculous yarn with all his thumbs of inadequacy, much of the horror of the song and the dance sequences full of skill and skill. Unfortunately, the ablute "All Almost Needed" screams the forest rarely with people in a wacky animal dress, a ridiculous horror wonder; The robotic robots that have an equally damaged "mechanical man" group of routines. Louis Harvard's crude, static cinematography, frivolous plastic thumbnails, sparky sugarman's groovy throbbing disco score, extreme gratitude nudity (special praise for Sheri Coel in this particular section), Melbo's comedy (especially the irritant who runs the Rossko robot law) And uniformly terrible  ర్శనలు (సిండ్రెల్లా యొక్క దురదృష్టవశాత్తూ మారువేషని సవతి తల్లి పేరు రెనే హర్మాన్ యొక్క దారుణమైన హమీ చిత్రణ ఇక్కడ పెద్ద పెద్ద బహుమతి బహుమతిని కలిగి ఉంది) ఈ విపరీతమైన భయానక దురదృష్టకరం లో విపరీతమైన విపరీతమైన చీలని మరింత పెంచుతుంది.
