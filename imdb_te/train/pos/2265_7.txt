I would have liked the work of Vonnegot and I'm very pleased with the film, but I can not say that I read the "Mother Night". When people say Venezag is ineffective, two things come to my mind. Many of his backgrounds are close to sarcastic or prohibited, even though he is sometimes accused of using his "easiest" goals. This makes movies at a lower age everyday. The directors look at these days of temporary breaking and I am very much hoping for the version of "BlueBird" now in production. Vannage's "Surrender of Titan", like an innocent episode, is probably the equivalent of "R" if it is re-published in the 50s, and it comes with a script that no one can come forward with the tragedy for its violence, language and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> In the current economic environment, there are many directors at "jailbird", "galapagos" and "hughes pukos". <br /> <br /> The other thing is his satirical style, irony on sarcasm but still ridiculously funny. It seems impossible to challenge, and it seems to be a big obstacle to making great images of his great novels, because our reactions as readers do not often have a clumsy technique. "Venezagt suggested that he did not have a missing character as a painted version of his work, "Breakfast of Champions" (film) comedy <br /> <br /> Furthermore, there is nothing wrong with giving Vannegat's subjective interpretation to the director, and as another reviewer of "Mother Knight" says, the good director is a visual But poetry has lost much of the same plot but it's from the same novel I read I think it's really sharp, and I'm one of the achievements of the movie you genuinely between you good and the bad you are, for the novel reader, Feeling who has seen someone to walk on the edge of a razor, and the jury is still there There .Developed. <br /> <br /> "There are technically few small but glaring flaws, especially in the sequel, and it looks very often brown and theatrical, but most of the time It touches an acceptable note and occasionally shows considerable imagery and resources. <br /> <br /> It stays back in the back with "Slaughterhouse-5" and is actually there. His most funny but disposable play, Misfire filmed version of "Happy Birthday Wanda June", of course, of course, "Versailles", his short stories, "Harrison Bergeron", "Who Am I This Time?" If it still exists, if it still exists, in the 70s, along with the "Time and Timbuktu Between TimeTutate", its product Ilo involved vannegat apparently very unwilling, because of its sadharanatatvanlo he felt misunderstood. <br /> <br /> HG Wells story, "Dr. moryu" bizarre surgical experiments performed on the island gurtucesinatlu him, he said, but many people had access to his work excellent. <br /> <br /> The movies do not do your job. <br /> As the man says, the larger the head is inside your head.
