This strange picture is anything other than the West in time. The net, dreams and horror films of its chaotic emotions and visions, its effect is beautiful and undisturbed. Actors were danced as dancing rather than acting. It really has a unique dream sequence that resembles a real nightmare (sorry, dolly fans).
