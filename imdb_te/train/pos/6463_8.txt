This is one of those films you are thinking to wake up the next morning. <br /> <br /> Definitely, we get the usual stereotype characters and stories, but it will do the trick: Entertain. <Br> /> <br /> Since living since Sweden and in the US, it's funny how we react. "Deadbeat's husband is going to kill him", "she (Gabrielle) will die and then move on to the heart". We know how these things work, everything comes together. And it did. The characters are a bit lighter, they are so wide that you do not really think twice, nothing really left to your own imagination. <br /> <br /> But the film is beautifully set in rural Nordland, and music is absolutely awesome. And the characters are lovable. Michael Nyqvist is really genius, with his silly unique look and Frida Hallberg is beautiful and accessible. <br /> <br /> Many people think of this movie, and this is the most important thing. You speak, laugh, hate you and recognize you. I do not know about you, but it does not happen too often.
