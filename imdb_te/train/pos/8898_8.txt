A great movie about the hippie movement at the end of the 60's (I saw one night in full). The title suggests that the film is not really important for the first 5 years in the age of 60. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is Michael, a political activist who goes on the road in America. Vietnam-War. Michael's brother, Brian, goes to Vietnam (no surprise!) He comes back from the war and "the fourth-born Tom Cruise" was murdered by Michael's sister Kate Rock and Roll artist as his father was a Vietnam War guy (what a surprise !!) And walks away from home and goes to San Francisco in the summer in love. The end is very poor (father is a liberal and happy for everybody), but I'm away from my vote from this vote (the rest of the picture looks good!). <br /> <br /> Performances are good by actors and the soundtrack of the film is great. The main sixties feature films include films such as JFK and Martin Luther King, such as big hippie protests, love and Woodstock summer. Wood as a first aid employee at Woodstock Festival "Woodstock Speaker" Gravy (we're in bed in the bed 400,000!) <br /> In the end, 60 'movie about a beautiful decade! 10/10
