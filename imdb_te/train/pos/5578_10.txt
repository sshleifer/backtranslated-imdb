The first time a happy and intelligent perspective in the dating world is portrayed in the writer / director Peter M. Cohen in this off beat comedy. This story explains when four male prophets meet each meal at a local local dining room about their meal mourning. We meet Brad: a good-looking, wall-street playboy with quick-wit and sharp tongue; Jake: a dull, sensitive writer; Jonathan: A nice guy who is sexually disturbed with hand creams and hand experiments; And Eric: The marriage guy who met his weekly of his single friends in the hope for some bodily presence of his boring and unassuming marriage presence. The efforts and difficulties of men's single lives in New York are surprisingly expressed, reflecting the reflections of sex in City and HBO's new comedy The Mind of Weared Man and brought a subtle light to scam. The three songwriters meet Mia and this story takes a twist - Amanda Peet humbly-and all of her fall. She attracts everybody with her extraordinary ability to match their personalities. When they learned, they met a single woman and fell in love, and they chose their friendship. Wrapped is the original filming of the dating world, which failed to recognize the critic. In plain language, they lost the point. Here the hero is the caricature of real people. Combining hyperbole, epilepsy and humility does not take seriously as critical discrimination suggests. Watch this movie, you will laugh from the beginning.
