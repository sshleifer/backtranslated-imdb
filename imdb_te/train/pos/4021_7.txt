India is a complicated story in the background of division. An honest Muslim who kidnapped an innocent Hindu girl and a Muslim-educated Hindu who burned a man's man - yet finally you would like them both. The story is strong, though the screenplay and flow are back soon. Background music score and songs are the best. The next veteran comes with memorable performance by Urmila Matonkar. Photography time, violence, and rural Punjab tastes very well. Other actors did not perform well, or did not get the chance to act. Direction is a really weak link. The characters are not well developed. It is not as crisp as "Earth", where a 5-character character also loses a mark. The ending is very interesting. This story has different conclusions - and they are all equally good.
