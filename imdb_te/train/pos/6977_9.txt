This is really a slavery for Katrina, because it is a good prequel series for Battlestar Galactica. It really starts slowly, but must be taken immediately after the new episodes are broadcast. <br /> <br /> I've heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season. <br /> </ br> <br /> Eric Stolts is an amazing job, as well as Claris Willow as Polly Walker! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
