Photography is beautiful but it's hard to understand what happened ... There's so much symbolism ... ... 2 goldfish - Do they understand anything in Thai culture? There are not so many plots, so much happens and it's just the postponement along. The real start, the true middle and the end is not the end. <br /> It's hard to get into roles because you never have the idea of ​​getting to know them ... It's hard to see scenes imaginable and realistic. This action is thought to be haphazard and confusing. I do not know what the Pong brothers did. I probably make more sense if it is Thai ...
