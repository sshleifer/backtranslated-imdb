This film is a lovely study for a family in crisis. <br /> <br /> Leo, the oldest, declares that he was alone and reacting with each other, and that the reactions of the HIV + family were alone and strange. <br /> I never saw a family that was physically present in this regard; Or the chance to shout at each other. I thought the family was unable to deal with the newspapers but after finding it, I found this moving motion entirely.
