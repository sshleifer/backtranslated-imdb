This 2004 Oscar nominee is the lowest b / w movie in Spanish. A young woman goes to a cafe, receives a coffee and watches one of the musicians who are silent with their musical instruments. All patrons are moves like humans. One person, however, is very fun and breaks into a song about 7.35 in the morning. Another surprising moment to the end is another, well, awesome. People, the place, everything looks very simple. And as part of the musical "Bolero", it keeps the structure up to the climax. With its structure, background, movement and wit, it is an 8-minute masterpiece.
