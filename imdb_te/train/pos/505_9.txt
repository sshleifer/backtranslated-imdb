Very good start. I was surprised to find the machines very sophisticated: it could be a crude, match to see the original series. While the Valkan Lady is very small, the cast is interesting. She needs to go to school in Spock, after all, the model for this race. Very bad people were not selected by Jerry Ryan. I have Mrs. Park, Korean (?) Lady. The doctor has the possibilities. Excluding black and other males are not separated. He really liked it. Bakula needs to find his niche - his strong point of QL is his willingness to try his sense of humor and anything. He is, of course, strong enough for a huge and heroic. The heavies are OK, though I do not like their make.
