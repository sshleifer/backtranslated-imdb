This gripping story of mutual love, jealousy and hostility is more enjoyable to watch with a sharp image and crisper sound, in the DVD years after its PBS broadcast. My only reservation plot has some inconvenient moments and strong Manchester accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately there is not a word here and it does not spoil the fun: the primary actors are ideally cast. Robson Green brought a troubled smile, a go-for-break nature and an athletic physique to his role as his younger man, who was in desperation for his employer's wife at the hospital, just beginning to work. Francesca Ans is one of the most amazing 50-ish women imaginable; Her acting rivals her beauty. (The romantic sequences between the two show better than the age difference). Each supporting character is very tightly and wonderfully shot. The Pithy dialog and the exciting extra mix makes it a fun miniseries. As Russell Baker suggests in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by looking at "Reckless" - but you're just fun. (The sequel, part of the DVD box set, provides a wild yet satisfying two-hour diagnosis. You should not lose it if you experience it earlier.)
