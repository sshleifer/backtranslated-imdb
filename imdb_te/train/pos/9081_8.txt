If you like science fiction, monsters, and ancient legends then you love this movie !! <br /> <br /> Jurassic Park has seen special effects since the big screen years ago hit. <br /> While acting is very small, storytelling and its effects are adequately replaced. <br /> <br /> I do not like non stop action, fantastic visuals, and myth and confirm ... Our 42 pounds on our theater screen.
