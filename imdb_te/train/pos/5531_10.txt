Seeing "The Fox and the Child" is an addictive experience. The flawless visuals, the integrity of the perspective and the overall beauty of the arrangement and the characters left me in the fury of happiness. <br /> This plot is unusable. Cunning simple. <br /> <br /> In the container of simplicity, the world will blossom you. I was tired. I learned. <br /> This is the movie which you can trust yourself. I said that I am the love act of any innocent heart. It reaches the audience heart - at any age - and as seen from the heart, reveals the world through new eyes. <br /> <br /> Adi da Samraj once viewed view into the ecstatic partnership in reality to the real art. I am privileged to see - not, to take part - this is the work of the true art.
