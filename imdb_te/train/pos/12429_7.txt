David Ducov is playing the lead role in this movie. Now many people are not even searching for reality. Too bad to say the least. David made his name in x-files and was a good actor. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchevney) left for drug abuse, a drug addict. Due to the complete disaster, he becomes a private doctor for the criminal Millionaire Raymond Blossom. However, FBI takes an interest in using Uujini, who wants a buzz. Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of Clare - Gangsters moll.She keeps in a solid performance. Timothy Hutton's playing blossom is amazing and immersed deep into his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as most people would expect and in the end I'll rate his credibility for his performance. His known monotonous tone and straight face but did not remove much from the movie
