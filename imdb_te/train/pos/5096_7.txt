The remodeling (4 hours) rebuilding of the rider huggard tale is an additional supplement with Russian soldiers seeking a "power of stone" buried alongside the common female pair and solo king Solomon. It is very well portrayed, giving a clear feeling of Africa's wide open space and playing well. Patrick Swayze is a magnificent Alan Quatermin, and Elizabeth Maitland as Allison Dude is attractive, hires Quettormine to save her father. In the lap of the lap, the Macnab Gavin Hood and the leader of the Russian soldier (not named in the IMDb list) are also memorable. If Hollywood does not agree to a good mood for everyone, it is very good and I am very happy. 6/10.
