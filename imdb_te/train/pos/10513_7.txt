If you have any clue about Jane Austen's production, now she will repeat each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion all the movies made of her novels are quite bored, but I like Asthene's characters, because they have a specific personality and general sayings that all Emma should also repeat. The thing that Emma makes for the good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good in the lead role. Moreover, each of the characters in the film can not think of anything, but getting a good partner and getting married soon is the joy of the film.
