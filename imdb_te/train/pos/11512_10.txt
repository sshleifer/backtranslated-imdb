Originally designed for T.V, the 'The Night Stalker' was originally produced in the US in 1972. Cinema in history. Based on Jeff Rice's unpublished novel, it was discovered that the name of Karl Kolchak (late Darren McGavin) was a detective investigator who found a vampire presence in modern Las Vegas. When it came to British television four years later, it did not have the same effect, but I'm actually my friends talking about it on Monday morning school. We've seen that we have agreed that it is one of the most exciting things for everyone. <br /> <br /> I do not know the existence of 'The Night Strongler' until almost a decade later. Exactly spin-off series, featuring I.T.V., 'Kolchak'; Buddy Eben's 'Barnaby Jones' was thought to have been a draw, however, the audience might get worse with 'Kozak' with 'Koljak'! The only origin of information about this program in the Fergoria Magazine. I could not even buy Jeff Rice's novels. <br /> There was something amazing. In 1990, B.B.C.-2 featured this show as part of the Friday Night Series dedicated to the supernatural called 'Mystery Rail' organized by Richard O'Brien. 'The Brain Eaters' and' Earth Vs. 'Spin' and 'kolchak' by rubbing shoulders. <br /> <br /> The initial titles were trimmed, Colchac's pendulum was removed and closed credits ... well, nothing. <br /> The first episode 'Werewolf'. <br /> <br /> I saw this in 1974. I prayed to my twelve years of age. Creepy, humorous, exciting, it eliminated Chris Carter's imagination. <br /> <br /> The biggest asset of the show is Makkawin. Unlike the recent Kolchak, the original one is everyone's figure, wearing fiercely, rather conservative. He is superhuman what 'colombo' criminal is. At the end of Simon Oakland is greatly known as Kolchak's bad-natured person Tony Vinsenjo. The scripts sunk with amazing, dry wit. I found it enjoying more fun for humor content than horror. When the twenty episodes ended, I thought I was deteriorating. <br /> <br /> 'X-Files' came a few years later and filled the vacuum - but only to one extent. I wanted to return to Colacach and Vincenzo. I'm never happy with the performance though. <br /> I have rice books now and have read them many times. I was surprised when Stephen King first wrote something (in his book 'Dance Macabre'). <br /> <br /> Okay, some of the monsters are rarely state-of-the-art, but what's that? The new 'kolokk' lost the original point. <br /> <br /> The best episode - 'Horror in the Heights' is the worst episode - 'The Sentry'
