I have never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... until now. She is really amazing in this film. Do not worry about the emotion that went back to her shooting after she was taken back. This is a very hard picture to see, the thing is decisive unpleasant and you just feel quiet and just watching the woman masturbating for what just seems like sitting and seems like an eternity. I felt that when her friends returned home, it would reduce some of the money and I was not all unquestionably close. The director had a lot of interest in his strokes and loved using mirror reflections, and I believe he was more interested in the pace in the second half of this piece. This makes me a heck of a powerful piece of theater, for me this film, though it's merit, has fallen short.
