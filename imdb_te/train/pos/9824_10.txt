Bad sex movies without hardcore sex: this movie is a romantic B-movies state sterling example. This is not so bad in this regard; There is a female attorney trying to prove that her lover is innocent of killing his wife. The rest of the picture, however, leaves something to be desired. Bad acting, bad direction, bad woman, bad sets, bad cinematography, bad sound and bad romantic scenes. Motion picture producers should learn the difference between vulgar and romantic. <br /> <br /> They do not have a general feeling with Gabriella Hall's nude or romance scenery. <br /> How is the dumb?
