There are movies, and movies. Motion pictures are not merely cinematic "candy", but movies are true works of art. Fraulein Doktor is definitely in second place. For many audiences, I am impressed with war scenes, but the nutritional criticism of the central character is considered the most sterling quality of the film. It is possible to serve his country as a true daughter of Deutschland, at all times in the chaos of drug addiction, Farrellin is very annoyed by German high command of all of his efforts. Dorter is only one spot on a Mercedes-Benz command in the rear seat of Auto, isolated, isolated, and killing is perhaps one of the most profitable yet real-life films of "spy" in life. Only the emotional distress comes from Rich Who Burton from Spy Who Came from Cold. The Fuelline Dotter is much less than the one observed in a rare view. I wish that its producers would find enough to release on DVD so that those who have never experienced it and can see it again can enjoy this extraordinary movie again and again.
