Sally's Outstanding Out and Out Action Picture. It's pretty promising with some interesting characters, solid shows and Renny Harlin's direction pretty enjoyable. Stalin is rarely interested in his action films and he is certainly part of the action sequences. This is one of the best action pictures of the year and one of the most exciting and enjoyable of the 90s, is a perfect art classic. As a Stallone fan, I'll look back with the memories I like. Plenty of amazing action and sneak in the form of the main action man. Action lovers congratulated the film because it has all the features of a good Atlanton film. The film is very good and has great support from Jainine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Litco. ****
