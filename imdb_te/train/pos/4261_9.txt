I will worship this film. I am a big fan of Moritz Blebrat, because he is actually in whole German films. But because he's not the main actor. <br /> <br /> Baranie Metschaurat, the only reason to see Julietttan in 2001, has played a major role in the film. "German dream" from Germany to Germany (this is my own discovery and contradiction ...) cheap labor in steel and coal industries. Nevertheless, they end up opening the restaurant and travel to the restaurant, so poetic and at the same time funny and lovely. The story of this period belongs to the two brothers of Giancarlo (Bilbertru) and Gigi (Methuschaurath) of the family. Gigi's dream to become filmmaker was threatened with his brother and his mother's decision to return to Italy. <br /> Finally, the film (of gigi or giancarlo) is what's big and completely neutral. Successful or fuller or more interesting. It gives us a glimpse of glimpse as we look for recognition when only two countries and mental factors participate. And this form does not lead to any bitterness or despair, making it a great film that deals with tension from immigration to immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin is to go to Turkey from Turkey in the 70s is a bigger standard of its credibility and emotional accuracy. The whole cast of icing on the cake, specifically amazing performances by Matsachaur and - this is a little boy who plays the younger tenacity - I really need stress. That kid's performance is just a hard act to follow about anyone! Great image, go see it.
