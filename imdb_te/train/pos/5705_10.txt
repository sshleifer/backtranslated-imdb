An excellent opening musical from Ren√© Clarrie, his silent "Italian Straight", is fun and funny. Using sound rather than dialogue and effects, Claire influenced early music in America (influenced by the opera Le Million from A Night in the Opera). All movies can be viewed (but not) and the DVD from the Criterion is exactly what you expect. There is a ton of additions, but most of the DVDs I've seen are pale tender, and Clair interviews on the disc is one I've never seen. Get it still while it's still there.
