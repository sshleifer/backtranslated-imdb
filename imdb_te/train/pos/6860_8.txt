Bobby murders the patient (Angie Dickinson) of the famous physician (Angie Dickinson), who Bobby murders and chases Bobby's glimpse at the elevator, chases the high costume (Nancy Allen). Teams have been caught in suspicion of Liz (Allen) crime and the killer with the patient's son (Keith Gordon). It is abbreviated in two words: It's very sexy (Dickinson and Allen is great), it's very bloody - the gore variety is usually reserved in movies that are popular and the boy is well-made. Writer / director de Palma's script is ok but it really lags behind man's image-capabilities. It will be very successful at the whisker level and I am really involved with these characters. <br /> <br /> I can recognize the sacredness of the standard de Palma to Hutchcock / Riohouses - at least one of the master of pictures <br /> and everything to be topped, it is a professional and reliable cast. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want, <br /> <br /> I do not think a thriller can do classy and bloody at the same time but this picture pulls it out. <br /> <br /> Best things about Pino Donagio music score. <br /> <br /> 8/10
