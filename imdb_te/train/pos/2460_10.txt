Hamlet is my favorite of Shakespeare's works. The actor is an actor Hank. This is simply amazing in his character. His soliculas are breathtaking. This is rare for a long time to keep my interest, but I'm drowning in this particular piece. I would recommend Shakespeare's fans to anyone and not more. It is everything that appears in its films in modern films: murder, betrayal, and hypocrisy. Mel Gibson's version should not be hit, but Branghs will break the whole work. It can not rotate any stone. When you finish the movie, the game will be enjoyed when you read it. You say "two thumbs up".
