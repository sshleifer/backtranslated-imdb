I saw two images of Pong Brothers, Take The Eye and One. I saw Eye, I was disappointed about these two people. That movie (eye) is a really bad script, especially the end (childish, clich√© and my opinion is quite coincidental), but its photography and experimental images are still good. So I decided to take only one and I'm not disappointed again. There is still great photography, wonderful film, MTV-style editing, cool music and this time, the story is indie soul, logical and beautiful too, you'll see some small plots holes, but it does not cause any trouble. The only problem about this film is that I get a bad DVD.
