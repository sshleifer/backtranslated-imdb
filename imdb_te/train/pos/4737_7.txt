Hack hop (black mask) I want to call a ballot with fist and explosions. The plot was first attempted and heard (biological engineering soldier was part of Superman's supreme combat power, killing and brute force to resolve every thing and to try to get rid of the peacekeeper, and librarian, or his other team, to keep the police alive - his best friend Cop on Will stay as a mask.), Most of the scenes, the works and will be entertaining, at least for me. I love martial arts films that are an artwork. Pace and action non stop are due to light around the air and the effect of recovering the split second after effect. But this film is perfect, jet lie's performance is what he does best, and the amazing performance of his skills, which is at least the best line. Fast action martial arts films are as good as ALA. Jackie Chan and Samo Hong are now the first to present themselves in the states, the films are much less on the lesser forces and the superb physical work. But even with the big holes in the platform, I can tell him how safe he is in his apartment, less than 20 feet from him, he has more than 15 feet with an army to escape. The scene will cut him in the apartment just ....... I guess I guess very well), I have a lot of cinema Saktikaramainadi. It seems to be somewhat lower for the last 20 minutes. But still all around the great paced action movie.
