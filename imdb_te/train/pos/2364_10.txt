I must admit I read the original MR James Story, but I read a lot of his other supernatural stories. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> I have seen many of the BBC Christmas Ghost Stories in the past and in my opinion, most of them surpass the signal man. - directed and 'mood' is definitely, acting, lighting and, of course, story and writing. I have enjoyed it and hope this quality from the same director and production team. <br /> <br /> I understand that the BBC project is not (based on MR James Stories) and promises. <br /> <br />
