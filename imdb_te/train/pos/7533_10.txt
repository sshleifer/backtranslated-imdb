When I was in Prince's Kids WB, the original show ended in 1995 ended up in 1995, and I did not believe that Batman was off to the show in 1997. Fix his own crime. This is an interesting perspective for their relationship. I also liked Tim Drake's mix of the series, and this once again featured great stories, great animation (the best original), fantastic voice work and intelligent writing. The only thing that I do not like is that it often executes parts in a 15-minute storyline when it's in the US. I wish I could have been in the episodes for a long time. My favorite episode of any Batman cartoons comes in this series, and "Over the Edge", in my opinion, "Heart of Ice" and "Counting of Robin" is not good. Overall a nice follow up, this program along with Superman has made my childhood very happy.
