Hayo Miyazaki's name is popularized with Spitid Away, but the director's first film attempts have often been ignored. THX 1138, directed by Spielberg or George Lucas, directed by Spielberg? I remember remembering the fragments of the film - the last 45 minutes at the end of the 80s and with me was the visibility of design and animation. So when I saw a copy in a well-known store for Â£ 9, I could not resist. The right thing is that the last 45 minute movie did not match with my memories (memory is so fun). <br /> <br /> The artworks are now available with some knowledge of the artwork. Some of the artworks, such as Jean 'Mobias' Giraud <br /> <br /> <br /> When the pajar is caught by a fallen girl (Sheeta) his adventure really starts - search for Laupta - refers to the neglected part of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. <br /> <br /> It is a good good versus bad chase film with the ultimate part of the heroes in Lupta. <br /> <br /> This is a group of robots that are locked under a giant tree - a part of the strongest part of my memory - the eco-factor nature of Laupta. This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the film - looping surface views, against the mechanical underground. <br /> <br /> Despite the contradiction of the film - the nature can not be overcome - let the last robot sarcastic garden and the animals. <br /> <br /> It is very beautiful, I say 'soft' - very beautiful and organic and details in buildings, air forces and tremendous details <br /> <br /> Mizuki is the true owner of these types of japanes anime. Buy this film and save it.
