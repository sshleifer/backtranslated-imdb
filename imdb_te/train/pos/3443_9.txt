The film "The Dagent" is filmmaking because it lacks a comprehensive, honest, daring and unforgiving psychological horror film that touches the painful experiences of pain caused by rape, because the film is cruel in its theories, which, if it is theoretically released, has made some strong biased hatred. <br /> <br /> The film is not only dark themes, but also for its excellent direction and standard style - but for all its performances. Chad Faust was completely sick and suffered enough illness and had enough weakness to create one, but he was also aware of his deep self-indulgence in his own self-indulgence, not only the women who raped her, but with the outrageous nature of his sexuality. It's part of Faust is a very complex, brave, and emotional performance. <br /> <br /> However, the standout Rosario Dawson, whose performance is a perfect revelation here. The tour-power of genuine dramatic dramas, and very subtle, more loud performances are very short. <br /> <br /> When Dasson appears in some of the great evil films, she proves here, demonstrating what she can do to emotionally and movable performances with some confident and backdrop. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p> It's very bad for a very extensive appeal. Such movies are good!
