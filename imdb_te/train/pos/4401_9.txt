The Devil Ride (Crouching Tiger), directed by Ang Lee, is one of the best directors in the cap. Those who do not know the history of Kansas-Missouri border war in the American Civil War. Watch this movie & you visit the sad part of the American. Unlike some amazing scenes (sometimes very slow). It is the love & devotion story between men & specifically a woman. It was Toby Maguire, Skeel Ulrich Jeffrey Wright & Young Lady Jewel, I never saw her or did not see her before, and I want to see her more.) Acting is top notch, excellent production values, it's too long The movie is 128 minutes, but is worth watching. <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p> <br /> <p>
