Science Murphy and Rachel McAdams wrote and directed this action / thriller actor Suspense Master, Wes Craven. The whole film starts with a few problems in a hotel in Miami in The Land Atlantic. The problem is fixed by all the hotel's manager Lisa Reisert. Then she goes to the airport, that's where the trouble begins all over. Jacques Ripper meets Jackson Ripper because you can not call Jack as the Jack the Ripper, you know him and I understand. Then they sit next to each other on the plane board, and crazy enough, the Ripper and the raiser. For the next half hour, Lisa feared, fearing Ripner, feared. I do not want to give anything away. Then we are lashing at Jack airport. Then Lisa goes to her house, her father is okay, and there's enough Ripner. Overall, the total of twelve minutes of violence and strong solidarity throughout that scene. Overall, there will be more than 25 minutes of intensive action. <br /> <br /> This film is not intense, but it has a great plot. As I said, I will not give up anything, because it's astonishing and thrilling and somewhat scary / frightening. And acting from each character in the film, no lines are all of them, all the pitch are perfect. It is amazing. Everything in this movie is awesome! Acting, music, effects, make-up, directing, editing, writing, everything is amazing! Wes Craven is definitely a master of suspense. Red Eye is definitely worth a visit and definitely worth your money. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie again and again. It's never bored. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is better than 10 out of 10 stars. Original MPAA Rating: PG-13: Some Severe Sequences of Violence, and Language <br /> My MPAA Rating: PG-13: Violence, and some serious effects of language. <br /> <br /> Canadian rating: 14A: violence, scary scenes, disturbing content
