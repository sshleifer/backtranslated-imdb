This documentary makes you travel around the world. It has rare and amazing sequels from the wilderness. How is this different and how our planet is so fragile? The future of the polar bear will be highlighted at the start and end. After all, the future of the earthquake is bound up with the consequences of global warming in the future. This documentary is the simplest approach of such a serious environmental problem. However, it can be easily seen by small children because it is basically instructive. Scientists may be very disappointed because it's not a remake of Al Gore's documentary "Uncomfortable Truth" but frankly ... A question can arise later: Is not it worth the preservation of the beauty of our world? This documentary demonstrates that in 2007, such beauty still exists despite the different blows. By living in towns and cities we can not forget that part of this nature and parcel. All things considered as a documentary remind us that we have a common treasure called "Earth".
