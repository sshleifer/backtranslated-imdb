Every now and then a filmmaker creates a unique group of people and allows you inside to see what people are doing. Laurence Cassen again. I always felt BG sill was the oldest song it was and he was able to do it again in the Grand Canyon. Every day we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and often we wake it up. This is an image of people who are determined to choose life and experience life. Let's see what we are concerned about when we are young children and big events relaxing. I have seen this film many times and the deep emotions of this film are deeply surprising. Danny Glover and Kevin Klein play their roles with a great painting and are worthy of playing Stair Martins in the filmmaking. Thank you again Mr. Cassen
