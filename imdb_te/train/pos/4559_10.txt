My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. In her life 22 years, she did not see anything but her school was occupied by the walls of our home and also other disabled children. I have everyone's jokes but I still feel this day because my sister is disabled, or ever gives a damn about her and her condition. <br /> I know I'm going through Christie's family. But they were fortunate. Christie can speak, he can communicate and he has artistic skills. My sister would walk, but she did not say a word, and she could not use her hands to do anything but to grab it into things. But this movie made me realize there are other people in the world like my sister, and the end (telling the truth) to cry out to me. And I see Shulshan! The film is very bad, and it is not. This film tells people something. People should be proud of their own lives. Do you think that you did not get well? This man wrote with his footsteps. Do you think you are not attractive? This guy got a lot of girls, because of his condition. Not a fast runner <br /> <br /> My opinion: Parents of little children, I suggest your children watch this movie so they know the next time they see someone on the street wheelchair, they are not strangers like they are aliens. My sister got millions, and I think it's going to be a lot of people to break my heart. This film teaches people, even people who do not "ordinary". 10/10
