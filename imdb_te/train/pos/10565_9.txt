In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler played and danced their role through three Warner Brother Muscles, which included a momentary combination of Depression episode audiences from their grief. In 1933, Gold Diggers, 42nd Street and Foote Parade were in the Broadway Theater's world. Besides Keerler and Powell, Basby Berkeley's Kalidyscopic choreography performed, temporarily discontinued and performed the same assistant players. <br /> <br /> All of these are classics of their genre but I ask it because of pace power and lead James Cognny. Warren William produces magnificent performances at Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter on the 42nd Street - particularly Baxter, burning Julian Marsh for the final box office smash. Both did not have the inferiority of Kagni, but he appreciated the frantic pace of a Broadway music. He is a perfect whirlwind dealing with product numbers, unscrupulous partners and a golden dug girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The course Cognny does not make it classic on the bottom of it alone. The script breaks with some sharp double entrepreneurs provided by Franck McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibby and Zon Blendel, who specializes in everyone's down-scoring assortment cast. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and exciting, and just before the Hollywood code came in 34. Sadly, thirty and few are over and over again. Sympathetic and morality make it perfect.
