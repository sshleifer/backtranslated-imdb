I saw this movie on HBO and it's great ... actually a tragic love story! I really appreciate the fact that the person in the story of the story lost his legs in an accident. It is rare to see the love story of physically disabled people. I love to think of love in the love of love between the character and the woman in her life. Laura Lytton ... At the age of 27, she made the film ... She is the woman who completes her life to renew the heart of this person. Unfortunately, his family is wealthy and she is not, "problems" develop. <br /> <br /> HBO is playing a few times this month. See Schedule here - http://www.hbo.com/apps/schedule/ ScheduleService?
