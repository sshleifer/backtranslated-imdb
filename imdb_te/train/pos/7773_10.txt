Fabulous Film! Recently the DVD was rented and was performed by the performance of this amazing work. Douglas Cirk was an intellectual genius and he could not describe Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar Winner), Robert Stack (Oscar nominated), and Lauren Baccal. Dorothy Malone has been praised by Paul Vergon in the film by portraying the murderer of Sharon Stone in his Basic Instinct. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> It's absolutely every tawdry big and small screen soap opera's grandaddy but nobody has dazzling style like you'll see here: The camera's work is smooth and polished, colorful use is breathtaking, the opening montage set song is not memorable, one dimensional characters are unforgettable, the final image Let's draw your head, how to cut the censors back to the end Tayane about it! </ p> Sometimes movies have a boring task to sit, with the on-the-winds written that has a lot more and it ends up really ill. Thanks to Mr. Sirk for attentiveness and to draw the attention of Todd Haynes - now one of my favorite films has become! Watch this movie!
