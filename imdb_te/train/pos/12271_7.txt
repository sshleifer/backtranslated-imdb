Talk about a burst opening, "Trampa Infernal" is the coolest opening credits! Traditional "Friday 13th" theme is guided by musical tones inspired by the theme (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha), where the main players' names are split into large letters. Completely unclear Mexican slasher / backwoods survival thriller's introductory intro and every minute it passes only becomes cooler. Two very competitive and testosterone-overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other in the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar. According to a newspaper article, a savage bear is loose in nearby forests and killed many of the hunters who have already tried to catch it. The challenge is to be announced as the ultimate macho hero in a huge set of balls that can kill the bear. Upon arrival, however, it quickly becomes clear that they are not against a bear but his secretive weapon weapon is not too much arsenal and his sleeve-up is a bewildered and completely maniacal war veteran against many fighting tricks. After a whole decade and excited American slashers, this early 90's Mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and clear. The principle is simple but effective, the main characters are adequately acceptable and the building will be succeeded succinctly for the buildings faced by the Satist killer. Unmadi is a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers because he uses sharp swords with a self-made mask and a white mask to cover his face. These murders are very dirty and rude, I've really hoped from the early scenes that I have excelled, and destroy all the inadequacies of the blood. Forestry and specially camouflaged Bobby traps are happy to be spectacular. "Trampa Internal" comes warmly recommended for fans of that style that hit a Mexican slasher / survival sleeper.
