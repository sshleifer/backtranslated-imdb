It meets for about a year after events in "Basic Instinct". Catherine Tramal (Sharon Stone) is now in London. Going on the road in 110 miles / hour (if not) do not have a sexual relationship with a soccer player while going to the car and ending in the Thames. She was alive - he was not. Police investigator to see if psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) is emotionally upheld by the investigation. Obviously she starts playing with her mind and starts playing plenty of murders and sexual abuse. <br /> <br /> The film is doomed before it is opened. It took forever to get a cast and director, the script issues were stable and the cast was not happy (Morrissey often complained about the film). Still this is not too bad. It's like the first one - a lush music score, beautiful places, plenty of sex and nudity (which is edited for a R), better plot and good performance - but not impact. It's like a retread of the first one. People have been killed here with a chucker lash (I believe) ... people were killed in the ice sheet first. Stone in a beautiful moment pick up a snow pick and looks at it longingly. She may even be playing mind games with a man and get involved in the murders. <br /> <br /> It also has a very rated rated - clear sexual debate, male nudity (Morrissey looks much naked than Michael Douglas), woman nudity (Stone is still very good) and some bloodiest murders. Acting across the board is good. Stone is just amazing here; Morrissey looks sad but okay; <br /> So - it's not bad, but it's like the first remake. I still recommend it. Stone was not happy because people were attacked and thought they were stupid to make a sequel to "Basic ..." 14 years after they were made.
