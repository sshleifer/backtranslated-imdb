This is the best of what I really think like Jesses. Many films have shown Jessus as a long, lobotomic or violent. This Jesus has been laughed, and it's serious when it's needed. <br /> <br /> The film is generally not attracted to the Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> The film took some liberties and tried to "fill in cans". But it does not seem to be impossible or unlikely. What I have argued is that it really does not explain what the Romans are against (the film was portrayed by Romans as the main driver of Jesus, not the idea of ​​the Jewish authorities). <br /> <br /> It seemed that the film was well researched. An example is an open comment for a young man known as "Mark". It is said that the male (or John Mark) boy was removed from his spy and ran naked (Mark 14:51). I get the feel of the movie they tried to do as much as possible (even in the soul).
