Year 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) does not like people. He is only a friend and he is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), old sympathetic. They run the herd of cattle with them. Schiff ganon (John McIntyre) got into trouble when the cattle were taken. Now Jeff has to go back to Dawson through the US border. Now they have a group of other people (Ruth Roman) and Renee Wollen (Kornin Calvette) .Two men went into the gold business enter. The fourth collaboration of Anthony Mans and James Stewart, Far Country (1954) are good Westerners. Acting work is amazing. Walter Brennan Stewart makes an amazing sidekick. The Ruth Roman is superb and the delightful of Corinne Calvet. Joy C. Flippen is very good as Dawson Marshall Ruby Morris. Great Jack Elm and Kathleen Freeman appear in small roles. It is amazing to see how Jimmy Stewart can overcome problems in his way. There is only man and his rifle. But he is vulnerable.
