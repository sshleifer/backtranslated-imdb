I'm ready to pan this episode, that this 'master' really does not have any horror images under his belt ... but this episode is the best episode of this season .. <br /> Good !! I do not know how he is in conflict, but we got some real talent in this episode! And you could see things from a mile to platform-wise, at least it was fun and full 56 minutes, so I could continue to engage in this series in the series. <br /> <br /> I especially like the bit to the end, not at every turn, but forever, a funny little bit that has ever been turned into a chicken-picked hubby. <br /> Really good effort. As I have said in other reviews- these are not real Masters doing a lot of these episodes .. But they maybe someday being masters of the future.
