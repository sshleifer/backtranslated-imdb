This is a very difficult movie to watch, especially the innate center of all of our lives. But ultimately the most beautiful and deeply moving picture. Any person I'm disappointed should say that they are missing the entire message. In fact, they will see that the film will solve problems, and the result is ultimately exciting. Sure, it's hard to see, the complicated thing and the ruthless. Yet it is very relative to society and everyone. This is what the world is doing at the moment (which is not limited to France) to everyone and try to see everyone. I say that it is better to go with a clear head without affecting the controversial opinions, and let the film structure for you.
