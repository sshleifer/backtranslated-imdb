This picture is excellent and excellent score. The Prince Oscar was well-deserved for music (many of whom did not know that he won). I think it's one of the best movies to watch as a couple late night on DVD. A great surprise: Prince is acting a good job, and the camera is pretty good conveying pain. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa are good in their supporting roles. Very cool landmark image.
