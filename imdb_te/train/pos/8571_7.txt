It is better than the first live movie 101 Dalmatians, a very good "sequel". It has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and all right slapstick! <br /> <br /> Cruelella devil has two major treatments, they are now a lover of dogs and they are very kind to them. Most people, including Chloe Simone, do not believe in one of the dogs that Crule once tried to kill. Others believe that Kevin Shepherd (owner of the 2nd Chance Dog Shelter) has changed her. <br /> Meanwhile, Dipstick, his colleague, gave birth to three cute dalmatian puppies! <br /> <br /> Eli Idle Wadillowsworth (Glorious Macau), as Glen Close as Gerard Dorardius as Le Pen and Le Pelt (another Badie, where he gave a clue). , This excitement and our more good family image !! A bust of this film has a very painful slapstick, but the last film is not too much. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
