Recently I saw Judy with a 54 version of the film, but when I congratulate the story and music, the film failed to get my attention. I thought '76 Reebok was the same story, except with Barbara Twist. I was pleasantly surprised - it has a more realistic and modern look at fame, money, love and its price. This version is very good, '54 is better than one, good music, good acting, more gripping plot, and, of course, a deep love. The previous film did not understand why it was in the top 100 list of the American Film Institute, but this silkwagon remake fails to make a mark on any critics list.
