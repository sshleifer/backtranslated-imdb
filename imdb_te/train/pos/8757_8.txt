I love movies that do not provide the distinctive "happy ending", which is my main reason for my will. Alice Marano (Dance) and her best friend Darley (Beckinsale) were arrested in Thomas. The film is anticipated whether the audience (or any) of the audience participated, and Bill Pullman is a solid workforce as perfect as their moral advocate. Jacqueline Kim turns into a magnificent show of his kind, great wife, yon, also an advocate. I wish the girls were being abused in prison, as the girls, as another commentator suggested, as I've heard that Thai prisons are very cruel. When this film took place, it ended. Alice has been sentenced to 96 years of age, and Dorren is forgiven and we realize that both (the audience) are innocence. At the end of the film, any film that takes my expectation earns extra points with me, and this well-drawn play is definitely worthy.
