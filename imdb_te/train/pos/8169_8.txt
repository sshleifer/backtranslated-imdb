This is a gory mess and pretty convincing. Corbin Burnson is in the possession of the film, which is his slick role of practices suffering from fraudulent control. Linda Hoffman plays his cheating wife and is very easy on her eye - unfortunately for her, the small "tryst" pool brings a serious punishment in the best way to know the best physician person - that's pretty shameful about the smile! The last half an hour of the film is completely lost by Bernstein's role and a spotlight on the young actress known as the Virgin Keane. As the most talented actress, she is very impressed with the moment she's gone. Nice legs too!
