Supranos is probably the last performance of the 90s. Its tragedy, if it's not on TV, is the best performance on HBO, everything you have to think about, it's brilliant. The cast is amazing. Tony (James Gondolphini) is a great actor and his role is amazing, as well as with others. Each character was flawed, allowing them to be realized and allowing viewers to connect with them and this has long been a reason for it to last. The last episode is good, and I can not understand that many different things can be interpreted as well, but Tony does not die, but the ground goes and sitting with them and blackout is just a suspense. How do I feel like going to Tony's trial and hopefully dead ... Live sopranos and tony sopranos .......
