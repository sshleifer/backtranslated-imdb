The 'special effects' and technical specifications of the film may actually be ridiculous to some, and I have just seen it at the age of 8, which I can not remove from my youth and captivating images ever since. The story of this girl's survival and the trials she suffered has been with me all this year and I have been thinking more than one occasion about how the girl has made it in many circumstances than what I see. <br /> The fact is, the first time I saw it was the reason behind my high rating of this film. Every time I was on television on the television in the 70s and 80s, I would start off with the TV that I can not explain in every scene. Suppose I see it as an adult for the first time (and with a smile in the world). <br /> <br /> I have shown this film to my son. <br /> <br /> Many of the other movies are not for everyone. If you are impressed by the fairytale human survival stories, the Peru / Machu Picchu and / or Amazon are partial, then I believe that you can enjoy this film until I have enjoyed the last 30 years.
