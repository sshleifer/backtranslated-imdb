This Chinese film is very similar to members of my culture, not of me and is far apart. Almost in Buddhism, it helps one of the characters in relation to each character and with the pleasure of simpler simple tasks. <br /> All the actors are excellent, and Zhu Huju manifests the grace and knowledge, yet harm and average. Er Min, retarded brother, we are not equipped with wisdom and wisdom and knowledge comes from the most unequal people of this universe. <br /> <br /> Another China, which is far from the Chinese reality, and has a lot of humanity and realism. <br /> Get it. Do not be disappointed.
