I saw this movie in the Hallmark Channel and thought it was wonderful since it's based on the real person. Pierce Brosnan is very good as a single English man who took the personality of half the gray owl. Photography is beautiful. <br /> <br /> The film has further investigated Archie Bellani as a gray cow called Gray Cow. I want to read a lot about him. I do not know that Richard Attenborough is directed. But I'm not surprised. I like all the films whether he is acting or directing it. I gave the highest rating. <br /> <br /> I would like to see you in the movie about why you cared about this guy. <br /> You showed only two cows and his room in his room. If you like me and enjoy a beautiful story without listening to foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes, this is wrong with the picture.
