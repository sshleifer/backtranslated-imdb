"Holes" is my all-time favorite movie! So far I have seen this movie three times in theaters and I look forward to buying this upcoming September DVD. After watching this movie, I read this book and am surprised at how the book and the film are. The film director made a great job of re-creating the book. In addition, the nominated actors played the role of their characters, particularly the role of Mag Kusz Zigzag. Participants in this film are good, it's a real win! 10 out of 10 stars, I definitely recommend to see everyone!
