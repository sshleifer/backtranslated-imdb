Who knows who can get a copy of this picture !! I'm looking for too long, someone to help! Back in 1997 my friends and I were extra on this long island based movie, and we never actually got to see it. <br /> I'd like to find some copy. I finally check it out and share it with the girls! Can i stop crazy driving? (Also, if it is in VHS format, it does not matter I'm still in the ice age.) If you, or someone you know, please help copy the image, I'm ready to pay a good copy!
