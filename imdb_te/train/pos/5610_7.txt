The same distinction in the same approach to Roman Polans has dictated this distinction. <br /> <br /> I can not yet imagine an honest actress, even though I do not agree with the best director at Li Lottaire, and the two episodes may not be satisfactory to most parts of the Diptic, and I have included. <br /> <br /> When the polygon revolves around a mental instability, the self-assurance is a bit lacking, and ultimately makes the intrinsic torture of his characters (Deneuve and Littaire himself himself in Lepette). The rigorous test for characters and audiences is really uneasy from the horror and tension of horror films because there is no extraordinary superhuman element here. Horror films allow some kind of catharsis (cheap or more elaborate), but Paulens is seriously harassing us, and if his dark work is permanent in his last work, our nerves are far from the edge of our positions. <br /> <br /> Suspense and horror, all of them playing audience expectations (alternately cheating and fulfilling), not literally with people's nerves. Rosemary's baby was a great success in my book because very psychedelic and plain rationality was in constant struggle: the story moved into a strange flat, but we were forced to identify with a unique character. If all of the fantasy elements are in the hearts of the heroes, the situation is very uncomfortable, because the audience is pressured to judge him, and we deny him, protecting him ("painted" NBA ").
