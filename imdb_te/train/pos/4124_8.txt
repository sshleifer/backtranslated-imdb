Mike Nelson and his boat Lloyd Bridges are all stars of this range. It's great for me when I watch it, it's a real feeling that you go underwater. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this program, the subject of the scene shows scuba diving from the person who looked like academic pro Mike Nelson. There were excellent performances, and the program always seemed to produce well. True, the play in the script sometimes has the same notes in 1 episode, but each show is owned by other shows produced by the baby of American television in this era.
