'Stanley and Iris' show the victory of the human soul. For Stanley, it is a struggle to become literate and realize his ability. For Iris, this is a vow and then the courage to love again. The aesthetics of the film Robert Dinero and Jane Fonda work together, dance and start, before everyone is fully confident and courageous and courageous. In this way, it gives a good idea of ​​how life is related, and it is reliable. Unlike some other critics, I keep each letter consistent with the overall picture. Supporting actors were also carefully selected, and they added the depth of the character that was added to the main characters assisted performances. All in all a wonderful picture. The best thing I can take from it is Hope.
