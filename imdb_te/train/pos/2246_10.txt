The amazing surprise of the Spanish cinema. I never thought Jardi Mollah was such a great director, after all, I did not pay much attention to his choice of movies. But this film is certainly not predictable at all and is not predictable ... something I always enjoy! I did not really feel it was a good press and I do not really think it would ever be released in the US market. We still need to be content with DVD or VHS ... I want to say a lot about the story because I do not like to spoil it for you, but mainly about the movie homeless drunk he is a new messiah for kicks and some money (and so much like that) , Before he learns of it he is a life prodigy Ipoyadu.
