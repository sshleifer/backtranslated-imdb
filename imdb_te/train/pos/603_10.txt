The music of Albeniz expanded the film. Once and for a time it did not play with the original equipment (eg piano, but the full orchestra), but often it is reworked with many contemporary groups (eg gigur) and treatments (eg jazz piano). The music of the film is only occasionally: music is often set for various dances, often flamenco, but not always. I do not think there are 14 seats in 14 seats, they are not united by a plot. All the scenes will reach the viewer a person. About half reached climax in my case, although all the rest is very fine in their own way. Those who worked for me embraced me in a painful carnal diet. In fact, the final scene loudly cried out. And in the most magical way you will bring deep into Spanish culture. If you do not like the subtitles, do not worry. Although each scene has a title of Albeniz's part, the movie is actually a vocabulary. Although my complaint with this very beautiful picture is sharp, none of the solar images are available on DVD in the USA. I'm here in particular the Flamenco version of "Carmen," but not the art of the art available in Europe (not played on American DVD's American DVD players). This is a scandal.
