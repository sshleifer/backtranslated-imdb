In life, once hoods, always hoods, and no one can get out of it free or in life. Hoodlums drugs in New York, New York, sell and scams, because it can not be manufactured in a legitimate world because they have a crime history or medication habit, or because they are lazy. The simplest narrative with a few shots about the most unpleasant characters causes their mainstream players from the audience to audiences because their mutual trust and compassion. The film was directed, directed, directed and directed by Laurence Fishburn, 20/20 Mike (featuring nicknames for all hoodlums), based on his game, 'Riff Raft'. From the beginning to the end there is a game, especially in the longest scene, who will decide who will trust three major players. It often comes out very fast, much faster than the dialog stage, and I feel the film's biggest error. Poems from the street combine in flashbacks throughout the film, this type of Ibbal pentameter rap, the violent and bright world of the film. Poetry makes these people harder to remove, murders, fraud and betrayal to one another, lack of our attention or our contempt. The worst thing about this film is that this realism only shows these people, but how are they suffering for the same reasons? One of the most stupid, junky, and finally conscientious is when one of the spectators wonders, or laughs at those who seek to beg him to jokes in the middle of his death.
