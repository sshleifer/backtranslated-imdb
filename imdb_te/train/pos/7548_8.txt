Little, but for a long time, a very wild tour to watch the cat soup. One day, I was looking for an on-demand list of anime section and it came across, and decided to see it. I spent the whole time sitting at the core with my jaw Agape. The whole time I was vacant of thought, or shouting it had a fleeting one "Turn Off !!!". But I did not. In fact, I am happy. <br /> The animation is excellent. Very artistic, odd and dark. <br /> A young boy - well, the cat - his sister goes in search of soul In the first half she was ill on the bed, and soon paid by a visit from a terrible reaper. Her soul is divided in half. <br /> <br /> When the rest of the movie is lost, the cat returns to the boy. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film has lost me honestly. I think they will go back, and their world ... maybe slowly falling? This may be because the world's armies have few steps in the rest of the world. First there are big floods, and then it will dry up in the desert in the desert, then everything is frozen (thanks to what you see as God or the fate). Then I believe that I will find the sister's spirit in the form of orange. After that, the whole world disappears. <br /> If it looks like random scenes, if you look at it adequately, I'm sure it has a deep message behind it. Some research. Personally, I LOVE the trippy stuff like this, and would love to spend time doing it to understand it. But for some people it's not their tea cup. It comes in very unpleasant, so if you like your straight forward anime, this is not a picture for you. If you have the open mind, I highly recommend this film.
