"Most of us live in a virtual world that is at least in the world, conditions of the world, the world of disarray, the safest place in the world ... With that words, Mr." "The Max" is a fascinating world that combines the world with fantasy and reality. Inspired by Sam Kitt's comic books, not only in the story of "The Maxx", it is also very confident about the material that has been inspired in graphic style, the surreal and unique appearance of the show that looks like these funny pages. But the story is interesting and fun .In some cases, it becomes very strange, but when you enter it, it is hard to get out of it. The story and the characters have been greatly developed. The music goes perfectly with the style of this show and gives the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many good animated shows, this is small. "The Max" Must See. This is one of my all time hobbies.
