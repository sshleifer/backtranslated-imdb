Hunky Geordie Robson Green Oven Springer, a young physician who is moving to Manchester to be near his father. Likewise, he has fallen to his senior to Anna 20 years and is the wife of his new boss Richard Crane. Despite warnings from his new colleagues, Owen takes her to Anna, Anna and Fraud until Richard's marriage is suppressed. This is a romantic drama with a very humorous nature and quick wit. The actors were magnificent: the green fraudulent and warm-hearted oven of "The Student Prince" and "Touching Evil" was pictured on the screen; Yannis of "Doon" fame is hilarious and proves to be a good match with Green; Kitchen, "King To Play" from Richard, his comic mysties, and his skill of snowberry, has the right to be concerned about things like creating hate for the oven. This is a perfect love triangle, and despite the deceits and frauds of our three characters, you will stay away from knowing and watching them.
