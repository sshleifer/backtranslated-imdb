I'm not a Steve Karel fan, but I like this film about Don, who ends up falling in love with his brother's girlfriend, an adviser who goes to her parents 'home and goes to her parents' home. Its story is told earlier, but it does not. Bits that are too small must be better than that image. The cast is fantastic, and Karel Tea is my cup, but he knows everything is different but is different from his wife and sometimes it's a wonder in life. In witty and wise times, when the troublesome hallmark card is, the film is still on you and is much higher than the running of the mill motion. Worth a look
