I realized that this is a very enjoyable Muppets film because it is very light and has the best comic delivery in most of its parts. Muppets try to sell the original music they wrote on Broadway, but they face common problems along with Kermit's memory loss. Although there are not so many great camos in the original "Muppets Movie", there are a few, including Jon Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Only the timing and delivery of most songs is great, and the conditions that appear in the Muppets are happy. The original songs are also good here, and the end is satisfying. There is not much to say about the film, but the Muppet fans must look perfect. This is a ridiculous Muppet movie and it is great fun to all. <br /> <br />
