I saw the film as a teenager. The songs were a huge success but Elite Class Govinda left the films, then Govinda and Karisma (aka Karizma) were not related to the class, however these series of films took place in the 90s and most of them were successful After a long time I was watching again and I was I have made a song for them for a long time and the riot they created. Govinda and Karishya's outfit in the late 90s were greatly appreciated by Karisma (the worst dressing duo at the time) but Govinda was still very confident about her dress appearance The designer is the same ... but it all combines it all back to good .. All the work and slowly the upper class realized what fun it was not and do not look back. This is a pair of series that makes that Indian carry in the series. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good time without renting or watching TV I do not think you will regret it ... but remember that <br /> <br /> "Love is stupid and exclusively Made by their kings ... I recommend to all lovers of the film unsuitable for udu definitely do it ...
