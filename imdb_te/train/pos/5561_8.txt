Okay, this film is going to appeal to specific audiences; <br /> If this is one of these films, this film is mandatory. In fact, I think the head shops are obliged to sell a copy of their first bang. The holy grail of Moti Python is for geeks and intellectuals, so the film is pathet. I first saw this film 10 years ago, every time I see it, I will still break. <br /> <br /> The fun-filled cat head lifestyle and jokes are more fun than the daytime beats like a half-baked effort. <br /> <br /> There is no plot to talk; The film is a part of many skeletons collection; As the movies revolve around Los Angeles in their epic fog of prophets. Despite this, the film has a fantastic sense of pace and does not pull all of them. <br /> <br /> Many people have cited the good work of C & C, but I must say that the next movie is superior. <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for an hour and half belly laugh, tune, and let your mind float away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and free Tommy CHong!
