This was the first time when I was broadcasting on BBC 2000 when working on the UKAD 2000AD in 1988. I recorded and recorded it in my Paul Steve Park House VHS. Until this time, I really saw Shah Bros. Kung Fu movies, with their tough lighting (the audience could clearly see these movements), so I thought it was revealed to me that Ridley Scott got out of Hong Kong. <br /> It's also my first exposure to all smoky, re-exposed exterior and prestigious special effects (stop-motion?). (Also pronounced "chia hook"). The heart of the Chinese Hohhast Story is a simple and moving love story in a Hong Kong movie, Leslie Cheung's extraordinary acting talent (a tragic, sad tragedy in life!) And beauty of Joey Wong. The johi granted is brilliant, but her ballistic hand gestures are difficult to analyze her portrayal of romanticism. <br /> <br /> Joey is now at the age of 20 (no worry, what's not in us?) This is always the eternal prestige of the actress. <br /> <br /> Here are some critics of the film that are simpler, no surprises, but they are not true of this film based on the popular Chinese story written around Pu Songling around 1700! That is a bit like the complaint that Romeo and Juliet ends up with the speculative and just copies with the WEST SIDE STORY. <br /> <br /> For me, Chinese Ghost Story Quentinational Romantic Tale. This is a very tragedy, because we know that Cheo Sin and Sin Sean have never been together. This is mature, because no one of us can mature until we have suffered great loss. It's about sacrifice, an important part of True Love for sacrifice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Trying to view this through the filtration of Western culture, enjoy the Chinese Ghost Story and you'll be fine with it. .
