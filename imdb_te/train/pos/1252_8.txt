I have never had any endless boundaries of our kind of irrationality. This really astonishing story is compelling, well documented and angry with frightening abuse and largely unwanted populations. As an American, I was constantly humiliated by the behavior of my country and it is only one of our longest catalogs of international maladies. We're dying. This was probably the first John Pilger documentary I had seen, but it made it immediately want to see what he had done. My only complaint is, and because I gave this film 10 to 8, Pilger shows us this mockery and terrible contribution to the US and UK governments, we demand that viewers / citizens are complicit in our own inaction ... but there is no indication of help. I do not know Britain, but it's almost impossible for the Americans to take part in their government jobs. A gesture in the right direction may help the islanders.
