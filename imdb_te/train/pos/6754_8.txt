Director Otto Primingser is ready for this harsh and thunderous film Noir with Dana Andrews and Jean Thurney with his Laura stars: Where the Sidewall Ends. The film has a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected turns, and brilliant dialogues and great camera moves and dark and sandy film noir lighting. Dana Andrews was detective as Mark Dickson, some of the criminals and some police personnel and criminals are physically harsh. After a case, he sees Dixon for suspects and answers, and gets more involved than he desires. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is the best in his role - tough and experimental, Andrews Dixon is ready to cope with all of their important things if they get to his bad side. He is the perfect film Noir anti-hero - he's not all right at all time, but we still root him. Jean Tirney has a solid job in her role, a sweet shoulder for dickson. Tearney's role may not be too much, but she can do the role of others, and she certainly states that she can smile in the eye, smoother and twinkle every member of the audience. Supporting cast is not too bad - Carl Malden is the most memorable, entering in and giving good support to Lt. Thomas. Ends aside is not a laura, but it is a great movie noir filled with great characters, story and pictures.
