Despite Disney's best efforts, this is a rather enjoyable picture of your dreams. I was surprised that it did not strike me as much sentiment; This film is fine. Dennis is very good in Quaid, which tells something for a sporting image. I can not remember that many sports movies have small quirks that trouble me. Here, everyone looks like episode. The film is surprisingly good, and I would expect a surprising business as it is a G-rated film that needs to stop the viewer from thinking. Ebert contrasted, this film was a success.
