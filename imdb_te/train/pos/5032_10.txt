The movie "Ferrille" is a mental thriller than a horror film. It is a horror film that has all the trappings but it is not. <br /> <br /> "Weakness" is about the perception of religion and the differences between right and wrong. <br /> <br /> In "Failati", middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons are God's work. It turns out that they are a trilogy of serial killers called "God's hands." We see his sons convinced that they are doing God's work and see what they are doing and that fathers will kill "giants" in some cruel ways. He said that he had received a message from an angel who had given specific instructions to eradicate demons living on earth. God gave him a list of names and replaced his "services"; He and his sons are given protection, which is basically not the police can capture them. We'll unfold all of this before us in a very unexpected manner. But it's really disruptive about the two sons, especially the older son Adam. Adam himself makes it suspicious of the existence of a supreme existence, which would make changes in his father and cellar during the week. He knew his father had clearly lost his mind and that's exactly what is happening to his younger brother, Fenton. Fenton, the other half of this puzzle, takes everything if his own religion. He seems to be trapped in the world of his father and god of the devil. I think this is because he is very young and easily influenced. But all these three things are convincing, of course, convincingly. <br /> <br /> The events in the film can be seen as a clear illusion of the three main characters. I say this because everyone is reflecting the situation in different ways and at one point in the picture they will see each other. Dad first sees murders as his mission. His "mission" will ultimately cost him and move into the siege as soon as demolition is eliminated. In fact, his illusion is important. His "orders" and the list of names he received are all in this hallrayal. Look at the scene where Dad found the ax in a barn to determine where I came from. Fenton, the youngest son, the demons and the devastation have easily impressed this debate. As he is very young, it is easy to fall into the trap of his father. Adam and the other are very suspicious of his father's actions. <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** ********************************************* (I can not tell you how or under what circumstances ). But I say it is not pleasant. After his death, it has been the fastest forward to today. (The story that old-fashioned Adam saw through Adam's eyes, is said by flashback). In fact, it tells the story of Fenton, believing that it is not actually Adam. This story was told by his actions and through his brother's actions. Fenton was frowned and the FBI agent continued to do what he had begun doing in his bait. <br /> <br /> The religion is a major theme, so understand how easy it is for religion to understand it incomprehensible. Even before Dad found out his new mission, he did not have a clear understanding of religion himself or he believed in the supreme creed. His sons Fenton and Adam often sang the churches of innocent children, but the understanding of literature is not clear. Following the revelation of Dad's newest mission, they departed in two different directions - Adam Fenton was suspecting his father's madness and being the highest. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
