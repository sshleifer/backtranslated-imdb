It is again pleasure to see such creativity on TV. This performance is poetic, artistic and good fun. The characters are very well connected and the writing is not bad (I think they will improve as they get their legs). <br /> <br /> In this series girls have stolen the show so far. Chuck like Olive is adorable. These two moths are happy. <br /> <br /> As they are magic, they hope to write in large parts. <br /> <br /> All the news is fine enough to print. Make a large bowl of your popcorn and enjoy something in the old shape. This is for adults. It sounds like a suss.
