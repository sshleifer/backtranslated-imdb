Excellent. <br /> <br /> Communist Lensing of Amrit Pritam and Dr. Dwivedi's nationalist film was originally thought to be more frank than the novel but I was surprised to learn that it was reverse when I read this novel. <br /> <br /> <br /> The splendor of Maratha Pritam is not meant for pseudo-second and Dr. Dwivedi. This film tends to be sensitive to sensitive material. As some poets say, there are no accidental women in any war, and this picture reveals. Hinduism does not stand against the kidnappers in mind, and the Hindu brother is the only tragic commentary on the Hindu brother. On the other hand it shows why financial angles behind the partition or kidnapping girls in the first place actually. I think kidnappers are kidnapped by the girls they will become legal owners of houses and therefore the new government. Houses can not ask them for a return. Apart from this, the courage of Purohit's and his wife's characters is to salute the girls, who are both incompetent village girls who are out of the world and try to return after abductors and girls who hurt each other. <br /> <br /> A woman does not have to be surprised to understand other women's pains.
