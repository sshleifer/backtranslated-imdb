More TV movies should be made this way. When I first saw it in '93, I saw it again. Both Helen Hunt and Steven Weber gave both spectacular, very awkward and realistic performances. Weber is particularly good, turning out to be exceptionally creepy and poorly functioning like a child cholesterol / killer. This film really boosted my respect for my actress for Hunt. The director also directed "Hooyers", which is somewhat formulaic and exciting. But both of these directors have the same full, simplistic reality. If you like the imaginative and uninterested TV movies, you can see it. The main story about Hunt and Phehe's affair is also appealing without removing from the main story.
