In the City Film Series book The Films of Gene Kelly, Anchors Avig is described as the king of a musical armor. I can not do better than I do. This is an important film in the career of Jean Kelly and Frank Sinatra. <br /> <br /> Louis B. Meyer has given Columbia a gene Kelly where Harry Connie has inspired Kelly to let her own numbers, and because of that, the cover girl has become a classic. If the mayor did not learn a lesson, producer Joe Panstock did and Kelly allowed artistic control. When Anchors Aweigh finished, Fred Astier finally had an opponent to dance to the cinema choreographer. <br /> <br /> Here is the main figure with Jean Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse for everyone. Originally Kelly wanted to do Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse number, but Disney did not give Mickey anybody. Mickey Roger is waiting for a movie outside the Rabbit Who Framed Who Fram. MGM is not concerned about being in its own animated rodent Tom and Jerry's team. <br /> <br /> Like Fred Astier, Kelly dancer has tried to do something new and different. For the next dozen years, these two artistic controls are permitted and the films are praised for their work even when they do not smile. Kelly for MGM, inspired every one of Astaire's and other studios for MGM. Anchors Aweigh, Kelly had a bit dance synthra. Frank Sinatra has always credited Gene Kelly to show him how to show him any musical story for his help in Bert Lancaster and Montgomery Clifts. From Help to Eternity. <br /> <br /> When Frank Sinatra bought MGM from RKO half of his contract, he insisted on a small artistic creativity on his own. He is friends with Jule Stainay and Sammy Kahn's songwriting team. In his autobiography, Sammy Kahn Sainatra insisted that he would write his songs for the film. Louis B. Meyer gave the team some good words to sing and sing him. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I Love to Love Easily. Frank pursues himself in the piano at the vacant Hollywood Bowl. It is Sinatra at his best. <br /> <br /> <br /> With Juy Stainy and later Jimmy von Hussein, Sammy Kahn acquired the title for reading more song lyrics than any other person in Frank Sinatra's mouth. <br /> <br /> They say a song can be written using the chromatic level on the Stenny and Kahn stakes. When Katherine Grayson placed his soprano to work on a soul of a sutton my heart sings, they proved to be anchors innovation. She also made some traditional numbers. <br /> The fact is based on the singing plot here. The two sailors will go in contact with Catherine Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell. She says that she can get an audition with Kelly Jose Irubbie, who is trying to solve her with Sinatra. They are trying to achieve this film. My only disappointment in the anchor innovation is that Pamela Britton, who played as a waitress' Brooklyn, never had her. She played Meg Brooke in Bridgown, Broadway, earned her reviews from her show and took her to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Anchors Aweigh is a great example of how not to make musicians. The creative talent is in agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. If the market value is to be paid for it, the cost may be withdrawn to some third world country debt. <br /> <br /> But the results of the film are phenomenal.
