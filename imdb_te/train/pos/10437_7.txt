It's a slow-moving story. No action was taken. No crazy suspense. No sudden surprises. If you're refusing to talk and walk about two people, do not waste your time and money about the story that slowly develops about Lovely-Dove Romas and so on. <br /> On the other hand, if you're going into the dialogue, it's your image after finding a master story, thinking of thoughts and real love in the fabric of life. The pace, music and entire tone of the film can be placed in the Woolgade Mood, because when you are very alert, you would recommend viewing this film. It's really amazing. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawk and Julie Delpy sometimes suffer from their habits but gratefully, the chemistry acting between these two turns out to be very natural, warm and mild. <br /> <br /> There are wonderful comments on many topics that will stimulate the idea and conversation between you and your partner in their conversations. I feel very deep and very different, but I will underestimate their intelligence. <br /> <br /> The whole story that makes this movie so appealing is easy. In the end it is power. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: slow. The dialogue is attractive. The story grows reliably, systematically and genuine. It's satisfying and ending to build up to the end.
