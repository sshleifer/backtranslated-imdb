There is no doubt about it just a great movie. Amitabh, Akshay, Sheffield, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal is a great story and amazing performances. The Hindi film industry is not shy with Mallika and Co, the film is totally obscure and has therefore failed to become an idiot in our Indian society. But the message and concept of the film is absolutely fantastic. An Malik (boring copy-cat) can be avoided and can be used as an Ismail darbar or Himmesh Rchemia musician. I think Vipul Shah gave a small Gujarati touch in music. An april musician around An Malik and he thinks of Popstar but this is not a movie to be there - he looks good with Govinda style songs. I thought this film was more memorable with some good song music with a pair of good ghazals or mournful songs.
