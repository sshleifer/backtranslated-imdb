I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon, and Waffles are different cats, but they are collectively referred to as "brothers". I often try to imitate the sad tone of their butler, Howe's, or Gordon's Scottish Bargons tired. There should be more episodes about Human Kimberly. Episode is a delightful classic about the pre-teen girls' cats to get Kimberley's sleeping party to get their favorite drinks, Routeber's thirst for feet. We can not drink RouteBerry in our home now without having a kitescroach vocals or 'Slap Shot' movie by Hanson Brothers. Future classic. Where can I find the first two seasons on DVD?
