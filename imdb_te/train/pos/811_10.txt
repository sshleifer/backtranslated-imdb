When I think of Jedi Return of Epic, think epic. Yeah Yeah what's there? They are adding an interesting interest to the film (they are similar to the Vitkanca, which can be technically sophisticated with the oldest actions). Jedi is definitely more dark about the rest of the movies. Emperor Palapatin (played by the wonderful theater actor Ian McDiramid) is the best episodes of the film. Pulpatine is very bad and sad, Mr. Rogers will be compared to him. Talking about Darth Vader, what a wonderful end to such a trend. Wader is really a modern day Greek tragedy and I think people can now understand and appreciate the moment after coming out of Sith's Revenge. At the end his redemption moves and really brings you a happy yet bittersweet feel. The best part is of course the special effects. It's a picture from the early eighties and still looks a time-test with graphics. The panoramic view of the palace of Jabba (Leah looks magnificently in the metal bikini) and ultimately the epic is still fantastic to see a three-way battle. The ending of JD's deepest story and emotional moments (mainly when Luk Wader and Pulpatine is out to Leah and Lekha is revealed to Leah) and the spectacular Special Effects is one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history.
