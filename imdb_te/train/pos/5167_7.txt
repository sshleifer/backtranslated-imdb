I say the worst part of the film is the first half hour. Who was really confused about who was. For example, the role of Bill Paxson has long hair and wearing a jacket. Then, when all the men came to the camp, it was a character that looked like Bill Paxson, but not. Where am I Bill Paxson Then there's a guy with his girlfriend. He was 21 years old. It is the 20th anniversary of Camp Director's (Alan Arkin) renowned. Later, this girl was talking and talking about her camp experiences. That does not mean it. She was one year old. That movie is great. Kevin Pollock is always a good man. One man ended up losing a full nursing, and his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was an old-fashioned camp director who admitted he was close to modern youth. The best part is that no one of the camped camps has succeeded in life. No one of them has a great career. It appeared in real life. The film is compared to The Big Chill. In some ways it's not as exciting as the Big Chill, but it's very realistic. So, even though the beginning is not guaranteed, the picture is out to turn into a pretty good one.
