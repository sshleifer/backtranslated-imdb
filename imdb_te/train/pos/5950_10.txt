This movie is great. This plot is true for an authentic book written by Mark Twain. Hank begins with a scene where Hank starts singing a group of children called "removing your toe on the moon", which reminds me of a memoranda of Sinatra song High Hopes, which is fun and exciting. The music is great throughout and my favorite song is King, Hank (Bing Crosby) and Sir "Sagi" Saga. OVerall is a great family film or a great date movie. It's a repeat film. The Princess who played Rhonda Fleming is gorgeous. I love this movie !! If you like Danny Kayne in the Korni Jester then you will definitely like this movie.
