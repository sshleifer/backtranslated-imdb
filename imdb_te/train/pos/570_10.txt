Strangely, I saw the film for the first time after 13 years of release of the film. It's a story associated with any father or brother ... A brother is a bit 'wild,' the other brother is the normal old child. Craig Shepher is an abomination as an older brother, but Pitt is an outstanding, and Schritte is perfectly paternal. Fishing scenes shot in Montana are entirely breathtaking ... I do not know that fishing fly is very attractive. The film follows the film, which is only a few changes to make it more suitable for a motion picture format. This is a dimension, not a lot of books for movie stories. It's a perfect image for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional image.
