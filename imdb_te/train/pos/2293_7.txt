This is very, very early bugs bunny cartoon. As a result, the character is still in a transitional period - he is not pulled as later and his voice is not quite right. In addition, chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a little unusual. Elmer has a poor SAP who buys bugs from a pet shop - no gun or desire to bunny burst! However, despite this, it is still a very enjoyable movie. Early bugs were definitely more sassy and ruthless than his later incarnations. In later films, he was perplexed with Elmer, Yosemite Sam and others because they started it - they confused the rabbit. However, in the film, he was like Daffy Duck at the beginning of the last 30s and 40s - just a boy who was annoying others! The next "cartoon" instead of the heroes of the cartoons. This is not among the best bug bunny cartoons, it is definitely fun to watch and it's interesting to see how much he has changed over the years.
