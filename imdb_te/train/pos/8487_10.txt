I remembered looking at "gong ho" as a child with my mother, and wondered why she would always cry in the last few minutes. I, of course, found the whole picture hilarious, especially the habit of the characters. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Geddy Watanabe are shining in the role of reluctant men. Keaton will not marvel me with his real-life style line delivery, and Watanabe adds humor and mourning to the mix. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> The film is one of the least underestimated films in the 80s. The film can learn lessons from the merger of American and Japanese workers ... sometimes you really have * "the best of the worlds". Now I understand why my mother did in the closing times. I am one of those cards.
