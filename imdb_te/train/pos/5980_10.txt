This is really my favorite movie in advance. There is no need to explain to each one ** hole. I am literally increased the metal horror masterpiece of the 80s, badly edited, showing 'boom stick', having these practically bloodless, cheesy, lame effects. The director (I listened) wanted to succeed at the box office, so that he could do sequels and himself had a FREDDY / Jason type contract. Damn, I wish I had gone down like that! Soundtrack Banging '. Acting is good ... Check this source. And there's no die hard fans out there, feel free to email and chat some time. Midgorgour ... I can look at YAHOO.
