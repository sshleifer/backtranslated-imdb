I remember watching this movie, the idea was very interesting. I wanted to know what really happened. I was so impressed by the 8 minutes. We start at school yard. . Two friends talk about crossing class. Kid Ai kid kip "Let's go to class today." And the kid claims a decline, they could not really miss something important. So the kid goes to a class of skips and kid. When he arrives there, the only and most important lesson they learned is today. They will learn the meaning of life. She gives each one a tract, and when she comes to her baby, she runs and tells the boy next to her to share. Well, the kid does not share, so Kid seeks for a teacher. When he finally finds herself, he is surprised by what the real meaning of life is. I suggest everyone to see this small one. It only takes about 8 minutes for your life, but the message is very important, it helps you get a lifetime.
