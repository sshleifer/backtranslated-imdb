What are all negative comments? After watching this movie for the first time tonight, I can only say that any single lone man is definitely a good holiday comedy. Drew (Ben Affleck) I would spend the holidays alone, and I wanted to cry. If you want to know why you should watch the movie. Also, if you liked Tom, James Gondolnny and Alicia (Cristina Applegate), even if you asked me, they were real snacks. However, this film made me smile and feel good inside. Before I close, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell has hit a pure holiday. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this good holiday comedy exactly to brighten any single lone guy in Christina Applegate fan who has not seen any Ben Affleck or it.
