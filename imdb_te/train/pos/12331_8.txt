Being on the eighth night Night Live Dead list, I love to save the film against all of her first five favorite films at all times, and at the same time loving this student movie simulation, the worst reviews I have posted previously. This little but sweet work always cheers the audience in horror and science fiction film marathons, where attendees have a love for the genre, and zombie movies are not very intense. This film is not original, it is not a shame. It is meant to be funny, and many others who I hear the hymn and who applaud it with me to succeed. Especially for those who have seen NOTLD 50+ times. See the director Kamon News reporter Jeff Drexel, and if you can get his foreign parody, Laugh.
