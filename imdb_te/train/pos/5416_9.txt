I've only seen it once. <br /> <br /> "I am very young ... but I have strong muscles of Ganga's sacrifice.> How many people I rarely submit to I realized how to use a foreign country In these historic situations, in this film, the friendship of friendship, the friendship of losing friendship, the love of each other, The question is: "who are we first, who are you?" This is a person you know people, family, and homemakers who are familiar with the names of other people, but they belong to different worlds. You have no time to give the correct answer, it is urgent, and it is for life or death. Emotion will increase with the rhythm of the film, until one dies, there is only one life, nothing other than the other fantasies or realities that we can see today, because this death, this particular affair is the life I lived in, I shared my child's friendship with friendship. This is where I lived as a viewer. On that day I always drop Ganga-din. I left behind, and then, my pretty childhood, as I've lived since many worlds ever since. I leave that all for the good and these lines come up today and I have a small visit that I did not expect to do this morning.
