<* Before going back, Evangelion was a gun and hawkster before Ano had been a statue and housewife for many anime fans, and before the Gynox fan came to the rank of fans. At that time, Jainax's honorable voice of wings and famous Otacan shorts, or course, Gunbuster followed some tough actions. <br /> <br /> It is fortunately, Guyon's six-part OAV (Direct Video) series. This is a larger range than this array can be made if it is made into a movie. This prevents it from being too boring and overly long, along with frustrating battles and filler along the way. In addition, they made some effort to be clear from the tested opera mechanics used in macros or gundam and other prominent space operas. <br /> <br /> For a show, Okinawa High School for performances mechapiloting in Norco. The daughter of honorary ship commander who died in the Battle of Noriko, when she was still a little boy. It makes his life harder in the academy, as some fellow colleagues begin to suspect Norco's congratulations to the professors. The first episode is pretty much a bit of a comic drama, writing about the characters and the school's setting. <br /> <br /> Things change quickly to help plan the assembling of an alien invasion, and Norco and Kazumi (the best girl in class). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the middle part of the gun buster is the focus of space, Some of the characters were introduced, and parts of the past of Narco were dragged back. In addition, every minute alien threat is more aggressive, and the ultimate ambition of mankind is demonstrated by gunbuster. The author is smart as Okada, he spies things up a bit, incorporating time-exclusion formulas. In short, the time passes by the speed of light travels slowly. This means that Noriko will be part of a war that takes about a century. Its dramatic appearance, when Norco is looking at his friends back to his base, when looking at those who are older than she is. Science may not be perfect, but it is displayed in a pretty reliable way, along with some SD Science Theater shorts, Norico, Kazumi and their coach provide a short description of the scientific principles used in this series. /> <br /> For a series of animation, made in the 80s, it is absolutely fine. Designs are the retro 80 style course, but it has charm. The animation is clear enough and the character models are fine, but the costumes are cheating. <br /> <br /> A few of the favorite glamorous giants for fans will be thoroughly exploited entirely. Mechas across performances are very pretty cool, with gunbuster as ultimate killing machine, strong and vast. The last episode was completely black and white. It is generally believed to be for budget reasons (but not verified), which gives a completely different atmosphere to the sequence that fits in the sequence. <br /> <br /> Music is the most distinctive space opera fair. Most places are very serious, very simple, and definitely worth the purchase. This is most suitable for the series, but it may be very annoying at times. Tanah was not really a well-known composer, the other honorable series he worked on Dragon Half. <br /> If you think anime music for 80s, you will know what to expect. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, the dramatic change from dramatic to drama opera to the historic battle is slow, but the observer rarely observes this. Step by step draft down, and take the front row of battles. However, the aspect has never been completely abandoned. With the last episode of the view, Noriko and crew are fighting for more human being, and in the final war, some questions are presented to the audience, regardless of the state of the human race in the galaxy and how far this is self-assured. They will never answer again, but they still provide some interesting foods for the idea. The last episode is quite open, with a nice but very predictable ending, all conclusions must have many extremes of course. <br /> <br /> With gunfasts, anonymous anchats, heavy battles, and some personal dramas, the gun buster is the first of your average space opera anime, and the big part is that. But it is exceptionally well done for change. Instead of going to the length of six episodes, a constant mix of predefined sources gives us a transition from a small range of drama to epic heroism. Also we will meet some interesting and very bright characters, which will change the time of mutual relationship to a maximum of time. This program is very strictly written, although it is slipping at some points. Excessive dramatic events and very cheesy mache attacks are easily avoided. Overall, trust ganbuster takes you very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. It may not have broken the boundaries and limitations of space opera genre, but at least a little bit of them. Very enjoyable anime classics, but without errors. <br /> <br />
