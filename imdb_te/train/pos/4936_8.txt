When the pneumonic plague (the variation of the bubonic plague) becomes stronger, the U.S. Public Health Service Officer Dr. Clinton Reid (Richard Widmark) is immediately indifferent to everyone who knows it is near the body. Unfortunately, by being so strongly killed by the murderer, the murderer spreads with the disease that leads to epidemic. <br /> Enter Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to track the killer as soon as possible and remove the possible national catastrophe. <br /> <br /> The panic-quality picture on the Streets, being a little bit and a bit too widely (my reason to bring an eight down score). It moves from Norwich gangster to genres of medical disaster, police procedure, thriller and romance. <br /> <br /> It's not the best work of director Elia Kazan, but it's a bit memorable. Kazan a Streetcar nominated Desire (1951), Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955), a helper responsible for all. The film is ahead of them, but Kazan said he had already "hated" by the studio. That freedom can take a long distance and may be partially considered partial. The film is in the city of New Orleans, where Kazan "was wandering around the night and day, I know very well". He wanted to exploit the environment. <br /> <br /> Kajan performs every kind of panic in Streets well, but they can be connected. Good. The film has benefited from being only one or two of its sentiments. Sprawl still works in terms of setting. The fear in the Streets, writers Edna and Edward Anault, may be part of the chaos by attempting to merge the two stories with writers, "quarantine" and "some like ' The gangster material in the thriller landscape is probably highlighted with an extended chase scene at the end of the film. Surprisingly, Kajan believes that the villains "are more attractive - I love lovers whenever I love Puritan". The latter reaches the title "panic" of the title - attempts to trigger the pest and attempt to disclose them and separate the disease. Although there is plenty of suspense during these two "moods", the film is quite straightforward dramatic, and is typical for that genre. <br /> <br /> Conversation is wonderful throughout. Stylized variation for many modern films is rarely more pronounced. It's clever, quickly and well distributed by each character. Confrontation can not be created by "mute" decisions or smart movements; Events and characters' actions are like a chess game. <br /> When exceptional circumstances took place when pedagogues were stopped from newspapers such as Reed, he gave long-term approaches to his decisions, which argued other characters. <br /> <br /> In this regard, "ownership, religion, moral and middle class murders us all". The idea enters into the film by the commitments made by the leadership, or with the permission from it. For example, if the gangster Blackie (Jack Pallons in his first film role) on the head cooperates to deal with the plague, the "jet free jail free" card is given. <br /> <br /> If the technical elements of the film are not uncommon, fine, but realistic reasons are performances, secret scenes and well-written conversations.
