From any fairy tale, and much of Errol Flynn's best, Istanbul is still going for it. Locations and beautiful technicolor cinematography come back from time to time. Errol Flynn shows his glorious past, Jim Brennan in the past, sees him as a comeback pilot to hunt him. The film is actually a remake of "Singapore" of 1947, and the story looks very amazing and clever by today's standards. Many of the supporting actors in the film went through "movements". Most people compare to Casablanca, the greatest of all times. When looking at this movie, I could see many similarities, but hey, Casablanca inspired countless imitators, so take it for something valuable. At the end, if you are Flynn's fan, or old fashioned love stories, you can see this picture. Otherwise, I would recommend the Casablanca, or the Malt Falcon as a good introduction to some of the Hollywood classic ....
