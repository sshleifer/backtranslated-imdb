Slowenian is a kind of road image on old-fashioned trains in the late summer province. In the beginning you will see a man who is wearing a lingerie from the black cloth, and when the same young man in his black pants left home with two suitcases, you see him missing on a banner in the corpse of the corpse (his father died). In the train he meets a young woman, and almost without words, but many small gestures, a wonderful love story begins. It's a very surreal, very poetic and slightly overwhelming movie with strange characters and strange events. Beautiful pictures with beautiful detail love.
