I have to admit that Holley is not on my watch list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. However, I decided to see that the Artistic Director of the Festival was specially recommended for the audience of 200 people before the presentation of another film. Wow! <br /> <br /> The film deals with a very difficult problem of this child's adultery and is done without any compromise. I'm crying several times during the film and laughing with others. Talked about an emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> The main actor (Thi Nyuian) is a Vietnamese novelist (only 14 years of filming) and has had to overcome this incredibly complex and complex role. She reminded me of the Kaisa Castle-Hughes from Whale Raider, but this role is more demanding because she plays the role of child prostitute. <br /> <br /> The main story is about a girl who sold herself to a prostitute in a brothel in Cambodia by prostitution by her family. She decides to help her after spending some time with a man (played by Ron Livingston in a strong dramatic role that she does not use to see her). At that time, she was selling again and she was searching around Cambodia. The story will change and the turns and the audience can not imagine what's happening somewhere. <br /> <br /> This performance is strong on board with a very interesting international cast. Udo Kier (very convincing as sex tourist), Vargin Ledoyne (touching as a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of his last films). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the case of this difficult issue, the film will focus more on a comprehensive, powerful storytelling. It is filmed in Cambodia (in some actual scenes scenes), which adds to the fact that you are seeing almost a documentary. <br /> <br /> The DP seems to have used a hand-held camera and close-ups, and you seem to be part of the story altogether. <br /> <br /> After the screening, they were all surprised by the audience members. It's not an easy image to watch and I salute filmmakers without making a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> This is the best film I have seen at the Edinburgh Film Festival. My husband and some friends thought.
