I enjoyed this small film. I was always disappointed to watch short films, so I saw that I was nominated for Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards and at the Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, the director, the writer and the actor Nacho Vigilono cinema musical instincts suddenly fall into a song and dance numbers. The result is quite entertaining and the song is really impressive. <br /> <br /> It's a well-made documentary, good editorial and actors doing great work. <br /> <br /> I am going to recommend this film to the end.
