Surprisingly good. The acting was fun, the screenplay was fun, the music cheesy was fun, the plot was morbid fun. It's a pleasant movie to look at and give your brain some rest. I've found the parts of the plot and quotes very creatively. In fact, it deserves to 10 to 10. This can not be compared to an arthouse movie or a bloody slazer image.
