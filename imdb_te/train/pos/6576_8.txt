Comedies often have less real depth and have unfortunate fame. Weapons and man, can prove false. <br /> <br /> At one level, Arms and Man is a successful, and somewhat unique, romantic joke. Young, dramatic, and surface Raina comes from a military family that participates in the war; Her fiancé and her father are military officers. By the arrival of an enemy soldier she will be surprised one night. The incident must be kept secret from his family forever, and the soldier will eventually leave. After the war is over, the soldier will be back, forcing each of the primary characters to review their values ​​and their relationships. <br /> <br /> The sha layers. Commenting on the Shah's structures, he can comment on the absurdity of war and the nature of love. And, of course, he does this within the Shavian wit and a satisfying plot. I have a lot to think about and think about it here. <br /> <br /> "Arms and the Man" is a fun and thought-provoking film, which also has its own relevance today, the first since the first century. Shaw shatters at warfare and popular ideals over love, combining a military satire with the ensemble of love and family. The play witch, witty humor and bitter whites are glossy. Captain Bluntcheli Sergas, a good example of the conversation of the Shah, said: "I am a professional soldier: I'm fighting when I am, and I'm very happy to come out of it when I'm not. There is no reason to believe that a Swiss hotel-keeper's son, Bluntchitch, has no reason to take part in the war and question Shawn's patriotic sentiments. Shah analyzed the whole concept of war and the army from the two elements of war and in the end shows that the feelings in the two camps are not different. <br /> <br /> The dialogue and sarcasm used for simple conversations gripped the gentle guarantee of the story's movement to end a fairy tale of life. The essence of this drama is a comedy, with all the characters happy happy and lovers changing and loving changes. This is still a picture of universal appeal and is still enough when war and patriotism and the feelings of love and marriage are dramatic. As long as love and war are, the "weapons and man" of Shaw must continue its relevance.
