An interesting TV movie based on the fact that he has cheated with one of the main characters of the prisoner. Giovanni Ribby plays his brother, his brother, who has a delicate mission to decide whether his brother should appeal to the court for the death penalty. But when he visits him and enters Elias Kotyas, the problem starts. This is nothing to do with the acting capacity of Kotis. He's just "G.Q." According to the journalist appears to be a prisoner of the proletariat sources, someone who spent a lot of his life behind bars is very advanced with a language. This feeling came to me after meeting me as an old friend, I did not see him for almost 15 years, he spent many Panama jails. The young man I wanted to know was because he had not been older, but for a long time in the infant system. There are prisons and jails, one must, but this "shot in the heart" prisoner is definitely out of this world.
