Alain Chabat argues that the film is his original idea, but in the end it is old enough to forget that the lovely background of Shakespeare is old. <br /> <br /> Chabbat is a "poetry grocery", a happy single and does not want any member of the opposite sex to disturb his life. He has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mum - G7 - who decide to marry him. Delightful, lovely Charlotte Gainsberg and any simple plan. Charlotte Charlotte should be Girlfriend and not just on the wedding day. There is no further discussion about marriage from the G7. <br /> <br /> There are very strong supporting roles as Ginsberg's tight-capped brother from Lafont and mother and Osterman. <br /> <The first Charlotte has charm, then there are some amazing scenes of family rebellion. French Pronto in English.
