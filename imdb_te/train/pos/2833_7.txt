This movie has returned after thirty-seven years. I am eleven years old and have taken this film on South Beach at the Longest Movie Theater in Washington Avenue. In 1969, I thought it was where it was! Very good picture. But now it's not as good as about forty years now. The times have changed, and this movie is now tired of the war between generations and old hash back. It's a memory, however, it's time to catch a place. It is interesting to see mode fashion, old Vegas, a slim dawn rickles, chain smoking and hip opening song. Acting is good, the script is slightly outdated, but the memories are still fresh. It's not where it's for you, but for me, it's still a nice and entertaining trip down the memory lane.
