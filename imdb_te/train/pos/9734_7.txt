<br /> <br /> If you agree, <br /> <br /> If you see a good amount of movies, <br /> <br /> Allison is in the film and with one or the other ... but at the end of the cinema you do not know how ... <br /> <br /> Okay this movie is Simon Pegg.I No other actor can see the role of Sydney No make-up, and I do this for the great performance of the peg is too weak, the image I'm sure! <br /> <br /> <br /> In this movie, the great goggles and jokes of Simon Pegg's Sydney are really laughing ... but I think everyone in the movie is good. For example, Kirsten Dun is very rich in the film Do not think about what Jeff Bridges, Gillian Anderson, and of course the spoiled mad star Fee Maes plays Megan Fox ... great role for her ... <br /> In all, I usually do not agree with IMDb ratings, this time I will totally agree with them ... Go and see this movie, it's really light and positive, and I recommend it deeply ... My rating is 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
