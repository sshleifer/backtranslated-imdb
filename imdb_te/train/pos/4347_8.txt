<br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I am not going to get much details about the plot of the film, as other reviewers have pretty much covered the same ground. The performance of Peter Faulk is the only reason to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Many of the actions in the film are upstate NY in the collapse of a short road trip with Faulk and Paul Riser. <br /> <br /> The story is written with adult minded audience. Plenty of reality-based comedy & give a feeling that some well-played drama film is your own family. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful film that really is a shame, but I can not say enough about this film except that it is very good looking at Falk with a big celebrity character. That makes it a lot. His famous friend & writer / director John Cassavettett proved that he was playing Faulk in his film braking films in the 60s and 70s.
