This movie is great! This rocked my stone cold heart. I can not tell you about the ethnic discrimination that Anthwana experienced in my own country. <br /> <br /> We saw this movie in our Sociology class at New Era University and I do not know this is true, it was created just by the intellectual intention of bringing fresh air into the industry. It's very good. <br /> <br /> Nadine Anthon (only six) was shocked when I was sexually harassed. If I were on his shoes, I would jump into a 10-story high-rise building. <br /> <br /> Antwon finally saw his mother face Eva face. He did not bit her or what, instead she told her about the achievements he had won in the long years he had separated. (I think I'll do it when I get my roots back.)
