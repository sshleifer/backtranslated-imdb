Many years ago I saw this film and this gave me a lasting impression on me. I have worked hard for so many films and have not been able to look at 'California' by seeing it again. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to say that it is every now and then to be ten or so. The first is its cast. The young Brad Pitt as Yard Grace is unsteady to us. Pitt know, as we all do, is one of the most continuous heart-throbs of Hollywood, it is refreshing to see him playing such a vile, unattractive character. <br /> <br /> Juliet is playing the role of Grace's tragic friend as ten years, as well as the role of the character, and at the age of forty years. Lewis (for her character's station) as well as contempt (for her simplicity), but her youth is rarely supported by her performance as an actor rarely seen. <br /> <br /> David Duchevani and Michelle Forbes are both completely unconcerned with the three pairs of traveling across the journey. Personally, I did not nominate Pitt or Lewis for any awards. US with Pit and Louis. Duchovanni was good and simple, and Forbes was stubbornly stubborn and shut, but both actors filmed changes of their characters, they were equally surprisingly, repulsed and strangely attracted to the pit. <br /> <br /> Along with fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting, this film really grabs us with proverb balls through its flawless pacing. At that time "California" was released, Hollywood's good-character-turns-out-of-emotional imagery ('Single White Female', 'Pacific Heights', 'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle', 'Fraud', 'Sleeping With the Enemy' ). Most of these movies followed the same principle, the nature of the relationship between a good man and a bad guy. 'California' is not really far away from this landscape, but its first two acts are the perfect example of a slow-boil thriller, and we are put on the edge of our seats waiting to turn the turn. /> <br /> If the penny is not dropped, and Pitt Maniac decides to play the bad guy, the film will completely change the gears and the last twenty minutes are not up to the rest of the film. The action is going to be thick and suitable for fast and clarity is cool. <br /> <br /> Many story (slightly whiny, pre-X-Files provided to Dakota) provided a tad. Duchovani's journalist argues that it is intended to be a book written by the character, so self-conscious narrative argues that most journalists favor a style of censorship. <br /> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/news/blog-posts/"> </ em> </ Highly recommended, but not the weakness of the stomach or the mind. This film is worse than one. But it's meant to be.
