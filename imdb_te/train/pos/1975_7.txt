It seems that the "Basic Instinct 2" has become fashionable, and the main part of the audience (including critics) appears to be terrible before it was released. Do you know it's more civilized to Sharon Stone's worst? Like all of us? Now fourteen years old, and what? Unlike most of us ?? Still amazing. The first comments on the film were very vulnerable, I had to look for myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not as good as the original film, but it's not as bad as most commentary plays. Michael Cotton-Jones is not Paul Wrohoven, Henry Bean and Leora Barsh is not Joe Essrrassesley. "Basic Instinct 2" is just an entertaining, average thriller, and Jerry Gold Smith, along with the original score, much less of its predecessor. Stone gives her a different dimension as she created a fragile, ghostly catherine trimel that could be well appreciated among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is a brilliant actress, not afraid of her losses and can play a camp during her leisure. Unfortunately, she is the main target for dispersing the film. She is very successful, the most prominent icon, and all the actors who have reached that level, she has time and she must now be destroyed by the Hollywood audience. <br /> The cast is uncommon, giving better performances than material. David Morrissey is much more interesting than a better actor and Michael Douglass: his performance is a flawless one, giving a thick, complicated size to a dimensional role. Since he has more screen time and is a picture of a movie, he can keep your attention from start to finish. <br /> I did not recommend "Basic Instinct 2" as a great film; I have expressed my disapproval of commenting on this site and my belief that many agendas than the film create an audience opinion.
