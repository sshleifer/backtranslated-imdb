I sit through movies like "Tiempo de valientes" and I want to talk about the cinema for hours. I'm looking at the scenes of this movie because I'm searching for my ideas for movie making and dialogue innovations that arise from Damian Szipran's mind, because the film's appreciation is beyond my own limitations. <br /> The environment is so uncompromising, so simple, I'm thinking; This man is a genius. He created the best television shows Argentina has ever seen, and some of the contemporary directors are still the first ever full of elements that have not been achieved. <br /> <br /> The name "El Fonda del Mar" and, it (a few years ago), has been awakened by my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema. <br /> <br /> If you start your journey from the daily lives of people, in the Pablo Trepero "El Bonerences"; The life of the Federal Police Department. Trapere's image is a journey of man's mind and experiences, not places he sees. <br /> <br /> But in his work there is a lot of humanity, and he has a lot of humanity in his work, and he has a lot of guilt situations, but with Szifron, mystery and thrilling music in the "there" His main characters, Alfredo Diaz and Mariano Silverstein show his research through the eyes. The film has a lot of highly skilled actors, but these two actors can not do without film. The first character (Louise Luke) is a detective who found him as his wife cheats; <br /> <br /> The second is the psychiatrist assigned to the detective treatment. He wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff uses the time period and suggests that he joined Díaz in his programs: "It's not a simple thing, no problem". <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two main leaders is not explained because it leaves a sign in our history and today is the kind of complexity that some talented people like Szifron are trying to show. In unbelievable situations, Diaz tells Sylvesterin: "How will our treatment continue?", And Sylvester replied: "No, I'm not your doctor. <br /> <br /> Diaz collapses in the street and does not give importance to it, or he makes mistakes Whenever we can not laugh, all the red lights on the street, or he's his police patrol and silversteen (But it also feels as if he smoked and killed it) or when Silverstein tried to be friendly with Diaz's thieves, we'll get there a magic from Diego Péreette, who gave a presentation on the psychiatrist himself "Locos de Amore" , But his sequence is impressive <br /> <br /> I'm so much appreciated, and as I say, about hours, but unfortunately it's not the way it works and I have to be perfect and summarized. While I watch a lot of old movies and study them, I can assure you that "Timpo de Diagentes" comedy is waiting for Argentina and never came.
