I have read recent comments about this movie and I want to respond. You are the rap group N.W.A. You probably do not know the original story. It will be launched in 1988, and went on to run Ice Cube band in 1989 and finally released in 1991. This led to the beef that began with the 1991 cue and the departure of dr.drere. This story is somewhat evidence. <br /> More this film is a 90-minute smiling spree, explaining that they are a political statement of gray juice song. Not to mention "love song" was hooking up delicious. <br /> <br /> While not happy with the film, Vanilla Sherbert is keen on her ass, and the record company executive is also happy and they are managing to shoot every time. There is no need to get it or complete idiots, in my opinion
