'Lost' gem refresh! You have an effective dialogue together with amazing acting in establishing characters, and you have enough to find out what has happened to them. Douglas and Widmark characters are real heroes. Palace is his usual evil presence. The Widmark has won the Feastfights Fight scene, a long chase on foot with a 'logical' ending of less than 60 seconds and a shift to the overdone chase sequences of contemporary Hollywood. You know how it can be, but it can withstand suspense and interest. Chase is the most realistic one you'll ever see. The picture appears slightly slower in the middle, but be with it for the end of the prize.
