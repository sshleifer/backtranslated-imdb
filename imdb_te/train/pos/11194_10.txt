Bad script, bad direction, top live shows, tired conversations. What can you ask for To laugh, it's just not better than this. Jora's over-acting together with the hazardous conditions that make for the hilarious parody of the "Hollywood" machine. It's not as funny as "spintal tap" as it's almost as funny. Do not miss Ray Leota's debut film line, "looks like a penis."
