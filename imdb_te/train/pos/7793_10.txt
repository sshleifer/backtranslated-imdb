My brother brought this film home from the rental store and reminded me to be a bored. I put myself on the title especially. I can never remember a movie with such low expectations and did not win completely. I saw this film twice before my brother went back to the store. This is rare, it's a movie that made me this way. When I was trying to make her way out of her life, I was caught completely in Ruby's condition. The bad thing about this movie is that it ends soon. I was looking at the bells. Another downside is that I was dissatisfied with everything I did from Ashley Judd. She is very nice in this film. This movie is my first ten favorite ever since.
