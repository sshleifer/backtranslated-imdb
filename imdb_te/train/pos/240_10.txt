Wonderful picture. One to activate all 5 senses. Not a true historical report, and all information is not taken into actual information. True Hollywood sessions were used as Naomi Watts (a lover of Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's Right Hand Man) as a list of 'heroes' and acting as very attractive actors, and unattractive (Sorry Geoffrey Rush) Actors play drunk and corrupt Victorian Police Force. This triggered a very unbelievable love story as a mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts), all of which are sexually attractive and feminine. From the first scene, the son saves young people while sprinkling a little bit, and his father calls him "sunshine", and he has "his brilliance in his eyes and his hand to eat me", which is very fictional and persuasive audience with Ned Kelly, Underdog. Moreover, do not like all the underlying underdogs?
