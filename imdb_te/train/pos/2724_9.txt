In the late 60s, many classic movies did not retain the ability to disturb and encounter viewers. "Cold Blood" does not lose ounce of its energy. Its exceptionally well-made yet viewer forces to think. Some people complained about the film, but the origin of Truman Capote is "fiction novel", the central message is unclear. This may be true, but it will not be removed from the image unless it is absolutely no confusion. To look at a picture with a persuasive political voice convincing to persuade its view of the audience, its simplistic, especially contemplated today's simple, manipulative moral dramas. To be honest, I'm not sure if I admit to the central message of the film, but I like its courage. <br /> If you do not agree with the anti-death penalty message, picture. Acting from two leads is amazing. Scott Wilson (one of the few still underestimated actors) is chilling as a nealistic leader, using his attraction to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake also spends both obedient and conscientious in both. His character clearly has the voice of reason, but Wilson fears to go against (a good homoric subtext on the part of his character). Cinematography is wonderful, elegant yet gritty and giving the impression that the viewer is really watching a documentary. Add another classic score from Quincey Jones, and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
