The film, along with Westfrott 1918, was my favorite pubst-directed movies and I enjoyed them more than his most popular films featuring Louis Brooks (such as the Pandor Box). This is probably because the two are quite similar to neo-realist films in the 1940s and 50s. <br /> <br /> In this film, the film is about the French and German coal mines, calling for non-actors (typical folks) in everyday settings. Correctly, those in the roles are miners - not actors. The central controversy that begins with the film is a huge mine in the Franco-German border. In Germany, much of the unemployment is, instead of a bigger blow, it is broken into the border and German workers are not welcomed into French mine. This is a conspiracy to create a huge controversy between language differences (a mirror in a dance hall scene) and WWI factions - a WE versus they are a result of mentality. Subsequently, the explosion caused a huge shortfall in the French and the Germans refused to sit back and do nothing. <br /> <br /> The film is fiercely critical of Xinophobia and is not in vain to see German viewers waste. War and hatred. A beautiful picture of some of the terrible and claustrophobia films I've seen so far. But if you look at the history, the effect of the film is fine. This was a real shame, with great messages of peace and harmony in the Westfront 1918, J√ÅACCUSE (Guns) and West Frant (landmark), but ultimately the people's opinion was partially failed. So, from a historic point, it's worth watching the wonderful and sorrowful remnants.
