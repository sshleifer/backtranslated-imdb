All Dogs Go to Heaven, in my opinion, the best animated film ever made. I'm not really a big fan of animated films, but it's something better than any of the other animated films I've seen. Music featuring Burt Reynolds, Dome Deloops, and King Gator as Gator Page in particular. "Let's Make Music Tomorrow" is probably one of my favorite songs from any movie I've ever seen. This is definitely a must for people of all ages.
