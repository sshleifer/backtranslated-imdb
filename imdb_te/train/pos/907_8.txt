This film is a great effort to revive traditional Indian values. It is replaced by Western countries. A common family story shows all the morals that follow each person while communicating with each other. Shaheed Kapoor will compose Modi with Amitra Rao as a griffin performance and she is also great. She is very good. The style of the film is similar to HAHK and such films are made in India for the restoration of old traditional values. Movies can not get 10 as it's not very good at the music which calculates a lot in every movie, this is flawless along ....
