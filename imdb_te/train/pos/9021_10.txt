I and 2 sisters have watched all three series of Tencu and agree that this is a good series for the BBC. All the actors convince most of the episodes they portrayed and the 3rd series is somewhat slower, but it is not without it and it will not be my evenings. It is never watching and I will never be watching. It's a wonderful series and a wonderful view of the BBC for casting and full marks. The first rate in all departments and anyone who recommends this sequence, some age limits should be considered due to age restrictions. Thanks to the BBC for releasing this series on DVD and videos.
