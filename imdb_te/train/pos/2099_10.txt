<br /> <br /> I am surprised that there are no further reviews of the film - certainly one of the best <br <br /> <br /> It is an amazing film that combines the great "Random Harvest" with the same early crisis. The middle-aged, unknown English WWI officer was in the hospital at the end of the war with shell shock and full surrender without his name, origin, or anything-he proved to be the most prosperous - when he was "back" <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to thank you for all those involved in the film - especially actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, Oppa and surprising casting choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> This is always with you.
