The characters are alive and interesting, the plot is awesome, the piroe effects have been successfully achieved and it takes a basic love triangle story and strikes a science fiction element. <br /> <br /> The camera work is very good, audio is clear and accurate, and I have been able to identify with many characters and their motivations with background music that influenced background music. <br /> <br /> I am a tad I am puzzled the whole small carnival in a chain shop parking lot, an incredible skillful memorable novelty, the sets are brilliantly designed, and special effects. Not quite powered by a single lamppost outlet. It's impossible to say the least. The fight between the brothers at the end of this film is amazing. It is amazing to have Jim Warne in the role of a non-clown.
