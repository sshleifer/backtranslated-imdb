I think this film is one of Kurt Russell's good films. Kurt Russell is my favorite actor and I think he is a good actor in any role. But there is a lot of action in this movie and I know it's 10 to 5.6 in the meter but most people do not like this movie. Oh well I thought it was good that everyone wanted to see this movie. If you see this movie and you want to see a backdraft with Court Russell. I'll give Soldier *** 1/2 from *****
