The greatest movie I see. One of my favorite movies from time to time. I saw 8 times in the theater and got the DVD. I looked back as an adult, and I realized that the film was average. Compared to known movies of good comedys, this is nothing. I understand the hilarious in the rock movie and break the little barriers which are great for the whole conversion with racial stuff. It's a good idea to think about how the film happened. It's a movie too thought but it's like a little twist which is a good touch. <br /> <br /> I love the whole movie so I will give it. <br /> <br /> It's good for me.
