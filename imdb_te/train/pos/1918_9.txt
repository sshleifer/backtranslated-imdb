I'm honest with it, I'm a junior high school when this sitcom was first broadcast on ABC. But with John Ritter I thought I had a little bit of it, something that I liked with something I liked. Acting is great, with a lot of humorous 2nd racist lines, when John Ritter always brings his game when it comes to the comedy. This is a great show to watch, and I'll tell you why it's a great show. My father and my brother and my sister, my mother and I sat down with me, and I saw the show that I thought was in John Ritter. It is. I honestly think John Ritter will rest his soul in God and I think this show will still be running if he wants he has not passed away.
