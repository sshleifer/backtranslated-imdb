I do not have words to explain how good this film is. Only an intellectual like Amrita Pritam wrote a true description of the partition days. The film has chased me for a long time. <br /> <br /> In this film, he played a role in the film. Her life was made in the role of Pero and made Manoj Wajpai Rasheed in the role. It can not be imagined by both, both Phero and Rasheed. <br /> <br /> In the Punjabi suit, Urmila looked very natural and Manoj appeared as an independent Punjabi musician. <br /> <br /> Sandeep Sinha has done a marvelous job like Raj Chandda Lajjo and Suri. <br /> <br /> Some scenes can not come out of your mind. This will bring tears to your eyes when you first meet Lazo. The climax is just a killer. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the Pakke, Mughal-e-Azam and Banaras.
