This is a very small crime drama while running in 65 minutes. This is all the right ingredients - a secret corpse, tired middle aged Carrigan (Walter Kinssela) and his rooky wayward Tobin (John Miles), a shadow killer woman (Patricia Wright) on Tiffin and love interest to help solve the crime. <br /> <br /> There are also a spectacular pistols that are taking place in stone wooden yard. <br /> <br /> Look for an amazing goof near the beginning of this film. The woman who died here revealed that "a priest is in her tattoo (confused huh?). And then, after Tobin's chase across the yards, he is suddenly shown to be in the wrong direction - not surprised that he has not caught him!
