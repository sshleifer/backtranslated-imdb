Perhaps "Presque Ryan" is not the best film ... but it's better than what you say. <br /> <br /> You get acquainted with the most vivid movies of Americans, the obvious start, development and outcome. <br /> <br /> European films are less commentary, but you can think and feel too much. <br /> <br /> Many of us can not understand the feel of the film .. This idea is not a simple but lovely film, "with commercial characters" falling in love and happy forever. "The summer holidays and beach are the only background, and the film <br /> <br /> Maybe some of you probably did not understand this movie, its 3 episodes, These three moments: - When they meet and love, summer in Pornichet - After a year and half Nantes living together, Matthew does not go to mental illness, he attempts to commit suicide, and to Cedric hospital. Speaking to the psychiatrist, he is likely to know what he did - the last part When Matthew arrives back in winter, when he returns to Portechet, how his life has changed and how his life is going to be, think about how to find herself. <br /> <br /> Some people could not understand this scene, because all the scenes in them was added. But anyway, as I said before ... it's not a funny movie. <br /> <br /> President Ryan, we need to show that the brutal life is not exactly what the young man knows about his feelings and what is in life. Mathieu wants to go away from home only, and try to live the kind of life he was supposed to bring happiness .. But initially seemed perfect .. He was not as good as he later felt, and he became troubled, and he felt lost in his way of life. He lost and did not know what he really wanted to do, or was not happy with him. He is finally disappointed and tries to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> It's not a funny movie. Very hot sequences? Only some .. But this is not a movie for entertainment. All feelings ... friendship, love, joy, dissatisfaction, pain, frustration, loneliness ... I feel that many others are identified with the life and problems of Matthew. <br /> For me, the best Homo-background movie ever.
