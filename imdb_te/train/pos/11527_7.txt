Miriam Hopkins In the 1940s, Leslie Carter's biography of Mrs. Leslie Carter includes a good assistant players, including "The Lady with Red Hair", David Belasco, Richard Einley, Claude Raines and Lara Hope Cruise and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Riens offer excellent performances. Hopkins is a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Ms. Carter. One of the greatest names in the rhythm of Thanksgiving is great as a luminous, eccentric producer / writer / actor / impresario David Belasco. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Carter's second husband, La Payne worked as an adviser on the film, a poor representation of Mrs. Carter's real events. True, there were so much publicity and bitter divorce, and she felt that she was undoubtedly a scandal and actress. However, she caught her son Dudley as a custody, so there was no compulsory fight. Once she broke with Belasco, she did not go back and actually started working at Videadeville and made some pictures at the end of her life. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this film Mrs. The driving force for Carter brings her son to control, but eventually she is away from her time, he is totally bound with her father. Even in the movie (and I'm not sure if it's real in real life) she moved with her mother and lived in a theatrical boarding house, which provided some interesting interesting atmospheres. <br /> <br /> A bad image, perhaps Carter or Belasco, does not describe the greatness. One of Mrs. Carter's most famous moments is in The Heart of Maryland, where she wig with six feet of hair. Fans blasted her hair while she was 35 feet hanging on stage, keeping her from ringing for hours. Very scene.
