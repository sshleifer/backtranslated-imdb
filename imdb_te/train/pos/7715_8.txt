First of all, think that the film is about fifth year old! However, it still remains one of the greatest films ever. <br /> The story is still solid enough and the effects are not uncommon for the day. When I was a kid when I was young to see the shape of the first (and only) time when the monster entered the field of power to rescue the vessel, I will recall the first time. Do I tremble with fear, I will tell you. <br /> <br /> The scenes with the tiger show their age now. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the creature's tearing effect through the Kremlin doors is amazing. <br /> <br /> It's also wonderful to see Leslie Nielsen (good memory for aircraft and Naked Gun cinema), even though young people are. He is 30 years old when this film comes! <br /> Now about 80 years old! <br /> <br Timeless.
