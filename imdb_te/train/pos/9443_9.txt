It was shocked that Deliverance was primarily known as the Red Neck Rape film and the Baazzos to be dueling. Even people who have seen the film can not get their mind from the rape scene. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It's certainly not bad at any woman rape scene about any movie. <br /> <br /> Deliverance acting, plot, cinematography and soundtrack are all given to branding caris. The backstory that it paints is beautiful and is different in the dark matter. The actors make you feel like two big and small rafting down the river that's right along with you. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​separating this image from others is the fear of being scared. Most movies can make you feel this creeped out. Bottom Line: This film is classic. I can not say more than really.
