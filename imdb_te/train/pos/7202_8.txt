Before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years ago), "Deathtrap" I kissed two men on the screen, and frankly, I was amazed. I understood the plot and this did not really cause my sensitive problems (not too much), but at first I saw at least in the mainstream film. I became chaotic in its time, and took courage for them to try, especially Christopher Reeve, in the middle of his time with PG-rated Superman. The male bipendrical on the screen may have stripped its stride with "brokeback", but it is more interesting to note the incarnation.
