Romantic comedies go, it's a beautiful and won. I thought the writing would have been stronger to build a bit better final connection, but thought it was not a huge tripping point. But, Amanda Dettermar and Scott Wolf are good performances and as beautiful as ever. These are two of my favorite actors, and they are happy to watch the cast as romantic leads. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film does not change your life, but it is sweet, warm and won. Not a bad thing.
