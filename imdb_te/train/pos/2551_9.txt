This almost unknown gem is based on a French Farce - it shows, and I understand that it is a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is fascinated by a wealthy Argentinean (Rowland), who asks her to marry her father. Caroline has already married Anthony (Coleman), who had just landed in and came up with a last-minute audience-directed memorabilia that Caroline made her love with someone else: a brass-ish sculptor (Gardiner). <br /> <br /> It is a complete cast: Ronald Coleman is at his most sophisticated and graceful Reginald. Gardiner is at his most advanced moment, Gilbert Roland is in his exotic location, and Anna Lee is just as strange. The film is a superbly directed Lewis Millstone (who also built); The whole product is like the love of the labor. There are striking improvements, such as the Columbia Breaking Frame and Speaking Camera, and the unusual use of sliding bar-cabinet door. This is a sin that does not release on DVD - a film that is unilaterally interested in classic film.
