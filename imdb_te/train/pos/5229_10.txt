The film received terrific ratings from everyone who voted here but this movie is for you if you like movies such as Dude Wears and my dumb and Dumbler. Citizen Kane and Casablanca id will need to silence you in your other perspective. Although it is kind of "kiddy", I still love this film and I love it, which is one of my few movies and my freinds over the years and has been able to quote as much as possible. Great image. This film should be the number one FII number, because it is Fagin 'upper class. You may not be bothered in this movie because it is designed for a TV movie on a channel that does not exist anymore. I do not know how to get this movie, I can not find an id that I want to buy for iDD. I still have tape from when it was first, and if you'd like it I might bute bute sleep. These are the rocks and basically all you need to know.
