Visconti's first feature film Massimo Giroty has an excellent drifter and the finest, Clara Calama from his classic touch screen flair and pure technology, including comprehensive performances like the spectacular, insane Giovanni. 'The Postman Rings Twice' is not repeated, but never improved. I can not believe that this is the man's first movie! It shows someone's confidence in the highest level of their career.
