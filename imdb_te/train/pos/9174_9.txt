Many of Jane Eyre's films and TV productions have been recommended to recommend them, but I suspect people have come to know for decades and fall in love. It's a classic (and offers more story than others). Timothy Dalton is entirely in his element as Rochester, is rarely a mark; While the distance is far from the dark complexities of the character, his performance is surprisingly nimble and very colorful. Jell Clark's Jane is more cerebral than another world, but she makes the perfect foil for Dalton (her towers!). Her performances of the show can be seen for the second time (after the shock of Charlton's Charisma). There are a few moments where some technical disadvantages and productive values ​​are better; However, it is the best by the standards of the BBC's standards. But it is real pleasure that shows. Do not miss this one!
