Every single performance from Simone Pegg is just better and better with each character. As always, he sometimes plays the role of the most horrific character he wants to hide behind your lint, but what is peg? <br /> <br /> The laughs are simple and eye water, and each of them targets Penn. <br /> <br /> The role of many journalists in this movie is very clean. Where each character plays the role of the only comedy that combines Penn. This is a huge credit to director Robert Weed. Gilliam Anderson did not quickly turn up the praises. All highly recommended.
