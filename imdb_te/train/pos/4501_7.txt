English pros is a pleasure to see this group. Auxiliary cast can create their own range. It appeared before the love triangle between the head of the surgery, his wife, and a newly-born boy's surgical resident. Francesca Ansez, Michael Kitchen and Sexy Robson Greene's high-profile skills were moved from the trash category to the most pleasant "ropp". The only critique it's hard to accept is that it's smoldering Franciscan Eyes and actually convinced me that Michael Kitchen is married, rarely an international, or a British sex symbol. You can immediately understand why Robson Green reveals his fire for apologizing to "Doors". Owen's father David Bradley is a stealer of the show with a great "laid back" appearance. Look at him in "The Way We Live" in a different performance to get the idea of ​​his range. Daniela Nardini, a little sexy kitchen, kitchen, forgot the kitchen and saw his great body. Conor Mullen, and Julian Rind-Tutt, Green's sidekick surgical buddies will have their own series as I mentioned. They are good. The whole thing is great for fun, and I am hoping it will be hoping, and thanking imdbman for paying the customers let them say this lovely platform.
