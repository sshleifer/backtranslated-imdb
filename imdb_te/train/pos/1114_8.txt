At that time I remember being too frightened and amused by this film. I have suggested that it is the most important film I have seen in ten years, and I have missed out on the same people. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has an exceptional cognitive behavioral notebook. And she shaped us with a bitter teenage personality that is all in the view of a decaying, adult world. It may be too bright for some audiences to provide an inspiration mix together. After returning from New York to LA, Bernhardts is looking for her, our realistic variety of people (all fit perfectly), but the true barometer for her registration is whether her acceptable enough black culture will appeal to a "black emergency" values Have a look out for it. (Nina Simone in the film, who has an impressive, strongly-built black lover in the film) participates in pretty black girl performances, and empowers Sandra's faux-blacks but ultimately refuses her. <br /> The Catholics think that they are responsible for Christ, but Sandra suffers from her black culture. She is valuable and she loses her denial. It is the only value system in the world outside the Bernhard's Artie chaos. <br /> <br /> The main problem is its racism and money, the way it is refreshing to see one of the two things in a diversity.
