This film is bad for some reason. Probably just by the public group. Anyhow, this is a very interesting picture. The film is a low-budget sci-fi movie, featuring an interesting storyline and well-seated scenes. <br /> <br /> This film may not be for everyone. If there are any science fiction fans to read this, I would recommend this movie if you like good science fiction. The film has crazy ideas. These sets of countries go to war with the GIGANTIC battles, and the entire country has invested money! The world is divided into territories. Anyone can challenge a war, or rather, a 'robot-duel'. The method of war is cleaner than nuclear war, now everyone is wearing those breath masks. Definetly a picture that makes you think. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>?
