I have seen through vocal and physical acting, masquerading and enchanting. Characters played by each character have been awesome. Literature, words, every gesture, sunrise, all this said. This film speaks to me. It's a different understanding of the person who believes in mankind shines on me. Who believe in peace and sensitivity. I have also rejected, sacrifices and human dignity are depicted. The power of kindness, without feelings and weakness. To gain power at the expense of mankind, that is unbelievable. This film no longer feared me for who's in this world anymore. And, I was sad that I thought about them. I like this movie for dialogues and face expressions. This film may be blessed.
