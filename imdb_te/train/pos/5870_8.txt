Jack NIFE Stephen Metcalfe's play 'Strange Snow' (the screenplay was also written by Metcalf), directed by David Hugh Jones, analyzes the often-forgotten influence of the war on the victims of the war's perpetual hurricanes. The film was particularly sharp when it came to war returns from Iraq and the raw treatment they received in our Veterans Hospital in 1989. <br /> <br /> Three Friends Vietnam When David was involved in the battle, 'High School' Flinagan (Ed Harris) was hit by a very painful posttraumatic stress syndrome, who was' in existence 'in his cartilage alcoholic vacuum' s school teacher sister Martha (Kathy Baker ). David tries to help his friend Joseph 'Jack Fife' Mézèz (Robert de Niro) his friend. On the first day of events, Jack Pi, Martha and finally two dates - to attend the Prom Martha - and that Promot Drunken David will completely destroy the residences at school and scare the towns and students. When Jack Find lost their friends, Dave makes a moment in Vietnam and brings David to the place where he can begin his ascent towards recovery. <br /> <br /> The three actors were surprisingly fine performances: Ed Harris de Niro and Baker set high standards and set their careers. Most people will help return all of this non-forgotten image A fragile reminder to the losses take them to families who receive them after the end of the battle to fight our battles. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
