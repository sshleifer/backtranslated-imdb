* What do I like about the speakers? Teenager Holy Tyler (Amanda Baines) goes to live with her father Valerie (Jenny Garth) to avoid going to Japan with her father; But her sister, her friends (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Mun), boyfriend Henry (Michael), do not know her half of the unsatisfying things that she only needs, Volese's Boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), the first owner (then the husband after firefighting) Vick (Don Courts), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second owner Peter (?) Have a funny bone dream in your body Be Ki, please skip this; This is not for you if you only want to be a sophisticated comedy. If you like a funny, sometimes touching performance with two hot chickens working in the main character (Leslie Grosman in the lead role - from Leslie Grosman, famous not just by Marie Cherry), then you? Welcome to Casa de Tyler! What I Like About You (2002-2006): 8.
