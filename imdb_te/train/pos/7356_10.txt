If you do not see Eva Longoria from the TV show "Desperate House Wives", you'll miss. Eva is one of the biggest Latina stars and you can see her in theaters soon. It was Eva's first feature film and she made an excellent job. When she shot it 24, and then looked hot. For this low budget film, the film "Juarez, Mexico", which is still playing at many film festivals across the United States, is pretty good for the first director ever released. In fact, it may have a limited theater release from some news. It would be nice to see "Snitch'2" with Bit Budget ".
