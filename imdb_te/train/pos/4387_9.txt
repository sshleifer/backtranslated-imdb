It is a strong image from the historical and mythical perspective. The story is simple but it is pure and straightforward. In fact, the standard story of a simple and respectful man, which can result in long conflict with educated and wealthy people. <br /> <br /> Poor versus rich, respected vs. disgruntled, is a classic but well-crafted story with no much better screenplay than Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The extra points you can smell people around the screen. :)
