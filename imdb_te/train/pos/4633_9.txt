Here is another beauty in the style of beautiful films directed by Ithan Fox. The film presents the story of a star-crossed fairy tale (an Israel, a Palestine) in Modern Tell Aviv. The impact of this film is not only from the description of cross-ethnic confrontation, but also of personal and political conflicts in ethnic groups. For example, one of the secondary characters, public gays, brings him his flowers when his boyfriend visits the hospital and while trying to kiss him in the family of his visits, and suddenly we wash through the inconvenient discomfort room. Apparently the young man does not open the way he looks, and the family is not accepting as he wants to be, while the boyfriend is confused and refused. The good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment. As long as we know from Yosci and Jagger, Fox acts as a master in efficient packing of emotional and mental complexities as brief sequences. The film is also effective as it shows the mutual brutality of Israel and the Palestinians. If you are not heartfelt, then the third third of the movie will shout. Although the plot is dramatic, it reminds us that it is very cleverly written and how good it is.
