Allen and Julie enter the cabin in the mountains after their daughter is killed one night. No one knows who little girl is killed but it is why they moved to the mountains. So the couple moves into this cabin and it is hit by people who killed there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of confidence and parts that make me the most jumped. Some parts are speculative but once I have an unexpected part. <br /> It's not a terrible movie in the world, it's scary enough to be pretty good. <br /> I end up with the end and end up. It's also a sad movie type but well-horror movie.
