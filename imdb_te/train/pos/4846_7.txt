This is a classic British comedy thriller that I always wanted to check but has now emerged no chance. It is based on a popular theatrical drama, which has been shot many times (especially by the same director in 1931 but unfortunately, this version is not fully available!); The plot for the remake in the review has been updated to the then-current war conditions. Anyway, I'm famous with early British comedians by Will Hay's films: the theme of plot, smuggling and hostile agents, which has a lot in the vein (which is Harry's general writing team Marriott Edgar, Wall Gust and Written by JOC Orton); Trapped commuter element, is an equally well-tried and true principle. At this time, actor Arthur Aske (inspired by Richard Murdoch) - never seen any movies I had ever seen - Hey himself being a hero and its personality is potentially annoying ... but soon the hot character (and the 1931 film version) As Murdoch acted, Oscie was absolutely witty lines Business hours is amusing bits. <br /> Remote Single Setting (The events of the film will mostly take place during the night a storm) provides some excellent weather; The last half hour - the arrival of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Lyndon Travers) and finally the arrival of the title vehicle - is particularly persevering and well maintained. In the cast of the cast, Kathleen Harrison, a stranger who feared stereotypical spinster, was all enthusiastically driven by a parrot and her first drink.
