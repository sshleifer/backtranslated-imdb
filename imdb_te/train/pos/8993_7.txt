Rock n 'roll is an outrageous business and DeG! This is magnificent. The intense ambition and perhaps the project of Phoolhardius, the filmmaker revolves around two large stone groups, covered by seven confusing years. To illustrate, the quality of quality material ensures the ability to film audiences to stimulate the audience. If you've ever been interested in music industry, this film will undoubtedly be a captive look. Music in the movie, although it is less painful from cutting and pasting, is the price of the entry alone. In the morning after I saw Dig! I chose a Bryan Jonstown Massacre album (I have already started Dundee Warhol's sounds) and have gone straight to the record store. Primarily defined by the search of rock music, the film succeeds at other deep levels. DIG! The destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the honest and sufficient goal of the people who are trying to bring those forces into conflict.
