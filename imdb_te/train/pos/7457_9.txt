<br /> <br /> The missions are very fun, many of them are actions, and sometimes it is very fun. The weapons you use are really good. In this game cars are good to make driving missions are good. This is a good story for the James Bond game. The voice over the actors in this game is really good and it is nice that they see Pierce Bresnan is really good in this game and the way the characters look is because they seem to be like real life which is really cool. The graphics in this game are pretty good. <br /> <br /> Out of total score ********* Out **********
