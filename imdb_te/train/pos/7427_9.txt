When watching another movie, I saw this movie trailer in the 70s when I was only 16. Oh !!!! How happy me and my best friend are. We can not wait for a month or month until it arrives. I saw 17 times that year at the theater. Love, love, love. Chris is very good for this film. He's brush and very bad, but it's also uncertain with shy and bobs and it's so lovely to watch again. I always thought they were one of the best scenes in the film when they were playing an evergreen song in the studio and with his noisy voice quite different from the exact notes coming from her. He is so proud to see her. Every day I could see this film. She also had a long sweater and cap like one I wore to her when we tried to dress up like her. This time came on TV and I love teens who they see my daughters and they like it. Perhaps it did not know everything I was caught in it at an age I did not know. Today I always end up with tears.
