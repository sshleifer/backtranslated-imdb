It takes a very special type of person to make a film that is very wretched, unsatisfactory, frustrating and repulsive, but it also makes the essence of intelligent and personal cinema redemption. Crispin Glover, did something that was truly unique, in all of his "out there" implications and predispositions. In this world has become structural, the film evades the creativity and the classic lines of art and potentially everyone looks patches. <br /> <br /> In the bats on the right, the film is a man with a farther paradigm of swastika and naked women in the shape of the shirley temple initially with a farther design (if really a model). It's rather shocking stuff, but if you have the chance of Q & A sessions after performances, it clearly opens a bag that leaves wondering whether you are art or just a less ordinary denominator. In the mask, the vibes feeling that this film will eventually cause. It is not even accepted by speculative authorities in the world who do not speak about the human situation. You may not like it, but definitely worth looking at.
