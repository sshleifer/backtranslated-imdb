Wizards of The Last Kingdom was depicted as a young prince (Simon), whose father (king) Clich was expelled from his empire because he was killed by "evil adviser". This film is about Simon's adventures. Special effects about this film, plot, acting and generally everything BAD. However, it's so bad that it's funny. You will be watching this movie because it's great, because as other reviewer of the film says, it's good, that's fine.
