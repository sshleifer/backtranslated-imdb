One of the most blood-crippled films so far is that all people in New York are murdered, and may not be the answer to everybody. From Hitchcock, Brian DePalma can see how the camera angles and objects look at some effect. Michael Cain plays a very thought-provoking role, while Annie Dickinson is mainly a bullfire with bad hair. Keith Gordon (later starred in "Christine") is perhaps the most interesting character in the film. But without seeing this movie you can not really understand. And after seeing it, no one knows who you believe. Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
