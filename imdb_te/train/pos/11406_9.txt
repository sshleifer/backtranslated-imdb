This strange arrangement of Wagner's final opera has definitely increased on me. When I first looked, I was a little bit more frustrated by the surrealist films of many movies, and I thought it was much more inventive in the story. However, if you can afford a fair amount of "reinterpretations", the film will manage to capture the strange and other world atmosphere of the opera and especially moments <br /> <br /> I do not really understand the character of the knife until I see how personally, Edith Klewer portrays her . Her acting (the lip-synchronized mime of Yvonne Mitton's voice voice) is dazzling, ending to the end, and justifies the picture that she captures the film alone. <br /> <br /> The film is a delight, which binds Ronald Lloyd's key role to Garnamayaz's fantastic role, which Lloyd has shown as a crystal of the opera houses around the world. I have made great efforts to enjoy the role of Gourmanmann on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, and the odds in his voice, and the warmth of this great character is really needed to be preserved <br /> I saw a video tape designed for America , So subtitle, can not be done away with, alas. This is very unfortunate, because the translation used is incorrect and it strengthens a very Christian interpretation on an image where the layers of the illustration are forced into. It seemed quite contradictory to both Wagner's explicit neglect of Christianity, and his much effort to "normalize" the Christian elements of the story. (See footnote with the spinler at the end of this review.) It's almost impossible for me to see a picture with subtitles and absorb them, and I strongly recommend that you have the capability to change subtitles in DVD versions, and instead, if you do not know the opera We read Libretto. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of pictures in the bottom line that I did not like and <br /> <br /> It has been steadily rising in my estimation over the years since I first saw it and I enjoy it again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " " In this subtitle, it is translated for reasons of escaping me as "I saw the Savior's face". This is very frustrating for me, because throughout the libretto, Wagner refers to the Bible as "the hell" for "disappearance", the intentionally and carefully for the "invisibility" of the Bible - the injury of the Amartas, and for all injuries and diseases and healing required.
