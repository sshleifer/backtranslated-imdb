Barbra Streisand Tour de Force in this Hollywood story. Her performances and songs are one-of-a-kind and the halls of great movies are exclusive. The scene where she was introduced to an unexpected audience by Cristoferson was revolving around the crowds' greetings and her, with the spectacular performance of "woman in the moon", the best film the audience could win. This is true. Her Evergreen record name ranks with the best in business in the scene .. All live, no lip sync, very special. Streisand is often criticized for being diva, but she is serving her in this matter. She was singing herself with her "Miss More Look You With You", which she earned for the Oscars and Paul Ellgreen for her Evergreen. Christopheran made much of his movements in his movies, this version of the "Born" franchise was in the first place in 1954 when Judi Garland And James Mason enjoy the music remake, but one in 1937 (Janet Ginore, Frederick March). I have not seen the DVD yet and do not know about its quality.
