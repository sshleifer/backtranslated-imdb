A wonderful documentary. I personally recognize this person in NYC in the early 80s. This film is not in that time period. This is something African American Guy Under Class thinks is just theirs and the love and comedy you see is real. People are truth and unfortunately still alive, which is written. The balls are still held, but they are in eight in the 19th century. That time has never been lost. It's good before "Homo Thug" movie. Queen's extroverts should be really proud when. This story went to Goodbye to Storyrieville, but it has greatly recorded all the Hill pictures!
