The first film, Robert De Niro (released a few years later), is worth watch. De Niro's character is not heavy, and when two friends try to prevent another friend's marriage first, they chase him to force him to force him. Any die hard de Niro fan will undoubtedly get a kick of an early performance today for best actor.
