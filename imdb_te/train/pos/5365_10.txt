Running man is often another arni action thriller that is full of explosions, bad deeds and shootings, and it's okay and has a lot of it. <br /> <br /> But, it looks like people compare it to the Terminator series, which is one of the poor Schwarzenegger films. <br /> <br /> But give it 18 years, and you can congratulate yourself. Different light. Rather than another intellectual action movie, it works very well with the reality of the reality TV. This is quite different in Stephen King's book, but Hollywood, Huboull, has its talented endings and the skills of a trained commando called 'common boys' <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) Dystopian is the police who is working in the United States, where democracy is the last thing, and the whole country is a p The dramatic / media conglomerate is governed by the compound. The economy is tatters, food for shortage and sadistic gameshows looking for people in the state, jumping for dollars, people jump for money on the dog pit, and one of the most popular man running, slimy Damian Killian (played by entertainer Richard Dawson) In a sport, 'Criminals' Theatrical, Pro Wrestling-Esquire "Stoker" by the hunted. <br /> <br /> And talk against the government. When a group of hungry people arrives in a protest in the town of Bakersfield, California, Richard's pilot sends a helicopter strike (ie killing). When Richards refused to fire innocent people, he was arrested and framed for the murder of audiences. He was sentenced to a slave labor, but he flew with the help of the resistance leader (with Yutte Cato) and runs on the run. <br /> <br /> However, his freedom is not long, and the employee Amber Mendez (Marisa Conchi Alonso), who takes the prisoner back, but this time he appears to be seen in the running man after attempting to escape his followers after abducting the network. <br /> And there, the whole film kicks into standard Arnie mode. Richards entered the post apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why this Dystopia has always been destroyed on the worlds) and had to run 'stealers' along with two prisoners who escaped from the labor camp. Amber is also curious about the rhetoric of Richards' innocence, he reads. What can happen then? So, amber, Richards and two other guys, running around trying to avoid stalkers, we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop. <br /> <br /> He is a superhero, an army of bad corporate dictatorships and a man who can not fight for the obese men who hang on Christmas lights. Your average American figure with the voice of Austria. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie becomes dumb, loud, classic 80's Arnie fun. There are a lot of exciting fight scenes, trademark terrible panes ('I have to break into my favorite guy), and the usual formulas final confrontation and happiness. It is fun to see Kilillion react in a typical 'perfect' Gamehost host, and the funniest moments in the show revolve continuously as some view the audience as an inconsistent host. <br /> <br /> If you expect a high-brow, intelligent movie you will be disappointed. But if you want a great 80 flicks, that's fine. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this film is that it is very prophetic. <br /> <br /> If you find yourself entertaining today, you have seen reality TV happening these days - by any means for a five-minute reputation, and the producers are ready to allow themselves to insult themselves on TV. It is not too far to guess that some of the TV executives are trying to get the right to show that TV executives live on TV. We already have videos with a horrific Al Qaeda captive helmet that we have posted on the Internet. <br /> <br /> In the current environment, at least some people are better off by seeing realistic deaths on their television sets. <br /> <br /> In the minds of these days, the restoration of the 80s, you should be impressed by the foresight of this film. We can find a way of pitching a program that combines people's desire for entertainment and their desire to sink into their ill health, as long as you can not reach there, but how long you wait, ...
