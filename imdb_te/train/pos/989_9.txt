My friend and I thought I had done this film well. We imagined ridiculous comedy, but came with a full action movie with comic thrust. We thought that the film did not play well in the box office because the previews are comedy. I was impressed with supporting actors and of course Dave Morse always puts on an amazing acting job. Supporting cast is not many veterans first timers and they're solid. We thought both the writing and the direction was the first rate. If you do not rent for a good time.
