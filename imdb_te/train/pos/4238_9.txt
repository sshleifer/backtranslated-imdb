On the surface, it is one of post-war romantic comedies. <br /> These leads are straightforward, but all the seconds are of type. Margaret Hamilton (West Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (professional obsessive-compulsive funbook), and Sig Rumann (Marx Brothers' Night in Casablanca and Always Wonderful Daily Opera_ At) <br /> It is fun to be fun with romantic-comedy sessions, which is another reference. <br /> <br /> Many post-war romantic stories & their 2-dimensional, stock characters are a very "romantic" comedy because of a crooked character. <br /> <br /> When I see you, I can not be positive, but this film is one of the best performances of the time it did, but now viewers have a completely different lens to "see" these secondary characters. I guess this is when I give 9 stars. I thought it was crazy.
