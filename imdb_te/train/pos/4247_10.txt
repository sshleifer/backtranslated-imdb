The girl from Missory comes to New York City to find out exactly what she wants: she is great by marrying her millionaires - without losing her virginity. <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow lives in this wonderful little comedy. With her platinum hair & beautiful accouterments, she is a dazzler. But the fact that her beauty she is also a good actress can not be obscure. <br /> <br /> She won her place at the top of the Hollywood Pantheon. <br /> <br /> An amazing cast gives the best support of Harlow: Lionel Barrymore, the beautiful Franchtone tone of his son smitten with love; The victim Patty Kelly stole her scenes on the side of Harlow; Allan Mubrey, the man of the English English; Clara Blanchick, Barrymore's deadliest secretary; Hayley Hamilton is an eye for women; Muscle nut bridallet like Kelly's affectionate lifestyle; <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the film was produced when Hollywood's production code was introduced. Comparison with the RED-HEADED WOMAN two years ago is attractive - in which Harlow's character ends, but uses many different ways.
