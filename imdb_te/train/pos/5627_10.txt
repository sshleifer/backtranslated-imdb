This move was actually jumping out of my chair looking forward to what the actors were doing! The performance was excellent, Farrah earned an Oscar for her excellent asset. James Rousseau was very good, I hated him and he played the villain and it was great. There are not many films that killed me in this film. The cast was great shocked by the great Alfie that big-eyed Farrah was a victim and you went back to her and you lived back in her horror. I know that you know that you are there and I know the same anger she wants to hurt her, but you know that it is wrong. In this movie you're on a roller coaster ride and in each scene you get up and down.
