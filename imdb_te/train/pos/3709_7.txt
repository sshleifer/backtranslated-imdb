John Grisham is the screen of any screen introduction of the main Hollywood system, and Robert Altman's last director about me for the mainstream. But this south-fried pot-boiler is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Notwithstanding Allman's best of all, it's not exactly what he's scratching over your head and what makes him wonder what he's thinking. <br /> <br /> Alton Noir thrills his hat to thriller, before his 1973 film "Long Goodbye." "The Gingerbread Man" is not so close to that movie, but it's very nice on its own. Knowing that Kenneth Branagh was murdered, a voiced lawyer was involved with the client (Embath Davids) who recorded his help to save himself from his client's father (Robert Duvall). The film is set in a tropical storm in Surya, Georgia, which gives the film an oppressive atmosphere that I like most. The turns and turns on the end of the film were clunkier and clunkier, and that Altman was not effective when shooting himself, but overall the film was not bad for the canon of Altman. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hanna, Tom Berenger and Phamke Johnson. <br /> Grade: B
