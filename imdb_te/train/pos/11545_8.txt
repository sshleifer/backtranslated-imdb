The original film, The Odd Couple, has some striking comic dresses. It's the whole world that Nordica is well aware of Freak's Ungar and the story of the funny, bad, slob Oscar Madison. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful jokes in the couple's Oscar apartment . Tired habits. He said, "Who wants food?" One of his poker player buddies, "What did yah come to?" Asked if Oscar said, "I've got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches." "What is Brown?" This is a very new cheese or very old meat! "I also love the line about the Oscar's refrigerator," it was in order for two weeks, I saw milk standing there not even in a bottle! "Glad to see Walter Mottow's Oscar Madison screen was good as Jack Klugman's version of the TV series. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon's Felix Under, Felix SO discouraged, and said that he was more than joking. Tony Randall's performance, Felix's comedy, warmth and sensuality Tim's Felix Unger may be for some time disturbing, but it is related to special situations that require an annoyance in storytellers in the TV series. Fox's Unger, , It will be run at all times <br /> <br /> The film still has great moments of great tests, "Famous" Monotolope Fight Never Scenes! One of the other great examples of Felix 's "short notes" on Oscar' s pillow will be remembered forever. However, there are darker sides that go up to the Oscar, a scene involving Felix's linguistic feast (even though funny by a comedy) after a rare ending to Felix. <br /> <br /> In the film there is not enough time to see the light side of the most memorable characters in this series. Start 20 minutes are very boring. The same problem occurs with Felix's conversation with Pidgin Sisters. The end of this film is predictable and very pat. Each of them has very little attention or compassion. As a result, if you do not see the above scenes on the dark side of the movie, it will lead to more than comedy, rather than depression and anger. <br /> <br /> Felix's Jack Lemon's singular guy meets this role rather than improving comedy between characters. <br /> <br /> It really takes the 1970s TV series to make The Odd Couple better. The original image is still pretty cool. However, the TV series is very good.
