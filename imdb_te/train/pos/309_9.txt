I do not know much about one of my favorite actresses before I saw this movie. After watching it, I'm so sorry about the life of Lucille Ball ball. It's also great moments, but I did not understand how sad it was. The film looks good and tells the story of the beloved Lucille Ball. I'll add it again.
