I saw big, huge, huge vanilla sky !! My Cruiser Fan, my weird brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say .. I completely blown away by the film and especially TC's performance, <br /> I decided that I did read reviews and did not see it and did not see it , I am very happy, as it has seen, 'has forced. I can not tell why weird thing is, I have found that I'm totally involved and I can not keep thinking about it the next day. I can tell you about what I thought about this movie, not the story about it, its life and how small events and enthusiastic events, such as entering a car, are not about it (Fantasy, Psychogram, What). For critics, the original Alejandro Amanabar might be the 2nd film, but the different details of the subject There, Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz for the purpose of a remake of an innocent. <br /> <br /> I do not even write two types of glue sentences to describe the film I read. <br /> I am not a balanced contemplative review but it 's not like it .It' s not the movie.
