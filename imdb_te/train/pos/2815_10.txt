I can not believe my eyes when reading some of the other comments and reviews. <br /> <br /> The film is a great, funny, crazy, over-the-top violent, yet minimal gore, and powerfully core all the way. It loved every bit. Do not remember any such madman to perform these laughs and martial arts. The most important thing now (at least for me): computer effects are free. When I see some Hollywood actors doing the screen on the modern hoody-residential action and "buffet" (a Russian word meaning "bull * beep *"), I understand that any beep * child can do it - you can adjust the wires to the body, Include PC effects, and it stuff into action movie. Here it is different. I do not think there is a physical, physically developed action star across the globe that will repeat the collapse of the end or the "Chinese Football" play. <br /> <br /> It's not a "star wars", a little Hong Kong movie that's made fun. <br /> <br /> A DVD with English soundtrack is not a problem with this image. It does not spoil the atmosphere for me. <br /> <br /> You can not mention a very good theatrical play. Some people say you do not like it. For me - it's amazing. Have a look at the friend of the dragon who speaks bravely and suddenly gets a fist punch on his left hand. His face expression becomes something strange and he comes up with the baby expression to the dragon. And notice the terrible size of his mouth - it almost makes him an ear from one ear to another. <br /> <br /> The film is eligible for a high rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world. . Thank you very much for our Russian industry for the release of classic Jackie Chan movies. <br /> <br /> A total of 10 of 10 people - a legendary film in its genre. Thank you for being diligent.
