After watching Deliverance, films such as Pulp Fiction do not appear so serious. It's probably not so bright due to today's blood and bullet scales, but when you find it in 1972, it makes you think differently about the film as a real bad thing. <br /> When I started I was really unusually watching this movie until the "Duinging Banjos" scene. The film's brutality and edge is really visible in that scene. I saw Drew (Rony Cox, RoboCap), headed with a seemingly undesirable young man. If you think you have a small banjo, you can probably make a hand with Drew's good expensive guitar, and you can really see how the four men in their territory are really. This is very believable when the plot goes and does not go beyond its limits. But the movie really separates, for a Cano trip they get more than four businessmen, and director John Boorman (XLLLB) separates all the characters from plain satire or stereotypes. When the film was full of horror and suspense, I really thought about four people and what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> This act is wonderful worldwide. Leading to a cast of Jon Voitt (Midnight Cowboy, Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Knights, Stryststead). Jon Voight is probably the hardest thing in the film and believes his trust from family members is incredibly ridiculous. Unlike Reynolds, the role of a warrior from the beginning of the character, Woyote's role in the film. <br /> <br /> Nanny Betty (Life) is also a very hard role, when Queen Cox is in incredible performance raping a Hillbill. <br /> <br> The villains were afraid of what I saw. Bill McKinney and Herbert "Cowboy" are amazing and very scary, like Coward Hillbillis. <br /> <br /> The whole Deliverance is fantastic and I have suggested to anyone other than the weak stomachs and children. 10/10. Watch this movie.
