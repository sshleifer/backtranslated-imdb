The film is a little unusual, it has a very soft story and the film is very slow and leisurely. It is pretty different from the average grant film, which is still quite a watchable and entertaining. It's sort of like "let's just follow the cary and see it gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you have a house to rehabilitate". In this film he is a lovely actor and with great support from Merna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. When the film plays pretty modest characters, it makes a lot of stuff. It's a great movie for Carrie Grant fans or the whole family.
