Acting is a little suspect. Alexander Walker (the Evening Standard critic, yes yes, he is dead now) recounts the film as a murderer. Now with regard to all the NI protesters, the film is Shankel Cutler (loyalists) and Belfast in the 1970s. I believe, they do not think they are for nothing. My main lion about this film is that it shows no ray of light or hope, it's all doom & dark, that means I got to die the little girl at the end. Maybe these applause sounds but all the prods & tiags may be taken strategically as bad or not completely good.
