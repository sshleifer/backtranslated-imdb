These, "Prodigal Sun" and "Eastern Konders" are my favorite Sammoh Hung films. Fat dragon is bold in this outing, rather than in "condoms", but he is less precisely as a director or an actor. He, in fact, has at the top and half a dozen magnificent scenes of his form and manages to tell a compassionate, sweet love story, a devastating and cruel act. <br /> <br /> Love and Romance are not the directors of the director, but they are an interesting affiliate to action and assure that the audience can not push ahead quickly between physical clashes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Samo's pedebob scene is beautifully displayed and comic to the comic tone in a scene that is accompanied by a car. Fast and angry stick fighting between Samo and La ka Car Lee is dazzling choreography and the best in sharp, excellent direction and its kind. The film's violence grows slowly, in the end, when climactic deterioration, we are subject to some of the most ruthless promises we have seen in a sammo product. Billy Chow and the director / actor who was angry with a house, a bone-fractured breeze filled with terrible rivals, and physical pleasure. <br /> One of the best martial arts films ever made at every level and never. <br /> <br /> Very great score.
