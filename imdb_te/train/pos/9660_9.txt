After some thought, I liked this movie. And after reading comments from all the other posters here, others were thinking about it and I was wondering. I loved American films - perhaps it was so. They usually have a well-defined start, the middle and the end. On the other hand, "Presque Relay" does not make such an effort. I disagree with other posters who say 'most arts'. In every way, this film is intended to induce your knowledge memories. Very often you feel that you are there in the film ... you're summer sunshine, winds, heat, winter, companionship, loneliness etc. <br /> <br /> In every way, you are dragged in the lives of the director's characters - so many people are so strong that this film is disappointing. After I finished watching, I thought it was the same. <br /> <br /> I find that there is no image in this image: "story" is not a story, it is the emotions that you (the viewer) feel. <br /> <br /> The lighting, scenery, and camera angles that you immerse yourself in - are rich, sensitive, and alive and have numbness and nuance. I can not see movies without a fully developed storyline (after all, a film 'does not think' to tell the story), this film is definitely one of my new favorites.
