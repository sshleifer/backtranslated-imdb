This film is an entertaining, fun and quality film. This book follows very clever guidelines, and tries to adhere to exact lines. All of the actors are positive, and you are expected to be part of them. They use some of the most prominent actors in the film. The graphics are slightly daddy in parts, and there are very few errors throughout the film. For example the yellow drops are not like lizard. The camp is not as stark as described in this book, and the book in the camp should not show much. His group is all mentioned in the book, but not in this movie. Overall, a great movie for a rainy afternoon
