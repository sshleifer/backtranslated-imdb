The Chinese Ghost Story Delayfully, the great Leslie Cheung, Ling Choi Sin, decides to spend the night at a disappointing temple, which meets and falls to a beautiful woman named Singh (Joey Wang). Ling is identified as a devil who is forced to cheat the victims for an evil tree spirit that feeds on Chai (Life Force), deciding to try and release the girl by giving her the right graveyard. An independent Taoist monk, Lig successfully defeats the tree spirit, but he will have to fight in hell against the evil Lord Blake, who is married to Singh. <br /> I opened my eyes to the fantastic world of a magical realm, the first Hong Kong movie, a Chinese Ghost Story Asian fantasy horror, the beautiful female ghosts I saw entirely martial arts action, innocent heroes males, knife Taoist monks, Dark rulers of the underworld; <br /> <br /> Two decades later, and this fantastic film is still one of the best examples of the genre I have seen. A luxurious, breathtaking masterpiece that combines horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. From the beginning of the full unforgettable and fully enjoyable experience of a Chinese ghost story, a wonderful compilation, including the excellent Sue-Tung Ching, David Woo, amazing cinematography and fantastic special effects (a murder killer tongue, many maiden monster and many flying heads!) .
