People complain about the number of images about people with mental disabilities. I do not see this as a valid criticism, more than most people's complaints about people. Jaco von Dormal makes excellent work with script and direction. Daniel Auduel and Pascal Dukevin are working together, Dukevin is playing himself. The film has surprisingly large moments, and there is simply no content to go to the "Rain Man". <br /> <br /> It does not destroy the amazing story that we had just heard before.
