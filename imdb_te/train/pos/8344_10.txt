This is one of my all time favorite. It's a simple and sweet - definitely a chic movie romantic comedy. I really like the good image of the whole quotes and this is ... Albert Einstein told Ed Walters "I wondered what I'm thinking" and one of my favorites is saying "what's the happening odds now!" In my opinion, you can look again and again The image is amazing if you can find the same amount, and with this one! I really enjoyed Walter M.S Path who played Einstein's character. I like all the characters well enough and the story flows well. Many times I'm laughing at the movie and I'm looking at my favorite lines while watching! I would recommend this movie to those with heart and now it is a sensational romantic jokes!
