The original person / character is "not right there", but my summary line represents the power of the film. <br /> <br /> It can all be done without the fancy camera movements and / or big product sets, but without the great story and the most (believable) and good actors story (arc). Great Japanese films / movies (such as the Tokyo Story) are not a mate, not quite story-wise, but more psychologically-wise! Great performances, skills in performances that are really gems. If you're interested in experiencing a touching story and want to watch a movie that's emotionally touched, it's more than one. As you watch (most of my reviews), I can not get into the story. IMDb has places here, where you can see that, I'm not a spoiler story!
