There's no middle class in this movie! It happens like most dreams and is very much like dreams, which is often crazy and real. <br /> <br /> Jinette's Depan, vague insults and many other faux passes are delighted at the reception collection and her jitter bag with Bunny Burns is a surprise and a pleasure. At one point, she sang the song of "Faoust" (a lapdog for some strange reason) to sing a snippet from Carmen, then "Aloha O" on the beach! <br /> It's a surreal comedy - amazing entertaining you can get into the groove.
