In "Brave New Girl", Holly comes from a small town in Texas, sings "The Yellow Error of Texas" in local competition, and joining the prestigious college in Philadelphia. From there the picture will increase a colorful story of friendship and confidence. I liked this movie. It's great singing and acting and putting the characters moving at a much better one. Acting is amazing. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Han are exceptional, and Nick Roth's camera work is really good and I'm very memorable (it's in the sequel Making). Kudos to the director and all the others involved in this product. Most of the image archives are gem.
