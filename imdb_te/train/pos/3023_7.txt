This enjoyable little noir has a high cast and many memorable scenes. Embarrassing complete authentic tones for the big distraction. The Spanish characters in this film are a French (boyer), a Belgian (Fran√ßon), a Greek (Pacquinau), and Hungarian (Lore)! And above all it is thought that the bacall is an English folklore! Despite these absurdities, the performances are all very good - especially of Paxinou and Lorre. But Boer, Paxina and Lorrey, and talking in different voices, is a real owl! I guess, looking at how they are alone, however spoken Spanish! It's pretty weird to find Spanish-born actors Brother Warner in Los Angeles! Hollywood has often "made an old accent" - my other favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) as Mata Hari (Dutch) who fell in love with a Russian soldier who played Mexican (Ramon Novaro). Perhaps they should have Novaro for "Confidential Agent" - he was great in Boer's role or at least in the Frankenstein (that he saved most of the dark makeup budget).
