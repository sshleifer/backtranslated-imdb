This 1939 film director John Ford and author Lamar Trotti reveals his lawyer, Abraham Lincoln, a fictional story of his trials (literally) and his troubles. It is a sentimental film, reasonably well made but rarely breathtaking. It is wrong to play Henry Fonda in the role of Lincoln, although the actor has his acting rights, with a lot of inch decorations and a bad nose he is very handsome to the famous Guerrero Abe. It's a good effort from Fonda, if nothing is true, but his miscasting throws off the whole movie. The supporting cast is excellent, though, and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But in the treatment of Fort Lincoln, he is more dignified, he is just a saint's coward and goes to the top of the final scene.
