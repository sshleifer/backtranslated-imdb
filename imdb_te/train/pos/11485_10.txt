Zero Day leads you to think, two boys / teenagers have to rethink what they will do - mutually suicide by killing their classmates. <br /> <br /> The two men decided to break away from ordinary citizens to define their own / interactive world by separating them for two men. <br /> <br /> It is not a perfect image but has a given money / time filmmaking and actors - it's a wonderful product. It is better than 'Elephant', explaining the intentions and actions of two young suicides / murderers - to illustrate a film that is under the 'rationalist' skin, you are likely to see a much better picture than almost never. <br /> <br /> A terribly sincere error but honestly.
