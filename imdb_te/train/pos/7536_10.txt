Pat Robertson commented that he was a bad man and his program is nothing to compare with what is evil and evil. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible also says that in the last days the people calls good and bad good! He did not even know that he fulfilled Bible prophecy! If you do not know God and do not let him know now, that's OK. He still loves you but finally you bow to your knee, and you like it, it's too late for you. God will not send you to hell! You go there with your own decision and your spewing defines it! God will show you kindness and give you the experience of Damascus Road. The 700 clubs and Pat Robertson's Ministry are one of the reasons I am still here. On the edge of alcoholism, adultery and possibly death, God reached through the TV screen and utilized Pat Robertson, and thanks to his God! You have the right to say what you have said, but you do not have the right to curse with your words. God was kind to you.
