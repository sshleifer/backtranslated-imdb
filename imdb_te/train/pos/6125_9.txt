Well, what do I think about Jack Frost? I saw the morfing box for the VHS tape and I thought it was interesting. I took the rent and took it home. Boy I'm right, it's interesting. They put the spirits of a serious killer into dreams, walking bodies and machines every day. But it is the most unique place to keep the spirit of a serial killer. Inside a snowman body. I liked all the friendly snowman pictures sliding landscape, pat holder, snow globe, etc. I like the actor who played Jack, he really put some fun into a killer that has not seen from FREDDY KRUGGER. This is true, I said it. FREDDY KRUGGER. It's "cool" level. I wish the puppet effects were good and mouth moves better suited. But I'll chalk to a small budget. The cast does a great job, there are some great liners and scares to make any hardcore scary fan jump. All and all, a great story, good effects, great dialog and great cast. I Give JACK FROST ... 9 STARS
