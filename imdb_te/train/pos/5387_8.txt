Even in the 21st century, childbearing is dangerous: women have miscarriages, and give birth to premature birth. Seventy-five years ago, the death of women during childbirth was not uncommon. It's the theme of "Life Begins": Look at the "complicated cases" ward at the maternity hospital. Loretta Young plays a major role, a woman who has been brought here from jail (no offense to give birth); The fact that she told her to give her baby after the birth was controversial. <br /> <br /> Although Lauretta Young is the main character, the most common performance is by Glenda Farrell. In 1930, Farrell played one of the supporting roles in Warner's "B" Women, and sometimes played a major role in B movies ("Torchy" portrayed Ferrell Tarkie Blane in several installments of the B-Movie series), Farrell plays the role of an expectant mother who does not want her children Plays, because they are only on this path. She makes everything she takes in the way of nurses like smuggling alcohol (in this course in the banned days), and as a fish - they are embryonic alcohol syndrome. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike most of the early 1930s, women on heroic men's path Not to cope with idiots - the situation was overturned, jelly. (See for the famous character actor Frank McHugh as one of the veteran fathers). "Life Begins", being an early talkie, shows the story with a drama with fair toyproduction, but it is a lovely little picture. Turner Classic rarely shows this; I've only seen Loretta appear in a few days of Young Honor. But it is highly recommended when showing up.
