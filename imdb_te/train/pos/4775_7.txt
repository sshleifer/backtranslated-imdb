If you want action and adventure in a movie, then you want to be fine to see it elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Richard Farmsworth concentrates on a delicate, weakly compelling performance. Alvin Straight sees Alvin's view of his brother who has a stroke in a riding mower in three states in this story. <br /> <br /> The story moves slowly to mower, but some people perform to see the viewer's later life Alvin is going to provide. <br /> <br /> Get stretching on the couch, relax and enjoy. It's the only way to see a very good image, which is rated a 7/10 in my book.
