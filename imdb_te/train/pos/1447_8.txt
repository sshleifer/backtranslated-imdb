Before I saw this film I read negative comments and started to look forward to it. I admit that I had to rewind quite a few times as the film was very complicated, involved and full of detail. This is a good thing, but the most unexpected in this culture of car, explosions, undesirable sexual and general violence, is an alternative to plot and character development. In fact, no welcome departure, though, I used to pay attention to what most I see. <br /> <br /> The film is characterized by character development and plot lines; The kind I used to explore when I was in high school. This requires a real mental partnership as part of the audience. What a good change. I can compare it to 'All The President' Men. That is, the mystery is the serious misconduct on the part of the elected officials and the mystery of having enough effect on the 'own' officers. <br /> <br /> Along with 'All the President of Men', the character attempts to make some characters original. In this sense the film is in the study of the role of Samuel the Jackson and Kevin Spice as 'The Negotiation'. In the film, their characters are two city employees and plots are very serious. However, this storyline is based on their characters' ability, to collaborate with everyone, every belief, and ultimately to unify the corrupt police department. The film has more gun firing and specific plots are different, but in general, there are many similarities. <br /> <br /> "Of course, I have been parallel to the past and present political scandals that I am going back to Watergate in my life, something that people feel is wrong, But the details are hard to follow, the film is not close to being complex in real life but its complexity is real to life. <br /> <br /> Previous posters One of the critical factors: unrealistic expectations. I have seen it 3 times in a row! Acting and directing maccalenidi amazing. The weak link in the voice of John Cusack.
