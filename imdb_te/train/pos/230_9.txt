At first sighting on the cable it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film portrays the exact picture of South and racist attitudes. Many attitudes, the Soul, use the guards to the workers from an old gardener. Sally makes this move, giving us a sense when his funny Wrangles returns to South. If I live in the Soul, I think Alzheimer's disease is suffering. His attitudes are less likely to be a little boy to work for him and the culprits are complicated. When he had racist opinions, he rose to trust a few black people. Two prisoners he trusted most were Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). Conversations between Ben and Soul are the best in the film, they have a real chemistry. <br /> <br /> James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler are both in great performances and at Hus. <br /> <br /> The movie is getting worse. <br /> <br /> <br />
