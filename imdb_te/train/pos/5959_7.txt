The film does not come into the news of a great movie, which is a fun way to spend an hour and a half hour with the family. <br /> <br /> The film was originally released, which was originally released. <br /> <br /> This movie is the "dinner bachelor's club". Zorja Fox plays a woman working as a surrogate to get down payment for the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nun plays his beloved Cadillac-a beloved mystery person. Fox gives a poor and touching performance and Nann has always been skillful. Michael des Barrers is a blind man on top attorney. Collective vowels - made of familiar faces - work well to bring the absurd bunch of characters into life. This is a good rental and one of the few you can see with the whole family.
