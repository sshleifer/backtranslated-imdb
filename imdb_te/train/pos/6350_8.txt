I wished I wanted to come out for this film, the trailers seemed over the years, it's worth it. I'm not a big fan of movies again, and I can not wait to wait to buy again! Jim's big fan but it's perfect for him, there's a lot to see and the 'good factor' is perfect for Christmas. I think Ron did a fab job of doing this in a movie, if you do not see it, do that again, look again, you know what I want!
