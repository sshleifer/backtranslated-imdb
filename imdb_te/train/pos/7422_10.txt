For a long time as a Barbra fan, any of these postings will be biased. Next, this film is a classic rank. It has shortcomings (emphasized on other posts), but there is a glimpse at the time (in the late 70s), and it's lovely to see the screen open. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not think she's always satisfied. But new Barbara (time) to his fans with live singing, younger new show and some very heavy-duty performance. <br /> <br /> This story is tough, but exciting, and will be of interest to you all. An extended frame "end" is hard for many but barber fans sit, but speaks volumes for those who admire her talent. <br />
