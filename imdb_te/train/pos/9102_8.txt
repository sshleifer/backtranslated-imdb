I saw this movie at the 18th Haifa Film Festival and this is one of the best I have ever seen this year. It looks on a bigger screen (I understand BIG, that TV screens do not have a lot of movies) with an amazing sound system that always improves the film experience, because the picture takes your eyes and ears and makes you into the story <br /> <br /> Displays a set of characters. Their stories crossed a few points, and the multiplication of stories reminded me of great Robert Altman and his sensitive images. But the true hero of the film is clearly Madrid City, which offers the whole movie background. It has characters, they carry walkways and highways and background scenes for all the shows in beautifully shot scenes. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker understands the meaning of the metaphor as the image is over and over again some items (shoes, example), and the salazar image improves. He combines the views of the city with the shots of characters and beautifully fits the backdrop of the scene to the backdrop. A set of talented actors will help him to portray a variety of characters. A spectacular example is the first in Juaquin down the road that takes Anita. It may not work on a small screen, but it goes smoothly on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The film's message is very positive. <br /> <br /> Music in the movie is usually pop, some instrument pieces (I expect my hand to sound a day, even though I have seriously suspected). <br /> <br /> All together I am a movie with a sensational feel, and I can not easily find it (you should take my word for it). For this and more I give this film solid 8/10.
