The film has a great sense of equality with movies with the best soundtrack. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm for making movies and entertaining. This film is not the best time I saw it, but I decided it was one of the best movies I have ever seen three times. It happens in New York, and will go through his lifestyle. With his girlfriend (Diaz) he finds Delilani in his life. He goes into desperation and then goes with the imaginary mixture. This film is beyond my expectations and is one of Cruise's finest films!
