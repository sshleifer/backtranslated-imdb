I admire the love and the lovely brothers! Only 3 years after the release of this film, how did I get to see this great movie? This made me laugh, it made me cry and it warmed my heart into reality. Big time. <br /> <br /> The cast is awesome - in the lead role - great for acting characters, great for dialogue, and dialogues are great & I feel that the films of the Ferrari Brothers are often underestimated - they are not comical - they are enthusiastic ! <br /> <br /> I love someone: Keep them free, let them be - try to share their passion and pain and always have one another truth. <br /> I'm not a sports adversary. But in this movie - Vibes are available to you. I could not smell the baseball atmosphere. Finally, the film should be a sports fan and you have to know the cool family fans. <br /> <br /> Many thanks, Pete & Bob! <br /> <PS: If you do not - please check the Kingfin!
