Abhay Deol meets the glamorous Soha Ali Khan and loves her "Hello Sister"! It was praised by Shivam Nayar. Soha, a middle-class girl Nainital fled from her house and married her lover, Shayan Munshi, to Delhi. But Shyon Soho has sincerely left and is alone in the big bad world. . Abhay, next to the lower class, will become protected by Soho's side and helps her get a job & shelter in a care home. Slowly romance flowers and agrees to marry Soha Abhay. <br /> <br /> Shi'yan goes back to Soho's life. <br /> <br /> The gorgeous movie with a very extraordinary story is a romantic film in Delhi, revolving around sensual Soha. This well-designed movie has memories, which keeps in mind forever. Awkward first kiss & forgiveness of Abhay apologize; Ahi described Soh as "class valley laddy" and "she does not love her"; <br /> <br /> Music is good and the background music is great. The sound track disappears in the scenes that lost the track of Abhe Sooth. <br /> <br /> The sharp end, bitter sweet pictures, will last for a long time. I will rate 8.5 / 10
