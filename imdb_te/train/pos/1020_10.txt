"Stargate SG-1" is the band's inter-galactic explorations named SG-1 followed by a device called Stargate and all surprises awaiting the other side of the Wormhole. This is the first few seasons when I first came to this series, and I saw this episode last time. I do not know how good this series really is after 10 years. My old opinion is that range is great, but my opinion is not true. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just a simple science fiction series, one of the most well-made, well-made, interesting, and longest, fantastic sci-fi. And why? <br /> <br /> The value of this array is most likely to exceed the film based on the television, the medium, the appropriate premise, and the image time limit. It is exciting to see the familiar concept of the series, the characters and their circumstances for a long time, and increase the ability to stop just disbelief, and this is the result of the excellent writing and dedication of all the groups. <br /> <br /> "Stargate SG-1" kept great adventures in the 10 years, but never challenged the plot-moving challenge and led to a very different time period of performance. <br /> <br /> 4th / 5th Perhaps the first few seasons, the planets and the different scenarios are focused on searching, the episodes are unrelated to each other, with the Goyal threat always coming. <br /> <br /> From the 5th to 7th, most part of the episodes fight against Goal and prevent the earth from attacks. The search for planets after these seasons was almost always a pretext for replacing Gold's / Replacator / Orio clashes with SG-1. <br /> <br /> The 8th season is probably the most mixed. It has a stream of episodes containing small land subjects, in which Stargate is rarely mentioned, but in the final episodes there are some great replicator moments. <br /> <br /> Since the 9th and 10th have a single new enemy and Jack O'Neill. They are good sequels, but the first few parts of the 10th season are a little weak because they are less than SG-1 and lose the battle of human / jaffna war in the battle. Usually, after Season 7, it is insulting in many ways due to the potential and mystery of each planet (episode) which has led to exploration; On the other hand, the nature of the show's nature is still designed for the greatest episodes of continuing and ongoing conflicts, which shows how the authors look great and brave. </ p> It is good to have a good level, I can feel that I have the feeling; There is plenty to offer all the great experts and series of people involved. <br /> <br /> 'It's a little harder to find out when it ends. The big picture, however, is drawn by the work of hundreds of people over a 10-year period, a scene of beauty, team dedication, best actors and characters we always remember as a collective called SG-1.
