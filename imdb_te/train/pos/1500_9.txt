Many days now, many people do not see classic movies. Most of the friends only watch movies from the '90s shows. It will be very difficult. <br /> <br /> Many old films are unique masterpieces in their own way. Only because, when these films are thought and made back, when those ideas are fresh. Now people are distorted to think of new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie. For true fans of classic horror. This is for you. The film has investigated the disappearance of a movie actor from Scotland Yard and stumbles on three other strange events with the same residents of the same house. <br /> I can not say no more, I will destroy the existing film. But it is a wonderful movie for the old age. Forget it again!
