It's the best TV movie of all time! I'm a big silverstone fan because I said this? Partially, but without her, I still see it. I'm a fan of serial killer style films, and believe in a great entry in this category. Also, Mary Giordano was easily replaced by Alicia's first five character creations. Completely memorable - she really exists. If I have a mystery, I'm also on my side. She plays a role in her real life. Sweet, honest, nice ... she is in real life. So what is that acting? Yes, indeed, she is again a sort of rebel. At this time she was not bad, she was very nice and feared a bit to do the things that appear on the act. But she did not have things that would make her simple teenager. Instead, she spent her time reading Detective Mags and solved crimes. There is plenty of cliche: her father's death is a different way than the vigilant-style. At that time, Alicia played the same characters: a rebellious, seductive, single parent, a loner. This also happens here, but she is not a bit attractive at this time. It does not matter; She's still cool as a nerd. Soon check this, or you do not have to investigate why Giordano will be ...
