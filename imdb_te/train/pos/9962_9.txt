I was scared a bit to watch this movie due to its rates. But living like Italy titles like this always come across and love so step I decided to give it a try. I was amazed! This story is different from other dance-images I've seen recently, in a deep sense than just "winning". It is touching and well written and directed. Raya is such a strong character that she never doubted herself, she was mature and focused and she had a Talent's Aware (and Talent Rutina Wesley, my jaw dropped in the final dance scene). She chases her dream, refuses her, honestly and inspires. Also, the fact that she is not a normal super hot chic (Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Joe Seldana ... see) makes her really attractive and real. Seriously, why is this film too small? You can understand it in the first 5 minutes that it's a good job. Really good. I cried at the end of the film too. And dancing routines are just sick.
