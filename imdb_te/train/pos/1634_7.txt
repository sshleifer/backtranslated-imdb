I first caught the film in HBO (probably) in 1981 and at the age of 15 I thought this film was a happy one. Keep in mind that I have not seen Alfred E. Neumann imagery shown in the theatrical trailers. When I read the Mad Magazine movie and stopped half way through apologies from the "general gang", they were sarcastically dismissed by such satirical images and I thought they were fun, I'm sure I find it hard to find them (and Ron Libman) are not embarrassing to remove their names from any credits, I am very hopeful Caryapaddadu. There are definitely too much worse associated with movies. Now the image you see in the video (at the age of 32), the MAD Reference has been renewed, and I'm still kick out. And I think it's a crown gem of performances because it's a Ron libman fan (hot rock, wear papa?) (Say iga AGAAAAIN)
