An amazing film featuring Thadveus O'Sullivan's magnificent performance from the host of British and Irish actors. The film describes the boredom of the film and effectively captures the 1970s Belfast's depression and horror atmosphere. Surprisingly realism does nothing to glorify either side of this dispute. On the one hand, a young Catholic father tries to increase his family. On the other hand, it deals with a loyal gang with the intention of promoting violence. Very interesting and, fortunately, entertaining. While no laughs, do not expect it. 10 to 7.
