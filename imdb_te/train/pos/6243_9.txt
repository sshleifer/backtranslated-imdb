A picture about the cruelty of this world. I found it free because of the truth. It has some very funny bits. Some of the acting are exceptional, for example Maria Hofstarter. The director tried to succeed as much as possible, in real life. Obviously, sex scenes are obvious and are not more fake than hard-core imagery. Although I could not understand a word because dubbing half the great actors lost, I found the image of the original language in the original language with the title of the subtitle. Maria is very difficult to duplicate by voice dubber played by Hofstarter. <br /> My favorite movie
