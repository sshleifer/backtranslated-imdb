A great picture! Slow: Yes. <br /> ... the original, deep atmosphere, dark and horror, full (feels like a nightmare). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A bit of Jodorovskiy (Fando y lis) ... <br /> <br /> Some night on Earth, Angel Hart and Bj√∂sten, P, a bit (which is wrong to tell Tetsuo?), Burke 's The Forbidden and Salome - At least a dark night feeling when combined ... Niue NOIRE. <br /> You are for avantegardistic and / or surreal cinema I like (I like) you like this. <br /> <br /> Final Words: The plot is very strange and unusual and it probably is why most people who do not like this # are hating it.
