This film was almost never good in the last week and at that time (around 6pm) the quality of the movies (at least here on the Mexican TV), I could switch off the TV. The story about Madelen Moore really strikes you. She does not come across very sympathetic character at first, but seeing the whole movie, you need her succeed. The film is really thinking. And I think mainly because of Brook Johnson's great acting. I had never heard of her before or saw her in another movie, but it was a great act. Congratulations to Brooke. I hope to see her in another movie soon.
