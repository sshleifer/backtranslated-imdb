Forget this as the "B" image. Forget that it's too late. Instead the title (1950) give a very qualified credit to writer-director Ida Lupino to fix one thing which is taboo in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The first film to resolve my feelings, rape and emotional and psychological effects is the same crime. Its victims are guilty. <br /> <br /> Although casting's performance is far better, Mala Powers, eighteen or nineteen at that time, has been the best performer to try to escape from his "humiliation" by Anne, a wounded young man. Based on her work in the film, I am surprised that she does not have a more successful acting career. <br /> <br /> Tom Andrews also has some good moments as minister in minister to help him. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lupino follows a series of streets and harbors, and police sequences that led to rape of some memorable scenes still in mask, working on a limited budget. And, she has created a sweet bitter end leaving me wondering if she really has a normal life again anytime.
