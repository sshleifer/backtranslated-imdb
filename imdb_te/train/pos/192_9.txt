In front of the show people, silent comedy, my opinion is only a slapstick and a slapstick. I can not imagine how the screen comedy is possible without relying on the spoken word or the many protests. But this amazing movie made me wrong. Davis, in my view, is probably a great comedian before Lucille Ball. Davis's habits and facial expressions Although I was not one of the primary effects of Davy's ball, I reminded Lucy that I was reminded of her when I was surprised. It comes from 21 years old who has never seen a silent comedy before, and I'm not really bored with specific-specific instructions (I can not, not clear) over time. You're probably more laughing than most talkie comedies. This is not only my favorite silent comedy, but easily between my ten favorite comedians.
