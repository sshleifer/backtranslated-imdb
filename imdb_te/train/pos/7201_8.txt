Trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running from a very good dramatic comedy idea about a playwright. Without giving up the story, you can not say much about this film. I can say this is as small as you see the movie. Everyone has its own agenda. Good surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. Well written all the good performances.
