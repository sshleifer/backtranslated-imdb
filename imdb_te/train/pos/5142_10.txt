It's easy to make really simple comments about this movie. It was one of the only Japanese films from this age, in fact it was "the Japanese movie started" and "never created the West." The second of these two comments is certainly incorrect, because Kinagassa admitted that he had "kaligari" killed in more than one occasion. But the style is intended to imitate, and this film is not far from the importance. Opening doors for the true intelligent layers of the compositions, stories and facts that we have here are experimental themes and built-in visual styles. For this purpose, maths is the correct setting, and the authors know it. This is a milestone film, and should make every effort to track it. <br /> 5 out of 5 - Important
