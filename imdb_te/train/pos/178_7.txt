"Protocol" is a bully cocktail waiter who plays a hit and miss picture Goldie Hein, one night a visit to save Arab life from a murder attempt. Woman will soon become a celebrity, and U.S. Getting a new job for the government. Will the power corridors be identical at all in the capital of our country? "Protocol" Hawn is as amazing as ever, although her best movie "Private Benjamin" is not as funny. But it's still a good movie, and I'm laughing. <br /> <br /> *** (From four)
