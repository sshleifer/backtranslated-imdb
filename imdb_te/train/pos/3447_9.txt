I do not like the director much more than Mamoru Oshio. But unfortunately, he has directed a lot of internationally acclaimed directors, but it has broken into his films. <br /> <br /> One of the fiercest of one, and although I like it to bits, it is not difficult to see why distributors in the West are contrary to the release. <br /> <br /> Among his big and serious films, Oshi is known to make some small and agile projects. While Tachiguishi certainly comes into this category, Oshii is really outdeone with this one, creating something very difficult to classify, like a independently Japanese film. <br /> There is a video documentary at its core. However, in order to create a fool of the existing subculture, Oshi inventes his own, enters the life of culinary leaders, avoids food and defends the Japanese culinary level. Oshi's approach to the topic is intimate with Dai-Nipponzin, and the subject is a grave sense of gravity when it comes to the joke of the images on the screen. <br /> <br /> But it decided not to paint his melomanier ocean, but to create a new visual method through baptism supermivision. Unnatural blend of live action, photograph, digital animation and a stick on toys. <br /> <br /> The Japanese animation industry will showcase the greatness and acting (or if you wish) to be less budgeted than the project could be. It's just about, the movie knows that it's too dialogue-heavy, making it a good companion piece for the innovation. The influence of Griffers analyzes all kinds of cultural, political and philosophical aspects, with persistent speeches and conversations eliminated by the audience. And to make it even worse, the whole picture is entirely based on realistic Japanese history and customs, making it more difficult for a foreigner to get a good hold on the subject. <br /> <br /> "After the war, Many guns have been introduced, such as Japan's most influential historians, and the film is expected to get out of any other prominent documentary, but some of the large and wildly animated cut-out photography organs are not very intense. Oshi Regular Kenji Kuwai takes a cake like a nose ring wearing a fast-food chains, along with pretty comic performance, from the atmosphere and the dark, from the absurd, the eerie and the comedy.It is very fun from exaggerated sounds and effects, complete with animation and the rest of the rest </ P> <p> Visually the image is very atmosphere, animation   ా అరుదైనది మరియు సమర్థవంతమైనది అయినప్పటికీ, కాలానుగుణంగా అతి చురుకైన విచిత్రత్వాన్ని కరిగించడానికి మాత్రమే తగ్గించబడుతుంది. ఇది సరిగ్గా చెడ్డ విషయం కాదు, తచిగుయిషీ ఎలా సంభాషణ-బరువైనది. అయినప్పటికీ, ఈ చలనచిత్రం ఇంకా దృశ్య కళాఖండాన్ని కలిగి ఉంది, ప్రతి ఫ్రేమ్ పూర్తిగా లష్కితంగా కనిపిస్తోంది మరియు చిత్రం యొక్క సాధారణ వాతావరణాన్ని సరిదిద్దడానికి మరియు మెరుగుపరచడానిక Is sufficient. <br /> <br /> Be careful, because Tachiguishi demands a lot from the viewer. If you do not speak Japanese, there are a lot of readings to be read and some cultural references are some of the attention. On top of that, the image area monologues are very spread out and hard to follow. The film still does not have English subtitles and even though my French is mostly enough to get what it's all about, I'm sure definitely missed the quality points of the film! <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not an easy image to get the picture, but around half it reaches the steam and does not let it from there. I still hope to see this one again with English or Dutch subs. <br /> <br /> "There is quite a bit that I ask for a shaded anime dub, to appreciate the ocean in another fantastic film, a rare movie to combine a lot of styles and effects, creating such a distinctive and still working. It looks and fills with great sounds and creativity.You can see all the details in the first sight <br /> <br /> "The rest of Europe (and the rest of the Western world) still stands out of the film The French were not surprised when the emblem was still waiting. But for those like Oshii, to appreciate the powder and playful humor and creative spirits, even if it is not possible, it can only be confused. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
