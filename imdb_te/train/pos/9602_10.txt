Darius Goes West is portraying American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. This spectacular fun filled and sometimes removing heart shows a young man who is unexpected, but his lovely Athens wants to see what is outside the GA restrictions. Darius wanted to see the sea. His longtime friends Logan, Ben and many friends decided to make the truth of Darius's wish. Ben and Logan's mother launched an email campaign to educate Darius's situation: Duchy's muscle weakness and daras not only to be seen in the ocean, but to raise funds to see this great United States. Young college buddies claim to be successful in bringing hope and awareness to this terrible disease. They realized Darius's dream and then some. They have spent their lives when Darrius shows love, attention and tons of fun when she helps Darius to show the same qualities for others suffering from Dmd. Doris is a volunteer for the Red Cross - sitting outside his local grocery store in his chair (with his friends). His amazing smile tells the world that dreams are true - all you need is a group of friends and friends who support and care for you. Darius and all the guys give an Oscar - no one deserves it more.
