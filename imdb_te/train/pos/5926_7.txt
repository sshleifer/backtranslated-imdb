Sleepwalkers are living creatures that live in survival from humans ... but they can only use virgins (why this is not explained). Charles Brady (Bryan Cross) eats his mother Mary (Alice Krieg). He goes after Tanya (Madchen Amik) who liked. <br /> <br /> "Fast-paced, bloody and gore are plenty and a nice, twisted humor humor. Rock once stated) and thought he would be cast after "Return to the Blue Lagoon", such as Cruise and Amik. <br /> <br /> It was written on screen by Stephen King and it is unclearly unclear. Why are they called? Why do they give birth to the mother? Why do the cats hate them and kill them? What are their powers after all (a cross will disappear when a car disappears and color and style!) Why only need the virgins? Why is the son with his mother? This is really bad, because the questions that are on the side, this is a terrific horror movie. The script is only good. Also, a very clear sexual scene between the cross and the Krege is modified (to tell you) to get an R rating. I can only give this 7.
