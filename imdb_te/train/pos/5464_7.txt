Baby Face - Notorious Barbarah Stanwick Flick says she has the authority to be a local professor - she tries to read Nietzsche- her books have never been better. Her father is primarily pimping local politicians and others outside her. Finally she had enough and went to the big city. We follow the trail of men who succeeded in an international bank. The dialogue is time-consuming and it's the last films that came before a self-promoted Hollywood production code. Watch for a guest role by John John Wayne, one of Stanwick's willing victims. Part of the Forbidden Hollywood collection - I've seen an extended version - plus a red-headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge for DVD. Interesting image and evidence for the future Femal Fatalal characters. Stanwick would play in the movie Noir Era. B +
