It has been widely viewed in Australia for the best police dramas ever produced ... for my money, anywhere. It's raw, sand, characters are real and the conditions are notorious and should not be away from the dark side of life every day cops and criminals, victims, lawyers and other people in their various orbits. This program has been broadcast in 2 seasons and has never been sold out because the show has been discontinued. We have forgiven us to forgive: However, like the Faith Towers, we respect this with a high-quality array of uniform quality.
