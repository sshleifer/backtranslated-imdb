This is not "loose", but the 1958 Monique's classic "I'm Sooty Ignati", a perfect and reliable remake of Maestroyeni, Gassman and Cardinal. It's nice, it's all funny characters and plots <br /> <br /> I've seen an amazing old version many times and I know all the gangs and unfolding but I still have "Welcome to Collinwood", its own freshness and atmosphere. It's interesting to see how in the 1950s Italy it has acquired the lives and ways of small pirates to USA 2002. Things have not changed too much. 8/10.
