The holy garbage is very silly! American comedies are not these? Anyone who thinks comedy is ridiculous - is more intellectual and intellectual in the six episodes of this series than the novel shelf! Hugh Laurie is a full owl. I can not believe that house is the same! You have a lot of great lines and gags in this series to see dozens of performances and still pick new things every time. Rowan Atkinson was a lively veteran, buttler put on Edmund. This is my favorite of all Blackdard series. And as the somewhat gentle heart of the Tony Robinson series, the ever-awesome, "Depressed Mass" Baldick. Some of my favorite lines are: "If anyone is going through Wellington, he really keeps his feet" and Bilderc explains how he got his name and relative MacDader "top kipper trader" and how to get homicide knives from Scotland.
