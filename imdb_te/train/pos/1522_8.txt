Hubbar all the movies became popular in the seventies. I do not like them too much, but this is an undeniably amazing slice of a British horror movie. Blood Dripped Blood Horror Omnibus, which has four stories around the creepy old house and is said to be an estate agent Scotland Yard officer. <br /> <br /> The film is well-known actors of three horror films; Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt, amongst which horror fans are always regarded as one of Lee's co-stars in the Great British horror film; The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film entitled "Method for Murder" tells the story of a horror storyteller whose creation; A stranger called "Dominic" was brought to life by his own imagination. This story has created a very good suspense; Through his girlfriend, he led, and led the audience to believe that he is an imagination of his imagination. This story is not very original, but this is due to the lack of realism through the atmosphere created and this is the last twist; <br /> The second story titled "Wax Works", Peter Cushing Actors and four of my favorite dances. This story follows Philip Grayson (Kushing), which finds a wax museum and decides to enter in, finds a woman he knows best and then we find the softening. The woman's relationship with Philip was not really explained, but the mysteriously relied on to build a suspense over the stories. After Cushing, his friend, Neville Rogers (played by Jas Ackland), and this story is actually going to start. The alignment of the magnus museum full of murderers for the horror film is not a new idea; The same setting was used for the great impact of the superb 1966 horror film, "Chamber of Horrors". Although the film is not as grand as one of the above-mentioned films, this set's power is used for less horrific effects, most of which can be achieved through the concept of claustrophobia, a limited area museum. Peter Cushing is always interesting to watch, and he finds him to avoid a madman chopping a dish for a chopping fan. <br /> <br /> The film starts with "Sweets for the Sweet", which continues without Omnibus's finest doubt. This story featured a legendary Christopher Lee as a seemingly unadulterated father. The beauty of this story comes in the way it is played. It guesses the audience; We know that we have something wrong with our father or daughter, but we do not know who or who does not know. Christopher Lee, in general, plays a role in his role of sinfulness; Audience is joking on her actions about giving a daughter to her daughter, and she is not allowed to go to school or have toys. Finally, finally, closely closer to the chest, is really cited by the chilling line, in which Lei tells his daughter about his daughter. <br /> <br /> The ending of this section is amazing, one of the best finishes for any horror story mentioned in my opinion, you will stay for a long time after the final credits roll. <br /> <br /> Omnibus "The Clock", which is exactly four jokes. The story is a humorous horror film actor who is out of frustration in the technical part of his latest film, going out and buys himself a garment. Naturally, this dress turns into a real bloodthirsty dress. Unlike the other three stories, it seems to have acted more laughs. The majority of humor is funny because it's no bad thing and the rest of the movie works as a good contrast. The ending of the story ends with the ending of the film's rolling story, which is a lot more humorous and funniest with a much better and better comedy. Also, look for a little gibber about Christopher Lee in Dracula. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want to become a horror amnibus, you can not really make a mistake with the broken house. Only the third story makes your time worthy, and this is really a great horror movie.
