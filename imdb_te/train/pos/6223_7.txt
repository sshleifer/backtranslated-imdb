From a modern sensibility, it's sometimes hard to see old movies. It is annoying that the stereotypical wallflower librarian has to take off her glasses and become a pretty and stupid one-guy winning. Especially such a shallow and glorious man. He is obviously a player (I do not believe she is not true), who looks silent attractive women and always calls them "baby" (ek!). After she completely altered her appearance and her life, after another woman rejects (she) just goes to her and Coney finds her money to rebuild her boat. I wanted to save him, and after him I was chasing him! His sudden conversion in a few minutes was totally unreal and I did not work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Sailors can not dance with one another? (You can say they came from San Francisco ... D) "rehearsal" dance is great, it is great to see Ginger Rogers fall in "right stairs" and look. The final dance scene is "Face the Music" with beautiful costumes and art deco set on the set. I really enjoyed "Sea Saw the Sea" (though they have used it very much as they recognize their best songs). <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit weaker, much like the music (IMO) - and songs are ok but the dance is valuable for the film. <br /> <br /> It is unusual for Hitler to know what he's already doing and watching such a hearty navy. Time. I try to suspend all the knowledge that indulge into a fictional fantasy land.
