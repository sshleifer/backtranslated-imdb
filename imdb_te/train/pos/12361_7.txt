Bellocchio refers to it as a political film, a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy, but it looks more metaphor than realism. Well, the film seems almost like metaphor. The revolutionaries, in whom we see, may be Mafioso, even if we learned little about anyone. <br /> <br /> Andreas' Papa, a psychologist, is the norm of the traditional traditional bourgeois - morally upright, pure, pure and tidy, completely customary. Gilliania, a revolutionary girlfriend, needs a reason to support very badly, but the commitment of a devotion can not accommodate demands. (I'm guessing here.) Andrea, an adolescent boy, is the only guy in the film who is not in some unrealistic way "upatz." He was respected but very disobedient to his father. Although he is not old enough to learn how to manage his reflex, he loves Giulia, or as he hopes, but he leaves school to show him in school and finish his final tests. His course of this hostile lifestyle is described as "media". He is in the middle, and when he reads about him, he knows who he is, and who knows how to be cool. <br /> <br /> Many people have been used during the oral part of his final <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> > It brings us - knows - to Marushka Detmars. She recalls the New Yorker cartoon a few years ago. Two hippos are neck-deep in the river, drinking yards from the bank, and a hippo says "I hate her". She is a good actress. (Let me go that way) but there are also everyone in this film. In her speech and manner, she is filled with her, the great sophistication of mystery. And it's not from the actress, not with the help of the director. Determars Catherine DeNeuve is nuts in the "repulsion" is not nuts. The walls do not revert to the rubber and the arms do not grow. Instead, we see her animated - sometimes very animated. <br /> <br /> She suddenly changes her feelings and gives her astounding jolts when she is concerned. <br /> <br /> A reviewer described her as scared, but it was probably not the word he was searching for. Her soft brown hair, with a white smile she made with her bread, drowns herself. And her eyes are like eyes in paintings on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs. Sexy parts are pretty romantic, because one of them is clear, but because we have learned about the characters. (It is more interesting to spy on the next flurry of the honeymoon couple than to go to a skin image.) Actually not too sex. There is only one scene of simulation mating but allows the director to act in real time. <br /> <br /> The young man playing Andrea is very good, this is a necessary thing, because the film is almost entirely dependent on him and Giulia. They should carry it and they will. Although it is not for their performances, I'm not sure I'll be so interesting or stunning. <br /> <br /> It turns out easily, slowly, into boring and sexy. <br /> It is worth it.
