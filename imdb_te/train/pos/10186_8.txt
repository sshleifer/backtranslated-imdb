Well, I know that India has not done this project in a good project. But the whole theme of the film is not India, it is power. The power of a warrior and the power of the mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son will swallow you up in their warmth. Then things terribly wrong. Nandini and her father's law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and the changed lives of the film's strengths. Compared to Karisma Kapoor's performance, Shahrukh Khan's performance is just a cadet. It's easy to retrieve love, violence and lives in the film, and find yourself sigh of relief and sadness in the climax. Music relations strengths, believable and well done.
