I took my 19-year-old daughter with me to watch this interesting exercise in film production. I'm always keen to get the views and opinions of a different generation of films, especially if I'm with such a hatred. And it's nice to get an unjudged impression from those who are not able to reach "every film she's watching". We are proud to say that both really enjoyed it and considered it as a successful mom / daughter evening. So far, what would we collect as compared to the brains of the brain dead "chick flick", what are we experiencing as a census? <br /> <br /> Eighteen directors were asked to build every little book about the city's Paris arrodinances, which I did not visit in the 20 years. But I wanted to. They are connected by joining the shots, and the world's most captivating romantic capital in the city of culture is referred to different ways of love in the city. Some movies work better than others, but as other reviewers have said, it does not come too far in Kitsch. Some are funny, some are secret, some are confusing and some are plain puzzling (I'm still trying to figure out some deep interior truth of the "Flying Tiger, Hidden Dragon" salon) means some are just fun and probably not meant to be probably (for example Vampire and Tourism.) My criticism about the whole film is probably perennial Â£ Paris is very good. It's also cold, wet, fog, different and vulnerable, or, in the summer, baking hot and many tourists consider you as a sardine, hours of queuing to see each attraction. But I am not picking up. <br /> <br /> My personal favorites are Coen Brothers, who portrayed the TuVillers metro station, and a stunning tourist writer Steve Bassemy. Buscemi is absolutely accurate, accurate and funny funny. I also enjoyed the piece about two MIME artists, which is close to being perversely sequences cutesy - definitely teetered on the edge of the kits, but it just stayed right on the side. Getting insight from the encounter with Rufus Sewell and Emilie Mortimer's Oscar Wilde is very different from me, and Juliet Binohe's trying to cope with the death of his young son made me uncomfortable. I'm a Bob Hoskins / Funny Shield piece, and Ben Gazzora / Jenna Rowlands have a bit flat, but Maggie Gyllenhall is good (she has a market in the junkers? I saw Sherry baby last week.) <Br> But I have two "social justice" pieces I want a good way). This is the first film I had read on the first day that I had to leave her own child in the movie. And then the film about African migrants, a youth, stuck in the street before the new paramedic and struggles to exist in the fringes of a different society that dies. Another murder statistic is that thousands of migrants in the world die in the fight to gain a better experience each year. <br /> <br /> Last picture, 14th aromatement, Margo Martindale How does the postal worker tell the story of his first trip to Paris? Very badly in French? Her night school has moved me to the French class. The perfect ending is, though not a good, witty, great, picture. <br /> <br /> Paris Ja Taeeme is a cherished idea, but it's great.
