I liked this movie. It's great. It has everything: cars, gun shooting, fighting, and even token girl. This excludes cars and none of these things is exclusively excluded. Shooting a bit, a bit of struggle, a little bit of hitting around, and a lot of car, a great hunt in the end. The jump, you can say, is impossible, but at IMDB here is possible according to our good friends, so the picture is not as bad as it is. It has some quality, and I liked to watch. Actually I liked the movie. And I do not need to stop my brains to see it. I never thought "Could it be possible?" Or tramp like that. 9 out of 10
