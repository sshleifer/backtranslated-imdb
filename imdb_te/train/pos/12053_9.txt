Well the complete ghost story that creeps and gives you some pretty white fears along the way. The story goes slowly and builds the atmosphere as long as you are ready to see a black woman. You will not forget her after you see her. No gore, no knives, hockey masks - a well-built story to watch the night out of lights.
