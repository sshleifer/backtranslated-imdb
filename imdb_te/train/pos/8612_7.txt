I totally disagree with other comments posted in this movie. For example, the film depends on the book and if the author has a gay character then how "Hollywood" could just throw in a Token Gay role in the movie. And there are two gay characters and I thought each other reflected great. A simple and other feminine but not above. And Diane Keaton gave a brilliant performance and her role was developed by her character, as if the other critic had a DCCC to see the overall picture in reality. For example, when she and Adam went to see the car crashing down in the junkyard, you could look at her maternity and then she saw that she was also invincible. I guess if this picture is wrongly flawed while you worry about gay characters and characters incorrectly. If you are more open-minded and do not know what I really have some instructions on what's good then you will enjoy this movie.
