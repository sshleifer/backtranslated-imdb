"Bend It Like Beckham" is the lowest response in the United States. This film is probably British in dialogue and vocabulary and a lot of talks with football and many people here have a lot of trouble in the US, which is very unfortunate because this film is absolutely fantastic and more qualified here. Based on the storyline (following a dream), many people are involved and finally, "Bend It Like Beckham" proved to be inspired and good acting as a good inspiration movie. I'm not very happy to see this film at first, but now I can not see it soon. I highly recommend this film!
