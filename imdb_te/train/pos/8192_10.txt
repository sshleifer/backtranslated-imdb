The two parts are amazing - the best from the series. Strict bits of the story have been pinched from past films, but these days what TV shows do not. What has happened to us here is a good science fiction story. A great big (really scary) monster is imprisoned at the base of a deep pit, voded some excellent aliens - the best "new" aliens in the revived series, with a set of sympathetic and believable human characters (with the completion <br /> <br /> Truth Star Trek Unnamed "fashioned" security people in fashion), some large-scale philosophical themes (love, fidelity, universe No, etc.) and some of the special effects are top-drawer. Every minute I liked it.
