This is one of my all-time favorite. Great music and some funny bits. I laugh every time at Millie, the maid who catches her handsome hanky while chatting, and uncutly polishes the furniture with her as a chat. <br /> <br /> The two youngsters, who had seen Frank Sinatra at the same time at the theater, Came out. She said she did not clear "Bobby-Sucks" between films (in those days you are not leaving between shows). The film shows you how attractive and attractive to the young franchise and allows you to appreciate his initial talent. And Victor Borzie gets in his usual bit in his bonus. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasant movie with a sweet, simple storyline. Very enjoyable.
