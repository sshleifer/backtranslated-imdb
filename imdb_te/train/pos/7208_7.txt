The playwright Sidney Brule (amazingly over the top Michael Caine) shot for the hit play. Enter the young fairy kid (a solid reeve), who just wrote a play. This is Bruhl's excessive crazy wife (played by Canon) and a German psychic (very funny Irene Worth) and you have a fantastic funny suspense film for yourself. <br /> <br /> "standards", "Deathtrap" is not a low-capacity twist-filled comic suspense ride based on a fantastic game by Ira Levin. <br /> <br /> The studio loses a bit of Midway, and ends with a field day with a calendar as it expires. The joyful one in the original drama but the whole "Deathtrap" is solid, well-played and fun with curiosity.
