I really enjoyed this film as a little boy. At that age I thought the silly baseball pranks were funny and thought it was "cool" because the movie was about. Now, many years later, I can look back and see what's a well-designed movie. The film opened my eyes to other children's struggles and a small child for real world problems. This kind of exposure is high, I do not think the kids are in the interest of our movies these days. Absolutely the baseball pranks are now really dumb, but they are fascinated by the kids. 7 year olds encourage children under the age of seven, but they ask a movie about baseball. <br /> <br /> Al and other angelic performances as a young man are much less impressive, but I will give credit. Both have done an amazing job for all the actors who play the children and Danny Glover.
