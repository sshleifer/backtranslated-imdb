This is very dating, but this is part of the charm with the 1933 film. You can say for most pre-co-movies; They are just different, usually in an interesting way. <br /> <br /> It's a short time, Spencer Tracy's great performance and beautiful face and sweetness of the character of Lauretta Young. <br /> You will find it hard to find a nice girl than a "Thanna" ,! (She began acting as a little boy, and they quickly reverted to movies in the old days). While the film was very soft, the camera Loretta's face and eyes zoomed several times, and Tracy's "Bill" was slowly transformed into a grateful love for Trina, playing Crouchetti Man with a tumultuous perspective of life. <br /> Although they have little roles, actors support Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambaeau, Arthur Holl and Glenda Farrell, a 75-minute film. <br /> <br /> I am attracted to the role of Connolly as the protagonist / father's father camp. <br /> <br /> This story is a short distance - hey - it's movies. The story is the two single Great Depression victims who are trying to live in a "Hooverwill" camp, and it makes a very touching storyline.
