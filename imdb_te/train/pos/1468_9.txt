No reviewer has any understanding of the cultural, literary, or psychological criticism of the reviewer who reviewed "the person already smelled and spitting." He dismissed Zizek's interpretations, as the director did not appear "in line" with the original intention. What is that? The importance of the intent of the director (or the writer) is not important in the complex theory. This is called the "Intensive Policy" of the author and should not be avoided. <br /> <br /> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy A text or movie is analyzed by several theories, one of which disagrees with one another and completely ignores the author's intent. <br /> <br /> Whoever wastes time and effort to insult Zizek as the wall of text is written. In fact, anyone studying the theory can instantly insult this person's opinion (I also suggested to you) that it is completely off. <br /> If you are interested in Freudian, you must have a Latin or Christian lecture. These ideals connect with popular pictures, read or think about them and make them more appealing and enjoyable.
