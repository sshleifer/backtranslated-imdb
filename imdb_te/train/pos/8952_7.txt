Gillian Horody (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she attracted most common neighbors to Shep Henderson (James Stewart). Sheppay spells a spell, dropping her fiancé and falling for her. Gillian goes through a lot of fun until it learns to really care for this man. She decides to tell her the secret. But how does Shep react when he learns that he falls in love with Gilead? <br /> <br /> When the comedians went through the 1950s, the book and candle were good, but not spectacular. It is an enjoyable enough watch and should sit down with it and appeal to almost anyone. Do not get into a film that looks great from a sliced ​​bread. At the beautiful, funny of the film, and touching at the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart are their best and have some real chemistry. A poor sort of Novak (others pointed out) is quite incredible. The supporting cast featuring Jack Lemmon, Hermione Jinggold, and Elsa Launcestor is often a laughing spotlight from Navk and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that the book and the candle can not determine what kind of film they want. Is this a screwball joke? Is this a romantic comedy? Is this a supernatural joke? If director Richard Quinn sat down with just one approach, the film could be even better and more memorable.
