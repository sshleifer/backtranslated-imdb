I have seen the movie Holes and that it should be the best film all year round. It brings children in everyone. Who will come to think of digging up troubled children as their punishment? Who is Luis Sachar? Even though it is different from the book, it's still pretty cool. For example, Caveman / Stanley is the largest of the two. Weight knowledge and height wise but ZigZag / Ricky is long and Armpit / Theodor is big. Even X-Ray / Rex should not be one of the youngest boys. The only thing I do not like about the film is that the past backs are rather persuasive and long. Even though I have seen more than ever in my opinion is only my opinion. I especially like working with boys. Jake is regarded as a moody and tough kid, like Squid / Alan, played by M.Smith. Jack M. Smith has performed this and has done almost all of the stars in the holes. If you do not see the holes again then I'll see when you definatly come out of it again or you'll be missing in the whole Lotto fun.
