This is a well-designed movie, well directed and sometimes driven with spectacular acting, sometimes deeply moving - for example the scene with a loyal but absurd wayward cock and his wife. The plot is positively working and exciting. The role of gangster is particularly interesting and plays almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero. <br /> <br /> Some of the reservation: I find a little unilaterally celebrating the successful integration of the hero. The Police and Justice System, the police character that is running up to that point of time, collapses. Even the heroine is a little more than a catalyst for salvation, all she looks like, tough guys are like weeping and fainting like it.
