Altman's "masterpieces" found by some people are now difficult for me. Maybe it's me. Like the last critic, I look like this "low" Altman (recently seen on the FMC), although I do not think he is targeting a wider audience. The company politics is a "microscope" for public campaigns. This sarcastic "docudrama" is like Dick Covet, who is currently looking up the date show, but I have found many dialogue funny and intelligent things (eg, "You're right for this story" is not "deep," but I liked it.The performances are an aging conservative leader Lauren Funny, especially Cavette ("himself"), such as Barcell, Lewen Jackson (who was actually a member of Parliament) En Pagal (left wing saiddhangam) (the opening credits as a reward for virtue in politics), and Kelly Burnett considered a basket case. Unparalleled in all of Altman's style, usually is not asamanamainadi. But pretty inimitable.
