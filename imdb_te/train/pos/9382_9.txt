Red Rock West is hardly one of those hardy noir thrillers that rarely see. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage Michael, a unemployed Texas Rufek, is desperate enough to earn a job. All the way to Wyoming for effective employment. He acts honestly for a mistake, but always on the dark side of duty. <br /> <br /> When Michael failed to get a lucrative job, Michael Red slipped into the bar, where the owner Wayne (JTWalsh) <br /> <br /> Wayne Michael gave a payment to hit the details and hit on the prostitution suicide. Michael accepts this money, then Suzanne is ready to warn her of the impending death. <br /> When destiny sets, Michael does not leave this situation easy. When the violent rainfall starts, he runs Suzanne's lover. Michael Michael is taken to a local hospital where he is also shot dead. <br /> <br /> With the sheriff being lucky and luck, Wayne is also a local law. Michael delivers an escape when he is taken on the final ride and subsequently taken from the "Dallas from Dallas" played by Quirky Dennis Hopper's murdered by Dennis Hopper. After learning that they were fellow navies, Michael claimed that Michael had joined him in a red rock bar for drink. Wayne finds his mistake and soon he and Lyle Michael's hot mask are going to the arms that are waiting for Suzannes. <br /> <br /> When we walked up the pace we Wean and Suzanne really lam for stealing robbers multiple million dollar steal. Central focus, double cross and murders begin with the pictures taken now. <br /> <br /> The film is well-directed. Nicholas Cage is generally less critical, and Dennis Hopper and Laura Flynn Biely have compared their roles with enough ability. J.T. Wahl is awful without appearing. <br /> <br /> Marc Rasoshiskis photography uses several specialty attributes added to the suspense and plot development. The film was further enhanced by John Dol's strenuous directional style and the rapid shooting editing of Morris Chestnut.
