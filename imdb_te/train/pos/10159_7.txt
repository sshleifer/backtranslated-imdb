Movies or movies are very popular in a few years. The Gospel road is one of them. I saw it as a young teen and would like to see again. <br /> <br /> This film is not philosophy or high-quality acting but it touched my heart at the time. I am a Johnny Cash fan and it is a brave venture. If it ever comes on DVD, I will buy it for sentimental reasons.
