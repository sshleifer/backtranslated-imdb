Spanish director August Villaronga is a study on how to develop the troubled young adults who need some psychic tools to deal with their secret psychological weakness, the children who experience violence and loneliness within their remote community in their latest community. These tools create a successful test of how the villagers will be able to influence three young men living in Spain at Franco, while dealing with a high degree of affection, attentiveness to others or putting them on a Mao film, and acting as a male. The three witnesses are bullies who are in trouble before their dual death or their allies and fill their emotions with feelings of weaknesses of their colleagues. The cinematic style of the text is generally visually rich, because you look out of the Spanish frame and work with a sexual desire of fellow Spain Pedro Almod√≥wor, with backgrounds that deal with sexual and gay relationships. The contrast between the two directors is that the supernatural superiority of claustrophobia and sandy reality with the opposite of Almodovar's surrealism, although two styles are the same. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I recommend watching this film, which will be with the audience for a while after viewing.
