They do not believe the romantic drama of the working class from director Martin Ritt, but there are times when Jen Fonda and Robert De Niro are both enjoyable. She is a widow who can not move, he is illiterate and a living room-creator - you can probably predict the rest. Pat Barker is following the novel "Union Street" (better title!), Which dissipates in cartoons, and the album's compilation is a mess but still pleasant; A rosy-hood blue-collar fantasy. The characters were deliberately a bit colored and Leeds lowered an interesting degree, but serious problems (the illiteracy perspective was a plot tool for the next love story) and no real withdrawals were realized. The end is a pure fluff - and cynics will find it difficult to swallow - these two characters deserve a happy ending and the film is not really satisfying any other way. **** from
