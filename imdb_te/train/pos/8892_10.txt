Great, great, great! I have everything I can say about that movie, but I have explained extensively because the IMDB needs at least four lines of text. The cast is so great (Jerry O'Neill is very beautiful!), The music is very great (the best music in the sixties, Imho), the historical factor is interesting and they actually seem to be in the 60's and in the 60s. And for all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes, and it's the drama's greatness. But in a word: great!
