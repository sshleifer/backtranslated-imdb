I first saw this film at the Sundance Film Festival this year, and the film is very appealing as I was young. These kids are in this simple and very unexpected way, but with the right dialogue and waste they succeeded in completing the film. Some have enjoyed the film but I highly recommend releasing and watching this movie. This is a mixture of intriguing remarks and joyful reality. Summing up the essence of the high school, the high school record is topped by my favorite list and hopefully is likely to be released into the theaters. I am truly grateful to the children who have worked hard to make this film, which shook our eyes on my smile.
