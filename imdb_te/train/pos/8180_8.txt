This is an entertaining film. It may actually make you uncomfortable from some undead mental or social, its not your daily doctor. How scary it is. Some of the film received good actors and actresses, but some were not as happy as Virgia Keane. Ken Forren and Schizard Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Benson) trial you reject Rob Zombie's devils are our co-stars of Halloween (2007) as our detective. The smallest essence is this: Dr. Alan Feinstone, a sexy wife, a good man, and a great dentist loves each other. Until he cheated his wife with a pool cleaner. He then had to close all of his patients' teeth and he had the hallucinations of women's patients as he started going to nuts in this thriller. But before that, nice guy.
