Morgan Freeman (who plays himself) and a small, funny, sweet picture of a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Pazz Vega), a full-fledged independent film. For the first ten minutes I was a bit skeptical about the movie, but when I was in the shop I enjoyed the movie. It shows how a positive attitude changes. It does not have any complex plot and it's easy to follow but the moods lift saddest and makes you smile all the way through without the need for the little-clic romance. It will catch you on your sides with laughter. Very rare masterpiece!
