This is a great movie "Mi Anna Call" because it shows why a person has long experienced it without knowing what's wrong with him. Publis for Patty Duke came in the eye and inspired those who suffer from this disease telling her story. I have great respect for her as a person. The thing that I do not like is that I can not get on the tape, I'm looking for it, not achieving success. How does it get to know?
