Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellarr), a current student in Japan, was only a part of a social program who was sent to help Emma (Grace Jabriceki), an elderly semantic-catatonic woman, after her aging, Yoko (Yoko Makki). Disappears. Karen quickly learns that Emma is not in her home, and she says "how deep will the rabbit hole go". <br /> <br /> It is a recent trend that has been delayed since the success of the Night Night Night Shyamalan films, but slow-paced, poorly scary movies. In some cases, such as Hide and Seek (2005), the procedure is exceptionally good and attempts to kill the film in other films, such as White Noise (2005). I hid the grudge and did not like it, but it is still very good - it earns 9 out of 10 people out of me. <br /> <br /> Although Grudge has a couple of significant differences, among other recent examples of this trend. Based on the Japanese film series begun with Zue-On (2000) (especially Zu-on's first half: The Grudge, Aka is very close to Ju-On 3, since 2003). Both, like many Japanese horror films, slowly planting here is like surreal within the scope of a very realistic drama. Most of the European horror is in the case, the grudge should be seen as a more painted nightmare. <br /> <br /> Takashi Shimizu, director of five Japanese entries in Ju-An (fifth in production), and writer Stephen Susco is largely lubricated and do not involve much logic or plot holes when it comes to horror behind the story. The idea of ​​vision here is to present a dreamlike sequence of thought-dream logic, scenarios - scary thought, creepiness, abnormal, and many audiences. This different approach will be used for making filmmaking as to how well you work on how well you work for the movie (though some of the acceptable grooves in the Zu series). Traditionally, American audiences consider hanging "rules" for "monster" and abandon the plot threads left behind. <br /> <br /> However, if you do not use it, it's worth trying to suspend your normal predecessors. Give a shot of movies and the grudge. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It's a big number of "main characters" (better than episodic zu-on 3), good cinematography, narrative, <br /> <br /> Even though it is slowly slow, consider the Jellar outfit that matches the color and shape of Elma's home . In the past your horror film, Passing usually increases the animation and there is no scarcity of tremendous programming to entertain the horror fans. The absurdity of the film's supernatural premise, and based on interviews on DVD with Shimizu, Japanese beliefs and folk have prodded me to pay more attention. <br /> <br /> Even more interesting subtitles come in Japanese with more intimate knowledge of Japanese culture, but it is interesting to see what horrific children and adults who look at horrific children of Japanese horror films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do, but it is also good, and it was 10 to 10. <br /> Now that I have said above, let me finish with Mini Round: I'm not anti-remake, but US distributors and studios think that we need reconstruction of foreign images, suitable for consumption. The original versions of these images should be released in the U.S. theaters. There is no need for a single movie to be featured, but white or foreign actors are not replaced by white American actors. Yes, The Grudge is a good movie, but in the end, I will see something original by using this talent and treat the latest foreign horror films - not only Japanese, but also Indian, Spanish and Chinese - at my multiplex. (1) You can avoid production costs and make domestic delivery agreements you receive, 2) You can earn money by my fans, if you choose foreign movie DVDs in foreign reputation or foreign currency versions.
