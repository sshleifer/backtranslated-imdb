Why is not this film 250 best? The film was still amazing after 56 years after its production, but was followed by W.W.II due to a near perception of death. People are well aware that life is stopped in an unexpected moment. And what's after life? By judgment I finally liked the scene and collected all the people of all countries. Defender Judge (Abraham Soferre-A Common British Judge-) and Doctor Reeves (Roger Lively) is an American- against Peter Carter (David Neven) and June (Kim Hunter) defender, Abraham Farlane (Raymond Massey Eye). It's very imaginative! Michael Powell wrote and directed, and it is an amazing "tour-de-force" film. The message of the film is clear: the law in the universe is very important, but nothing between the humans on earth will pass. This beautiful story is more interesting than any Hollywood movie.
