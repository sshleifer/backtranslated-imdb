The best part of an American in Paris is the long ballet sequence at the end where Jean Kelly and Leslie Coron are the lifestyles of many major artists. Kelly was originally founded as a pavement artist in Paris, and thus a musical burst of logical ending with life and energy, stars such as Gershwin Tones and actors like George Guitar and Oscar Levant. Kelly is his best here - this is slightly different from 'Rain In' in Sing, and the effect of all the top films with the ballot is a definite user. After all other MGM musical highlights, the scenes that ended with 'That's Entertainment' were not surprising!
