This program is awesome. Both parts of the dead are very sad. I really cried. But other events are awesome; Kerry is my favorite character, because she is "on the side of darkness." I also thought Brigitte was funny because she was the last. I also thought that the guy who played Kyle was really very handsome. When Kerry was sarcastic about everything I liked it. Rory's role was beautiful, and Paul really played by John Ritter was really funny. This whole overall TV show is funny, and I still wish they showed up on TV. When they were shown on TV, I saw it every time. It will show up again, I'll see again and again.
