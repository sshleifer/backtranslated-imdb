The film is awesome and is less than the ending deals, which is still well worth it. The film starts with Claudette Colbert Robert Ryan's marriage. When someone asks the minister if any objections, a man jumps up and announces that Cobbert can not marry because she is already married !! Colebert emphasized this is not true, but when they were investigating, they were convinced that peace justice and many others would remember her marriage and a signature marriage license! Slowly, Claudet's mind is slippery and her neighbors are clearly suspicious of her sanity. Then, when the first husband is murdered, all the evidence and suspicion come on Colbert. <br /> <br /> This movie is a breathtaking mystery suspense film, the first half of the film I have ever described. It is amazingly intelligent and attractive. Unfortunately, the end, however, is a bit down to a down, all this behind the pioneering power turns to "right out left field" - it's very unexpected and impossible to guess and the information given to the viewer. However, this film is very good and I can not do it too late. Specifically, Robert Ryan has done a great job as a "neck-and-destroying" fianc√©e, yet his other performances are fantastic.
