After opening shock of grasping Mr Branagh's guts to make this film, I literally was shaking with excitement that I had this epic forward. I'm not disappointed. Shakespeare is still available for truth. It covers my mind. I was always watching, or rather, enjoying listening to Bragg and it surprised me ... Was this film dubbed in other countries? In the Mona Lisa mustache painting.
