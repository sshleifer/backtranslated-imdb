Twenty-five year-old sailor Anton Fischer (Derek Luke) was sent to three sessions, after another infidelity and invasion after the Navy commander Dr Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). Reluctantly at the beginning of therapy, he gets his confidence in Dr. Davenport and reveals the painful woes he created in his pet's home during his childhood. Meanwhile, he meets Cheryl Smolly (Joy Bryant), and they fall in love with each other. Fixing his personal problems, Anthon becomes the new man. This is a touching and positive story of a real family playmaker who finds a friend and returns to a normal life. Denzel Washington's direction is sensitive, attractive and good about the story of child abuse. In the hands of another director, this could be a huge story. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Volttoo a Vier' ('Returning to Live')
