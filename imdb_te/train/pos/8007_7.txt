This game is very addictive, and I have to play in the course of the hours directly until late at night but the fact that you can not save a game you can contribute in this game, at times I have to play in the order <br /> <br /> Yes, "Freelancer" is addictive but very flawed . Even for example, something that bothered me was that you could skip any of the cut scene with the result that at times you had to watch the scene time cut the same few minutes after the time. <br /> <br /> When I wait for the story to begin, I have a great opportunity to check my e-mail or chat with my friends and more. The promise is but the more you get all the more ridiculous. Even the game ends quite a bit, at least it does for me. It is clear that they will be revealed in the upcoming sequel. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the sequel in this movie is currently in the work, but most of it after I release it. <br /> <br /> The gameplay is very simple! Even for those who are not familiar with flight games. To keep it bold, every fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are very difficult and requires a lot of effort. It took me 1-2 weeks to finish this game, which is a little too short. But thanks to God for multiple player selection! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Even though the mission of the mission is the same, it's just <br /> <br /> The graphics are nice but not revolutionary. <br /> <br /> Addictive game but beware of its flaws. <br /> <br />
