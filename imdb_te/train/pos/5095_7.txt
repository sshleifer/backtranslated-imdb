King's Solomons's mines bring us Patrick Swayze (who plays the role of Allen Quatermine) who spent a long time in Africa, but decides to return to England and become his father. He finds that his wife's parents find his son in captivity, and he is less likely to be arrested with money for a lawsuit. Alice Daddy (played by Elizabeth) was founded by an African breed for his father's release in Africa and a redemption of the map sent by Elizabeth's father. <br /> <br /> The good cast of the supporting roles of Quetermine and Elizabeth is a good cast and some of the enemies (Russians), Elizabeth <br /> <br /> The film will have your attention to the end of the movie. Patrick is once again a strictly dignified man, who saves the young man in Durbhara. Patrick is a great dramatic actor, he can easily portray passion, loss and despair, harsh silent good man, anger and power; His role in King Solomon's Minds actually laughs a few times. I would like to see Patrick Swayze again in the live-in love story, one of which he does not need to be strong enough to hold his jaws stronger. Maybe a little dance will help. But this is a good image for the whole family and it is worth the time to see it.
