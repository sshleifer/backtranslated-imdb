The first 2 episodes reduce the wastage of waste wars to the absurdity and reduce the rule of nationalist barbarians. The third part of the moon and outside exploration and exploration is predictable for the meaningful use of human talents and resources. This may make others feel enthusiastic, although some viewers are dismissive as innocent or extreme. It features a space gun / launcher and a helicopter featuring mass communication equipment, elevators, flat screen panels and wireless intercoms. It's probably wrong about future windows windows buildings. <br /> For me, it looks like an image of a group of rational thinkers who walk through the ethics of a Spinozion to think alive. Moral living through scientific development and united world governments. It is believed that promoting characters (like two cabels) believe that humanity can 'permanently live' by protecting our experiments and advances for future generations. Arthur C. Clark (2001's author: A Space Odyssey) refers to Stanley Kubrick's illustration of the magnificent SF film. Kubrick hated it and said he never saw another film based on Clark's advice (Source: Clark's special millennium introduction to his 2001 novel). Eventually, Clarke suggested it when someone asked about the best SF films in his list. It has a beautiful Men's Art design, but the medium special effects (toy tanks). <br /> <br /> I personally like it and it treats the entrepreneur of modernity as an amazing compilation. It is a bit naive about the ability to create society without a crime in a long term. Do not be afraid of the inaccuracy of progress. It seems that we can just go back to the dark ages, or at least in science, to kill us by our inability to escape from a high population or the next major natural disaster. But the importance of taking risks against public and nanny outrage for potential threats to space hazards and deaths will look good. <br /> <br /> CABAL: "Too much more and more quickly, and we call death .and he does not end up - he conquers beyond the conquest - this little planet and all the laws of its winds and paths and mind and substance will stop him When he conquers all the deepest places and time secrets of all the places - he still starts. "<Br / <br /> <br /> CABAL: "We are more than animals - we have to snatch small scraps of our pleasure and live and experience and suffer, do not pass - all other animals - or do." - or else? All the universe - or nothing ... "(quotes from the screenplay). <br /> <br /> A rationale for this is for progressing all society, then as members of the Council members (of the Government of the world) as technical experts. In fact, the "technicians" allow their citizens to continue as artists or freely other cravings and suppress the use of jurisdiction over government bans, science and experiments, and other statutes and their critics into the reins. All council These huge rebels are experiencing a lot because they are trying to make progress and end the council's freedom to experiment. The progress-based council suppresses the rebels' free speech, but only at the urging of its "peace gas" and the desire for freedom and space to achieve its progress. <br /> <br /> The story about the freedom of science is all about the wonders of development. Social bias (for example, wanting to ban cloning) or naturalism (some do not want us to be free to emerge, we become just as slaves on earth) or fear / cause (some believe that we are not ready for modern science / technology). But regarding the risks of the dangers, the Cabal (council president) replied: "Our [scientific] revolution has not canceled death or danger, it is just death and danger value" (screenplay).
