"Moon Struck" is the first time I watch the movie. I really liked it the second time. I love it for the third time. <br /> <br /> The humor is subtle but good. This film offers a very warm humor. The story takes place in an old school Italian neighborhood in NYC. I'm glad to see Cher's search for love. The film has worked well for Nicolas Cage. The role of the old man is amazing. He does not say a word and lifts up the screen. The scene with his dogs dead in the moon is amazing. <br /> <br /> Olimpiya is a good character played by Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The main characters of the film climax are on the oatmeal's breakfast in the family kitchen. Unusual direction and wrap up.
