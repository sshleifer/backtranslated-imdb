This film is full of gripping and its b / w photography of American Heartland is amazing. We think we are right there when we cross the big sky country and then return to Mexico, returning to the United States. At the end of the film, Robert Blake appears on the face of small facial rivers and tears on his face reflecting rain. In the end, we will follow up the stairs in their last moment. <br /> <br /> The two criminals performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, Perry Smith and Dick Hickok, can be seen in any city on the street. Hickok is a smiling boy next door and Smith, a man who has stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town. The movie is made in the film and we are surprised that the criminals are no different than anyone. Evil, even the most violent, part of the human condition. These two delusions men are killing the whole family and looking for a safe there. Once in the run, they started writing checks and prepared a trail for officers. <br /> <br /> There are very good supporting actors. I liked John Forcezite as Alvin Dui as a detective in the case. Also, Wilgir shines in the brief but spectacular scene as a trial lawyer. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see this film everywhere. After purchasing the DVD, I finally got it. <br /> <br /> The classic classic crime film ever seen. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this wonderful movie. For me, this great image is all about making the film.
