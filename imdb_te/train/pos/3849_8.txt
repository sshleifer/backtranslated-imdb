Verrohoven's last Dutch speaking film made me laugh. Movie buffet for all the small details and cross references in any movie I can assure those interested in the art of combining all the feelings of the film. I do not read the Gerard Rigs book, which is based on the movie, but I still believe we get a candid picture of somewhat self-conceited poet / writer who gets him (a way - spoiling here). He is also an anti-hero who surrounded the characters with his vague intentions. In this awesome packed cinematography, Paul Verapavan does not appeal to the glamorous film-noir setting, rather than the glamorous "Gesellic (?)" Dutch locations!
