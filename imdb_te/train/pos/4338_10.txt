The picture is very moving. It is tender, and funny at the same time. The scenery is absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser were awarded with awards-winning shows. Olympia Dukakis is the greatest. I told her story briefly, but I wanted to see her more-she was a real pro. You can recall experiences in your own life, hopefully and watch this movie in a positive way. We're fortunate to see Paul Risser when we see a clay and A at Clay. He is a wonderful person, clever, eloquent and "real person". It's a happy night! It must watch the movie. Thank you very much for your departure.
