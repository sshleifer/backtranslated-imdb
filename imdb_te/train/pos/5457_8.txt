The film was one of the more dangerous black and white films in the early 1930s before the Hayes code was implemented. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwick plays the role of young and beautiful Lily Powers. He actually works well with his performance. Lily moves to New York and makes herself the sleeping business place for all men. Stanwick makes a brilliant performance as men who use men as a timely affair, and any emotion with them is considered to be pawns. <br /> <br /> Lily Powers is a woman who does not love her mind with just energy and money. <br /> This is what I saw when I heard it. I believe it is only because this film was the first to introduce people to the sound and dialogues among people. We have shown how she made the chain a few times at the beginning of music. Filming and various scenes are something exciting! The film's director has done all the right angles and all the right strings, the film is full of realism. <br /> <br /> This film is better than all. It should be, but it is not completely destroyed. The baby face has slow-moving scenes throughout the film, and there are some speculative episodes that are likely to sleep in the next stage. But this is a must watch and it is suggested to some people and friends.
