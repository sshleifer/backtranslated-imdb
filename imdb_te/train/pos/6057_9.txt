Sure, it's a great home theater "displays" disk, for super imagery and excellent sound, but it also has a touching play as well as information documentary. The parallel tales that are tied to this film are of interest to all viewers. Young, old, boys and girls will find a deep down, we all have high performance indie machines that are all automobile fans, especially blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder sound track certainly fits the visuals and content. I do not want to give up, but the last driving order of Quincy Jones's "Last Days" brings tears to your eye. Have fun!
