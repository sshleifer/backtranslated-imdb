Another show of Kurosawa's intellectuals is a dark surrealist form of the tragic lives of the Togo slum dwellers, particularly a series of sequential groups, in the hardest and fierce post-war Shanti town. The tragedy and backlash from comedy shows how the film deals with the most vicious life of everyone in their own way, often repulsing themselves and emotionally withdrawing or drowning from those around them, living in fictional worlds of their own heads. Kabuki-esque Theatrix, Kurosawa dolls, combined with the emotion of the audience, combine the kitchen-sink reality with the tear and laughter with the same curve. An excellent, drying experience.
