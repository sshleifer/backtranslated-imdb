The Grinch's piece was made to Jim Carrie and I was very impressed with his performance. I was not a great fan of him but I was surprised at the outcome. Taylor Momsen as Chin Lou Who has shown a beautiful maturity that she has seen on the screen pretty cute girl and her acting skills her years beyond. I have also drawn tears at one time! I did not expect that humor was so dark that I did not read the story of Dr. Suss's story. Overall, I enjoyed this movie (from the song!) And recommended the family view in particular.
