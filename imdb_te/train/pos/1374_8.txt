Ester Williams is a French film. But synchronized swimming is the only three girls in the Paris Expo that are the only hook for finding the story. All boys were portrayed as "Yanisaks", but in fact only 3 girls were concentrated, and by the time, some adults and other adolescents were in the background. Marie's girl's charm is not unattractive, but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and want to force her into Florin (aesthetics that reflects a critics) and she is also a comfortable friend to Anna: she is not attractive, but for her, her body time is short and is now a baby in a woman's body. What secrets are a journey to self-sensitivity without road map but there is an insight into three vague topics: where are the sullen and mindless shouts for young people? While the dinosaur breath is breathing, Florian's self-absorption is beautifully portrayed, as well as with Mary and Anne's equivalent beautiful Union, all of which appear to be the pupil's puppets.
