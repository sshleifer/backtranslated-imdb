If a thriller idea follows your car, the explosions, and dozens of people converge through firefighters, then "House of Games" is not exactly a movie. <br /> <br /> "House of Games" tells the story of a respected psychologist and author Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crosse). , A patient seeks to help and seeks to take part in the shadows of the con men who are headed by the attractive Mike (Joe Mantegna). Suspense to destroy anything to say about the plot. Apparently, I find it hard to believe that anyone who saw them coming in difficult. Like a brilliant con artist, this film will draw you to its web and miss your vigilance. <br /> <br /> The story is very well-made and well-designed, dialogue smart and laconic, acting is uniformly good (Montagu is magnificent). Some have complained that Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character and why Mend Lindsay Crauss is physically unattractive. But Dr. Ford is cool and supposed to be away; Moreover, her recovery plot (I believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her inspiration when needed ... I will not say anymore). <br /> "House of House" is a dark form at the bottom of human nature, ending with inconvenient opacity. Every second you look at will be your attention and then stay with you for a long time.
