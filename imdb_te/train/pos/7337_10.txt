Good story and amazing animation. Frazetta and Bakshi's influence are clear, and this is a good thing. Anyone who feels Conan the Barbarian or the game Dungeons and Dragons should enjoy it. The war between good and evil sometimes is clear cut even though our hero appears to be neutral. Very often in fantasy films Elves is usually white skin and sleek hair and goblin and orcs have dark skin and hair. Frostetta, Bakshi, or Tolkien's work know that they are not racist. Anyone who likes fantasy films should like this movie. It's not for young children due to violence and sexual fantasy. Casting did well and the first rate of scenes and music. I hope it puts this gem on DVD right away. I'm lucky to have a VHS copy in good condition.
