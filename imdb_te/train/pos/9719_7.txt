I'm going into this film, I have heard good things about it. Coming from it, I'm not really amazed or disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a very child role as his other films. There are a couple who laugh there and there - nothing too funny. My favorite episodes of this film are probably when he dances in club scenes. I will try my best to come back to a club. Here and here are some stars: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, X-Files and Jeff Bridges from that chick. I saw Newton's guest role in the scene. Simone Pegg, she's been in the last film with Fatboy Run Run. I see a toss up, you'll either find some fun or find a little lame. I can add, Kirsten Dunst is adored in this film. : 3
