Prisons are not well-known for their kind of hospitality and 'happy vibes', fights, confusion, killings and serious male bonds! But in this film the prison is a completely different beast. Horror movies set of cells, you probably know, is nothing new especially as they emphasize and exaggerate the inability of claustrophobia fear and escape inability? Great themes in horror movie. For instance, CHAIR (Waldemar Korgenowski, 1988), The Green Mile (Frank Darabont, 1999), ALIEN 3 (David Fincher, 1992), and all women who are exploited in prisons in the course of the acquisition, if any other entry is to be invented and very fun. Or at least that's what you'd think. Prison is definitely a very fun and pleasant ride and it's a bit insulting, it is not well known. <br /> <br /> The film opened in a small prison (well, duh!). However, this is not just fellow prisoners and does not have the protection to fear the prisoners, but its mind has a ghost ghost spirit similar to one thing; Death! And the boy, we treat some wonderful death scenes! I can not lose anything for you, but there are plenty of innovative and cheerful murders made by invisible hands. <br /> <br /> Apart from special effects and murders, the film has another subject; That's the cast. Headlining, we know that the Ring's of Lord (Peter Jackson, 2001-2003) star Viggo Mortensen (and all inclined, yes, he's naked) whose performance is not only highly believable, but his skill Eastwood-Esquire character is both bad-to-bone and loved (Very sensitive mix). He added him to the cast of 'Hey Oat-a-A-That-A-Person' actors and you've got a group of great stars. While the characters do not have three dimensions, they are often not too late. We've got plenty of nails prison warden, a human rights activist woman and other stock roles as a black oligist. But in all honesty, this 'error' actually helps the movie. Instead of improving the boring character in over-long balance, we are in action, more or less, chucking and once it's (at the very beginning) a scene where there is a filler? It has balls to wall plots. Unlike a specific Schulshan REDEMPTION (Frank Darabont, 1994)! Sharing meetings with Slasher style, this is some meeting, and in the good ol 'slasher style tradition, the PRISON punishes those who are bad. <br /> <br /> All of this is one of the amazing miraculous horror movie and sadness and unmentioned sin in the world of horror. The film is highly recommended for fans of the horror with the amazing cast and great special effects and original death scenes. Due to the manufactured in the United States in the 1980s, it is very cheesy (which destroys most ending) and, simultaneously, very low since sand and realty. <br /> <br /> It tries to overcome problems like a prison rape, which are subtly done). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Very good entertaining horror movie is very good.
