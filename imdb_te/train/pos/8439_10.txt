For all the homicide junkies out there, this movie is great! In this program, never played a single role. It has helped to fix some (but not all) issues from the series. Unfortunately, unless you look at this series, you will miss a lot of joy because the film has made huge hints for every season of the show's existence. It was a series of opposites to be a particular film, but we have to see what we can do. I hope they will do more movies and continue to do homework characters on law and order.
