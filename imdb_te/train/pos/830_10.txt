I did not have much hope in the film, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is exceptional in a very different role. He pushes soft weapons suits for the funniest look and pays to show him as an outstanding actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear played each other greatly and make one of the best friend pairs in a long time. Humor is dark, Brasnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis performances are great, with a touching story about friendship and you have a great picture. This is one of the best friends' comedy films in a long time. It certainly shows that we can expect great samples of the Brauner's Bond era.
