The soundtrack is diligently focused on getting the beauty of the film closer, not only the music, but also the sound of all the sounds. How the opening scene that leads to the expulsion of gyno gives a background of moral ambiguity! Please note that we will introduce music music that has led to Giovanni's wedding. Do not expect here to be too much in Italy's political career in 1943. This is not the issue. On the other hand, if you are in accordance with the music and the music of the sounds, you can lead to a word beyond neo-realism. Landscapes like Antonioni are the moments that we can do more in the internal life of the characters than at the end of the movie. This is one of my favorite Visconti films.
