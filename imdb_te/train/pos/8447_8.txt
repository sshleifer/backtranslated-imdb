In all the truth, this is not really "movie" as a wider last episode; I thought you were following this TV series (Homicide: The Life on the Street), and I suspect you would be difficult after the TV movie for this movie. "Homicide: The Movie" is still a great watch. I'm going to return every single cast member, many years later, many people tell me about their television production to portray their characters and to shut down in an incredible program. The film is not only the concept of "family", but also among the characters, amongst the actors. It's all the more bitter-sweet, the last time we see them all together in the HOMICIDE headline. By story story, I realized that this film was not quite a bit. Gaydello's mayor specifically invented the candidate, and I thought he was acting in his systematic parameters as his shooting leitant. And yet, dear. The serious storytelling twist of the left-handed Baylies hanging at the end of the series was finally resolved, but I did not think it would be necessary for one; I enjoyed staying with a mystery (the first episode of the first episode for the whole series was not even solved!). The favorite fan of the TV series I love this movie, and the fact that it was manufactured after H: LOTS was canceled, but I do not recommend those who are least exposed to this series. Now, if they just want to release on DVD ...
