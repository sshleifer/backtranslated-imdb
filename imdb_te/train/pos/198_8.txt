Oh looking silent classic at a time is great! Director Vidor is just delightful and will also make a long (at least 1928) comio. There is a story about success in life and how it changes. Marian Davis plays a young girl who leaves her friends, part of a big "drama" studio in a short comedy studio. She becomes a big actor and the consequences are really different from the real world. For a moment she even rejected her (poor) in the past! The scene of the main character (Marian Davis) is undoubtedly just ridiculous ... the studio does not appear to be the same as Marion Davis and her specialty ... This is the first film-in-the-world, and the films are fantastic by looking back at cameras and object to realistic imagery. You must see me!
