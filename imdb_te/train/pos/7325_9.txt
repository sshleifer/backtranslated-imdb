John Carpenter's Halloween is very clearly a horror work. The mentally challenged psychologist tells the story of Chiranjeevi of Michael Myers, who returned to his hill on Halloween night and killed a group of infants. <br /> This is the first and the halloween franchise. The carpenter is slowly observing the story and displays great temperance in creating characters who love it; <br /> <br /> The more unusual is the presence of blood and gore, and yet it remains the most horrible Halloween ever. Receive it! <br /> <br /> The image of Halloween Jamie Lee Curtis is recognized as a defining point in the earliest and final Donald Pleasure's career. True classic.
