This version of Anna Christie of Geoffo was filmed a year later with a New Year's cast in German, a reducing adequate reduction (not just American MGM productions) for better work than English. If Garbo is anything more commanding (or more of a screen presence is more beautiful) and her performance is more controlled. She is very clear, perhaps due to many reasons, but we can imagine that she did not make her first film, so she quickly adjusted. <br /> <br /> Always a picture other, this Anna Christie is still the only O 'nail game in terms of words. There are a woman's love desires without losing her independence, but it will come old fashioned anyway. Some scenes do not appear - the Cooney Island section is smaller and not as good - but overall it's the direct echo of the first film. The director, Jacques Feather (Belgian-French), just repeats the work already done, which I felt was a disappointing feeling. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see two images inherited, as well as (sets, but shots, the same). The storm is an occasional scene where some of the stunts are lifted from the front of a small scene, where the sensation, but walking with her friend in a plank on a canal, from Mary Schierler (from the English language version). But when they show only the photographs, and the next scene shows their faces, German characters take their parts. <br /> <br /> Clearly themes - Immigration, disobedient fathers, daughters of adultery, and problems finding true love - have strong streams especially with European threads (gorbo, right, and Swedish lady play).
