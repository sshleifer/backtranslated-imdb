I always liked this comedy in an effort to try to counter the annual demand for the U.S. government for taxation. Ever read a tax code: Our congressional and Senators have too much inquiry to follow multiple clauses which push in to help their financial backers and various interested groups. Despite arguing that it is fair, the tax code always has a lion of burden of middle and class classes than richer and more effective. Various specialty clauses are intended for their use - average 1040 or 1040A and have different sets of different investment and business organizations. <br /> <br /> The story is a wealthy landlord here (Philip O'Brien) in taxes paid to his neighbors (Paul Douglas and Una Merkle) over 20 years. The Baltimore office of the IRS was in Fred Clark, and he attracted attention for Ober with his influence. <br /> <br /> Randall Douglas, Merkley, and their three girls and two boys rarely need cash (they produce and bond with their neighbors in their field). However, Randall's family who trained in clear (IRS) lines of tax code tries to call the fundamentals. But Douglas Rainlord Randall is gradually fond of, and he retains Randall from his fate and subsequently drunk him. He makes it harder to leave Randall by removing his car's motor for his "two" repairs. <br /> <br /> This place follows the growing attraction and confrontation between the urban and vague prestigious Randall and the rural and life-loving Reynolds. They really make a beautiful couple. In the end, after Ober's complaint, Randall comes off brass tacks offensive and Clark (a tougher cookie) back. <br /> <br /> The film is not ending - it ends happily, but reminds us that the power of tax is power. To destroy it, and the government will go for destruction, too, often. One million saves a likely family reversal, but it's so rare that we just know a dramatic trick. Clarke's owner, Charles Lane, recovering more about Ober's "help" by suggesting his taxes will be more careful next year. Ober is green later.
