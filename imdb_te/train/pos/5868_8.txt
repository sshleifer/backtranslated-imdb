I liked this movie. It is very rare to get a glimpse of post-tap Vietnam, and this film-sance has made fighting sequences and exciting bombs and shootings-it. I do not think I'd be influenced by it. A wonderful look at how the alien vets feel. It's very clear, it's hard to see. We all fight and Apocalypse now understand the kind of play, but it is very different. What happens when they come back and try to live a life? They are not. I know about a large group of men around losing in America. No sleep, no love affair, can not deal with "normal community". They are completely away. This is a huge tragedy, and not adequately addressed. Yes, we have changed our attitude about Vietnam couple, now we like them, but what's that? They have no differences. Too late? So this is a great movie, but I cried a lot. I have no other criticism.
