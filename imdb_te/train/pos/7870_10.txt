The upper society of the film is a true demonstration of how unemotional and selfish. It has many characters and each character represents a different category of person. No nature is 100% good and ethical is not different from the leaders of all distinct Indian films and no role is 100% bad and different from all. The film is a perfect blend of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the first time I liked a picture that raised some social questions. I would recommend everything to watch the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers the newspaper's hip-shaking parties of the newspaper but how she became a criminal critic of the newspaper. But not all of this, it shows that her voice was suppressed when she did not survive there and when some of them helped save the innocent children. She also got rid of her job. She could not find a criminal journalist job and have to do it again. Not only her, but a very large number of characters are interrupted by the film and gives a different feel to everyone when watching the movie. I will really congratulate the director for making a great movie. Please do not miss.
