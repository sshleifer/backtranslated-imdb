I could not wait to see a final copy of the opportunity to watch some of the Slavic Village-Broadway area. <br /> <br /> Last Friday at the Cleveland premiere of the movie, I did not laughed out for a long time in the comedy! This is a great slapstick. Russia Brothers has directed good work. The whole cast is their best comedy acting ... slow or dry parts ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he is the greatest safe handicap in the film. William H. Mackie's crook is "Riley" and Michael Jettar's "Toto" in "Stitches". I believe they are funniest characters in the whole film.
