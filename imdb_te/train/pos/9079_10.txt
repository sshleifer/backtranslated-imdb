This program will succeed, because all adults appeal to where they are in their relationships. As a married man for 26 years, I have played the role of Patrick Warburton: he loves his wife, but she knows. I also enjoy his unilateral delivery; Never gets too happy or too little. A good ensemble of letters. <br /> <br /> I do not know how David Swade is in his role. He enjoyed the best of small doses. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the pilot, and I look forward to seeing how this array developed.
