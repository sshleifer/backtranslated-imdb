My face was wounded and I worked very hard in the film. Ben Affleck was happy and reminded me of a beautiful boy Jack Black in this role. Gondolphi gives a distinctive performance. The whole cast is a funny, pretty good story and funny movements. I'm not looking too quick in this film. So I was amazed because I was completely proud of it and came face to face. I would like to recommend this movie to anyone enjoying comedy, I want to be a loner and / or relative during the holidays. The best part of the film (anyway) was a little bit of humor's moves and I was laughing for a long time after the rest of the audience stopped. Namely, the scene involving lighting of the Christmas tree. Look at it and smile good!
