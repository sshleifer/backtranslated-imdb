<br /> <br /> <br /> The best film in 1943 is the performance of Paul Lucas' Oscar, who has brought his family back to Europe from the intensity of Nazi panic. <br /> <br /> The usual magnificent Betty Davis did not name his name and was nominated for Best Actress for any film or 1943. <br /> When betraying around them, Lucas successfully resolves the situation. <br /> <br /> Davies again pulls out all the breaks when the tears dissolve as Catherine Hepburn cuts. <br /> <br /> She knows that her eldest son should follow him in his free way. <br /> <br /> A wonderful picture of an American positive campaign on an evil enemy.
