I recently saw it on the cable channel. The picture was great; It's one of the few music I've seen that I shy away from light and darkness. It is depicted along with most of the sculpture of age. A set piece of dance sequences are going on, I do not know where to look next. One day I go to the big screen and see it, see what I'm doing. However, the bill can actually be lifted to Oliver Reed's performance as another of Bill Six's. There is nothing but a completely understandable and terrible man, there is another, some inner demons. If he pushed me into a corner, he made me think he was capable of anything. It is almost as though Sikes character is on the edge of the madness that it waits for the trigger. I saw Robert Newton's Bill Six from the 1948 film, and I thought he was just a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance threatened me in my own room.
