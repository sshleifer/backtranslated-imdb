I can not believe that the film is currently rated at 6.9. Anyway, this film is perhaps one of the most impressive real Indian films I've ever seen. Really refreshing looking at a picture shown by the traditional family cinema. I felt great to this story, which was established by Shahid Kapoor on the wedding of Amitabha Rao. Amita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle, but her cousin does not care very much because her cousin does not like her mother. Amrita passionately. She enhances Amitabh because she wants her mother-in-law to love her. Although the Amrita family does not belong to the middle class, even though the Shahid's family is a very high class, they still deal with respect for their family and really beat them up with me. It's because I've really seen people being too rude to people who do not feel as well as thinking below their standards to feel very unpleasant. The film shows that Shahid's family is ready to see Amitahi's great values, opening the eyes to the fact that she is not a big business legend or not. There are an 8/10 offering for everything in this film, and I wanted to do more of these films.
