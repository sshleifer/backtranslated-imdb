Her cute husband Eddie (loved by David Hausmann), Carol's absurd, ever-present Gala Paul Anna (happy with Chris Jordan for admiring the comic joker) and Anna's Hunky, the painful husband Peit (usually Eric Edwards) is one who often has group sex The quartet of civilization. Their normal routine disturbance for Carol's lonely, suppressed, but still impressive widow, Mrs. Jennifer (a magnificent moving performance by the lovely Jennifer Wells). Pretty soon Jennifer will be a ready participant in the loosens and swingers' blithely fun and uninhibited carnal lifestyle, with everyone interested in her seductive Carol. The author / director Joe Saro maintains a suburb of the suburban and a comprehensive, surrounding and comprehension test of the total wildlife scene limits of the 70s sexual revolution; Sarko turns into traditional middle mores things with their heads and more spices with a large and provocative mother / daughter use subplot. Also, the Sarno Bang-Up offers uniform first-acting performance: Wells and Brook are exceptional, the sassy neighbors Miss Fields such as Smondara and Erica Eaton, a new age sex therapist with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Hauseman and Arlana Blues. Better still, all women are very hot and lovely; Wells, particularly herself, looks like her luxurious luxury and stimulates romance. Sexual scenes are really strange and very clear, but are rare or tedious. Stephen Colwell's bright, polished cinematography and Jack Justice 'bouncy, melodic acoustic folk score are both solid and effective. Recommended view for suren fans.
