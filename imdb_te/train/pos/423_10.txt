I read the summary of the plot and this is the worst I have ever read. It does not do justice to this wonderful movie. For an example of a good summary, read the list at "Turner Classic Movies". Anyway, this little boy is one of my favorite movies. I could not wait until April every year. It can be seen in TV, which is one of the best horsepower of the time. This is one of the greatest music that can see the entire family. Romance is clean and lovely. The storyline is interesting and the songs are great. They do not make movies like this anymore. Good acting and not above. Pat Boon and Shirley Jones are the best of all, including many great characters.
