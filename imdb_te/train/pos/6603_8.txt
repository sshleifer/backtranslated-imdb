When I failed in the film, I mentioned two failures to understand that they were successful: "Scanner Darkly" and "Immortal Ad Vitam". If you are enthusiastic by the concepts of these two films and are disappointed with sadness (such as me), you probably get a revival. It hovers you into the future Parisian world. It's not too doping. Animation done well, I thought it was a rotoscope, but from what I said it was not motion capture. Facial expressions are fantastic! TRON Since I have not seen a fantasy world displayed in the animation / live hybrid. The black and white medium is used to slow down your attention to the scene; My favorite effect is what they do with headlights beams, look for it. The director will come with your attention and confusion but you are finally satisfied by finding the thread that you want to find. <br /> Plots are secondary, but it's not terrible. It is noir-ish. There is a hero for many of the main characters giving some depth to them. There is atmosphere. Since you have "sets", you seem to be in different places in Paris. There are some actions, and a car chase. I want to see again and again to get everything done. I recommend very large screens to describe as "sets" and credits are small.
