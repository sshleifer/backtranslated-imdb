I stumbled across the reconstruction syndication of this show several years ago, and it fell in love. It features Tia Leoni and Holland Taylor and subsequently laughs at me in an episode. I guess it's not too big, it's canceled after a few seasons, but I believe that I'm a good run, it can suggest to see ... if it's possible.
