The only sequel to the Angels' sequel, Dirty Faces, is somewhat disturbing from the general sneak peaks of The Angels Washing Their Faces Dead End Kids. <br /> <br /> The Dead End is a continuation of at least continuity to Angels with Dirty Faces, having the presence of Kids and Un-Sheridans. <br /> <br /> Un Sheridan, she is the true shining light of this film. To paraphrase a cliche, Ann Sheridan can read from the phone book for two hours and I'll buy the DVD! <br /> <br /> Another aspect of the film is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is kept far behind in the background. For a good example of Sheridan-Reagan duo, I would recommend Jacques Girl or King's Row.
