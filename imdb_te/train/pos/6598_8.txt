When I was traveling in Brazil I saw this movie. It is difficult for me to understand Brazilian culture and society because it has a lot of regional and class differences. In Sao Paulo there was a statement to see this movie. It shows something in many Brazilian everyday life. On the other hand, it is sometimes not-dematatted. And I was the only negative comment in this film. It is sometimes too much, too much sex, so much murders and hate a lot for a movie. The director is able to portray a little subtle, making it more efficient. <br /> <br /> I also liked the film. Characters are complex, and are very real people. Beautiful American actors and actresses have a lot of cosmetics, but at the same time people who can be ugly and beautiful. That story is realistic, even when the story is not reliable.
