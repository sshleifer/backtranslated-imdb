It should be against the law not to feel this very funny stand up performance with Eddie Murphy. <br /> <br /> Murphy spoke about Dix, pussy, tests and insangents with many famous people, including his own "family" for almost 70 minutes. Among the people that have been obtained by Murphy include: Elvis, Mr. T., Michael Jackson, Steve Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Wandros and James Brown. I never laughed at all my life. I mean, Mr. T is someone who does not know, but Mr. Tig is very laughing to Murphy, something about it. At that time I saw Mr. T not recalled but I still laughed. Now he knows who he is and it makes it a lot more fun. Because what Ed is doing - he can make those impressions much better, he does not matter who he is, it is still happier. And on top of that, we learn that Murphy is actually a very good singer. Please see it ..
