Playing as a kind of runner before the Great Escape 13 years later, this little souvenir is played directly on the British film without any thrill and well overkill. Setting up the first part of the film, our heroes escape the next part, while the second part focuses on their survival when trying to reach Sweden. The film takes the purest character through a simple, effective and yes, unreliable conversation, and achieves its goals. <br /> <p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> 7/10
