This installment makes the CIA the most foolish organization. Of course, maybe they are. <br /> <br /> After all, the plot goes on to this, which has the power to kill everyone, including his own people. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is a very trusted job trying to stay at a stage before Bourne's overall picture is killed. He is still where he is and trying to remember how he gained. He gets help from both & movie seems like every minute, someone is trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of time remaining in this movie and the action sequences seem very real. There are a lot of chase sequences painted by a moving cam to make it look more realistic and less visible than Hollywood. These scenes are in accordance with the reality of the film. <br /> <br /> Some suspicions will take place in a few moments as you are surprised if someone dies or Bourne drives them. This is the type of action you would like to be entertaining. I'm sure it will lead to the next film in this series.
