A surprisingly complex and well-researched study about the "First" serial killer in the USSR. This extreme episode in the days of Perestraco brought full life with performances by Stephen Rayia and Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> <br /> This test of a suicide as a killer is well rounded and compelling without being graphically graphic when showing others to the right of his behavior. <br /> <br /> The heart is not based on this fact, it is not actually interrupted, but the main story of this fact is essential for the full development of the major partners. <br /> <br /> HBO provides us with an extraordinarily amazing feature film. . Congratulations to this great piece director and editor. It should be on my Top 10 list.
