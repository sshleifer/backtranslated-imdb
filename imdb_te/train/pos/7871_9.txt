Madhur Bhandarkar goes to everything to touch on the taboo and gives the most realistic picture of modern society. The director's impression is also from his earlier films like Satatha and Chandni Bar. In the next film, things previously explored are being explored and exposed as a whole. Casting is amazing and can be viewed in every scene from many angles. Most likely, the film leaves you without thinking a lot of facts around you. When you start to guess things out, you end up being very close, but do not mark many scenes. <br /> <br /> Finally Konkan Sen Sharma, Boman Irani, Atul Kulkarni, have written a lot of conversations and you feel that some of these people have lived. There are still some scenes that you can think of more depths. The songs seem to be in the background saving times and the voice of the latta is the only meaningful song "Kitne Azbe" you are left alone in the modern society!
