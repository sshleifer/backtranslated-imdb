Laurence Fishburn is an outstanding actor, and should be respected for this effort, but he is not in the class with great Shakespeareers like Oliver and Wells; And he suffers from Kenneth Branagh more. This Irish, always clever, steals away away from the show. Oliver found the probability of his production, and he learned that someone else was playing with him. Iago almost could not absorb the possibilities of Shakespeare's worst character, but Bragg shows us the depths. It's nice to see Venice opinions.
