It's my opinion that Michael Jackson is a good film for lovers. It includes a message on drugs, amazing special effects, and awesome music video. <br /> <br /> The main movie song and music video is centered around 'Smoot Criminal'. Unlike the four minute music video, it's simple and very easy to see, in my opinion. <br /> Plots are rather weird, though. Michael Jackson plays a magical 'gangster' when he sees the shooting star, he turns into part of the machines. Throughout the film, he becomes a race car, a big robot, and a spaceship. <br /> <br /> Especially robot is a bit out of the scene and weird. <br /> <br /> A child has been kidnapped, Michael tries to save her, tortured, beaten, and suddenly becomes a huge robot. All the bad guys blows up. A little weird? <br /> <br /> But this is a good film, along with the scary robot scene, enjoying both the Michael Jackson fan Smooth Criminal Music video and the movie.
