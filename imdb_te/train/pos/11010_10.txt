When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity, most films were thought to be inspiration. It was not really surprising, until 2002 it appeared for the film of this theme. <br /> <br /> Cipher is a clone to say that it is inefficient. <br /> The story belongs to Morgan Sullivan and applies for a job with a high-flying techno-company called DigiCorp. His job is to get information about a spy and a rival company, with an imagined and false identity. His home life is perfect but his wife is lying to what he really does. However, things begin to take conspiracy theories and before he realizes what happens, he really begins to question someone. <br /> Turns and turns at every turn make you feel totally attracted and never seem to be contrived or unbelievable at any time. <br /> <br /> It's an exciting journey through a very distant future, and puts you all rounds on the edge of your seat with good acting. <br /> Most recommended.
