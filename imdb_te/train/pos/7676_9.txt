Brilliant! My wife joined me in a wider line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After reading such a long line, I can understand why. Holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between the two people. She was a little girl, he was wearing Western clothes. The film holds every bone in our body. Any graphic sequences or anything is not hard to watch - it's the surrealism of that normality that really kicks you in the gut. The picture is beautifully portrayed. Among others, we liked the scene that Patrick teaches Holy to ride a small motorcycle. Thuy Ngoyen's rawness (CANT believes this is her first acting job) and Ron Livingston's show days are with me. Highly recommended.
