My mother and I went to our home from the North East (mainly Massachusetts) tour when we decided to take a small alternative to attending a film festival in Boston. Now I do not know much about the movie, so I thought it was a bit educated. The first film we saw was this Romeo Division. Now, I do not know about you but I thought it was great! It's a pleasant surprise, since I'm from Texas and we can not see many movies where I came from. My mother insisted that it was very violent, but I did not know much about what she had said but it was a great movie. I was amazed at the fight scenes they were great. Also, Romeo Ladies killed all of the bad guys when I won a good thriller so good guys I was a big fan. It's a real brightness. I'm not sure if it's released in the video, but if you get the chance you should check it out. I was pleasantly surprised at you. Although a word for wisdom, it's violent and there are many cous words that you should not let your children see. This is more for adults.
