Insomniac's Nightmare is a very interesting and well-built movie. I loved the way the throws you into the subconscious of the main character without coddling the audience ... Acting is top notch - honestly, I see Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - But everyone, especially the young girl, as well as great. I am very attracted to this film. Generally, "Independent Movies" can be found on a Grainy, I-Shot-on-On-My-camcorder, but this director knows what she does. Lighting, cinematography ... quality work. I'm looking forward to a motion-long work from Tess!
