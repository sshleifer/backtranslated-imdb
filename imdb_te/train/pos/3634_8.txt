I have low expectations for this film, but I'm looking for something that is not for an evening. I enjoyed the theater and I was a little surprised. This is a very good baseball tribute film, and a nice lesson about pursuing your dreams. Dennis Quaid works with a skill with her role, and I have touched for his performance. Absolutely complete price ticket and your time is worth a couple hours!
