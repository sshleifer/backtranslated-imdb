As the police correctly pointed out, the man died from two bullets in the chest. <br /> <br /> There is not a problem here, both of them are killers and others who are unwilling participants in trying to find out who are infected. <br /> As suggested by some individuals, Elia Kazan does not appear to be a small piece of anybody who seems to be in Louisiana.
