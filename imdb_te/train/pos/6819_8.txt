I found a fun and stimulating experience "in time". While acting is not usually brilliant, it is absolutely acceptable and sometimes very good. The film is obviously one of the best works in the genre (Children's Size-Fi), as evident in the film's young population. In general, I produce the best movies and TV shows for Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia kids, and say, 'The time at the top' is that this doctrine is nothing to discount! I do not think the continuity of the youth and the great acting are important. Good plot and very important for those who play an imaginary screen. Both are rich in the film. Special effects are good, without removing them from the story, or closing the audience from their own imagination. The film was easy to load over-load of SFX, but it totally destroyed the 'Raison d'Or' completely. <br /> <br /> Setting and camera work There are very high standards in this film, and will complement fine wardrobe and historic accuracy. Overall, the film is highly satisfying, and I recommend to all viewers who can see the world through the eyes of a child, or try to find the ones I like! Now, I should read the original book as soon as possible.
