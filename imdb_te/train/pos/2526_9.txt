It's great! In story mode, it goes from your punk to the pro. You have to complete the goals that have skating, driving, and walking. You can create your own skater and give it a name, look stupid or realistic. With your friend Eric up to the game until you start to skateboard team off (you can choose a team to remain) and you start your own team until he deceives you! There are many levels from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, New Jersey, Manhattan and School II (not part of story story mode). You can unlock the mysterious skaters like Iron Man, Jean Simons and another skater. You can create your own goals, such as SKATE characters, COMBO characters, tricks, gap and more. You can create a pedestrian goal and write what they talk about. If you are bored doing so, you can premade goals in premade parks. The only thing I do not like about this game is that sometimes it is difficult to drive cars. 9/10.
