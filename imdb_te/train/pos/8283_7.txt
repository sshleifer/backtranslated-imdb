<br /> I liked Jake Weber. His poor delivery will be refreshed during the best performances. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked family dynamics. Wendigo looks silly, but it is represented by the kid's toy and dead deer. See, compound like it? It's not a mental story, a freddy slash em up instant saturation film. Look at it and reflect on your inner child and tell the picture what you want and you will be fine. <br /> The good work.
