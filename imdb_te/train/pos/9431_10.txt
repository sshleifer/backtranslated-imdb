And this is a very disturbing picture. I might be wrong, but the last character I thought Burt Reynolds was an actual actor, which changed the character and delivered a message. <br /> <br /> Jon Voitt and Ned Beatty are also amazing. They are simple and do not know; Businessmen like to enjoy the country. <br /> <br /> Photography and sets are real and natural. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> The film is still quite unsatisfactory, and there are still places like this. In America, country folk people still hate the city people; It is almost a century and a half from civil war. <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It is still filmed in rural areas of southern Georgia. Do not just drive to mobile, only in the past; The area from Hurricane Katrina has not been repaired yet. 10/10.
