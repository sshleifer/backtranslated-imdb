Bela made 9 pics for Monogram, but this one, 4th, was only beginning to come together things. This is useful as a template for the production, writing and role of the rest of the series. From here, better or worse, the series also serves as an important subject: a scientist (usually Bela) experimenting in the basement or in an old house (sometimes in the dungeon in the old house). It was also the first time that art director Dave Milton was able to spread his wings. He arrived on the board for the Black Dragons, the previous movie, but he clicks on his craft click, but this one is. Louis did not put up a great atmosphere, and all the other monograms were around. The cast is key in this, and it's a pretty good B picture picture here. You will be starring together with Barclay and Harlen (also from Black Dragons), Russell, and Leonton's Cat People. Rogetto, from SPOOKS Run Wild ... Poverty Row is a good slice of talent. If you have limited time and budget, start this one ... It will give you everything they have learned up to this point, and the rest will compare. The plot? Bala steals the gland juice to steal his evil wife as a young man. They both want to sleep in the coffins. If you can read it and smile, the rest will be easier.
