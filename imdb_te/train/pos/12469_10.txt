This is a great movie. I think some people are not based on this true story. This thing is great, the movie is very good, and the balloon with the mummy ends in the fishing town, thinking instead of "just a little girl's desire to be true", which means that our peaceful dreams are true in us, and all of this world is real. The little girl (in the film - in the film), and her mother, the best actors I have seen in a long time. They are good for all actors and good director. If someone can tell them, please tell them, "Thank you for the 25-year-old man from Romania."
