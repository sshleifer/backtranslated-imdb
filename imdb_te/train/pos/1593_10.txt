Two sisters live together in this program. Holly is a teenager and she has female issues like her sister's job, boyfriend, and feminine women. They sometimes make mistakes and try to support each other, but they do not give up and continue. And the show is also about friendship. The priorities of life. I loved this presentation too. It's funny and the actors are very good. I'm really sorry that the show is over. I still see time back over time :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth might be new to comedy but she did well. She is one of the actresses I'm looking for. I like Vince and Holly's relationship are very natural. Gary makes a natural talent and laughs you every time he shows up. Tina Holly find a true friend and I like them really meeting. Lauren's character is very funny and she has a natural talent. I want to see her more. This show really takes you and you can laugh. I wish I could not finish the show.
