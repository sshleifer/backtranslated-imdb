After watching the film 14, the first ever-Soviet TV (I really wager * for the first time in history * "shovd" , I thought! Over the years, I was very much impressed with the film and the incredible acting, but my feelings changed with the original mix of drama and a mixture of enjoyment from the bitter reality of my 14-yo. Seal: helplessness. There is an air of the inevitable catastrophe that progresses throughout the image of the primitive depreciation tide (created by Shirikov) that eradicated the lives of the best minds to bring humanity to their areas ... It is usually hoped to 'upgrade' their dominance and lower classes with the inspiration of the Russian Revolution, Leave the power of mediocrity Mingivesenduku to it ... and an excellent, very good and talented satire in the form of wrapping up the idea of ​​a real tragic. Symbolically enough, the film claims that the era of the Soviet film ceremonies ended before the Hollywood tsunami knocked them down. It is good to judge by most current Russian films (most of them were previously called 'Blackbusters' !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) For commentary ... I can say this is a movie I have shown earlier, but it is not. A lightweight term by the current standards is very rare, and it is quite confusing to show the true nature of all Shrikkows ... BTW, the tragedy of Epstein, can be understood by the words of a single Cussword translated to the intellectual and particularly inexorable laxation, Russian speakers! But I am concerned that in today's teenage debate the expression is expressed by Cosworthy. I feel that the most effective medium for work is a bigger problem than their choice :) Well, this is a great food for thought or idea that the book might change them, or anyone who might have a luxury looking at it.
