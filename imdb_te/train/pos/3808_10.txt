I voted 10 for 10 people because this was a lot of animation, because I could see for quite some time. The animation is amazing. The backdrop of each landscape is beautiful. From the colors to light to the standard fare of artistry. I was amazed. When the beauty is on the screen, you sink in a storyline, which is timeless and at the same time fresh. Character development In short, these touchstone moments are exactly what the viewer is and why and how they came to where they stand. I'm impressed with the whole affair and think this is a must for the whole family.
