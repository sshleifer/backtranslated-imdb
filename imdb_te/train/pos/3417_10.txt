Before I saw this, I removed the subject, but this was not your average success on the vicious story. It is technically the Mt. Everest, it's so much more. Eric and Sabriya show the image of two very strong and often unconventional people of the two most successful blind adults. Eric is an American blind mountaineer / athlete and sabriya, a blind German educator who opened school in Lahha Tibet. They are exceptional in their own ways, but it does not agree with building confidence in children. When Eric wants them to reach the summit, Sabri wants them to enjoy Eric as a role model and want to enjoy the moment. It's a little complicated and it's not clear whether a person is wrong or absolutely the whole climb is not a bad idea or a great idea. Tibet has seen the deepest scenes with children and the hardships they encountered before going to school. The most moving Tashi story, a weak young man who grew up in the streets after his parents left him. I am happy to see the whole movie of my life and I am grateful to the school thanks to him, who is now running some successful small business with his classmates. If you like spellbound or murder ball, you'll love it.
