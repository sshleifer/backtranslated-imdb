These are a lot of good movies and do not leave me disappointed at all. The soundtrack is sensitive with a fair shot hand-god camera work. Always have the beliefs of the movies as well as the other, but I thought the rhythm and timing of this film was fantastic. Dakota Fanning is a major self-paced child who needs faster and her talent has become a staple in the movie never disappointed me. For Mr Washington and of course Christopher Walken they exceed the challenge of showing the dark sides of humanity trying to move both light.
