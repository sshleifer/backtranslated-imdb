I never commented in the movie before. Last night I saw this movie with my girlfriend. I commented that this picture is with you. It does. It's been around 24 hours and I'm still completely impressed. This film made me my own self question. I can compare the role of Ben like helpless. I liked this movie. I love movies to guess and wondering until the end. I feel both emotions are more, happiness and sadness. Excellent feel good image and a very sad one. I wanted to stay with Ben and Emily, but finally they were forever. If you do not see this movie, get it and watch it. Make sure that you do not have any distractions. You want to see every nuance in this picture. One for my library.
