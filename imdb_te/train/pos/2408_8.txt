Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and the sadness caused by this violence to see the film. Although the box office or TV ratings are not successful, The Fox Movie Channel has still found a real good idea to show that. Chris Sarandon and I loved the people who portrayed his disciples to sing in Hebrew. However, like in other films, Sarasovan does not have long hair, but looks closer to what the Jewish man looks. What surprised me or surrounded me was Jesus' paradigm about the peacock "And you never forget, you are a Jew!" Although there is no racist comments, Colin Blakley Chris Sarandon is trying to make it look worse in those days. Piet's Keith Michel plays the role of "The Story of Jacob and Joseph" and "The Story of David". But if you compare Pilate with Telly Savala or Hard Hatfield, he really painted a Roman manager's impression.
