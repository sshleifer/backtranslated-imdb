Kei Pollock's 2004 Heart Warm SÃ¥ Sam I was in Hemmelen / Heaven Each theme of Swedish humanity and humor is a group-delight. It has plenty of ammunition for cynical critics, continuously error-sponsors and Sacryan-Debunkers, and maintains the depiction of life in the small group. <br /> <br /> The film also maintains the scope of proverbial messages about 'identifying one's own voice' and 'one by one fearing it' without removing the throat of the soldiers. The group pleaser comes from two facts. First, small films about untouchable people about bringing a new life to rural Christians provide many opportunities for revealing hypocrisy, while simultaneously permitting repressed characters to get out of their hair. The same year and the same was the Swedish wind, Sheba's pearl queen, and Babbert feast in mind. Second, any film about small sections of the entire wider world touches the human strings of our growing personal / self-focused and untold world. Structural similarity to the whole monty, brass off, calendar girls and a clear day shows its debt to the formula. But this is a formula in the remaining life, and this is because it requires people's favorite news movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Maestro Daniel Darrse in search of self-rediscovery of a stranger shot dead. He is a town where he visits, or rather again, towns, without knowing the place of his childhood. He was merciful by fellow students here because he was a sensitive musician who did not like to drive a truck. Here, he does the work of Cantor / GuyStuster, despite the usual suspicions of artists and outsiders. This area, of course, can be traced to a wide range of notable varieties, whose character can be predicted: the broken-hearted, fair-hearted girl she is beautiful; Cell phone-ringing local businessman; Whose beauty loses because of domestic abuse? Steamer Pastor and his less tough wife, first emerges from Ingmar Bergman. Also present: jealous, uptight spinster (Siv) (inspection); Aging still sings (check); Elderly couple suppressing each other's wishes from kindergarten (Czech); Obesity person whose function we laugh and say 'fat' (check); An intelligent boy who is capable of damaging a good 'A' (check). <br /> <br /> Pollock's image is not all warm fuses. Although it is 'setbacks and moral opposition', it allows for participation in a show. It involves violence and a metaphor is better to die after creative salvation. Violence is largely related to malice and oppression, but never reveals deeply into the growing school bully in Beatrice. Likewise, the small town pastor adheres to the super-Protestant stereotypes wearing moral, black, his secret happiness in the closest girl magazines is hardly surprising. His oppression and hypocrisy are just dangling associated with mental reality. Perhaps a child who does not tell a little boy, the lost son probably sees on his shoulder and keeps it secret. <br /> The possibility of compiling these holes is the functions of the compilation, many inconsistencies and continuity glitches (twice) of the CV after the moralist expression. In fact, the implications of the film have long passed away, and everything is resolved in one scene. Unlike some awkward love sequences, the film's 127-minute seldom pulls, but there is a feeling that the cutting room may remain on the floor. <br /> <br /> The holes that the film can pick it up despite the massive three-star charges. In the technology-based Flix and the materialistic self-seeking world, no one glimpse of human society, welcome to anyone, even stubborn.
