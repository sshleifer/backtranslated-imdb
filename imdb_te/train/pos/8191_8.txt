The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit are among the two best segments of 'New' Doctor Who's second season. Clearly, this story has basically changed the plot of Quatmas and Pitt (1967) to an external space, with the Basti 666 separating the history of the universe. These episodes cement emphasis on relationships between Rose and Doctor, promoting Rose's growing self-confidence, and setting her up as the most equally-not-for-share partner with our beloved Time Lord. Matt Jones's elegant screenplay, an occasional over-reliance on one-liner for doctor and performances of the entire cast, particularly Shawn Parks captain Jachrey Cross Flan.
