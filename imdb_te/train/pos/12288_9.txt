House of Spirits is a gripping story of family conspiracy, South American politics and super natural powers. The novel of Merrill Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irenes Isabel Alende brings life to all passion and suspense. This is one of my best films in the 1990s. Esteban Truba's age and gelmei irons are very confident, with her relatively young age in the role of Meral Streep Clara, maintaining her delicate and loving warmth. Vinnona Rider and Antonio Banderas are struggling with a cute couple for family consent in racist culture. Glenn Close, Estaban's sister, gives a very moving performance. Portugal's rural areas are a substitute for a non-tropical Latin American country. The Clara's home and the Esteban Ranch's settings are effective and adds US cars to the postwar climate.
