I have not seen other TVs except office, weds, entries and its soup. <br /> <br /> I'm experiencing a lot of trouble with the pop culture of this show. Soup also helps me to mention people in the office when talking about Sagi or Hedi Montagu. <br /> <br /> This soup shows clips of these highlights. Performances, usually ridiculous or highly controversial moments (Simon, many people are watching the American Idle because auditions are the freak show), so many people are watching. And i mean, for a naget of "mind" or "shock", this mind is not bothered by other 98% of untouchable tat shots or "reality" appearances. The only reason the soup can not get a 10 in my opinion is that the sketches are not that funny, and even an occasional occasion, the commentary is not always the same. <br /> <br /> Joel's quick wit and soup composition team (which includes McHale) make for a great show. I happen to be smiling from the off-camera crew and enjoying the comments. Although they are apparently clear by giving occasional etiquette laughter, it is so happy because it is forced. They are exactly the opposite. And this is part of what makes the show funny.
