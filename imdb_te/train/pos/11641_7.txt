I caught episode about Brad, and his bicycle racing career began to get used to a drug trail on the streets after it started as soon as it started. I should say that the story about his biking career is a cardiovascular rather than his drug addiction. The young man who won and race on the right here was invited to train with the Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately insulted Lance Armstrong in the great athlete he lived and was commonly common for all innocent and unfriendly. He wanted to leave soon enough to understand. However, I was confused about how to mix that presentation because it was at the height of his addiction. </ p> <p> <p> Shows Brad. We see that we are sleeping in pat-handling and gutters and pots and smoking crack cocaine. I do not even know what's legal to show, but why did the camera crew follow him and why the movie was made? <br /> <br /> Do they expect some TVs to give a good TV episode, hoping that this TV can turn its life around? <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a bright show. Addictions and the total control they take on people's lives. Sometimes it can be difficult to see because I have seen families and friends suffer from the indifference of slaves, and I finally agree that everything is cut short. It seems to have lost times and everything in the episodes during the terrible things, but still, and maybe I should be here to warn about spoilers, a happy-ever-present feeling in the end, a very unusual event in real life. But still, this is a presentation about people trying to help other people, and you can not complain too much about that?
