This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I'm frustrated and t.v. And I found the "Home Room" and it was about 5 minutes, but I was hooked. It's very interesting and moving. It happens in everybody's life. I'll give you a 10, if possible. The director / writer and actors did a fantastic job. I think teens want to see this film and I learn from it. It's great, drama, mystery and more. I shout for hours! Director / Writer I want to write more movies for this film. I loved it! I do not even know about this film, it's nice because it's sad. I want more people to go to movies to watch.
