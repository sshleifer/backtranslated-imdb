After watching the film for 3rd time now, I'm almost at Adam's worst movie Punch Love Drunk Love This is in Pakistan. Finally, when I'm throwing the boat, it should be brought to you if your true Adam is a sandal fan. <br /> <br /> The characters are waterboat, <br /> <br /> The film does not have a depth and good storyline and deserves to be on the bottom 100.
