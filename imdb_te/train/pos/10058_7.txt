I was somewhat disgusted about the image of a young child who was soft on the heart of his / her reluctant guardian. Have I seen enough of them? Baby boom, kolia, about a boy, earthy, and somewhat, whale rider ?? Expect to be frustrated by the principle. The embarrassment of the arrangement kept me in the King of Mask: the small town of China in 1930. Poverty is bound up with poverty, poor children are not identified as children who have been killed or killed by anyone in the black market. Wang recognizes his buyer's grandson, whom he calls "doggie", who is his granddaughter, who first pushes her out, although she has been promised a great street-show successor. She is reluctant when she reluctantly takes her back and when she is kidnapped. <br /> <br /> The film is embarrassing to show the younger, street-smart girl to go to the sand to survive. <br /> <br /> The two major performances are believable and painful in their social situations. In Western society, at least some people have been quarreling from Wong, which has not been better succeeded. Wong fully agrees with his station as the most popular social worker, although I did too. While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and fraud that is suspected in a modern, suburban child, it is absolutely believable in the context of a kid's survival in a society dealing with poor girls as the worst. After discovering that her previous seven employers abused her physically and emotionally, Wang's sheer attachment would be a perfect feeling. <br /> <br /> Peak, actors, surprising plot turns, and of course, heartfelt resolution contained in the small urban life in a foreign country all contribute to a very viewable image.
