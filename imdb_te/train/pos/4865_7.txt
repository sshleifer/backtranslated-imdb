I was accompanied by George Barnes & Gracie Allen with Fred Asterier. Voldhouse and music by Gershwin. There is no cohesive quality of Fred & Ginger Movies. <br /> <br /> This story is good, it's good to read in Woodhouse's book. Seeing some acting is painful and painful (especially the young boy and the little girl). <br /> But ... Humor dancing is more than most movies. I never knew Gracie Allen could dance, but the boy was doing her in the film. Have you ever tried to stand on that spinning disc in a fun house? Imagine tapdancing on high heels! <br /> <br /> She is marvelous at the artist and increases the overall quality of the film. <br /> <br /> If you can and get a strong upper lip, it is recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. As soon as the credits are wounded, I have to return and have to attend again.
