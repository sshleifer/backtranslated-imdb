While I'm familiar with the stage production of Guys and Dolls before I watch the movie, I like it. Both of Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his vocals, though he is a great actor, see from Manchurian Candidate or From Iff) <br /> The other critics' opinion about these songs I have a Broadway soundtrack, but it's not much fun, even though it's revealed by Isabel Bingga's voice Jean Simmons. I have a dark quality. Jean Simmons' voice is quite realistic, although it is acceptable, it is not always a huge concern in music. Moreover, especially when I notice Marlon Brando's particularly weak vocal entry, "Luck BA Lady" and "Sintra" are the only ones that I know in the past. I recognize that Vivian Blaine's voice is more attractive in the film than it is in Broadway. The synthra voice is the only one to redeem the faults of others, if they really need redemption. (They're not) it's far more than Sam Leven's, especially in my favorite song 'Sue Me'. <br /> <br /> Also, I complained that our songs from the movie for lesser songs will be deleted. 'A Bushell and a Peck' is the gemstone and song replacement, 'Pet Me Pappa' and the hot box elements that accompany it. It is not included in the film, I love 's before love before', and sung in the film while playing Nathan Adlide 's dressing room. The same sentiment in Love is equally well and maybe that the two stars are more capable and not included in Broadway The film is not without a film without 'Adlyide', but actually I can not see the original production, I can not. Actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br
