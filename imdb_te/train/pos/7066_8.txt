In 1936, Ray Meyand saw how the young man did not understand how the movie was so old, and I remember him playing in the great movie "Last Weekend". Ray plays the role of Stuart, who is a great banker. The three girls in the movie are not happy to leave their father and mother and realize that their father is going to marry a young blonde who is looking for a fine sugar daddy. They hire a person to be a rich man, his name Count Arizzed, (Misha Aur), drinking at all times, giving him a lot of comical laughter throughout the poverty and movie. Dina Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she booked at the police station and she told the police chief that she was an opera star and then I started singing with the incredible soprano voice, I heard everybody, the whole police department and the most entertaining and delightful scenes from this film held. It was Denny Durbin's first feature film and her immediate success at night and became a great performer with Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
