It's a wonderful movie to watch or show young people. In addition to a very brief nude scenario, you will rarely see other films as you make an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in Africa. It is similar to that out of Africa, but not all romantic flats. White French people in Cameroon are luxurious because they feel locals as people. The white people are all superiors and they will not question black services. However, unlike real servants, you only hear what 'thank you' to the whites and hear that other respect is given to these people. Because they never considered people's feelings, they would be like pets or slaves. <br /> <br /> The central example of this thought is the relationship between mother, Iam and her servant and Prodi. At times they spend a lot of time and although they were normal to have sexual feelings for each other, the White woman never felt proverie or his feelings. A good example of this thinking is that she is very sexually upset and bored when she has a dressed apparel. <br /> <br /> In this regard, almost all white Africans are actually ignorant, while some are misinterpreted, such as misuse. </ P> <p> Between Prateau and the little girl (who was raised at the beginning and end of this film). <br /> When they are very close, sometimes he's a player or a pet and the girl always plays with the local kids. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, his role is very staggering and confusing, as it is a bizarre white character who thinks blacks are better. For a moment, he works with black people or eating with them (other whites can never) and then he's trying to hit Prostyay! I was able to imagine what he had inspired - perhaps he was just trying to move blacks against a jerk, or crazy or perhaps communist agitator whites (who knew!). In fact, unlike some good scenes, this character is pretty much ruined. <br /> <br /> When I really enjoy this insight, there are just a few snippets in this world through a short-lived child's perspective. This scenario and colonialism did not happen to remove the country, the film wanted me more. The film began in the early 1980s (she was wearing a Walmkan-style headset), and when the film went back in time, it was revealed in the 1960s (more or more), but anti-colonial violence or independence for the country in the early 1950s. I was screwed by some film producers in this mess and the first film (in the 1970s) began, and I'm assuming the lady thinks about her life in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a good idea, not using the prolog and introductions shown by her as an adult traveler in the country, but not the context and confusion over time. And I also appreciated the end, as it was a pleasant surprise when she knew more about the nice man who provides a ride. But altogether, it seems to be missing - there is no clarity or message that migrations do not think and look like cruel.
