Heavy chills down the spine! I'm surprised by those who do not like me! At 10 am I saw it and I was scared yet! I saw hundreds of thriller / horror movies! For crying out loud, I'm 22 !!! I mean, okay, voice acting, especially good, maybe also b-film-ish. But the true form of terrorism, the sound effects, the flow! At the very beginning, you will be beaten again with relentless, unforgiving, scary scenes! Many of the clich√©s have still failed to surprise / intimidate! You know you're coming, it's coming, it's coming, BOO! And you still jump on the chair. Hold a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend and watch the night! Hats to Japan!
