I walked through the movie on TV and could not stop it. Peter Sellers plays an unlikable fellow who falls for a warm and cute Goldie Hawn (who does not?). Gordie's role is still not unequal today as it has itself since the beginning of the film. The film gave me a different dimension of human relationships and I found it very funny. Peter Sellers's role is difficult to sell, but I think he pulls off well.
