Good movie, good music, good background and acceptable story. But again, as his movies, the main theme, the best actor in the man of Idea and the dust of gold. Nana Patekar. It may be his second best performance after Parinda (others may not agree). Other movies are not far behind. <br /> <br /> While Shahrukh is a luxury film, the film can be done without the film. You can see in his paintings, while others are very hard to reach their peaks and get out of their skins. <br /> <br /> This film is great, music and direction is a bit thin striking plot but the screenplay and dialog are again very good. Must see.
