How can I see together Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? <br /> I never heard of Ned Kelly and I was surprised to learn about the legend of this young man. I was surprised at how average this film was. It's really too late and it's true that at the end of a 4 hour movie marathon or it's really slow, I'm hard to follow this story. Because the story is not complicated, but it will be slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom created interesting, dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Although I would recommend this to be a must see, this is a great story in Australian history (how old the country is, the country is very rare and praised) and the film is some good action sequences. <br /> <br /> This is the reason for watching it ...;))
