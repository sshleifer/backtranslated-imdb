In Cannes "Promise Me This" is the title in the review after the premiere "Father is still on the business". I understand why a lot of people are thinking that the only unique but unique expression of the film is still in his new movie and why critics should not touch him. I did not rest for two hours of pure energy. Although he is suffering from depression and distress of the empty space, he is still exclusive and unclean. Stribor Kusturica's surprisingly good performance. More closely and less scenes in "Life Is a Miracle". Marija Petronizivik Femme has a fatal world class capacity, please do not damage it. Sure, I recommend everyone to watch this movie.
