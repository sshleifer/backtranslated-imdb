Enchanted April is a tone poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece telling a message with a few words. This is one of my favorite 10 films since it came out. I patiently waited for the upcoming film in DVD format and continued to wait. <br /> <br /> If parent company Amazon's listings are correct, there are many people in this title DVD format. Many people would like to go to Italy with this cast and this script. Many people want to make this film a permanent copy in their library. The cast is fantastic, cinematography and direction is impeccable. The image is the perfect keeper. Many have already asked. Please include our names in the list.
