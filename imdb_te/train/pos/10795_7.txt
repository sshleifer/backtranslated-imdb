Oswald, this film is very good, good action plot with poor scenes and fighting scenes, but Chuck Norris refused to bomb and do not do anything but shoot some characters. This film is quite similar to the events of September 11, threatening to send a video to the terrorist president (Uhrich) of Bin Laden and blow it up. With Juddison Mills Rasheed's composition and several kick-butt roles, there were some exciting action roles, but Chuck Norris was absent. Jodson took up much of his work, leaving his computer with a queue on the cue. But, altogether, it was only part of Mr. Norris, though it was real and did not take action. I gave the movie 7/10.
