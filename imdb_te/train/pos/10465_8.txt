Kipra started his career, but worked very well with camera work and his timing. This is a narrow story - very predictable at times - but he receives very good performances from his actors and has some rather complicated camera movements that are close to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Of course, the wealthy 'prince' will lose his good performances. And fast pace, it's easy to get caught up in clocks. Then the picture is very original, because the married couple can change the lifestyle. The end is very predictable but satisfying. Very exciting and fun: I want to congratulate the title.
