The comedy of epically funny proportions from guys you brought to South Park, and a lot of guys from Orgazmo. This vulgar, opacity film is totally frustrating, egg, and satirical. It paints a very brutal treatment of humans and animals. I love it !!!!! This is some funny stuff. Really funny. Two losing friends explode into a national sensation, creating a game on the thier driveway. Corruption and greed and blackmail make the sport sour, and tapp it up to fix it. And along the way, you will laugh. Too. Everything is there. Have fun !!!!
