Sabrina Teenage Witch is one of my favorite T.V shows of life: D is used to see everyday parts back when I come home from school. So far I have seen each episode at least once and have seen the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Jon Hart is a perfect teenager / witch who plays with teenage teenagers in common, and we can reach out to all. She's funny, smart, outgoing, witty, and much more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit Sabrina Auntasula. Zelda, a brilliant scientist, and Hilda crazy, the abusive person makes perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Though I agree that college years are not as good as her high school years, but they are still not good. I do not expect it, but I think the ending is awesome, it makes sense and I liked it anyway. :)
