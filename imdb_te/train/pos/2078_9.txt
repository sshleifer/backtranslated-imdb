This simulator of the Pearl S. Buck movie is definitely a classic. A true Hollywood epic, it has a great Hollywood film: birth, death, joy, sadness, excitement, disappointment, and so on. There is only one thing that comes to me. I know a sign of the times, but the two main characters did not play Asian actors. Paul Muni is a great actor, and he does an admirable job in Wang Lung as a farm owner in China. Louis Rainier plays Olan. She did not even see the Chinese! I think I have tried to get the character out, but they have to keep Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they can not do it, and Ms. Rainier is very good in the film, but they did not try to understand her "authentic". Still is its greatest film, especially the book (I've done in high school, decades ago). See its must, see beyond casting. I think you are.
