After the first public projection in Paris, I saw one day at the movie MK2 Howeafuele. A very good picture about the three younger people in the age group of three, who are in the same mental phase. Many scenes let us return to our teenage years and let our first feelings about sexual relations come back. It is possible for directors to cut girls' first sensitive feelings to lebricism, but in that case, the probability of her story is not corrupt. You can sometimes find a slightly slow picture, but it will create this intimate atmosphere. I have special mention with talent young actresses, Florin and Mary, which is very convincing. There are so many small details but this film has made it easy to learn what's synchronized: impressive!
