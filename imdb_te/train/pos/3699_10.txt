The "Sun Loves Who" story works its way through some prickly subject matter with inspiring and kindness enough to keep up with not only the hilarious, but often hilarious. It's been a while since I discovered that I was so full of touching and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The film is beautiful, drawing with beautiful scenery and calm scenes. Peaceful images are contrary to tensions between human, very flawed, and most desirable characters. Five of the major players are amazingly and dynamically due to the excellent cast. <br /> "Who Loves the Sun" It's a really funny movie that takes a sharp look that hurts that we can turn on each other, and is awesome hardly but equally rewarding process to forgive.
