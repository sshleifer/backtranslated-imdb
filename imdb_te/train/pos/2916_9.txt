Most of the films I've seen, including many of them, are the best of the US Naval Airships (Blimps) in the WW-II era. Yes there are other good LTA related movies, but it uses more specific effects than real-time shots. This includes more real-time footage of Man's Navy Blimps. True, most of the dialogue dialog but makes Hollywood movies more interesting now. From 1949 to 1959, I spent 10 years (20 to 20 years) in all types of naval airships.
