It is the story of two people who are part of the Portuguese Revolution. Competition is easy to understand, but typically the directors start out from a historical fact to talk about something, or this fact shows up even before or after. It can also be seen as a kind of documentary. This picture is distinctive for the two people, not the general leaders, because the revolution comes from the public. Although it is made from the title of the Army Army, they can understand that they are "heads" as the main characters. Nice colors and lights in the whole film, the amazing work that works as the first film for the director, does not come to her fast. Well shown to people and the audience's emotions and passion. Maya's role (the main thing) is well made and has a good description for Stefano Akorisi, which can show the limits of magic, not a hero.
