I have this kind of old black and white movies, movies like Will Hay and Abbott & Costello have a thing like my favorite especially. I chose this movie on DVD because Wil Hay's "Oh Mr. Porter" used one of the best funny movies ever made. Ten minutes ago I ended watching this movie (the movie ended at 12.45 pm). I like this kind of movies, ghost trains, etc. lights light up at night. <br /> <br /> The one-liner in the film may not be for some time, but I think it depends on the viewer. They pay me. I am 28 years old when I was released when the film was first released (though I was my father). I'm very grateful to this kind of old movies. With some snacks and drinks sitting in the front room of the TV, you can not get a lot of things to do when you see these pictures and resting at night. <br /> <br /> I realized that one of the men in this film (he had a black mustache) appeared on three quarters of the crash after his car crash. He is looking at a woman who went to the station. The man also included Will Hay Classic in "The Ghost of Saint Michaels". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ' Outside of the abandoned station, and the ground is not in any direction, the station looks away from the storm outside the inland storm. I thought I was acting in the film with the cast. The atmosphere in the film is now missing from many movies. <br /> <br /> You start the film until the end of the film. But sadly it could have been seen in favor of movies with nudity and catchphrase and raw humor. Movie Production Age (Ghost Train, Oh Mister Porter, etc.) This film is the golden age of the film!
