Who does not want to go on a road trip with Peter Falk? That person's right eye today has more role than most actors. It's funny and touching film. This is a reflection of all the Bombayistic Special Effects bores. Women prefer romantic advice to all wake up and men love it for studying their father / son - another great little scene. And it's just enough of an edge to find a real indie. Obviously this is a love interest for Paul Reiser, a father and a son, as well as the way you move the lifestyle and have both laughter and tears. Very entertaining piece, however, the raiser is watching Watch. You can tell both his role in a new appreciation of fellow actor who is really enjoying the special talent of his father and Peter Faulk. Really happy. Let's hope this film will soon make it all in theaters around the country where everyone has the opportunity to laugh and cry with Paul Riser and folks.
