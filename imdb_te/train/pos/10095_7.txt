My parents took me to this film at age nine. I never forgot. I never looked pretty like Elizabeth Taylor. (Remember her twenty-two as she walked Elephant), I'm nine, so feelings are not sexual, I can not see anything on the screen. I sit at her feet like a puppy and take care of her. <br /> <br /> She started to show her age (she was about seventy-four), but I believe that she is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women she has ever lived. From, and it is a sappy play. <br /> <br /> It is a well-designed position on Taylor's aesthetics, spectacular scenery, impressive elephant stampede, and human pride with landscape. A few hours by watching a movie channel or rental video.
