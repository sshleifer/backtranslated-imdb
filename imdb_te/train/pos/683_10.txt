I like Ghost stories. Good ghost stories of night lurks, inexplicable voices. Now I see many of them. With particular efx having more grip on today's films, sometimes you find the real gem, once you've spent time with the writers and directors to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. "The New House" is a pilot episode for this very, rare, TV series Ghost Story, now one of the most horrific films I've ever seen. This was done in 1972 ... I am only 9, but it has never been comparable. As all remakes in Hollywood have occurred, some people do not have the same "original" than the original. This episode is crazy right like hell. I'm lucky to find on DVD today and find it very rare and harder. "The Hunting" and George C. Wish anyone will do more ghost stories like this.
