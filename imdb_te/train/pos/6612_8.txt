Final Fantasy brought CG to new level, a rebirth for motion capture. The film or cartoon, the film looks like a tribute to the new generation of film noir, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and European cartoonists. <br /> You see Paris almost as you can see, the characters look like you and are true. The real actors are shaking, tripping, trembling, as never before. <br /> <br /> Hoping to find a mind twister. Before you half way from the movie you can figure it out too much. This case is certainly quite simple compared to popular thrillers, but it certainly makes the eyes a pleasure.
