I'm not kidding about that essence and vote! Video distributors packed it into another special 80 volvol film, but it was a great parody of the horror genre you imagined for the horror film "horror saddles" made for Westerns for horror painting. I think that good, bad, stupid, unnatural, etc. (usually unhappy), and comedy filmmakers and actors should be a very difficult genre to work with - just touch it to succeed with just the right kind of things, some of which have good ideas. "Full Moon High" is bulging with good ideas - that's easy, so that it can easily put the team of Zucker / Abrams of "Airplane" and "Naked Gun" to shame. One of these was John Birch-style one-on-one character named Ed McMahon as the right-wing croquet. Jokes, non sequiturs, wisecracks and word-drama literally thrown in everything, including non stop and kitchen sink "Back to the Future." <br /> Here are some (i.e. almost every critic) here must be stopped by the spirit of anarchism, but I am almost laughing, and putting the frenzy next to it. B-movie exceptional Larry Cohen did not have a direct comedy before, and he feels he or she has any joke that he or she may think of when he's lost. If Mel Brooks created it, critics claim it is a comic strip, but because it was made by Cohen, it was removed as schlock. Critical reviews were also called "Silly". Pranks? What is a comedy - serious? Anyway, I laughed too much for this film. Cohen makes fun of everyone - his usual brand includes a reflection of a low rental movie-making with him plenty; He and the actors must have this complete explosion. <br /> <br /> Many of the humor is Mel Brooks-Ish, and Zeus loves humor or B-movies (especially horror). Trust me: the image is not hard to find, and it's as long as you agree - the belly's roller-coaster smiles without laughing on the social value - then you really enjoy !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> A sidenote: Something that is funny in this movie (actually briefly) is actually funny.
