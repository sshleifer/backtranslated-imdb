I see, this is what I saw. I'm a very frustrated movie buff. Anyway this film has not shocked me. I'm before that past. But I did not know where to go and took me to some emotional places. I can not find anymore (Ikki) the romance of the animal. Never ever. Ever. Ever. But there you go. He did. I should give the director credit. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes, the film is a total bore. Start with some very clear footage of the two horses we have sex. I was surprised if the movie was not bought five minutes later. Then an old man in a wheelchair speaks to an older man about two men getting married. Then some will kill the nervous person. Then we (briefly) get a hot but chick with a butler (but it is very small). At this time I was loudly caught up trying to stay awake. <br /> When I was sleeping for 40 minutes, I was forced to finish it the next night. <br /> She finally gets good stuff. A girl (who she is, in this film) is in a dream that was destroyed by a beast-body in a forest Victorian-era Gulf. The scene will last for a while and really the meat of the whole deal (hey-hash). It is beautifully portrayed, superbly edited, and distributes the goods. They try to close the plot at the end and it's sort of makes sense but it's sort of not. Oh! Good. I will definitely recommend this film. I'd like to shoot for the first 40 minutes (and my TV), but it will redeem the last 50 minutes.
