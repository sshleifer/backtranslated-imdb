Wow. Uhm ... well ... wow! I'll start with the plot. The woman (Marcy), who comes to her home, finds a legend of a beast roaming in front of the young Lucy, waiting to marry a bishop in France or a cardinal or Catholic church (to satisfy a will). The bed that night, she is wrecked with Beast and the ex-woman with her ex-rape-turned-consensual effort. It gets interesting here! The plot is really thin (and pull it in the middle of most of the time), but filmmaker gifts (?) Suppresses it with surprising and delightful endings. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone. If you're looking for a great movie, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a very out-of-the-picture film about the best of felicity (which shows almost sympathetic expression on the subject) this picture is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, you do not have to worry about this, in the beginning of some horse-on-horse action, 'deeds' pretty cartoony, IMO)
