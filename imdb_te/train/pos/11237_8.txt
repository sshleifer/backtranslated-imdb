Star Trekki: Hidden Frontier is the longest Internet only favorite film, which is made entirely for the love of the series, and must be seen for trek fans. Product quality is great for a fan movie, although you can sometimes say that they are green-screen scripts. It does not get away from the overall experience though. CGI ships are amazing, as well as space war scenes ... On the opposite side, I can say that in previous actors (and occasionally new ones), some characters in actors / actresses, but once again, it will not be away from the whole experience of Star Trek's new interpretations. The cast and the band are really unique here, and overall, I recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
