It's been 16 years since its original run, and now some "marketing wizard" promoted the version of the classic version of the classic, or re-releases the original 65 episodes. I can not understand why science fiction or cartoon network has not been lifted. The Galaxy Rangers actually thought of better plot and better scripts. This animation speaks slide show compared to Japanese animation and it has an average quality of time and is amazing. This is a huge toon-toy tie in the market, it can be a lot of doom. If available, I willingly spend the cash on DVD of GR.
