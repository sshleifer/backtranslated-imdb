I've seen this cable cable, Stereotype from StereoType police chief is really funny from this good comedy movie about the big bad guys, Joy Leno and a sample car from a carrot kid star from MR Miami. I compare this movie to "RUSH HOUR" in which the local police officer is a partner with an Asian police officer to solve a case. Chase brings back memories by the farmers market in downtown Detroit. Cheerful soundtrack, good script, I give 10/10.
