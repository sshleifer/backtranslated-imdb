Andy Gollsworthy, the first Taoist master of the Order, expresses the way through his sublime na√Øve art. In fact, time and change is basically his work. I purchased his first book several years ago and my family was very surprised at it many times. So this film is a treat to personally get to know the artist, there are some amazing things to say about the patient and the soft, and the natural world as he looks forward to, in which his inaccurate inability to tell in all words. He has many children to play in the great outdoors alone (if they do), creating things before they create them from the woods and sand and mud and snow. Mr. Golds was given a gift and mission to extend the sort of game to create the greatest look of nature, and intelligent new ways to open our often tired eyes on it. And always with a sense of respect, gratitude and humor, and I am surprised by the nun.
