Anyone who has shot this movie? The aviation scene is beautiful on the hill. It looks like England. However, Ivy's apartment building appears to be the Brill Building, with its lovely elevators. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendel is listed as "Sir Charles Gage". Perhaps I was shining, but I never saw him. Perhaps he is a husband's lawyer, but, again, I do not recall the role of being on this phone rather than mentioning a phone call. Maybe he's in the air scene? Or a ballroom scene? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall is 57 years old.
