Although the best of Disney is not one of the works, "Bedobox and Broomsticks" is a fascinating adventure movie. It's generally good story, good songs, great characters, good actors, magical and delightful special effects, good settings and lovely scenes in England. <br /> <br /> It is very well-played with live-action and animation. The animation, of course, is pretty good. This animation is very similar to the 1973 animated film "Robin Hood" and is about animated characters: bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and "Robin Hood". Furthermore, the bear does not mention the little John looks like, King (lion) is a mixture of Prince John and King Richard. <br /> <br /> This film is often a "Mary Papins". Combine live-action and animation with a similar artwork. Both have similar settings in London. The two are their magic and a magical woman. Children like Citra (Carrie, Charlie and cute little Paul) are a bit like the banks. Both films were directed by Robert Stevenson and cast David Tomlinson. However, instead of a very serious person like George Banks, David Tomlinson appeared as Professor Emilia Brown - the brilliant and magical figure. With its magic, the film has some minor but significant similarities to the stories of Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Most of the songs are good. "The Age of Not Blewing" and "The Beautiful Brain Sea" are the best. "Portobello Road" is great. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson is once again the greatest in the film. Angela Lansbury's Miss Pryce and 3 Kid actors are very good: Charlie, Ian Weigle, Charlie (unbelieving at the younger age) and Syndie O'Sulligan, known as Roy Snort. <br /> <br /> I like the black cat. It's great. It looks like a black cat from Salem, TV series "Sabrina, young witch". I do not look pretty when a white hamster is changed in the characters in the movie. Rabbits are really beautiful, fluffy and adorable animals. I love them! He is also unforgettable when Professor Emelius Brown becomes a white hare, because when he becomes man again, he hits his nose as a rabbit. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is okay movie, but its end is very bad. The first minutes of this film are not exclusive, but it will improve. The end, however, is weak. It's my main criticism, because in most part it's because of the animated knights thing that's a little too much for me and the feeling of war.
