Some people have compared this film to Deliverance. I believe that Mice and Men are more appropriate. Our famous man, Heaton, certainly loves the spike. Whether it is sexual love or not is incomplete and incomplete. This is because Heton did not leave spike. He needs him. They need each other. Brothers, family members, and their only relationship with humanity. Setting, scene and low cast are all up to the perfect image. Frankly, I did not care what happened to the characters. But I was careful about what the filmmaker had done with them. He did well with them. I spent some time wondering what the end of rats and men would be. Soundtrack and cinematography are compelling and witty.
