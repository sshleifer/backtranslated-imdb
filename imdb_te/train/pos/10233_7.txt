I have always been interested in watching Hong Kong movies, but they are not all meet my expectations ... until now! Burning PARADISE Most HK movies do not have flat humor, or dragged into the second rate story line image. The story is not complicated, but some "intellectual" space (there are not just scenes to fill the crazy martial arts film with the only chords I've seen, but it's not a real hay movie since Hollywood participated). The film has some striking scenes, the first of the last major scenes (previously seen, the earliest) but in the mind, there is a lot of blood flowing (half of the people are cut, decapitation, etc.). The product is very good and the special effects author's fantasy shows that although some shots are pretty technical, the notice (notice: he is pinning a paper sheet and a wall!). Yep, this is not my favorite Hong Kong movie by Tui Hark or John Woo, it's Ringo Lam! Hell is going to learn more from this director! Ace.
