Chris Rock starred in this remake of Warren Betty's Paradise, a comic about a man who died before he dreams of his dreams (1941's movie Here Comes Mr. Jordan's Reconstruction), and his adventures are his new (temporary) body. In Betty Reform, the character is the backup quarterback for Los Angeles Rams. It's very funny to watch a bad comedian playing Razor sharp rock comedian <br /> <br - And decisive low talent -. In Rock's hipper version, our main character is the youngest struggling. It is kind of like watching Tom Hanks playing a bad actor. Lance Burton's dreams of playing the legendary Apollo Theater on an amateur night. But every time he tries to do his stuff, he straddles the stage - his nickname is "boogie". His jokes are dull, his delivery is painful. In short, Lance is everything that real Chris does not rock. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was hit by a truck. Okay, so maybe he took a tenth ineentence of a tenth ineentent from his body a little ineffective angel (Eugene Levy), but hey, he's going to hit anyway. No dice, it was not due to Heaven until 2044. So what? Mr. King (Chazz Palmateri), the "manager" of heaven, reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the dead dead Mr. Barton. The problem, the body they find is a greedy, old white man. This appalling (Mr. Wellington) has all kinds of things - he is the 15th richest man in the country! No luck! You can imagine how Lance changes things. <br /> <br /> However, the wealthy Mr. In Wellington's body Lance falls in a beautiful hospital (Regina King). We know how hard it is to find the woman who gave our body, but when you're a dumpie, try to win an old white man! She is not impressed with your money and it is even worse. <br /> <br /> The first shot of Rock in the film is in the lead role, and in my opinion he is a brilliant actress. There is still a lot of the comedian still standing - and, of course, if he ever wanted to get the different roles, he might have to stop being in the script consistent with routines - but this is not really a bad thing. Rock's personality - his drive, his delivery, his behavior, and his passion - what fuel is this film. He's obviously very funny in the role, and he's bent to make sure you're enjoying him.
