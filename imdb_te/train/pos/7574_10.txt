You have a very good storyline in the game Nemesis (or Biohazard: Lost Escape), in which you have a very good storyline to play as Claire Redfield in search for his brother Chris Redfield (Resident Evil 3: <br /> <br /> My Resident Evil You probably know who) it is scary like the other Resident Evil, rating compared to other videogames)
