After finally watching Walt Disney's Song of the South in MySpace, I decided to see what I linked from Google Video with Ralph Bakshi's film-Konkkin-on Afro video. In this movie, in the live-action sequence, Precherman (Charles Gordon), along with his friend Samson (Barry White), accompany him with the Papi (Scottman Crotter) and Randy (Philip Thomas, his middle name professionally attached to Michael), and the two escape from prison. During their efforts, Pippi tells Pippi the story of the brother Rabbit (voice of Thomas), Brother Bear (White), and Precher Fox (Gordon) and their adventures in Harlem. Many of these beginner attempts are animated and live-action mixed, which provides a distinct perspective from the writer / director, which is sure to protect some people. Another intriguing animated character is a big-that-big-big-America in every way-white blonde woman wearing dark red, white, and blue stars and stripes with a grip on a small black man and one of the most sexual violent ways shot by him is surprisingly funny ! Such scenes are cool throughout the scene where another person gave me big laughs from another person regarding the frontal anatomy of Brother Bear. There is also a woman who tells her friends that she has left her "cockroach" herself if she touches her piece of comic strip artist George Hermann. I was also impressed to hear Grover Washington Jr.'s hearing of "In Not No Sunshine" as part of the score. The most compelling part of the film, Skunkman, appears to have been filmed in Silhouette in his sequel, singing a credit sequence he started and he scratched a song using a N-word in a satirical manner. Years of the film I saw the VHS cover, which was filmed in the fraudulent manner by Brother Rabbit before appearing as Warner Circles, "This film scares everyone." All cartoons are a long warning to anyone intended for a child. I would definitely recommend Konskin to every of the fans fans and animations.
