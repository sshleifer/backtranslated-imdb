I watched this last night after seeing it for many years. It's really a fun little picture, with a bunch of faces you do not know. Arkin always shines. Check it; You are not disappointed. By the way, it's just released on DVD and in contrast to its packaging, it's the Widescreen. Transfer is poor, but at least WHOLE image appears. ;-)
