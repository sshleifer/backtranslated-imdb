This film is definitely the best in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is the best, the cinematic image is just as cool and creepy as it will be the killer! The actors are fantastic, you are amazing as Dr. Loomis RIP Donald Pleasures, he made the film even better. Without him the film is missing an important factor. Jamie Lee Curtis is also amazing as our beloved scream queen! She is innocent of her innocence, as she murdered her friends at home, as long as she finds one of the best scenes in her films. She gives her amazing performance. When I saw in the very early 80s I was afraid of it like hell I loved this movie and you are still gutted as a fish as you see it today as an amazing picture that brings you into this world Every turn! The fact that the film is easy, even if it is frightening, terrifying and even fiction, as it's a simple form of a madman in a mask that's ready to kill everyone without thinking that he is there, without thinking that he is there. We all know that unfortunately bad in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly a disturbing deep fear for all of this, this is not exceptional. Death at any turn. Halloween of course it shows this in a very horrendous way. Horror should be reliable and the movie is very happy. It's a fantastic story and exciting and horrifying atmosphere. As well as the fantastic storyline of Psycho, I adore both, I believe there are the best horrors that provide the formats. Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I have ever seen and I see them in my life and do not get tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best films of all time.
