I rented this movie from Netflix for two reasons - I'm in a mood for what I thought was a silly '50 science fiction-asco and it was the first movie film Superman. <br /> <br /> Almost 15 minutes later, I was completely engrossed and very surprised. <br /> <br /> An experimental oil field penetrates six miles into the ground and sponsors shut down. Lois and Clarke appear to get scoop, but the deep well is always disappointing to work. One day later, very strange events make a more favorable story for Superman than Clark Kent. Radioactive Mole Men seems to have occupied the Earth's main source from their six-mile deep house. <br /> <br /> Superman and Mole Men is a simplistic but well-made piece of social reality. Released in 1951 as the lead actor in World War II, the moral of the story is that the Americans can not grow up as fascists. To drive this point into a simple straightforward Superman method, Reeves also blamed the 'Nazis' Mole Men Hunting Lynch Mab at one time. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, there were no survivors. Six miles of drilling through the Continental crust itself is "not the top mantle penetrated," the Earth's hollow point "- it is not in any case - remember that the film depends on the golden age comic book. <br /> <br /> The film is slightly uneven With Mumelen's interest, a bit creepy and nicely filmed many Corman-S. The script is brilliant and economical, according to today's standards, the costume is not fair, but by the time, the film's special effects and costumes are very good.Chinatography is generally very good, and one of the acting I think Reeves, Jeff Corey and Waltara I am especially impressed with the reads.
