Those who are interested in knowing exactly how good mankind is in red whites, my father has a fifth, "second renaissance" story duo. They do not know why they split up into two parts, but they really prevents the first part and the rest of the animations, which is actually one of the DVDs (and on any of these other terms on non-formatted DVDs) Parallels between robot rebellion and civil rights. Slavery, fascism, concentration camps and collective burials are combined with millions of manual masks and the sound-symbolic of humanity's god-complexity. In fact, "God" is not really referenced by these images, but replaced by "man's own image". <br /> <br /> In this story collection, "The Second Renaissance: Part I" is very effective in bringing emotion. A wretched and disturbing view of the likelihood of humanity has become "the architect of its own architecture". Some of the concepts can be easily disconnected from the previously established science fiction literature, but again, it has done most of the matrix series and is a driving force behind its success. <Br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
