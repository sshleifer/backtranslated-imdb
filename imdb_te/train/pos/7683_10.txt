I've enjoyed a lot of time with you. I love reading INTELLIGENT and INSIGHTFUL commentary. The authors of this program are awesome and the actors are beyond the talented. James responded to an accident (I remembered that I was a trucking accident or a car accident) and it was the saddest episode. <br /> <br /> Florida and children were originally out of projects , Neighbors with Willowna (Wilnona). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All children have dreamed of their dreams and found their dreams every opportunity. It was a wonderful end and I cried because it was happy with them and the show seemed so realistic that I actually believe their destiny. <br /> <br /> Benson and Jefferson have a great performance and many other great performances. It was a fantastic period for African-American television and the finest writers of the time. I love it because it is awesome for TV Land memories and I can not stand that junk watching today. Some people ... Quickly get the 1970s and 1980s ... your intellectual viewers are from a dying breed here, we need good material. <br /> <br /> Love TV, the original sitcom jackie of the 70s and 80s (they sing "ALL in the family" ... those days ......
