One of the movies you've heard from friends (or read in IMDb). Most of the false notes in this. <br /> <br /> I was able to see a young girl fleeing from the Dead-End Home Town in Tennessee compared to all the world property in the old hitting car. <br /> <br /> Heroine, Ruby, makes some bad start, but learns from them. <br /> <br /> I did not show a little more on Michael's shoulder, but ... it was her reasons. That will change. The only thing I like about it is, I think, the title.
