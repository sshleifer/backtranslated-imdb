<br /> <br /> Jane Austen certainly does not accept this! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow performs an excellent job of capturing Emma's attitude. She is fun and very elegant without much crazy. She's very contractual British voice (British is not me, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she's cheated on me ... she's also amazing in "sliding doors" ... I sometimes forget her American ~). <br /> <br /> Bates are also wise women of Jeremy North and Sophie Thompson and Philadelphia (Emma Thomson's sister and mother). They almost stole the programs ... and there are no lines to Ms. Law! <br /> Most recommended.
