I had last week's "Big Bad Swim" screening pleasure at the 2006 New London Film Festival. This festival did not show the best independent and mainstream movies from last year. At the festival "The Big Bad Swim" was selected for this festival, which was shot locally in and around East Connecticut. However, when the credits started, I thought how well I compared the others to the "Big Bad Swim" festival. <br /> <br /> "Big Bad Swim" is a fascinating, honest, and often- many adult education classics at swimming students and their fondest and troubled instructor I've had a lot of depth in the screen at times. The intrinsic character development and storyline that worked from one of the ingenious, swimming lessons, works in the subtle and graceful ways, which I find refreshed. This scheme does not deny you the head; Besides it is a spot that builds and grows organic with a pace. I never bored. I never did. <br /> <br /> The film's comedy "Napoleon Dynamite" meets "Old School". Acting from a relatively unknown actors team is reliable and their dialogue is not as embarrassing or contrived. Not obviously the multi-millionth of the camera being shot is all awe-inspiring and not clear, but full enough and well for the budget. The lighting and filming technology for the scenes shot in the strip club set puts a more realistic approach than the same background scenario in "Closer". <br /> <br /> "In the independent film industry, but I have to say: Distributed to" The Big Bad Swim "distribution If you do not want to see this film, look at it! Disappointment is impossible!
