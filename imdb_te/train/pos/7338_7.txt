Fire and Ice is an animated film set in a fictional world. The film is a village destroyed by a huge glacier of the evil snowman named Necon. Lynn, the only survivor in the village, sets out to take revenge on those who have killed the glacier. Snow glacier passes through the fireland and the princess named Tegrara is kidnapped by evil creatures. Lorn went out to find her and was also ready to find and kill NÃ©kron. Fire and Ice, directed by Ralph Bakshi, my favorite adult animator. He is the film version of Fitz the Cat and such animated artworks that he wrote as a great movie as a great movie. Fire and ice did not like me until I had other works of Ralph Bakshi, but the film was enjoyable. It has some good animation on the episodes and the story is entertaining enough. The only basic complaints I have are that I would like to have a further story for this movie because the story used is very narrow and it is not much. I will take this film some time, because it runs at 80 minutes. It's still an entertaining action adventure movie, not suitable for kids ages 8 and older, such as Fritz the Cat or Heavy Traffic. I wish there was a more developed story, it took a little longer than that.
