'Ifigenia 'is a great achievement of Michael Caagonius. This fairy drama was adopted on screen and brought to life with an amazing cast. Cognannes were made impossible. He painted a Greek tragedy on the screen without losing his influence and prominence. A stellar Greek cast helps him in this. The newly arrived Tatiana is as good as Pampaschau Ifigenia. Irene Papas, which is equally impressive, is very real, even though he is sometimes at the top. <br /> <br /> In each scenario is a fantastic Greek film that was beautifully directed and directed by Michael Caucianis with an excellent music score by Miley Theodoracis. Rumors say that Oscar has lost the best foreign language film.
