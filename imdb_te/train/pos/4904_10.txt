This film is perfect if you are in the mood to feel good in every way. If you love jazz music, you must see. If you see the romantic characters that you smile, it will bring the tears to your eye and tomorrow is not for you. If you are looking for a serious, deep, massive piece of art to distinguish the best stick and do something with Dorren Aronofsky (maybe other words - reviewer djjohn is easy, you do not know a good time, when you see one) My only complaint is that this image is very shank Correct. I have to look a bit more time to get my fill.
