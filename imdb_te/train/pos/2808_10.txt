This film is not morbid, it is not disappointing. It-sad, because in the early 90s of AIDS- sad. <br /> Its true message is love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom are in the long run, love affair. <br /> <br /> Let's see when "Silverwalk Life" Their devotion to each other is clear and the AIDS is becoming more and more important to their lives. First released, I participated mostly in HIV / AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor in the HIV / AIDS clinic. Mark and Tom talked to me like any other AIDS movie on its day, because real people are living, I have lived so many experiences in real life everyday. I know from a live experience like AIDS was previously seen to eat away the powerful, younger, healthy people away; Looking at Mark and Tom in the film is a lot of watching my old life friends deteriorating. I like this, and it still affects me after years.
