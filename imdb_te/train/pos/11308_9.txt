TCM keeps me awake from time to time ... I have never heard movies ... sa≈°oso ... now oscise ... opening film by Visconti !! Postman Always Rings twice the Italian version ... Wonderful! Beautifully played and directed ... either never heard or never heard, like Clara Calamai, Giovanni, and most importantly, Maximo Girito as Gino ... What a sensual man! Muscle and attractive for anyone on the screen in 1943! His look is ahead of its time ... many male stars have driven him since the 1950s ... he needs a major global star! The film is much better than Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange's version and a less glacier than MGM version with John Garfield and Lana Turner (I really like). Who can forgive .... This Italian version is different ... And with real and very different ending ... see it see ... e it's going to buy !!
