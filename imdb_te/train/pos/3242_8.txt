I saw this movie with my father. I was a pretty princess at the age of 15. This was done in an afternoon Star Movies. The film is a bit unclear. <br /> All the actors, especially Blades and Lou Diamonds, are great. I think it's ensemble, they get together well together. I can see this movie anytime. I think it's the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters that deal with a very strange score. The jokes are not corny, but they are nutritious and intense at the same time, they are so fun. <br /> <br /> A lazy afternoon is a perfect comedy.
