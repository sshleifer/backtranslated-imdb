"It's not me! It's, red, my twin brother Rupert!" Speaking to Bobby Dugan, waiting to be in Sally's place. <br /> <br /> In these years, I've used dozens of lines. However, no one can trust it. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best moments of fun and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Steven Oliver is perfect for Duggan, so that "Malibu Beach" is the same character (not more screen time) in 1978. <br /> "There is no tug!" Another way to the ages. This classic image is definitely worth the entry price.
