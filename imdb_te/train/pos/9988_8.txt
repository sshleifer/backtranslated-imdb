What I like about adaptation on the screen of Stone Angel is that it's a very real stay in the novel! Great image! As an avid reader, the bad thing about movies is to translate some translation into this book. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burton Hagger is a good choice for the cast and she is definitely a movie superstar. However, the Canadian actress (Christine Horn) chose to play Hagger in her short years, making it an excellent job of great praise. <br /> I did not see anything of Horn's previous work but after watching Stone Angel performance I would definitely like it. <br /> I am Stone Angel's Canadian Theatrical release in Spring or Summer 2008. I can not wait to see on the big screen again!
