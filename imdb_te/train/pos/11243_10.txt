When I was released in England in 1980, I first saw "Breaking Glass". I love it and it's still great in a Canadian station in August 2005. I'm only concerned that I can not find a sound track or DVD in the stores ... someone would have a slight luster or some order from some company's prices. But when it comes back to the movie, there is something to say about Hazel / Kate 80s Britain. That same decade was the same reasons I went to Canada "Thatcher" and what she was doing to that country at the time. Please do not forgive if you get a chance to see this film!
