I catch this film by accident on the cable in the middle and got it rented to look completely and I'm glad. I immediately drew the story and thought about the girls involved. Simple high school graduates, good friends from childhood, go to high school, and nick a guy who is facing serious trouble. They are used as bloody scratches in the heroin smuggling ring. When detained girls try to deal with their problems, they learn to deal with their detention. Thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings and the girls end up in more trouble and their American lawyer "Yankee Hank" will lose trust and they try to help themselves. Hank is trying to save them after she thinks she's cheated by Alice (Claire Dane). However, the Hank Thai local wife's case is a rat smell and the inquiry will work some more foot and finds the girls really be victims. The end of the movie was tears when I was doing an unselfish work to save Alice Darlen (Beckinsale). I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.
