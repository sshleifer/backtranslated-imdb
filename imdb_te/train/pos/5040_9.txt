On the first day after reading Stephen King praising the high heavens, I saw a trailer for Filipy in Yahoo Movies. <br /> I'm not really a fan or star, I still want to see it as a big thriller fan. <br /> I was disappointed. Acting is amazing, especially from two young children. Normally I hate child actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton are wonderful. Bill Paxton really made it work to direct it. It is beautifully portrayed. <br /> <br /> Notice the plot twists. Finally three turns hit hard and fast, and I did not see them coming. <br /> <br /> The last twist of the film, given the gravity of the disclosures, has given this day the cold, and I have seen the movie many times. <br /> The real gem.
