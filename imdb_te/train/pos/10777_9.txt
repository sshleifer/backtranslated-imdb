Radiofreccia is a picture about us, about our dreams, our friends, our blame, our addictions, our fears. It's a fantastic picture that lives in a group of friends like all of us through the growing difficulties in a small town during the most important decades of the last century. The things in this movie are not happy or tragic, it tells us a story, we have all experienced us. One of joy and excitement, sadness and grief. The power of this story is that we are in love to grow characters, it is one of those movies that you see again over and over again, which is overlooking the town in Emilia Romagna. Listening to the music that changed the world through an old radio's cracked sound that radiates the radio, playing our dreams with their dreams, Freccia and his friends next day hope its streets will finally be able to walk its streets. Radio Freessa can laugh at you, sometimes you cry, it will shock you and comfort you, giving it to you and takes you away. Personally I have played an important role in my life, and my friends, and I want to see you all and let you become yours.
