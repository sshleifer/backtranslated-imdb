I thought this film is silly. I have seen so many times and I highly recommend it. Mel Brooks, is amazing. This cast is awesome .. I do not know how this image is available from 2 out of 5. I love you .. I saw his other pictures and they are also funny but this is a joke really stuck in my mind .. I can not say enough about this film. I'm looking to stay out of time, but it's never enough for me. People playing the homeless people also fit the funniest standards. Please keep this movie more often. I can not see enough .. Leslie Ann Warren is another favorite, Cinderella ever since. I thought she was not really funny but she liked her acting. She is so funny in the film and she and Mel have done a great job. They have to put more on his movies on TV.
