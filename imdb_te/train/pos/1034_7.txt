I think this film is probably the most powerful when I first started in 1943, but nowadays it's a bit too expensive and static to boost greatness. The film was before the introduction of the US war in 1940. Paul Lukas plays the imposing and good head of his family. He spent seven years for the Germans to fight with the Nazis and prevented the capture. Betty Davis is her very savvy and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the kids without him from time to time. The film begins, crossing the border from Mexico to the USA, and for the first time in years, they go to rest and stop running. <br /> The problem for me is that the family is also perfect and very good - the real problems can lead to a clear positive campaign instead of the real family. While it has a great goal at this time, it is fraudulent today. In particular, the most odd and most written dialogue used by the kids is not just a real ring. Fascist anti-lectures are more alert than real children's voices. They are a very annoying result - a person who is particularly litelist, at times, like a brat. <br /> <br /> Rambene Romanian (despite the fact that there is no clear voice) is the only one who speaks to them, along with Betty Davis and her extended American family. <br /> <br /> It is the ultra-well-known dashheem hammett who wrote this conversation because it is not real to life. The story relies on the play by his girlfriend Lillian Hellman. And, the basic story idea and plot is good, ... but the dialog is just bad at times. Overall, a picture with a curious curio and some amazing moments ... but it really is everything.
