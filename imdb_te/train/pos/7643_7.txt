Curiosity !!! This film is based on the notion of what if. Of course Mr. Destiny will be able to answer this question. The main character goes through a bad day, like most of us, and asks this question. Chaos Theory tells China that the butterfly in China can influence anyone from the chain reaction. The film's focus depends on a program during baseball game. This incident sets the target for someone's destiny; In addition to Mr. Destiny, "The Butterfly Effect" uses Ashton as a comedy on the play. The results are a fresh, some original image. If temporary is tuned with "The Butterfly Effect" Mr. Destiny gets a chance. I will give this film 7 to 7. I saw the first half of this film three times and finally ended in TBS.
