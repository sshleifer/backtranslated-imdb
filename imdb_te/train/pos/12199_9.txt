Wells is the first secret to guess what the original film is. It makes a real adventure - imagine the beautiful woman who supported it once, using the incomplete skeleton and cinema forensics. <br /> If you do, the secrets are always there. <br /> <br /> When entering mysteries, this article is simple: simple diversion, a jealous husband as red herring. <br /> <br /> Placement of Wales in the artificial dream of looking dark and multifaceted world. The first true noir, but also dark. If you do not think about the camera it's not clearly the twisted world. <br /> For all the celebrations, Kane was successful because of great play and story. The camera eye is surprising but experimental. Wells goes from there to explore the mystery story with this eye and the self-suggestion of Shakespeare. During this period both Othello and Macbeth were started, and I thought they were part of the same view. <br /> <br /> Nair seems to feel that people here are a bit less than their lives. They are adopted by random factors in the environment. So in telling this story, Wells should make the environment a character. <br /> We know the famous lighting, blocking and angles we know (since countless times have been seen). And we have deliberately closed sets: park, yacht, picnic area, aquarium, dock, court, Chinese theater and funhouse. <br /> <br /> I've been cut by the barbarians but not with the role of 'external' heroism, this strange atmosphere. <br /> <br /> My own solution to the mystery was fun, in other character-climates introduced as suspects. In other words, the manipulation of black Irish (not known from the notes and an amateur novelist who typing a scene in the union hall) is not: human conspiracy (park or civilized version, court) or nature <br /> <br /> Instead of entertaining The purpose of the conspiracy of Gods. Wells is what this self-reference is: the fact that we set these people (including him) by hell for our own caprice, as set out by the pedating opera with Welles. <br /> <br /> More about self-reference: His wife is sure about the consciousness he met with his wife soon. But I believe that he has a strong subconscious comment on the climate and studio environment he has worked on in his own taning environment. Well Wales is very irritating, and likewise, his character. <br /> <br /> If this poor Rita is all about China, the Chinese Theater, the Theater, will assess the rape from the above, the loss of the woman. Invest in the environment more than anything
