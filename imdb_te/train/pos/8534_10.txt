Eric Stoltz Joel Garcia, after breaking his neck in a hiking accident, recently provides an outstanding performance as a successful young novelist who spent the weekly parasites and a special hospital. As he learns to deal with gravity and gravity with his new limited physical condition, Joel is slowly speaking, swiftly speaking, the lovely women's Raymond (Fairy Wesley Snipes) and the unpleasant, aggressive, racist biker blows (a wonderful William Forsey) Forced to share. Joel receives considerable support from her loyal and loving, but married girlfriend Anna (played by Helen Hunt). <br /> <br /> The main achievement of this remarkable film is that these men are not seriously refuted by the confusion. Directors like Neil Jimenez (who also wrote a brilliant and intelligent script) and Michael Steinberg have linked this story to an extraordinary taste, intelligence and warmth, especially how it is controversial about behavioral behavior and the inability of the problem A lifestyle sex life (Joel and Anna try and a motel Where love fails in the room The point is to make the most powerful in a fantastic scene pudu). In addition to the expected poison, the film offers a surprising surplus of more bad, funny raw and martial humor, highlighted by the order of turbulence with a secret sleeping trip to a strip club with Joel and the blues. Unmatched acting was another important plus: Straits, Snipes, Forsyth and Hunt are all outstanding, Grace Jabrisky is stand-out supporting turns like the kind of hospital nurses like blues' doting, priceless mom and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young. Despite the horrible thing, the film has finally proved to be a very moving, positive and exciting film provision for the marvelous power and durability of human movements. Excellent magnificent gem of a play.
