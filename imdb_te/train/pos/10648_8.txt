What can I say about "haunting" It has everything that makes a great picture. There are wonderful sets, moody music and dying sound designs all over the place. Screenplay, however, sometimes covers the mind in a strange, surreal way. The whole team may be forgotten to read, because probably the weakness of the plot is due to the creation of cg effects and the construction of Gothic sets is very weak. Despite the slightest belief in the hand at hand, each member of the cast gives a valuable performance. While Lili Taylor has responded most to others, but about it. All I can say is that it's a little enjoyable two hours, but you definitely want more. Too much.
