This is a very funny picture, easy to see, you almost entertains all the time. Director's work is noticeable and his type of comedy is his trademark. This film is a history of a special police partner, such as deadly weapons, but jokes and comedy arrogantian sort. One of those twists played by Perette and he accompany him along with his detective Diaz (played by Luke) in his assistant program (Diaz is struggling because his wife cheated him). Some of the dialogues are hilarious around the world: understandable and somewhat ridiculous. Overall is very good, it's a 8, but it's 7th, because the fall comes down a little. In a personal comment I have to add a "Bravo" for Argentine filmmakers, a bit better late.
