What really can be said ... First-class thriller made of equal amounts of "Tenant" suspense and full mental disorders. It's a talented plot-every detail is included for a reason-even though the plot is rarely understood, most of them are not addressed in an objective manner. Increased fear and uncertainty guide us through the world - so we are left with an increasingly volatile Trelkovsky (Polanski) - a positive Polish man who has received an apartment due to the previous tenant's suicide. Following an apartment-warming party thrown together with vicious co-workers, Trellevsky is in an apparently unseen observation by fellow owners in his building; The rest of the story describes his mental retardation and gives us the same mind with David Lynch's next efforts. However, the "tenant", more breeding and bad, unexpected comic relief, fine performances, and a really haunting score woven. It's a movie that's better than it's described, and it's hop.
