So what is a real independent picture? I'm sorry to say that the main hollywood's latest nostalgia is no more than a brilliant marketing strategy that looks at the strict and cutting-looking day and age, seeing the general public as an independent film. <Br /> <br /> Why should we be happy that movies like "Hate One Minute" existed. Throughout the board, this film makes a point in contrast to its own template (indie horror movie). It's not afraid of love or hate, "hate it", and in watching this film, you're just saying Kallio (director) this film just forged fake blood spray places. Good ones. You can find this movie in the horror film section of your video Story, but do not cheat, about this story about love, good people pushed to the edge, and finally oh-distant light <br /> <br /> You expect spots, or an Evil Dead ripoff Stay away from this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are in the subtle feelings of horror / suspense genres, check this movie. <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell has produced this film, and I'm proud to tell anyone that it's not "Evil Dead". <br /> <br /> Bruce did not attempt his "gray" image and it was clear that it was not "hated" and could do that. <br /> <br /> My advice, though, is to see how to look at the film and see Mr. Collie and Mr. Campbell are trying to show you any kind of exposure of any friend that Mr. Cambell has issued. <br /> This acting is well done. Oscar caliber (probably deliberately) There is nothing about this film, it's good to see compassion shows in the horror film. Very often, the actors do not even try to "hate" it, all actors seem to be scary, never before the general horror-film camping. <br /> <te technically, "hate" is competent about indie gets. <br /> <br /> With editing fast paced, cinematography has given a good budget, and "hate" keeps fast, without any bag-down points or bad opposite climax. Glasded the look of all multi-million dollar counterfeit Indies, but personally, I did not see that issue. Everyone says that it really deserves the medium. <br /> <br /> Those who lost the blow were caught in the Aski pockets, pulling nickels, dimes, and warning the wind and making a good film.
