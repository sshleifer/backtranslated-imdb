I believe this is the most powerful movie HBO Pictures date. The movie will be released in theaters to view people on the big screen. It's available on video, so check it out and check it out. Chris Jerolmo made a great job with the direction and screenplays. Performances from Stephen Ray, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery Demon are not flawless. The best work of the genre.
