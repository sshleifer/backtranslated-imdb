This is a fantastic but uneven 60's trippy world war in the Italian style of I'm hard to find spy thriller. Psychedelic graphics of experimental credits and Lesbian Love scenery and poisonous gas and German cavalry with great score coincidence by Enenio Morricone, and a gas scene with German cavalry, a gas proof 'storm trooper' gear missing picture. This is a film that captures the horrors of war and cruelty and the brutality of players in the battlefield. Unlike war scenes, some architectural and special effects are old because the bulk of the budget for this movie is saved for war scenes, it is not a problem for 60 films lovers. I've seen this movie on television many years ago and have a look at tap on VHS. I still have tape and enjoy watching it from time to time.
