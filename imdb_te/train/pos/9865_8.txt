I saw the movie with two big children. It's not as smart as Shrek, I thought it was good. In the movie theater surrounding the children in the spring break, I do not have the sound so I know all the kids like it. There parents are also engaged. The death of letters and clear death brought about enough gas and interpretations. Hopefully people will realize that this film was created for the film. Also, I liked it even though it was successful. Personally I liked Scrat !!
