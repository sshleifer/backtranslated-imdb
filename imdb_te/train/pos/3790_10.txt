I risked and riveted on the independent movie channel. I was a professional actor and I struck through the shows. Without affecting them, they are fully enhanced. It spent half an hour in IMDb until it was scripted or portrayed, and eventually looking at the credits and waiting. Do not give up. I also enjoyed a very good picture called writer-director Everyday People. The shame of the film business is that these wonderful projects are distributed and the ads they live in the radar range and can not live. The film is desirable and proud to be flown. I want people to see it and see it.
