A special film about the confusing woman (Lindsey Croce) involving sharp men. Joe Montegna gives the performance of Oscar-caliber much less in the group. The absolutely mesmerizing first hour, Montegna shows the crows "ropes" of his con games. The Story Line is said to be a bit later, but it is still an innocent character in a dark world that is a special character. Definitely worth a shot.
