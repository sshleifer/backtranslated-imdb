A meteor shower crater Lake causes a prehistoric egg that does not crash. <br /> <br /> Okay, the plot just trash. But despite its clear low budget, it comes across one of the most gripping and entertaining monster-top-loose films ever existed. Humor has some good moments. Plesiosaur is a wonderful Harryhausen-style stop motion creature in this small gem refreshing in a era called 'monsters', which are not forced to break up each other (rubbery-suite creations or fries like lizards). <br /> <br /> It's a very hard movie to find, but it's worth finding.
