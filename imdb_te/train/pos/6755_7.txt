Ah, noir. My favorite genre. The next film for Otto Primer's "Lara" is film noir in New York where corruption and violence are prevalent. This was Dana Andrews as Sargent Mark Dickson, whose brutal tactics dropped him in hot water with his officers. <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to convict the crime owner Tommy Scales. Dexon is close to achieving his goal when Marthaan's wife, Morgan Taylor, joined. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <<br /> <br /> And, like the works of Primer's workmanship, . It does not have the verbal intelligence of visual dialogue of the tidal experiment of Wilder, Hitchcock or Wells. Like Lang's next period, "the wrong side" is a nair "clone", rather than really artistic. <br /> <br /> Film is not something special. It's about a policeman who slowly became a criminal. In one scene Dixon claims that his father is a child himself, the film flirts with the concept of predictation, but the scenario dares to keep his ideas until he leaves the oto. <br /> <br /> Camera work is also frustrating. There is no intelligence on the Otto camera. We did not try to assign anything to any camera. It does not play with space or architecture or enforces step-by-step police approach. It is just a tripod set up with dolly and out occasionally. Understandably, most people do not care about these things. <br /> <br /> The main good gangster cave trapped in a full car of gangsters (noir cage) that our hero enters into a vehicle-lift (another cage). Like Linch's "Blue Velvet", Otto retopologizes the film, constantly sending "upstairs" to hell. This works well, but the set design failed to strengthen it. <br/> <br/> - 7/10 - Otto appears to follow a Noyor's Hawksian print of a picture rather than a toy. "Dancing", "City in Night", "Scarlet Street", "In a Lonely Place", "Act of Violence", "Bomberbang" and "Johnny Ager", "Where the Side to Kill" second tire film noires. It is competent and engaging, but there is no additional special magic.
