I did not dance before Flamenco, but I think this film is perfect. The colors and the dances are unclear, the GPCs and all the opponents were once simultaneously, which seemed too soon. I saw other carols solar movies and I agree that the film is his best product. I think the best of his last films are in conjunction with the creation of Iberia. I've used mirrors to reveal the activities behind the cameras. I felt like watching this film sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, dancers in a wooden plank on a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this film is like a glove. I do not know how to get a copy of this film in America over the next few years. I would recommend this film to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures. It's safe to say that it's perfect on my favorite list.
