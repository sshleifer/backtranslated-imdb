I hate over-the-tako French movies over, but all of my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest French film of them. I saw twice in the mid 70s, and then it disappeared. But I finally saw back in 1999 and fell in love again. Every single 25 years ago, every bit seems fresh every bit. If you do not see, do not miss your chance!
