I liked the show when it was broadcast on television and I was crushed when I decided that it would never be anywhere! I'm hanging out my copies of this program, I taped them or taped it to anyone. It's up to date. In the end, the DVD decided to release this beautiful series on DVD and I finally managed to get my hands full of enthusiasm at the full set. This brings me to this part; <br /> <br /> American Gothic is a bad thing about good verses, primarily a fight between Lukas Buck (which is Buck, a B). <br /> <br /> The nasty sheriff of a small town small town that runs with his convenience as he wants to run things, should not lead his way out. <br /> <br /> I thought the show was written and directed in a fantastic manner. There is still room to live. I really hate it when it's canceled, but I think it's going to be for me when I finally find it worth watching television. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole has done a great job in the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck, he has the right amount of evil charm horns to pull it off. Other actors have done a super job, so I can say, casting me too has hit me.
