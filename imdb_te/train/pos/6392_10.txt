This independent, B & W, DV feature is continuously closely associated with the ability to create humor and enthusiasm in creating obstacles, shock and a lot of madness. This is a very ridiculous and ridiculous thing, since there is a lot of absurdity in the film, there is a heart and reality that keeps the film, putting the entire piece entirely from drifting into craziness and the real message here. This film is how we all survive the mad world. It's the heart of the film. Things are gone back and frankly, like Leon, the 30 a. The old paperboy-the protagonist, always tries to stay together. <br /> <br /> Acting in this film has gone a long way, and always trying to capture Balan, he works for the best work. Above but exceptional cast really keeps the bonding bond. The van meter is probably the best of the group here with a show that shines through the obscured declarations. Just like the characters in the film, look at the real person under the men with her sudden people. <br /> <br /> Maskovski is the true genius here. He takes the most fraudulent plot turns and keeps them real. It's his script and his cast, which helps to stand on the whole thing. It is true test of Majkowski's true and all this picture, it never works once our nerves, with unpleasant plot and characters. Mozkovsky is a moving film, giving the heart and humor. This is a unique image. Tappipokudadu. <br /> <br />
