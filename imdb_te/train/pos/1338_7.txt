The poor year for Indian films of 2000 was due to the lack of quality and imagination from film directors. There's nothing like mohabatine and koho na pyar hai. Due to film financing, the CCCC was quite controversial and did not know much about the film and created good publicity and modern ticket sales for the film around India and Abroad. This is only a suspense thriller. The film is now released in 2001 and the film is surprisingly good. The main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well maintained. Salman and Priyati Salman are good work. The queen plays Salman's wife, but it is a little less demanding role compared to Pragty. This eventually becomes a surrogate mother. After the Har Dip Pyar Kare, three lead leads confirm that they are rich in the chemistry (apparently) on the screen and screen. Salman Khan has been a successful venture for successful businessman and has been looted as a laughing comedian in his other films, the lowest in the Mumbai film industry, and a part of his chosen films. To the end of the role of the queen is not a prostitute for herself ... It belongs to her and the rest of the family ... if you tell the rest to see the movie to be destroyed. All of these songs are mainly Decke Wallon and the main title song. Other supporting actors like Salman's loving family do a less but good effort. Abbas Mastan built a hit and acted as a tactic of the film .. I wanted to go and see if you'd like to rent or whatever you want!
