Adolescence Summer - Although we do not know the signs and traces of these particular lands, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - all of us are the same.

Lanisha is lingering with his father at his security job - the only way she gets time with him. Apart from seeing the love that exists between them, there are also family and father's failures. In a connected sequence, Lanisha defends his father as her mother, and she both love them and see how desperate she is for her love back. Later, the three friends are in the darkest visions and dreams - and silly / funny children, and even the most tragic, reminding us how reality is the hammer's idealism.

She collects her courage to catch all the fears and doubts at her bay. <br /> <br /> The great gift of our song We can really just turn and drift away, after that intimacy, one day, alive and enjoyable, if we truly feel the terrible ephemeris of friendship.
