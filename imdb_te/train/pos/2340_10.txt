I immediately fell in love with "pushing daisies". This performance manages to put a smile on my face with great storytelling, witty dialogue and great acting. But not all: it also holds you up to the end. The basic idea behind the program - Bringing life back to people with a touch, the end of the second undead - is interesting and may be seasons later. But the curious murder cases, the unique look of the show and the most talented storyteller add to the experience. But "pushing daisies" is more than parts. It has a particular charm that is really enjoyable and I'm looking forward to entering the Ned and Chuck world for the second season.
