I'm still new to Krimi's genre and I've seen before and before this one is somewhat frustrating, 'The Dead Eyes of London', in my style that did not induce a great hope for the others. But at first I saw this, the concept was different when college girl murders were a strange and rather absurd attempt in a criminal film; It's really fun to watch and it's really hard to hate a movie that throws very strange and amazing ideas into the script and handles to pull off with the style. A crazy scientist begins in a laboratory that finds a new and highly poisonous cow that kills a victim and appears to have died of a heart attack. The poison is used by a secret criminal who breaks the murders of the jail by putting his toes using this toxin (later placed in jail). As the title suggests, the closest college full of girls who provide the victims. <br /> <br /> However, with a plot, there is also a mystical monk wearing a red cloth. This is not exactly a serious affair and is clear to the director, the film has a lot of tongue-in-cheek vibe, which makes the baud better with the theme. The fact that the plot has very different sides means that unfortunately everything does not run smoothly; Moreover, this film is not a big problem because it has been filmed long and has enough time to make audiences interesting. The atmosphere is very good and the color scheme on the display is great. However, the film is based on Edgar Wallace's novel and is clearly a great imagination of man; The spaces used are also awesome and a killer's cave is hosted with wild and exotic animals, and the story does not have anything to do with the additional 'something'. You can not imagine the ending of all the elements that you are going through in the film; But the reason for these murders makes sense and the satisfactory path to the Climax film. Overall, College Girl Murders is a fantastic little mystery film and one of the most recommended!
