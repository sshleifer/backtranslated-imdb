This film is really eye-opening. I saw this film many times. First, when I was four years old, I actually remembered it. Then I remembered at the age of 12. It is not a mistake to wake up for everyone and to leave God every day of our daily lives. <br /> This is a great movie for a non-believer and a believer!
