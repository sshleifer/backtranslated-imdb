I saw this film for the first time when I was 6 or 7 years old and really did not think it was really unique. As time passed, I saw it again and I began to understand the morality of the film, and when it came up it started to grow. For a while I have not seen this film alone for a while. When looking for an older classic film to watch a few weeks ago (now 15 years old), I dug up the hawkard's VHS. After looking at this I could not really say naturally. This movie will never give you the happiness you really enjoy. It is true that the nature of the three different animals to work together to go home is always the one you always need, even if you're different and always send the message home. The way the selection of characters personalities is really amazing. That's if you have an old knowledge brilliant Golden Retriever, looking or guided 'opportunity' fun if a little clumsy young American bulldog, with sassy brilliant, harmless but confident cat. The film follows the impossibility of a trip that is so realistic that these three friends or colleagues believe that the trip will take place and create that dream. <br /> <br /> When I come to films that promise you that I will most likely do not sound soft tissue grabber, but in the film it is very doubtful that shadows try to avoid the shadow and the possibility and sassy will tell him to leave him. There is silence when two animals return to their beloved owners, and everything is shadowy to God. There is a fine way between heartfelt and tramping garbage but the film itself is pure magic at the age of 15. This film may not be Lord of the Rings but produces an amazing image using animals for Disney and for it it also deserves 10/10 at this age.
