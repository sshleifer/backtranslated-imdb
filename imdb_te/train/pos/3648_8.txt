"Pandora's Clock" is a gripping suspense / thriller that is cross between a virus image and a disaster movie. The film premiered in 1996 in the first episode of NBC, a flightless flight infected by a passenger who suffered an air failure. When the pilot (Richard Dein Anderson) and the virus expert (Daphne juniga) tried to find something to prevent the calamity, the U.S. Government talks. I'm not really a big fan of TV movies and children, but I liked the "Pandora Clock". It is one heck of thrill ride. <br /> <br /> Jane Leaves (TV's "Frasier"), Robert Loggia, and Edward Herman (also President). <br /> *** (Four to four)
