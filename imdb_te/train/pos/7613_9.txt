/ I've seen the first episode I've seen Lost, I thought what some people do this people who crash and chase a monster monster. But it is not, no one's monster and you are not every monster in every episode of Lost, and every time it gets better. An island with an underground glue and a relationship between persons crossing each other in particular before crash. This is a real secret. <br /> <br /> I hope the rules of this sequence and what I really do not know is that they do not broadcast the last 2 episodes in theaters,
