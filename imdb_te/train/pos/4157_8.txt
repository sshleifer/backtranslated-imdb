It is good to catch this early angol movie Science Fiction channel, which is actually very popular in anime and is not a catastrophic rating that claims to be adult swimming in the cartoon network. I very clearly see the cut off parts on the Internet that it is less popular with more popular and more and more people actually want to buy the DVD now. This film probably does not have too many cuts and okay for voice word dubbing film, though I watch the original Japanese version rather than. Americans use some of the annoying voices to dub the children and children. The film has a young boy who trains the train known as the Galaxy Express to reach a planet with a technology that has become a robot. He wants to be a robot to avenge his mother, who was murdered by a robot who hunt for humans. During his adventures, he is friends with many workers on the train, as compared to a beautiful woman named his mother, Mattel, a woman in many Amazing films may be very good, for our young hero, or really bad. As he travels from planet to book, he goes into the pirate Captain Harrock, a star pirate starring in his own animated cartoon series, so that the galaxy express is primarily in this universe. All very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected finish. This is a sequel, but it's not quite as good as this, but the ending is a bit more late than here.
