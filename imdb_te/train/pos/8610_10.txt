Diane Keaton is a very difficult but funny story involving many young people and their deep dark secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), "The Family Stone", '05, is a single daughter and loves her more than words. She always called her and called "Surner Dorothy", an expression used in 'Wizard of Oz' in 1939. An accidental car accident occurs and Natalie is deeply involved with her daughter's friends and lovers. As Natalie is investigating, she learns about herself and her true relationship with her daughter. It's a great movie to see everyone's supporting actors, especially good performances.
