In my opinion, a Guy Thing is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic, and completely cute chic movie that the boys will also enjoy. I thought Jason Lee and Julia Styles were confused as a confused groom and his soon-to-be sexy cousin. If you ask me, they will open as magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before I wrap up this, I like to say that the shows are top grade, the direction is flawless, the product design looks good, casting is perfect, and the dress is perfectly designed. In the end, I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Styles. You're laughing and thrilling for us, so go to the video store, rent or buy, kick back and see with your friend.
