An excellent documentary about the landmark achievements of Kumba's Women's Attorneys Association (WLA) in Southwest Cameroon is to protect women and child rights legally from domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, men are always sovereign over women, and according to the Sharia law, they can imagine the hardships for women and children to impose secular legal rights. After 17 years of unsuccessful attempts, WLA leaders have recently acquired some successes, and the purpose of the film is to share these success stories. <br /> <br /> These judicial organizational leaders are Vera Ngassassa, a state attorney, and senior judge (court president) Beatrice Natuba. Both play their role in the film, which has a drama portraying the drama, although many expect it to have the next entertainment of real events for the camera. <br /> <br /> Two cases involve a repeat wife with forced sexual assault at one point; Another 10-year-old girl is sexually harassed; And yet another, mother-in-law, repeating the childs at the age of eight. One of the damaged wives wants divorce. We follow complaints from inquiries into the trial results. In each case the results are suitable for women and children. Criminals receive strong jail terms and / or penalties; Divorce was granted. <br /> <br /> When the law comes into force, this female criminal law enforcement officer is sexually abusive. Moreover, all parties, including those detected by criminals, are respected. This is the most important and well-designed movie.
