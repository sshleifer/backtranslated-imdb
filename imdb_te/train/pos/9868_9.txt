This is exactly the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but it is different from the lesser cartoon feelings (though the main creatures have deliberately cartooned features). At the end of the story your face is not morally (like pulling your shirt in the shirt) but just chooses to tell about the relationships between different "animals". <br /> <br /> Unlike many Disney films, the characters are much less than their voices (the benefit of fewer actors to cast voices). They are well rounded and completely believable, amazingly. The group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The animation is fantastic as you would expect, and you will be praying for an opportunity to go up the snow smile. Image. You will fall in love with the comic relief of its desperate attempts to bury the characters, especially the prehistoric squirrel and its nuts. <br /> <br /> When I was disappointed with the next day I was not able to find anything, I wanted to have a particularly lazy item, especially a lazy picture. <br /> <br /> Monsters are better than Shrek or Shrek.
