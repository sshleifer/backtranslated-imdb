Stage simulations often have a major flaw. They often appear to be placed on a film camera stage (such as "Nightmare"). Sydney Lumet's direction keeps the picture alive, this is very difficult. However, it is good to see what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is very clever. The fate of their relationship is shocking. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the play of Ira Levin, but I have heard that J. Presess Allen's adaptation is faithful. The script is very twisted, and keeps you guessing. <br /> <br /> "Deathtrap" is a highly entertaining movie, platform and is recommended for almost all fans of the screen. <br />
