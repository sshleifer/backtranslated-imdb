My personal idea is that many (American) critics can not get divorced from its political / historical material. It's not growing in Main Street, USA. It is growing in Yugoslavia during the torn between the east and the west. As the boys are torn between Esther and everyone, and Esther is "Tovarish Joe" and is torn between the guys. In some cases, it is lost on a viewer who does not live under Tito. The film is very low and the director's lost is very bad. Such films assume independence. It's not just "another Eastern European age film" ... ultimately the fine line-up of young people who lead to true freedom.
