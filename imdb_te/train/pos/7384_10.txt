I saw the Oscars of that year. She is happy. But there is a major intensity in this program. She is only great because she is so funny, but because she says some things that need to be said in a public forum. Hollywood awards, employment and representations have come out of balance in a racially balanced way. No "black" award shows are required. White bread, mikistostist nominators and judges let their head take sunshine and see the great thing is not limiting "white" directors, producers, actors, etc. Woody Allen allows the poor taste to be in the air. He will not be there. The fact is that, this is the first Oscar show I've ever seen since for the "Color Purple" awards. Voting abortion saw me performing performances until 2002 and killed me. Do not give up other contributors. Billy Crystal is a riot.
