I'm very happy when I hear that film coming night before Halloween. When I learned that I was a 1978 book, I had to read before watching the movie. I'm sure the movie is very different if I read the book. The authors actually made little difference, naturally, the good plot of the book's true plot remained true. I played Boyle and was very disappointed about the film. I'm not a big fan of Boyle, though whatever the mood in the movie, she's always on her-good lips, and dark makeup-ed eyes make her feel sexy. In fact, the movie is true with true self-esteem. My favorite subplot Sheehan family (the son of the narrow b / c was killed in Iraq and the current events Casey Sheehan is on whose mother went on a huge anti-Iraq insurrection). In the book, certainly not war is Iraq, but when that video in Vietnam, and that son in the house helicopter turns, I was really creeped. Overall, I was impressed with this film, and the book was very well followed.
