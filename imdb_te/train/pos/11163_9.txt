I love this freekin movie! Walsh is a true master of cinematic form, his film sometimes missed, in my opinion. But this film is my favorite because it really gives me a sense of time set. << br /> <br /> The amazing characters, lifestyle, clothing mode, way out <br /> <br /> When the two men try to surpass each other It is good to know that there is. <br /> I thought only one thing in history <br /> <br /> Where can I find it on DVD? I saw only in TV. But it's perfect for anybody who wants a piece of life about that period.
