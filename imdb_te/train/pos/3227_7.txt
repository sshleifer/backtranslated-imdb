This futuristic action thriller from Kurt Russell Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.) Is strong and quiet. Soldier placed on a rubbish-dump planet, like a cross between Rambo and Shane, Russell's title role, left for the death of a "obsolete" genius. Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwei and Michael Chicklis have a staggering call for immigrants. They spend a lot of Russell frightened film, and the rest run for their lives. Where Russell's performance is the best he has given. Since there are almost no words to say, he emphasizes the meaning of emotion, feeling, meaning and meaning. It is almost a MIME display. When the action sequences kick into the gear, he kicks the donkey - and the way of a strong, quiet, material. There are errors. Jason Scott Lee is as cruel as an "upper" genius. Jason Isaacs has a great impression of Frank Burns from M * A * S * H, and Carrie throws Gut (and his throws almost over the band) as bassy's tutor. It is recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to a lesserly esteemed, and fantastic science fiction film, and Blade Runner's vision - David Webb wrote both the People's Screenplay.
