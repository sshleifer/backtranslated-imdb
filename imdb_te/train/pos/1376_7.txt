It is the focal point of relationships between three teen girls in a French synchronized swimming team that does not sound to be the biography of Claude Monet. No parents nor teachers are talking, not school, boys are a peripheral person, Hunky François, enters the story determined from time to time and is always confused. <br /> <br /> Pauline Auguste was very much impressed with the expectation of joining the team at the age of three. She is kind of odd looking. She did not yet come out of her adult phase, long, bony legs, big feet, and no catalyst. Her abortion and sports followed these plump lips. <br /> <br /> Adele Hennel is old - is more well-developed, well-developed physically. She is a cute guy cut in swim suit, teasing the boys, cutting her long hair, washing around her. But she did not see what she was doing. Or she? I did not quite recognize it. French is short on paradoxes and stability in the long run. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is in the squad too but she is dump and plain, and sensitive about it, and has a strong love for Francois. Bleshir is a good actress and adds to the odds of the character through his acting. <br /> <br /> This scandal, conspiracy, hidden emotions, is associated with young people who spend more time with each other. This is a tricky thing. This can be confusing during the gradual improvement of Homoric relationship between Pauline and Adele. You can not expect that this is a soft romantic image. <br /> <br /> The only nudity we see is less than a turn, and some small sex covers are under, sometimes literally. <br /> I'm in the plot or its analysis <br /> <br /> This is partly because it's complicated because it's not partially because I do not know exactly what I'm going to sing. <br /> Please give me an example. Okay. Adele girl envy others. She is also very distant and self-satisfied. Above all, if she had any apparent use of the boy and the man, it would have been apparently visible if she wanted to be from the driver of the dumb François to the bus driver. She brashs unashamedly about her skill in her apology. When Pauline arrives for her to join the swimming team, Adele uses her to look after her. An elite and self indulgent narcissist, do you know? But the so-controversial yellow take on Pauline, underneath her wing, and tells Pauline she is still a virgin. Really? Yes really. Pauline begins to draw close to Adele and Adele finally agrees that she would like to get rid of her surgery and Pauline wants to do it for her. Pauline is now sexually attracted to Adele, working with a suppressed taste. Now Adele really wants to get it with an old and experienced person. So she takes Pauline as a boat, where she leads some people until she extends her Pauline room. Two girls are standing in one another and the other is not exposed to sexual desire. But Adele Palin slowly kills his own back and kisses and kissing kisses on the lips. <br /> <br /> Adele again asks, laughing, "Now there is that bad, is not it?" And then goes back into the club. But between Pauline and Adele - but what's going on? In the beginning, Adele Paulin is an abusive child, and ultimately a close friend, as a potential lover - and Pauline responds, Adele is satisfied. Does she find Pauline using her men? Will she satisfy her now to know that there is another person in the innocent service? I do not know. <br /> <br /> I was a bit thin as a third member of the trilogy, with plain and over lip walhlower whose expression is always discouraging but at least totally different and the first one to get rid of itself of three sound virginity, but she left for me only to consider the space < <br /> <br /> What should you look like? By all means. (Compare just about high school students.) For men, some of them did not penetrate into the women's mystique, which gives you some idea of ​​what appears in medium shots.
