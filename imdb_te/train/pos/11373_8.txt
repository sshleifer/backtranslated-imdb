Here is a fantasy: no serial killer has no landscapes, no one is dying, no car, no big movie, no big noise ... and it happens in Russia. <br /> <br /> The remaining stories have only two small action scenes but they are terrible. <br /> How many red tape to work with the rest of the story detective work, and the murders of the poor detective? This is a very daunting picture, and "Lemonade" describes the character of the best hero (Stephen Ray). Furthermore, the story is not discouraging and it is very interesting. <br /> <br /> Rhea is an exceptional, heartbreaking detective. Jeffrey Demon scared the killer. The Russian voice of Donald Sutherland is suspicious but plays a unique role in the film. <br /> Once again, this story is not a bias against the homosexuals, bias against homosexuals, secular psychology, police and government officials, unwanted / dirty / bigger ones. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is clever and refreshingly low-key crime film. It's very special, it's probably not well known but people who watch it really love it. Since it's based on the killer's real-life account, it is more agile. Do not pass it because you do not have anything about it.
