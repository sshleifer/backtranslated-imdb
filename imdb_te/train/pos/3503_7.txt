If you remember that summer when the first summer, girlfriend, or first puppy in love when you are your first kiss ... this picture is for you! OK So this film and I never never won as a loved one as an Dominican as Oscar BUT ... If you are not part of the culture there are some things in the picture that goes right on your head ... The kids are the mother and the father of the two grandma, the youngest son is a cafe bustel tin (Many Dominican!), Jude surrounded by men, visiting the church and praying a candlelight Cinematic brightness is that small detail. Of course, not all of the works of the film are not removing the royal lords, but it is not intended to be an educational tool for learning Latin Latin (tip: make new friends instead). The bitter-sweet, fox-cloth, which actually kept this film without taking too seriously. It's just a boy's age story as it is in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tombian". I would recommend (especially Dominicano!) = O)
