The quirky image of the amazing breakthrough in the Pathfezes saga. Parker Posey plays a Fay Grime character as a sexy, weaker, loving mother, or she may not be visible. The story is very cheek in the cheek, and the dialogue is skillfully understated. The hints of humor and introspection, none of which is not well-cut down. The supporting cast is stellar. Why bother? This film requires your full attention, almost the image stopping and taking notes. Posey has a more sex appeal when many actresses lift her eyebrows than have their whole body. She is worth your time, even if you do not understand Denim.
