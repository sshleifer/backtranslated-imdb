Dick Clement and Ian La Ferris have been a huge success for their TV shows. However, their motion is very much wood (2008's The Bank Job fine, the previous year Across the Universe decisive weak). <br /> <br /> Still crazy, fortunately, great success. <br /> I enjoyed "moments", and this picture is one of them - <br /> <br /> Pierre is shaping up in the festive reunion show ... <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable.
