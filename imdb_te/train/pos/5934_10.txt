I'm sorry that I do not know what Hollywood is doing. We definitely give you movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by Hollywood I think they may have covered the story of the story Batman story, but please do not entertain us what we really want to see Batman and Superman together. I hate this trailer because it wants me more. I'm looking around to see when I get out. This is a terrible practical joke. The good story line graphics seemed to be solid and it has all the aesthetics of a great movie. Unfortunately it will not happen now. Producers, directors and all the actors have a great job but I hate you to do this. You wanted me more.
