It's all about telling me a story of films and acting. The story of David and Bethsheba is a tragedy deep and enjoyable for anyone who read and understand the Bible account. In the film I made a heroic work by Gregory Peck and Susan Heward. To make it known and understandable about David and his journey to become King of Israel, this story made it more comprehensive. You could feel his loyalty for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the true human side of this man who was older than his time life. Susan Hayward's fear, dislike, but she obeys her authority as her king. At the time of the outer night in the Uriah night, David's anguish can also be experienced. He was also killed in battle. The powerful and authoritative continent of the king of Raymond Massey made me feel his anger. The sets are true enough, and the atmosphere is believable. All in all I feel like one of the best movies of this kind. I gave a ten rating.
