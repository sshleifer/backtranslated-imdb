I do not know why some people from the US, Georgia or Bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about what they do not understand. For those who have not seen this movie - watch it. Do not expect this koterica slightly or do not put some frames. Trying to understand the whole humor inside, see the film without the seeds - their Villages in Bali Clinton bombers, all the golfers in the Balkans are always very creative, and the Balkans are very creative, unexpected, unexpected, For those who argue that this is a bad image, I'm worse than the American's sh * t (Meet Dave, Smart Get, etc.) of me, the sacred, Frank Balkan romantic comedy. The comment should be useful and the author should point to the personal opinion in the second place. I think the film is so great and the respect of the story and the story in the story should give their respect. It's easy, but true. It is cruel, but delicate and makes you laugh dead.
