OK, I really did not have trailer story boys have bad story lines, because they kick the ass. <br /> <br /> For example: At the end of the film, Ricky and Julian show "Patrick Lewis" to put the dog down and tell him to go out. In the end, Ricky and Julian will be told that they are in prison for 2 years. In the TV series pilot, the first clip they performed was the same clip as Ricky and Julian "Patrick Louis". But in the TV series, they were in jail for only 18 months. <br /> Also, the storyline of the story and the content of the TV series are connected to the material between the guys). But some actors played different roles. However, Patrick Roach portrayed the role of "Patrick Louis", but in the series he played Randy. <br /> Also (again ... I know, it's great too), Sam portrayed Sam Taracco in the role of Sam Lasco. Film, smoker cough smoker instead of guys smoke. <br /> <br /> In fact, the two heroines are the same. <br /> <br />
