The evil of humans - this is a wonderful, fast paced thriller by Wes Craven (Elm Street Nightmare), who provides us with something superhuman and more terrifying of the leaves next to 85 minutes. We (Batman Begins) will do a fantastic job of presenting a sociable, friendly, charismatic killer, Freddy Kruger, Jackson Rippner, and Sillian Murphy's faintest evil. Performances are great by Murphy and Rachel McAdams (from The Wedding Crashers Claire). Very close picture between two people, their eyes and their faces is very much. This is not a small sweep of action, a sweeping sweep of canvas, and is less compelling for these limits. Cinematography is not unique, and of course a passenger jet cap can only do a lot with the camera, but the dialogue is wonderful, the story is tat. There are no refinements, no matter what the problem is that the problem is confused with the heart in a war between the main characters. By keeping his attention and avoiding refinement, Wes Craven is a much less plot and exciting exciting action thriller.
