I always enjoyed Pokemon movies. Yes, I know that they are all in some places, in some places, and even in small areas, they are very young in some areas and they can be guarded with the ad. "Hey, easy, it's a child's picture," but next to all, they are still fun Not good pieces? In my opinion, they do so and I enjoy them too. This is as enjoyable as a previous three, and certainly cuter. It has some really sweet and touching moments since it's fun, the latest Pokemon Selby introduction. It's not the best Pok√©mon movie, the third is not bad but enjoy the third installment, and the whole series is just entertaining, harmless, popcorn family fun and nothing less. While the film is slightly slimmer than the last three, all the guarantees and characters in the film, especially the climax / endless, especially some serious marks of intensity and interest, are still my favorite and humorous. These films have been criticized for the lowest rate and the lowest four subdivisions, and are not eligible.
