"Kabie" describes the difficulties of a woman before and during WWII, raising her children alone after her husband was arrested for "crime perception". The film is directed by Yamada Yuji and as expected, the film's atmosphere is amazing. Historical virtue of some scenes, especially the beach scene, is suspicious. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film is absolutely believable. How can I prevent how they got this actor for the 2008 film? Sayyi as Yoshina, the most attractive and active actress in Japan, undoubtedly won her personal awards for her performance. Shoufukuti turbibube is really good in the supporting role. Although it was Annano's tandonobo, he painted his impressive performance, his character's disastrous and difficult situation. <br /> <br /> Images that foreshadowed the war are not my thing, but thanks to excellent direction and acting, I was fully perceived by the story. Moreover, "Uonagi no Machi, Sakura no kuni" is not distant, as oppression and brainwashing in Japan at that time examines the controversial and sensitive issue. Best Picture, recommended for most viewers.
