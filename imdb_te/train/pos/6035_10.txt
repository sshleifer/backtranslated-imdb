I have not decided on target audience for this film. I recently had a 50-person figure across the world of independent film. It was at the risk of the discovery of the film called Clercs last night on television one night. The first two things that I saw about the film were 1) technically absurd and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with the director on the local paper and Clers was one of his influences, I started to get interested. When I told her the main effect was The Station Agents, I watched a week before the DVD, I decided to go and check it out. The result can be explained similarly to Clarks, but these two movies did not say the same thing. Both images are suffering from technical writing, which are overtaken by fantastic writing. Although Clorx has nothing in his life, one day in the life of a frightened person who feared to ask tough questions about him and his situation, who is constantly a constant waiter forever, always running one way or another, so that he can never face the big things and fill his life. The themes and ideas of the film are strong and sharp. I can say since seeing that I have not changed much since I was growing up, young people still have the same problems. The author has these themes, the modern theme, the arts are amazingly honest characters, and they are completely unreliable. While indie cinema goes, this may not be perfect from the technical perspective, but from artistry, it is very close.
