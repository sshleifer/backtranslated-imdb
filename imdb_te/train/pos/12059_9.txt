I usually love ghost stories, but I especially love the ghastly, weathery and beautifully creepy British period style ghost stories. All these scores are eligible. An innocent young attorney ("lawyer" in Britspeck) is sent to a small village near the seaside to solve an elderly, deceased woman's estate. It was during the 1920s when most middle class brides went to the beach for "their health" for the holiday. Well, guessing is that there is nothing "healthy" about the village of Victorian estate, located on the fringes of a fog-swathed salt marsh on the hulking creepy site of the elderly woman, Krypton Gifford. When the lawyer saves the life of a little girl (no locals will help get trapped in the accident - you will find why in the next picture), he accidentally angrily the anger of a vicious soul, black woman. She does not have any affinity, Gazzie Wraith, but a nasty and evil of a solid black silhouette. The viewer sees only her a few times, but you feel her wretched presence in each frame. As the camera lawyer is crushed when reading through legal documents, you can expect to see a black woman at any time. When the lawyer comes out of the generator, he thinks he's gonna get old, home camera snakes and she'll pop there too. Waiting for an opiate woman is nail-deep. We have seen many elements of this story before the story (no one who does not care about the locals' warnings, the fog, the innocent guy), but the director manages to combine to a completely new and compelling ghost. Look with a friend so that you have to spend a while looking for a black woman. . .
