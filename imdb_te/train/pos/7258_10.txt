Recently I was fortunate enough to get a DVD copy of this movie and now I see it for the 2nd time. <br /> <br /> It is not uncommon for most of the movie, because there is no speaking conversation in this move - just listen to the ideas of the characters - it's just Not an exceptional thing. When I'm looking for a copy of the film, I'm the producer dead and the main actor dies, it is not kept in any British TV or movie archive, it is not always released on video or DVD, after their copyright 80s worldwide television networks Trash it. First there are no devices that can record users when they are shown on TV in Australia. <br /> <br /> In the latter view, I see why it's unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Whenever I want a DVD copy please send me an email and I'm sure I can do something.
