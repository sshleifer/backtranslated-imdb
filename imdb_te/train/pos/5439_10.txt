Naturally, Buddy is also a great influence on the genre or action style. George Lucas needs a fan of this film as he looks at the stardom of his stardom in the Star Wars series. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dramas are the precursors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chaabakaka. Also morphed into Sam Jaw's Gunga Din C-3PO and R2-D2 and not like him or not: Jar Jar Binks. <br /> Today, the film is viewed as a non-PC but Eduardo Ciannelli is a speech. The leader of the Indian Opposition Leader to the British Raj is reflecting many of the sentiments today. <br /> <br /> "Three strong man leads and only a hint of love." There was a time when young people who kissed in Mitra's film were just lazy. <br /> <br /> Hopefully this movie has not been forgotten and some of the surfing channels stop at TCM and act as CGI actors with action, adventure and thousands of cast.
