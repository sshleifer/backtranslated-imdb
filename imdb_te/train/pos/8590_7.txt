I'm at the forefront of going to the movies and spending $ 15 on Keefor Sutherland watching my favorite role in TV history. I also feel that this is true for Eva Longoria fans. <br /> <br /> Film Secret Service Agent is planning to kill the president. With the investigation being done, the only possible candidate is the most decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). <br /> <br /> It goes in a fun, fugitive style to search for the truth. <br /> <br /> It's great, but absolutely amazing. A good cast, a good story but I felt a bit empty, but you're definitely pretty bad.
