I'm waiting for a long time to see this film. This promotes a fair idea of ​​promos content and, eventually, when I see it, it's very well made. Many of the traditional romantic movies have finally started a happy marriage after marriage or marriage, but the new relationship from old life and life requires a really great adjustment for this transformation. The film is all about the newly married couple Freddin and Isha's marriage to the marriage and start their life with their honeymoon. I was a bit silent, and if I thought she could use some lines, acting was really binding. The story is well woven and dialogues are very low. Editing and direction are good, Meghana Gulzar has done a really good job. To summarize I would say that a good play romance is a real combination of Bollywood's a clean entertainer.
