I came back from a pre-release view of this amazing sci-fi movie noire. It's the perfect unique and well made of style. It is portrayed with original actors, but is transformed into a black and white comic strip style you have not seen before. It goes a step further than Sin City, and it does well. It is a successful combination of French comedy and film culture. The story and mood are reminiscent of Blade Runner, and if you like it, you surely love it. The storyline is intelligent, boring and there are some nice little twists. This film must see any filmfilm except for those who do not like science fiction or b & w.
