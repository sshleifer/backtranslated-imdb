The subject of this documentary is very powerful, which brought me to tears. Yes, I say tears. This public struggle of people who are traditionally exploited to stand up for our rights, to stop the cowardly prosecution to challenge the good of society and to challenge the establishment. Chouz played a weak and unfortunate role, the face of Bush dirty corporations and the capitalism of Amok. In fact, Latin America has been rebuilt and ultimately the vast majority has a voice over five hundred centuries. However, in Mexico, this election was clearly stolen by Calderone. Chavez is not accurate, from far away. He is trying to change the constitution to rule indefinitely. It can not cope. Fits in politics and back image; The pace is breathing at moments, and the others are deep philosophical. Chavez did not acknowledge the role of a leading hero to challenge the US domination and domination of world base. If you think the author is biased in favor of Chavez, nothing stopping you from doing your homework. An important message of the film was questioned by sources of death by snipers executing insulting allegations against Chavez's supporters. Venezuela puts it as an insult to American accusing democracy. Hesta Revolution Cement!
