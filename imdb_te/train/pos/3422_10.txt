<br /> I have a nephew who is in demand, but I am ready to go to Iraq after December 2008. I missed my beloved son in Iraq in Iraq at 09-15-05. I have another nephew who joined the army soon after graduating from high school this spring, because there is some idealistic and fantasy idea of ​​working in the military as his elder brother. My wrist died only 10 days in the country and he has not gone on any of the missions now, and how my nephews do not suggest experiences shown in this documentary from personal experiences sent by my son's son. <br /> <br /> I can not do anything about those who are in or out of now, but I did not raise his hand and did not swear at home. <br /> <br /> The documentary The Ground Truth is the best visual reference to me. Never seen. I eventually need my little nephew to see what he's getting himself up before he's late. But: (do not laugh) I need my mother to see this first. She is in fact not looking at and listening to men and women, not just their idea, but they will forever be immersed. Then she will have an emotional decision to watch this movie with my brother and he can also see his son, my younger nephew, also see it. Then, my nephew can start to take this seriously. <br /> <br /> My problem is, if my mother does not have a DVD player, she still uses the video (that is correct? tapes?) I need a way to see this film. Can I buy someone in this form? Otherwise, do I have any other way to get this way out of tape? Is there any legal link that I pay to download and transfer to my computer on my computer? If so, who should contact me. I'm not happy with the right to grant a legal link. <br /> If you have any alternative ideas, I'll consider anything you can suggest. <br /> <br /> Help me, I never know when my old nephew will come back and I will miss him too. The emotional toll for all that I am losing three and making it back is that the price that every male child in my family has to pay is very high. Please help. I would gladly call you to get the information you need, send me an email. Thank you so much for any help you offer. <br /> <br /> <p> msgid "Sincerely, Lori Swanburg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
