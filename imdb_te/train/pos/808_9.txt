I only directed Jedi Return, someone else, I mean, very unnecessary scenes are absolutely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, our heroes appear to be different people: Princess Lia Solo will not be able to fight any longer, and Luke boring, Darth Vader is not bad, and Yoda dies. <br /> <br /> But many unusual things I can not hate in this episode. <br /> <br /> Some spillers 1 - Jabba Temple 2 Sail Barge Attack Sequence. 3-Chakravarti (now it is bad) 4- Speeders chase at Under Forest. 5-final battle. 6-The Dark Side Summer Scene. 7-Anankin is back on the good side of power. 8- And the last ceremony. <br /> <br /> Some of them are good for tears to your eyes. If some scenes are cut, and if another director is appointed, this is as accurate as episode 4 and 5, but still unusual. 9 out of 10
