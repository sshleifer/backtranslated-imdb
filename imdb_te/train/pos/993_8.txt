Actually this film is not so bad. It involves action, comedy and enthusiasm. The film has good actors, such as Doug Hutchison (Percy from "The Green Mile"), playing Bristol. Another well-known actor Jamie Kennedy, from "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters played Jamie Fox in the role of Alvin, while David Morse as Edgar Clanton, the most surprised man, although he was very good and funny. "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliere", he played a very sympathetic person, and "Byte" is almost nothing but a man without plays, it's nice to see. What's really unfortunate about this film is that many films of the World Trade Center will make this film appear for some time. Overall I thought this is a pretty good little picture!
