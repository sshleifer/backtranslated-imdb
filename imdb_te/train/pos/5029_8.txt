I have seen the film in the film to be shaded by malicious and slash movies on screen. Boy, I was surprised. This little treasure is frustrating and happy with the dark atmosphere. The more surprising yet blood actually shown is limited. Like most good films, it has left some of the imagination and has done an excellent job of directing Bill Paxton. The scenes shot in the car after seeing the "Anatomy of a Scene" episode at the end of the video tape is good, some of the subtle and amazing things that I have observed, just a "Oh, that's good, keep it" type of direction. This is a movie that is full of seriousness. Nevertheless, for the dark matter, a portion of it was filmed in the daytime, and there were some disturbing scenes. Acting is unusual (okay, I'm always a fan of Powers Booth), and do not go to the top. Au Contraire, which is under control, works well for this type of film. If the film does not exist any area, it's in the end, it looks slightly contrived, but still works at a simpler level without destroying the message of the mood or movie. What's the message Everyone decides for themselves. Overall, in the 1-10 scale, the film is for those who love Southern Gothic style (ie: "Body Heat" or "Midnight in Good and Evil Garden") and a 5 't.
