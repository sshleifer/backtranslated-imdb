.... Actually, full - attacking nasty villains in their cave, Little Big Horn style works for me, to save the day by waterboys' bugging, stop sudden. <br /> How would you play it on DVD on 66 years later? As a Western, near to the Apaches or Sioux, and the US Cavalry subbing for the Imperial British Army struck me. It's too colonial in short, do you know? The White Man's burden and all? <br /> <br /> With the extensive play as Cape Grant, Fairbanks and McLaughlin, some buddy fired a buddy slapstick and mixed the clashes for a good measure. (I thought I was the Token Army mistress of Joan Fontaine - they left her a bit too small in a certain cutting room floor) - none of them were for the Oscars - not actually Grant at some scenes - but it is still going to work. And who else has Ben Casey been an Indian bugler? <br /> <br /> In Hollywood only. <br /> <br /> Check it out if you like adventure and fake Western style antics. It was done by a group of pros, well I might add it. <br /> *** Outa ****
