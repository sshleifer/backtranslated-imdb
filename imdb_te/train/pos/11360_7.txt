Chris Jerrolmo was cautious that the list of people who were murdered was just a type of Jack-the-stripper. Probably by both of them, Stephan Rey's spectacular performance against Donald Sutherland may be due to good. Is it playing two parts? All the above ?? The film has more than just a morbid account for Rostov's butcher's history. Supporting actors, particularly Max Von Sido, have played their parts well. Good direction. Photography is great. The fact that the film depicted in Hungary is not to say that this little trivial can be completely forgotten, for telling the story and the depth of comments. <br /> Once, the TV movie made from HBO comes up with trumps. Recommended, especially if you want to forget some of the journalistic analysis and explore? This is, I'm quick to add, no exaggeration.
