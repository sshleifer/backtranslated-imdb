At the Appalachian Film Festival, I have the opportunity to watch the film for the first time, in which it won the Best Film Award. The film is brighter and it works well with an amazing cast. My favorite shows come from Yusuf Kerkor, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. Also, there are some great effects with dragonfly and cockroaches, that I was surprised to find that this film was made on a small budget. I will do a great job with the director-director Adam Jones, who has won an award for his work. The audience loved this movie. Cross Eyed will make you laughing throughout the movie. Definitely a must see.
