In 1995, when many people talked about Breevheriar's great premiere by Mel Gibson, Scotland's history, Robboy also saw another better and less well-documented film. Although it is a very different film, the story of the historical period is set in the story, although Rob ROY is just as common with the spirit of the most epic films along with the amazing BRAVEHEART. <br /> Discusses themes such as courage, courage, honor, vengeance, and the key to the happiness of the family. It also leads us to the very delight of Scottish mountains that the human soul finds its surrounding nature encompasses all the greatness. Robert Roy MacGregor (Liam Neeson), the main character is a true hero (universal in the legends), "Scottish Robin Hood", a "Scottish Robin Hood" who struggles to get rid of his oppressed oppression. Although he has been worse with his actions by actions, it is very painful, with two things in his mind unquestionably: that he gave himself and his woman, Mary McGregor (Jessica Lange), to be affectionate. This will lead to unexpected events. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> This factor requires both movies and movies and wardrobe to be made. Many memorable moments are in the mind of any artist. For me, the most spectacular scenery tells his boys what Rob Roy really means to be honored while in the highlands. Then, he sends them and beautifully loves his woman. The scene of his escape from the waterfall of Montrose Margus (John Hurt) appears spectacular. <br /> In reality, there is some graphical violence, for example dual, but I do not think this violence is harmful in many other modern films. Its justification is similar to other legends: bloodshed and cruelty that are really serious and there is no point in hiding. The most anxious scene for me is the story of the villain against Rob Roy's wife: Arbibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) rape. It's really frustrating and the kids should definitely avoid it. However, all remaining O.K. <br /> <br /> There is a fact that I really love this movie. <br /> <br /> The Scotland man, who plays a brilliant role in British cox's supporting role, from the famous Lyon Neeson, who is well-suited for all cast, long, brave, strong character, is a silent witness of the horrific actions of the evil forces in the war. Jessica Lange is as good as Mary McGregor and has many beautiful moments in the film. In many scenes there is a chemistry between Mrs. Lange and Mr. Neeson. John Hurt, one of the best British actors, is doing a brilliant job like Mantis's Marquis, a corrupt man. I like the calm of his character. But the real villain played the role of Tim Roth, his character apparently portrayed AriBabald's obscenity - a person who loves war and finds a real mess in the slaughter and slaughter. <br /> <br /> In any good epic, this extraordinary evil will see its end. <br /> <br /> And yet another perspective: musical score: Such memorable and sentimental tones that can sound in the ears for a long time. The final moment causes me to tear, because this is not known to everyone, but I have the greatness of places that combine these progressive voices. Scotland is in the heart of its visitors and reminds me of the permanent effect of this film. This is my second trip to Scotland. <br /> <br /> Rob Roby is a very nice movie, well directed, photographed and acted. It probably does not have a large number of spectacular scenes and war scenes, but it must have a movie with a very important feature: To have a very fun movie: Excellent entertainment with heart education. I really enjoyed that movie, do not hesitate to call it "fun mountain ranges" and rate it 9/10
