The soul is a wild horse and a unique and realistic form of Western life from the perspective of native Americans. <br /> <br /> The friendship and souls in this film focuses on the friendship, the spirit, the friendships and the dangers encountered in his life. <br /> <br /> Using the technologies available in the film, <br /> <br /> Bryan Adams's songs, and the music from Hans Zimmer's music, is amazing, from the 1994 Disney Hit the Lion King to the most popular music He was responsible. <br /> <br /> The story is not very deep but some films do not remove my opinion from the whole movie, but not too deep. <br /> <br /> The amazing image I enjoyed extensively, and it is suitable for all family. Should not be missed. (10/10)
