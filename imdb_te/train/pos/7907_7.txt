I can not agree less with the rating given to this film, and I believe this is a sample of how little mindset the minds all around the world. Really ... Do you forget that the movie is a kind of art before trying to make some business just like fun? This movie is not entertainment, it's not just fun at the movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It's style, it's different, it's shocked ... That's why most of you hate it because it's not happy. It's just the story, I'm too weird to admit, but after all, an unusual story. It's not a great story but a great movie work, but it's worth 7-star rating to dare both the writer and the director to portray the story that does not promote the audience, thus selling billions of copies and big studios to make it richer. The film is made in the United States in the European-Artistic-like film, and everyone involved in it deserves respect. Be it for the courage, or the only sense of humor.
