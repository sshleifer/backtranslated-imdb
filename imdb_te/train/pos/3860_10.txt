In Holland, homosexual author Gerard (Jer√≥n Crabb) gives a lecture. He is overnight with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (she imagines a boy). He plans to leave the next day, but Christine's hunky boyfriend Hermann (Tham Hoffman) decides to try and try him. Then things will come fantastically. <br /> <br /> In 1983, the big M rated art house hit in the US. Many people, a scene in the church with a cross that is a gay sex scene shock in a crypt ... and it's all comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeen after "Speters". Extreme sex scenes have been attacked by critics by "speters" and denounced as a trash. Thus, the picture was filled with clear signs of thinking that critics would be getting art and appreciation. He's right! Critics have not realized that Vershoven is a big joke on the film. Still, this is a great movie. <br /> It is beautifully portrayed by John de Bont (now director) and there are so many symbols and clear "hidden" layers that you are never bored. All acting is very good - Krabbe plays a completely satisfying role but (somehow) you separate him; Seeing Soutendijk and his piece of perfection is just amazing - Gerard gives her a little smile when she agrees to stay with; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Huffman is very beautiful to a great body - credit worthy of doing the church scene and going with a crab in a crypt. <br /> <br /> It's not easy for people to be offended or heart weak, you just like fun movies (like me) it's for you! A 10 all the way.
