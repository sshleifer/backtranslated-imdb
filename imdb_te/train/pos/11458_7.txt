Thanks again from the darkness. Insight in the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. There is no need for anyone to see that many of us have a lot of surprise. Golds valley's sculptures come alive and it is very pleasant to see his reaction to everyone. This artist is not for money or fame - because he created it. This is his life. When you see his failures, there is the power to remove energy from his body like a bursting hot air balloon. It's not afraid of the beginning again, it takes his power from his work. It is somewhat painful to see him recapture the nature and remember his work, but it is breathtaking. He discusses the flow and time in a little dialogue, and there is no doubt that the artist and the earth are the same. He says he needs land, but he does not need it ... I beg out differently. The mere complaint of the musical score seems to slow down further pace.
