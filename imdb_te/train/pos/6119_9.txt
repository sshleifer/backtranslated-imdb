Okay, but plain mute. Not bad for horror / funny movie. I read how people changed with Michael's version and some elders hates scary and when they see this, they're not interested in horror films or maybe not see it (never seen), horror (maybe funny) uncle, I'll see about renting or buying that movie This is the 2nd though I am Amazon's VHS this one Onugolu and the day before Thanksgiving, November 21, got it. Four bucks value, l.o.l. <br /> <br />
