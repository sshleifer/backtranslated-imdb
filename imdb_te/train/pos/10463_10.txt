When I saw in the schedule for Christmas, the novel was not read and the title was not well understood as I had not heard anything about the film. And, after reading the content, I decided to spend my Christmas evening watching the film. This effect made me totally surprised: I do not remember when I saw an image that every moment reached me. Anything a VOW to the church has, without doubt, is one of the films that I have realized from the movie. There are some controversies about why I thought this film was the least understated part of the film. <br /> <br /> First, the whole content is specially educated. Some answers to pure right faith and universal questions - it is for modern audiences. Does Christ need us in our time? Love still mind What is the faith there? What is the logic of life and suffering? Can I believe if someone really believes in me? <br /> <br /> In this movie we will find answers that come through the characters. <br /> <br /> Second, the movie is exceptionally human. The main characters experience inner struggles and take very hard decisions. Beginning of their lives, or they can forget about the family to retain the values ​​taught at home denman Kyle David and Teri (Megan Paul) is good? Ellen (Barbara Babcock), leaving his ailing wife, Julia (Donna Bullock) who falls in love with the launch of a new happy life, John (Ken Howard) is not better? In fact, Ellen can no longer recognize him ... however, he vows his wife's eternal loyalty. John's rebellious brother, Phil (D. David morin), goes to the best of his easy life, or even his life, to his satisfaction, teccipettakapoyina begins to think seriously. Phil's prayer to God in this park is a mental abilities of mankind's universal concept. <br /> <br /> Third, the movie is not very popular nowadays, and there are still many problems: there are still problems, yet, these people are something more powerful. This "something" love and belief. I know I can feel a bit idealistic. All families can not rely on loyalty and may not be as simple as that. <br /> <br /> The fourth whole film focuses on people's mutual support. If we want to live happier lives in our society, we need to understand one thing: we need to help one another. Alexander (Oscy Davis) is an example of such an attitude. At the beginning of the film, we see John talking about prayer. Later, he helps his brother. Alexander John and his family are the "angel". <br /> <br /> Fifth, artistic features also focus. PERFORMANCES: Barbara Babcock gave Ellen a classic show and she is doing a perfect job while she has a very difficult role. For example, the moment she looks at in school, she wants to teach again. Ken Howard should also be a loyal husband. Image: Sunshine (love) spreads everywhere the most memorable for me, however, fallen leaves (autumn) in the park, walking on the scene of John and Ellen. నేను ఒక విధమైన చిహ్నంగా వ్యాఖ్యానించాను: దుఃఖం ఉన్నప్పటికీ, ఇది ఎల్లప్పుడూ కాంతి మరియు ఆనందంతో ప్రకాశింపజేయగలదు ... <br /> <br /> చర్షీకి ఒక వావ్ వాస్తవికంగా దాని అర్థం ఏమిటో నాకు చూపించిన అద్భుతమైన చిత్రం ప్రేమ, ఏ విశ్వసనీయత అలాగే అది నివసించడానికి మరియు నమ్మకం ఎంత అందమైన నాకు నిరూపించబడింది . Finally, I found the film is a lot of words I want hattukunevatini and I hope you will also /> <br /> Kyle's uncle Phil to <br: Yes, he (John Brighton) Bible. But no one will force you. However, what rules do you live in?
