Looking back after a long period of rest, it was a flaw in its original release, and I was amazed how it was. One of the reasons for its failure was that one generation had suffered a miscarriage and was disappointed that a young man did not show full hippie fame. Now Antonio is already familiar with the serious combination of change, with eager enthusiasm and no clear vision for the future. The main couple were amazing and a shameful one they took too much flak for the film's perceived failure. They demonstrate the ideal and variety of contradictions and demonstrate pure happiness with love. I initially blamed others for concentrating on student rebel sequences, but from there one of the most beautiful pictures of the film and the best man he made and the natural landscapes. Oh, and I did not say the most explosive ending.
