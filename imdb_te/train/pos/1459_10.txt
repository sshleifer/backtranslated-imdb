Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a non-pre-documentary documentary on globalization until I saw Murray Grass: made in China. The film has zero commentary and combines great footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in China, who live within a factory compound. They play with toys, jump rope, and dances. However, most of their days and nights have work, work and work - but the footage of their work is brilliant and mesmerizing to see. The owner of the factory in China has opened a tremendous opening so that he can bring home the effects of globalization, and the workers will "punish" him. How Martha Grass Beaded From China to Carnival The film will then connect the local world with humor and interesting and comprehensive scenes from both cultures. One of the most interesting episodes in the film is the cultural introduction of the factory workers and Mardi Gras films attending each other. Here, the picture comes with a full circle and shows how the images are communicated and transformed. The film never preachy, not guilty, and everyone's opinions point allows the present. In the end, we - the audience - make our own decisions about the complexity and globalization of the film.
