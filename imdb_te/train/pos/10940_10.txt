This is definitely one of the best Kung Fu movies, and may be one of the best movies ever ... It has a great story, it's a puzzle like a puzzle, intrigue and lots of suspense. The film is filled with cat and mouse games and hypocrisies, people who hide their identities and their nature. The characters in this movie will live and breathe more than your average Kung Fu movie characters. They are all interesting and compelling and does a good job at giving the scenes the image to show their personality and desires. <br /> <br /> <br /> The fight scenes play out as short stories and most of them are very original and exciting. It has excellent training sequences and martial arts skills, they are awesome. There are five members of the Poison lineage with his own style of mimicking the specialty of the toxic animal. The styles of each of these characters are pleasant to watch and the techniques used in the training you use are in the picture ... When this happens, the director uses quick cutting for a parallel draw training scene. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> When talking about the film, these changes are made by music changes and The whole thing works well with the sound effects. Film director Chang Cheh clearly stated that the film is not small enough. It makes some scenes more efficient in this movie. We really care when people die in this movie. Even when bad guys die, the camera stands on the horror of death. Some scenes in this movie are really stiff. The characters find a vengeance and you really feel their anger and pain. <br /> <br /> At the same time, it's also a fun movie. It's all the different things you expect from the classic Kung Fu movie. The evil is dubbing, the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat. Sound effects are some of the happiest and most characteristic of the character of the characters at times. <br /> <br /> The director is a visual stylist and gave more than his counterparts. If you look closely at the movie, you may notice that the technological prowess contradiction in the show is contradictory. Everything happens very fast (quick cutting style and fast camera movements of style) makes it easy to see how good this image is. Lighting and composition are excellent at times. Camera work and movement are very sophisticated with a very fast fast paced compilation ... For example, imagery of suspense and intrigue, imagine hitchcock moving at speeds twice. Chang Chen is truly an artistic person and the artist knows his style and is able to produce an important item while working in its limits. He tightly tightens the boat's Kung Fu film, but in his miniature, his skills are scattered every shot and every shot and they have the quality of work. He is an important filmmaker who influences many people. <br /> <br /> This is a real package, a kung fu movie that provides for each level. It's art, it's worse, it's mentally moving, it's fun, it has a real meaning for morality, but does not allow it to get that morality in the way of doing good things. I recommend you either the fan of this genre or everyone.
