As I have already said, one of John Kapperter's 1978 classic two of the first movies I can see is reminiscent and heavily influenced (being the classic Canon the Barbarian). I really was frightened by the fact that my last boyfriend (my imaginary friend) had been friends with me when I was not sleeping in my sleeping monster Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> It's horror classic and my modest review I think it does not do the right justice. All the surprising thing is that the film is still working, perhaps in the action of a cognitive, cognitive or immediate subculture. It all happened. It's impossible or not in a foreign country (most modern horror, such as hostel, touristas, cry wolf, sa, etc.). It is contrary to our graphs at other times. This is something I'm scared or out of the night doing very little, and the signature soundtrack is still obvious on their head. It still works because we can replace or tertiary killing with the more terrifying mind that our mind produces. So we are contributing to our own fears and concerns. <br /> <br /> Carpenter maintains a simple story about everyday, middle class, suburban and relatively benign child. He then spent 15 years in an organization that we could not escape and return to his hometown, the infamous Haddonfield (we did fortunately experience). On his way he was killed and killed. Although Michael is not a man, his name is Michael Myers. John Carpenter uses Michael Myers as a metaphor against the precise security of the middle class suburb. <br /> <br /> In the castle of American security and security, confusion can still strike. <br /> <br /> Michael became a man when he was killed. He is not a serial killer, human or mental illness. He is unstoppable. Simple overalls, bleached-white saturn mask, and some breathlessness due to lack of any communication can help in disqualification and completion of Michael's production. It is the source of his power. He is uninformed, confusing and confusing, rather than a cruel chaos. It is lack of cinematography (postcard effect), lack of information / inspiration / explanation and experience of Donald Pleases (Dr. Loomis). He sells "shape" with outstanding performance and discontent. Larry Strood is also the first film to be Jamie Lee Curtis as the innocent girl (who at least for a short time) refuses to be confused with the most inequalities. <br /> <br /> This new niche of horror films is not the first film (Black Christmas 4 years ago), which is very successful and redefining. If you are scared by horror films for a long time (like me), it will make your hair behind the back of your head with the first cords of the signature soundtrack. I should look at this film horror film so well and be one of the pinnacles of John Carpenter's career.
