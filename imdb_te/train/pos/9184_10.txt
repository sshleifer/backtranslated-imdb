Yes, this product is long (good news for the BrontÃ« fans!) And it has a long time experience, but if you do not want to see the actors, actors and acting are both good! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />> I do not care that other reviewers mentioned that he was so beautiful. Dalton is definitely, attractive, but pretty boy. In fact he has a craggy, steeper dark charm that he has a lot to keep in my mind, mysterious, very masculine r. And he takes poignantly so to Rochester's sad, tortured personality. He warms up when the scene is called for, but Rochester's tender, also emotionally, emotionally. I have read many times in the book and Rochester is a nonstop snarling beast - I normally worship Chiran Hinds, who is usually worshiping - and I am generally worshiping him. <br /> When I read the novel I see Jayla Clark as Jane Ms. Clarke, for me, is similar to Jane as she describes herself (and others v She was eight years old in Lothud, who trained to check emotions and "passionate temper", although she did not appear to act or sculpture. Her primary inspiration was her childhood friend, Helen, which is related to Diemer's dedication Iii. Her true nature is ambiguous, however, as well as learning how to Jane, her servant, and his voluntary service program is designed for students to go to school and learned to cultivate the targets. Rich in the home of Mr. Rochester and Jane became a govarnes. She certainly did not speak to him equally. Remember that even after she gave her, remember that her station is below her employee. However, if you read this book - this product is superbly close - you can clearly see the small struggles of Jelah-i-Jane, as her emotions are inconvenient to be mild and temperate. /> The chemistry between Dalton and Clark is right, I think. No, it's similar to Hollywood (thanks to God! It's not Hollywood's sort of book) but theirs is a romance which is real, devoted and reliable. <br /> <br /> You do not think there is any love for a woman like Zen, this is a small miracle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast are excellent, and the character from almost every book is here. So, also, great, poetic original conversation is very much. This version has a lovely, infamous 'gypsy scene' and, in general, has more humor than other versions I've seen. In particular, mutual teasing between the main characters comes directly from the book and is very happy! <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre is one of the first novel feminists in many ways. Finally, she accepted the love of her own words, and eventually agreed to Rochester's real equivalent. Just beautiful!
