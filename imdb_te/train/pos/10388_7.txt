I'm a fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. And I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> "Excellent plot" The funny hearing people against the film are train and "It's rarely a show than the show." Does anyone remember the misfortune of humor in the pilot episode? Daisy habitual jokes and bob Luke said that half the children were born in the orphanage. <br /> <br /> <br /> When the plot goes, it is cleaned up. This is the perfect dukes plot. <br /> <br /> Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville Although their small screen versions are not perfect, they are a great job and work well together. Although I was Burt's Boss Hog, I was not very interested. I have a slight inefficiency from sheriff Rosco. <br /> <br /> Rosco is a little scary in the film. Who does not smile on their face while running through the streets of General Lee Atlanta through the streets and hazard roads? <br /> <br /> This is just a great dumb picture!
