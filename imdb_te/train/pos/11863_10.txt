Maybe this is probably the best film ever made and it's not exactly here Brian de Palma is one of the greatest cinematic artists who are burning on your students here. Brian D'Palma's Director Touch is the first to testify that he is one of the best directors, and there is an amazing show from Al Pacino that distributes an immortal hero in the big screen (Tony Montana), and you'll never ever ever see (violent) scenes ever (Tony is sitting with a bath Where there are many people's rooms), many excellent a-lei The nurses often use the term "f * ck"), the fabulous little details (Pan American-Globe, "The World Your Meet") or Giorgio Moroder. Nothing is named unnamed and it is one of the best gangstormiders in addition to "The Godfather", "Good Fetas" and "White Heat!"
