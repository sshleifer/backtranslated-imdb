An American in Paris is the ultimate blend of art and Hollywood music. MGM's powers were built into a musical powerhouse, which featured memorable music from Gershwin, who were equally known as the 20th century Beethoven and Mozart. <br /> <br /> Jean Kelly is at the height of his power in the film, although the film claims to be ready for his best work in Sing In the Rain (1952). Two films are actually close. In addition to the Arthur Freed Connection, the Broadway melody segment in "Rain" owes an amazing American presence to the Paris Ballet sequence. It is specifically referenced in the opening credits of the film as a dance number. <br /> <br /> In this film, it should be like Jean Kelly's dancer and ballerina to their highest level. <br /> <br /> The casting of the film is uniformly amazing. Leslie Caron makes her film debut for the first time, which she exhibits in a mature way, and she wants to make films over the years. There are some surprising sexy moments in MGM musicals only by Syndis Charisse's work in syndin in her introduction dance series, and later in her writing, Sing and the Band Wagon in Ballet. Oscar Lewent Kelly's Stoic Pal is the film, which is one of the best two films: End Party Sequence (which I give to anyone who does not watch the movie), and one of the film's most memorable musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Kelly's romantic rival George Guitar Some of the musical headlines, though, and Leesley Coron's Nina Foch ka romantic rival. <br /> The May-December relationship between Kelly's character and Nina reminds me of the "two men" relationships between George Pepperd and Patricia Neal in Tiffany. <br /> <br /> Some elements of the film are less satisfying than 'Sing' in the rain. Although ballet, luxury and well-produced, the rest of the picture is not really good enough. Without giving the plot, the ballet can only happen without a real poem or reason. Unlike Broadway Melody Sequence, this is nothing to do with the platform - and in the best musical shorts, the songs are somehow up to date. <br /> <br /> The Bollywood film is going to happen soon. The ending is not ending (after all of a MGM musical,), I was hoping a bit more ... the film after the ballot ended. Director Vincent Minnelly felt he could not follow any ballot. <br /> <br /> In addition to being an American Hollywood's best musical heroine in Paris, it is perfectly negative. It did not reach much of Sinigine's heights in the rain, but it came close, and it remains a clause for Jean Kelly's skills of one of the greatest dancers of all time.
