From the first scene you have a clue what will happen here. The story becomes more evident in rolls. Acting is wonderful and these actors touch your soul. Even though I knew what had happened, I was very confused by the inspiration. I'm still worried about why Ben did what he did. We could see his face in "second thoughts", but the ultimate sacrifice went against his emotions and feelings. It's a very interesting and touching story but I'm confused. Probably the location of that movie. I like the movie and Will Smith can cut another good movie option. This guy knows how to enjoy the audience!
