"Welcome to Collingwood" offers a very happy dialogue with a recent memory. This movie, which was directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, reminds us of another movie, but since we lost early credits, we had to wait until the 1958 Italian movie "Madonna Street Big Deal" directed by Mario Monique. <br /> <br /> Russian brothers are a brilliant performer to portray all the characters in the film. William H. Macy, Louise Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, anything with the last Michael Jetters, it's not bad. It's a collective piece so all the characters get a chance to shine. <br /> <br /> In this movie we will have safe crackers from hell. No one could assume that these men can carry on a job they can undertake. Wrong, and whatever happens, they succeed in doing so. George Clooney plays a minor role as a master of safe cracker, who appears to be a rabbi, confused with a priest by the gang members from Cosimo's funeral. <br /> <br /> Let's sit back in the movie and relax, and let this little time crooks know their thing. Let them laugh at their funny lines, as anyone can see, this gang is sad from the beginning to the end!
