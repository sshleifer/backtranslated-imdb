Ulysses, like a film, can not be compared to the novel, because they are two different themes. Nevertheless, the film still manages to perform many aspects of the book work, but as it is a visual medium, it is difficult to remove the stream-off-consciousness. I think it's the best film I can make with this topic ... and move on to the movies that do not like their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the movie is still entertaining.
