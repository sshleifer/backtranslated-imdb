A Laurel & Hardy Comedy Short. The boys will wipe the chimneys in a nonsense professor Noodell's house, who integrates his reaction to serum. Stan & Ali also spreads their dirty work along with the destruction of the house and the ceiling. Then the professor wants to try his new potion ... <br /> <br /> Very funny little picture. The end is a bit abrupt, but the very slapstick that has led to it is amazing. At the end of the chimney, Stillings & Ali's Willy's competition is very good. It was Lucian Littlefield as Professor.
