"Cosmoi" was last year, the last film I had seen before marrying. <br /> This is the first film I was married to because we promised to give a copy to both of us. <br /> <br /> Unlike the reality fiction sometimes. For all those who wrote that the priests are not in real life like "Don Camillo", I would recommend them to visit my Priest Pee. Nuno Westwood in Estorill, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> For all others, see this movie, before and after "I'm!" Day :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
