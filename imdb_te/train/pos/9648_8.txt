I liked this movie too. The story is back and forth backward and a little forward and not easy. There is no resolution for the story, and you are surprised to find out what really happened. I liked this because I liked that movie. I especially like scenes between "dating" boys and I have been drawn into their lives. In fact any film with nude Stephane Rhydow will get extra points. ;-)
