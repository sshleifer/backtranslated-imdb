This is the best of all football movies I've ever seen. Being the other fever pitch. But the hero has so far been a great player to play in the World Cup Diego Maradona about the great World Cup and eventually the World Cup. This story is primarily centered around him, but revolves around the game's other monsters at the time. <br /> <br /> The musical score is inspiring and the images are powerful. The story of Michael Caine is objectively impartial and calmly dramatic. This story is not the personal games of the World Cup; <br /> <br /> There are tremendous games in the same vein as France v Brazil (one of the best games). The last Argentin v w Germany is also in the same vein. Highly recommended. Classic of world football. If you're a Maradona fan, you need to look back again.
