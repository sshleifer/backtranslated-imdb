I realized that this film is not really based on Daddy Smith's novel. In any case, it's a good idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now have his own puppies. Although the dalmatian is beautiful, the film is completely dumbfunken to the end of snowball. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I do not know what I think if Krulella De Will is totally compassionate. In fact, I have often thought about the possibility that she can become friendly, but now she has quickly become "she" and once again declared that she is Kremla, I am almost really worried about Chloe's dalmatians. Actually, in the scenes where dogs see lady and trumpets, Chloe and Kevin are much better than I expected while having their dinner. I'm also a dog-like parrot, and it's wonderful that dogs have learned many tricks in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do, Snowball is also at the end of the cinema.
