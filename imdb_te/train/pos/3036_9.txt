The name just says it. When I came out I saw this movie with my father and he had great praise for man serving in Korea. The film was disappointing that it would only focus on man's life for some time - an eighth bio-pick, which feels inconsistent to predict the cost of man's entire life. <br /> Some posters have escaped flawed characteristics about the man who is the cheapest shots. The background of the film "Duty, Honor, Country" is not just contradictory from the lips of the high-brass officer - it's a deep statement of the whole devotion of a person in his country. Ironically Peck is generous that he has gained a good understanding of man. He does a great job of showing the fearless nature of nature with man's humanity's side.
