For many people watching this film, it has low interest, but hundreds of movies deal in magic and snap, in one form or another, perhaps best in many ways. <br /> <The Gold from the Craft from the Subject of Understanding Interest of Movie Industry. Most of the films touched on it are childhoods (for example "Witchboard", the real part of the full trash in every way) cheesy special effects or cardboard cutaway villiers (cf "magician"). More often the subject comes in a silly religious context (in various revelations based films, the antichrist is inevitably a lawyer practicing something new). Rarely, it is rarely seen in some realm of magic, as it has been practiced in real life, but the performance of the occasion in such films is better than literal or symbolic ... <br /> Many years later I saw this film again. I saw in front of VHS; It's a dark, moody piece, and after watching it on DVD, I'll say if you have any intention to watch this movie, watch on DVD, do not look in VHS. <br /> <br /> Dark and moody are rising in VHS but the DVD takes on a very different tone in the DVD. I think that would intentionally move darker elements for the wire style, but the film goes over this edge when the VHS is converted into low color media. The DVD brings life back to the film and I see it differently. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I realized that the treatment of magic was very good as it was first seen. <br /> <br /> If you are honest and interested to anyone in real life, this film is countless. <br /> And no one else, you really waste time reading this time.
