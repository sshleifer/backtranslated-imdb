Alan Johnson (Don Cheadley) is a successful dentist, who shares his business with other business partners. Alan has a loving wife (Jada Pinkett Smith) and has two daughters (Smith & Imani Hakim by Camille La). He allows his parents to stay in his big apartment in New York City. But somehow, he thinks his life is somewhat empty. A typical day in the city, he sees his old college skin, Charlie Fireman (Adam Sandler). Alan did not see Charlie in any year. Alan once again tries to befriending Charlie. Charlie is a man who is a loner, hiding his true feelings from people who are attentive to him. With Charlie's suspicious loss of his family in a plane crash, they were one of the flights on September 11, 2001. Alan is almost comfortable with Charlie. When Alan tells about his past, Charlie tells the Allan or about his deceased family member. Now Alan attempts to help Charlie and makes his life easier for him. <br /> <br /> Mike Bender (Blankman, Indian Summer, The Upside of Cooper) is an excellent touching human drama written, written and directed, sad, truthful and comedy as well. Sandler gave a spectacular dramatic performance, Sandler offers more in his dramatic role than he did in Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love. Cheadle is as wonderful as ever. Alan's assistant wife Pinkett Smith is good, Liv Tyler is also a young psychiatrist and Kunqua Burrows is good, and Alan is a lonely single lonely single woman with a wild crush. Despite the fact that it has great reviews, the film is disappointing by the box office box. The cast is the first rate here, the writing & the director is excellent and the wonderful Tide of the T. Alsobrook's Widescreen Cinematography. <br /> <br /> There are great New York locations in New York City on DVD where the film will portray a beautiful city in New York. <br /> <br /> Transferring a sharp anamorphic widescreen (2.35: 1) on the DVD and a good Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. DVD is also a jam session with Sandler & Saddle, a feature, photo montage and previews. I hope more about the DVD features such as the audio commentary track, the director and the deleted scenes. "Rain Over Me" is definitely one of the best films to come this year. I'm sure, the film looked great on the big screen. It is sadly, I do not have a chance to see in a theater. But it is a kind of movie that is well-played on DVD. The film has a good soundtrack and it has well-known faces in characters and bit-parts. Also the director is a bit part of Byrne Sugarman, who is an actor. "Rain Over Me" is one of the shortest films this year. It's also the best sandler film of my taste from "The Wedding Singer". Do not miss it. HD Widescreen. (***** 1/2 from *****).
