This film is amazing. This is in detail in the 1980s fighting the struggle between Russia and a hard-line detective with the special ignorance of corrupt communist rule in Russia. I am giving high scores to this film because it has no restrictive-looking image for the development and development of the forensic investigation ("Thanks" to the world). This is a graphic image. Violence provides a diagnostic image and it is tragic residue. There is a "candy-coating" that is high in blood or gore to separate us from the brutal reality on the screen. This film is based on Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. I am very familiar with the fact that the true movie has a very deep appreciation for the truth. It's not comedy, but for those who appreciate the dry and dark humor, see this movie.
