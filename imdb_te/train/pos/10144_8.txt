<br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable, and yes, it is a clich√© romantic comedy "<br /> <br />" At the very top of the comic effect. Bulldory scene is gold in gold, where the actress deserves an honorable mention! If you want a film with twists and turns that you guess, then you want a thriller. It's a romantic comedy ... It touched my heart and realized that I was lucky to recognize my true love in my life and every effort along the way was valuable. <br /> <br /> The movie is a great movie for a hilarious cry ...
