8 Simple Rules is a funny show but it's a mature lesson with some life lessons about moving after losing one which is the episode of the dead episode which is the episode of the APC. Hennes Dynasty (Katie Sagal), daughters Bridget (Kale Cuco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson), and Son Rory (Martin Spazzars) - see each other for guidance and support after Paul's death), family patriarchalism. Kate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleaseset) are brought to one hand. I am happy for the second season at this show, in which he will be David Spade with the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But all and this presentation is pretty good. This program reminds me of many classic family sitcoms from the 80s and 90s used in ABC.
