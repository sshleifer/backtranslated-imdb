People's comments have forgiven me a lot (sorry) point. Cassdon's life wants to give a simple, normal life. A traditionally constructed story, in which the characters change their lives, then fade out, music, and the film wrap up, will be merged into this large canvas. Many of the characters in this film have such light and then they will continue. Sometimes they can hold onto their thoughts, sometimes they are not, and the way the life really is. In other words, the cassadon conventional dramatic shape in favor of the pursuit of life? Only happiness is not the only end; And yet everything is still in the process, still for ever grab ?? And, if you absolutely insisted on a theme, the exploration of the fantastic character in our lives. What is a miracle? Well, life itself, for a start. Then add random events and a life, or many interconnected lives, and in cross connections that you have wonders through bucketful. Many people recalled at the center of the film, while Mass and his wife sat on the bed and dreamed of everyone's own dreams, but later in the film, they showed how the dreams actually were in shape. It's not an easy or clear message. You have to start playing before, and then sit in your mind for a few days, a month, a few years and see what we did there. It is, without a doubt, Cassadne's best film, his most mature, his most humane. The main meditation in life is from one of our most gifted writers and directors. This tragedy is that he has not been allowed to work for many years now, mostly due to studio limits around the "dream catcher". Hopefully we have not heard the last from Larry Kasdan. Great image of a great artist. Keep in mind that art is not necessarily completely irrelevant to succeed.
