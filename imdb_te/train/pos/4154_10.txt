This is one of the best episodes. Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in his' petrol car '68. The trainer who dies in state penalty reveals that he has stolen heroin from the car after the shooting. <br /> <br /> His case was opened with the speculation that he was murdered by police. <br /> He reveals a war veteran who is a police officer and a man who is prohibited by prohibited love. This kind of love was ashamed and at least thought to be hidden at that time. <br /> Although I am not a kind of personally supportive person he is still a policeman and a human being and it is not killed. The sound track is wonderful (I keep watching DVR), and the use of black and white is especially attractive to color a color to emphasize an object or give a specific feel to the scene. I'll look at this repeat!
