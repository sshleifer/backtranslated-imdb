I was biased and I was the author of the self-published novel The Hungry Beychelles Club in 1994. The role of the character in the film is the inspiration for Marlon's character, written by Fred Derek, a nomadic and hungry bachelor. I can not be more proud with the trailer, I hope the film is going to look perfect and I will comment further. But my role as Jaraja Fox, starring Delmar Youngblood, is stellar. Most of her emotional vehicles are in fine form. I could not do well! This looks like real people, hardly driving my statement against formula-driven and thankful racial bias home, gracefully and heartfelt.
