I can not tell you that this film deserves anywhere near Tigekkei, which has been wiped out by some critics. Yes, it's an overdose of time running, Hampstead Editing, and Cheeseball Special Effects. And the comic energy does not have the power to get your average audience member to sit by without checking his or her watch. <br /> On the other hand, it also has some laughing-loud funny lines, talented and rigid cast and classic underdog campus. Mackie, Stiller and Azeri are as good as the "core" band, and do a tremendous job of combating the distinction and diversity of the Garofalo and Studdy team. I've added the whole image of ruben or mitchell to the whole film, but everything will shine. <br /> As I mentioned above, your classic "Underdog-Makes-Good" stuff. There are no surprises, because you know that they will succeed. It is valuable that the absurd, slave leaders and villains are not, but the dialogue and interaction between the characters. Under it all, kids at the heart of these people, who just want to do the right. The best scenes in the film will give the film its emotional detention. Look at the relationship with Azeria with his long-suffering mother; Macy's lovely innocence in his unwillingness to accept the cop. Amazing secret identity; Stiller's Rage (an unnatural, rather spazzy kid knows you'd go into eunuch tensions, rather than quivering on the playground); Garfola wanted her father to take revenge. The real appeal of this childlike belief, superhero comics is that the sense of justice and goodness always makes the world a better place; <br /> <br /> This hackney comic book tropos is why so many. It shows "Mystery Men". subplots (romance, family life, conflicts in the team, etc.), but the main plot is such a loopy fun that makes it up. The fact that this is good is the fact that some of the critics are losing, and I will issue an exclusion: if you're the type of a viewer who finds the pleasure of an Itchi and Scratchy cartoon, it's unmistakable and reasonable ("I believe this way. * Snart * ... _magic_ xylophone? "), then you are very literary-thinker and ridiculous for this movie Rs. Go to a sandalwood movie instead. <br /> <br />
