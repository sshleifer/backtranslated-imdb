This evening I saw in the recent attached presentation of one of our local independent channels this evening, now displaying two episodes each week. <br /> <br /> My father is one of these seniors (in my homeland, Cincinnati) where young Rod Serling worked in the media there - and I tell him how talented and creative he remembered there. Remember the dad. Overall, the "Twilight Zone" is one of the true classics on television and produced its product during the Cold War, not just a perspective in the era of the country, but also a nostalgic image of the day. <br /> * Minor "spoiler." <br /> <br /> Other shows in the story, elsewhere, is a storyline intended to give the "surprise" end. At times the characters are on the ground, at first the story refers to at least one, but this is "Earthling." <br /> <br /> In the cold battle, the last time a Super Powers have a message (here) is a situation where the dummies are triggered by buttons. <br /> <br /> The stories seen today have a nostalgic look at this worldview 4-5 decades ago, and still provide some food-for-thought. <br /> <br /> Although the dialogue does not extend to Leeds's significant talent, it still provides a simple, important message and a worth 20 minutes of entertainment and interest.
