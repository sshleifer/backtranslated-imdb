I saw part two days ago and today I saw two parts. Of course two parts are away from the worlds I am shaken a little by all I've seen. I thought with the inevitable knowledge of death. To me, it's the whole picture is blue. I suppose Soderbergh is feeling that we feel sure that his death is slowly evolving inevitable. Part Two has never been before, but it's positive in Cuba, compared to that statement and it's negative in Bolivia. In Bolivia, the politics of the movement are only indicated, but are rarely dirty. I had memorable scenes at the end of the film: a short talk with the jailer and the Bolivian officer's talk about the official questions and the failure of farmers to support his revolution. I controversially played a national role between Argentina and Bolivian. I felt that Soderbergh has done tremendously with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle. You will get food without breaking the farmers who do not have enough food. I tried hard when I tried to find out how hard it was. I'm guessing everything in the timing; There is enough anger against the government to start the movement; Not in Bolivia. In his letter to Fedel, the radical scarecrow film read at the beginning of the film: If not now, now 50 years. Most thought provoking and full picture; Every effort to see it.
