I will return to the "70s performance" television. It's a great show anytime !!! They have to make episodes between other episodes, but it's confusing. But I'll come back and do more episodes. Please come back ... the show is totally happy. You could not laugh without seeing the episode. Very funny episode and performance in each episode is very good when Hyde and Jockey go each other. Those are the best parts. "That '70s performance is the best" .... it will be and will always be the best performance ever. It's really sad when the show ends. They need to make new episodes.
