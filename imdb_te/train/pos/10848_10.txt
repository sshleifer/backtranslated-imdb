... Heads, Hands, and Feet - A band from the past, just like the Strange Fruit. There is a triple whammy. Those who say that the film is not disliked is heart or 40 years old, and the real thing is no experience. They are sad. This is an incredible one hour or two, which is not even noticeable in the second performance. Stephen Ray, Timothy Spall is a fat drummer (a very happy person in many ways), and a new name for Bill Nyighy - the dance singer and frontman all super shows, and Juliet Aubrey is fascinating <br /> <br /> The Syed Barrett / Brian Wilson echoes are loud and clear, from the motot the hoop up to Karren their tense hassles It's frightening, and the script never has more than a minute. Do not compare this with spinal pump or ruddles or full monty - they are unfair. The closest comparison is The Committants, and it's not bad. <br /> <br /> I do not remember any movie about the memories of Blowwine Pig but live on the name - someone in the team learned what they were doing. <br /> Oh yeah ... and I 'm the other - got tight little fingers; a-a- and about SteelEYE Span ... Spooky TOOTH ... TEN IN IN NAILS Anyone? (You should watch the movie or on the road)
