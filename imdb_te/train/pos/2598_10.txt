The film is not even valuable, it is the best way to get an overview of the novel before reading it. In the summer of 1968 I saw the movie in NYC; That fall in graduate school, I read the book for the first time. Some scrupulously detailed image of the joy of reading the novel is in my memory. And better or worse - and I've read and taught the novel for three decades now - Milo Oceania is still Leopold Bloom.
