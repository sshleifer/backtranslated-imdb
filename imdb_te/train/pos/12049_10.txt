I gave this picture 10/10 because it's hard to appreciate me for some years of reluctance and haunting me for years. The sheer on the woman in the face of black is constantly fearful of pure horror and co-music with fear. <br /> <br /> When I was 10 years old I first saw on TV and it really hurt me for years. I have said many other users as well. Most movie reviews continue to show how the film is becoming disturbing or terrifying, but you believe everyone who posted on this board is really a powerful thing. I really like the horror imagery and are generally more fun than it is, but it's really terrible and maybe disturbing most people. I have not seen since 10 years and I've found it to see it again, but I'm afraid I might have some sleepy nights. I can not get my finger on what is right, but I feel that I am scared, the great weapon of women, and we feel the audience as we are so intimidating. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <
