Viggo Mortensen has acted as a new prisoner in a haunted prison, in which Warden (well-known Lane Smith) is a gruesome secret because many prisoners and prisoners slaughtered a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick was secretly known and feared for his life. When I feel jail movies, I always think of high-caliber plays like action movies Stallone or Van Damme or Shawshank Redemption or Green Mile. But I did not expect a ghost story like the Exorcist III style. Prison is a weather effort and it is definitely the best film of Renny Harlin's career. The film is creepy and a cast (at that time) has good acting from unknown. <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** *************************************** (Good)
