The American vehicles of director Paul Vroomhoe's are of varying quality, but many of his films are controversial. This is the story of a sweet (and bisexual) writer. It was a beautiful and richer woman. But the woman does not know that she is interested only in meeting the lady's beautiful girlfriend. At this time, the author suffers from strange perspectives - they appear to be the hallucinations that were caused by alcohol abuse, but soon he finds that he faces some sort of references. The lovely Hitchcakian thriller, original and provocative. I love movies that they think about something about you, but then you learn something completely different. One of these movies; A thriller during the first half, and a semi-religious surrealist saga during the second half. Very romantic, original and blasphemy is not for children or people who go to church every Sunday. Great cinematography by future director John de Bont. Most resume!
