Wow, IMDb and Google, I'm trying to remember this f'ing awesome movie name for 15 years. Slaughter High, man! <br /> <br /> I do not bore you with the plot summary, and the actors, and with the yadda yadda, you know what all you know. You are here somewhere. <br /> <br /> In 1987, when I was 7 years old, my father was renting it all. These horror films. Does he see his children with him? Not. At a young age, I saw Slater Hai. I saw in that movie a big time with me. I have not seen since, but today I remember the most ridiculous murders in the film. For example, the post-sex scenario (why a metal bed in a school?) Gets power. Or, the guy was drowned in a cesspool. Come on! My personal favorite, though ... the stomach that explodes from the tumor beer. Amazing! How can one of the characters honestly hate the movie about a beer found in an abandoned school after 10 or 15 years and think it's a good idea to drink? Then his stomach burst? What? And that's the great way: let's take my car ... it starts. Classic trash all the way. <br /> I mean, after almost 20 years, I'm looking back and smile at it. But when I was 7 years old, I shared it! Tless. <br /> <br /> All in all, yes, a worst movie. But this film comes from 10 to 9 for nostalgia purposes and humorous factor. We're getting a real delay and the same Late Late Late Movie Show every night or hunt a VHS copy and hope to hunt dust from your VCR.
