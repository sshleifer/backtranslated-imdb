Rob Roy and the epic of the hobby and action! Within some mild spaners. Liam Neeson played the finest Rob Roy MacGregor in his career. Jessica Lange is alphabet-perfect as his wife Marie. I have the most passion and chemistry I have seen in a screen pair. Best snotty Aristocratic Performance. Tim Roth portrays one of the greatest screen villains. His Mary's rape is repugnant and harrowing. He really is a wonderful bastard in this movie. One of the last dual best swordfights between Rob and Cunningham. Directed by Michael Cotton-Jones is blameless. 10 to 10.
