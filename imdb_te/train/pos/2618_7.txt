<br /> <br /> When I see the Lion King 1 1/2 I can not have mixed feelings about the whole movie. This is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing about it that gives you the same feeling as the Lion King did. There is a story about how those who do not read other reviews, meet Timon and Pumba, and the events in the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> The picture of the most funny jokes in this movie. My favorite episode is when they celebrate raising Simba. However, when they interfere directly with Timon and Pumbaa's actual events, they should be the worst parts for me. I can not see the "Life Circle" or "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" sequences again (I'm ok with "I Just Can not Wait to King at Sequence"). <br /> <br /> The voice talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella perform an excellent job, a man who is Matthew Broderick, Rafique and Hyena. The actor who made a younger simba was also like Jonathan Taylor Thomas for me. But why are they also a voice actor for jazz? He literally has only 2 lines and does not need much. <br /> <br /> Julie Caver and Jerry Stiller's additions add only talent, although you still can not hear Timon's Mom's voice and not about Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are original, eventually coming to mind when they rock the pride. <br /> How is the time for them to fight with the Hyderabadi? <br /> <br /> For DVDs, you will not be able to help you with special features for 2D set. They could easily fit the commentary, or another aspect ratio on the 1st disc. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " .
