I am really shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie. The film is not intended as a "deep thought" film, but the critics think that's what it thinks. In fact, no movie does not change the life of insight, and if it does not produce deep, twisted, sandy plots, they rate 1 or 2. <br /> <br /> The film is an action / comedy film, and it is intended. And for an action / comedy, it's very well done. <br /> <br /> Although I have never been a Jamie Fox fan, I have the most used plot in it. He gets out of the ordinary criminal jail and is thrown into the bad-guy group when he tries to cleanse his action (see Blue Struck, Hudson Hawk, 48 Hours etc.), but this is a bit of a technical twist. <br /> <br /> "Bad guys" is actually a "good guy" and a real-life "bad guy" a uber-geek. <br /> <br /> Jamie Fox actually did not try to overdo the brilliant and intense main character at the same time, and over the movie's comedy. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a deep underlying plot like "Matrix" or "Drama" mice and men, then this movie is not for you But if you enjoy the raw action, amazing fast-paced filming, and rarely throw a humorous twist You're not disappointed with this movie.I usually rate about an 8 (the same level as the hard trilogy), but instead what is it <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
