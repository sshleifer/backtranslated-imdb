How is the film controversial and gentle? It has a perfect structure. No one wants their daughters to be players. Apparently most cultures can not have a small breast either of their daughters, either. Apart from never seeing a group of amazing actors we have ever seen, all the different cultures prefer to become their professional soccer players, as long as their females prefer. The structure around the parallel to the two cultures is amazing. There is no crisis. Both cultures are modern and valid. (And yes, two silly, too). One mistake: There are hundreds of relatives in the Hindu wedding ceremony but not a child in them.
