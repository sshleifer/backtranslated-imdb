It is not 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Talmma and Louise', but it is the best road film. It sets its two main characters gently and easily. Audience is a tribute to the director and intellectual tensions quickly learn. The young French (and English) speaker wants to do better in France, where he is a French friend and drinks the men and parties as young. And his Moroccan Arabic (and French) refers to his father by following his Muslim faith, denouncing the wisdom and the knowledge of elders and the new culture around him (such as mobile phones). The film can explore very powerful politics - the odd twin drive to get to the eastern Yucca, the thru Turkey thru and the eastern Middle East Mecca. These are places where Muslim population is involved in wars, oppression and ethnic cleansing; Where dictators continued to carry out torture and epidemic executions in order to have power, and religious groups were constantly in a deadly fight with each other. And only those films and possibilities represent the agenda of the film. The relationship between these two films is crucial to the film, and faith and politics are in the background. It seems to us that we are human, and to tell each other to understand and care for one another in order to perform well in this world. It's certainly not 'natural birth killers' and it is all the best.
