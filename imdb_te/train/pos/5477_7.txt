The unorthodox print of this magnificent film was found in the Library of Congress in 2004 and has been featured in a number of special theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews I found online, the nastiest dialogue and innuendos are intact; After crossing New York State Sensors, they were either stoned or fired back before the first release. I also read that a DVD is "expected to be in 2006" and one can only hope! If we were really lucky, it would have comparisons between 2 versions. The censored version of the original release is actually available in LaserDisk, notice what I've seen. Stanwick rules!
