Although I do not like Stanley & Iris as a film, I admire acting. Zen Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in the film. I'm not always Fonda's work fan but here she is gentle and strong at the same time. De Niro is capable of each role playing a gold role in acting. He gave a great performance in the film and has a great scene to take his father home for the elderly, because he can not take care to break your heart. I do not recommend this film as a great movie entertainment, but I do not say you've ever seen a lot of bets to run.
