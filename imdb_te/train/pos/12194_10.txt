Surelial Film Noir was released after the "true," genre-defining classic "The Maltese Falcon," "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice". Wells films should not be evaluated against others. He played through different rules. In fact, he was playing. It begins when a different Femal is releasing the films, so the Vallacian sequences (typical fast-style style), dialogue (much of the "hard-boiled" philosophy) and abstract logical (but interesting) (perhaps Havitworth is deliberately a dimensional) with outstanding performance. "Wells" means "formula", but he was willing to use "mysteries" for his backgrounds as "entertaining".
