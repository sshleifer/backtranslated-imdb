Let's see Surez Bajataya is good for him. It is good to have a movie that does not have a glimpse of your family. While this story is simple and does not contain any new items, you are just like the movie, because the show, the performances, and the reality of all the treatments. Hats off to Suraj .. This film engagement leads to love. The description of the changes as you think, it's wonderful to behave after you act. The director definitely gave it a lot of thought and made the actors perfect. Even though the film is slow, you do not care because it's hard for a story with the story you continue to enjoy newly enjoyed. A typical royal sheriff has many sentimental scenes, which is likely to stimulate the audience with tears (especially the ladies). But when you come out of the cinema hall you are very satisfied and ticket worth :-).
