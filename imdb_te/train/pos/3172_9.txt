Debut? Wow - Cross Eyed is one of the most enjoyable indie films I've watched in the past year, making the eye of the easy eye of the Eyes of the Cross Eyed. I mean - I log into IMDb to find more images by this author ... because Cross Eyed has a special signature - you want to see what this writer says. Nowadays, it is rare to watch a well-written, well-directed, well-edited and well-balanced movie. For me - cross-eyed encapsulates what film should be about - combining the best of all image elements to create a brilliant, artistic and sharp story. And yet, please.
