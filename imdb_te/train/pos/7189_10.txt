My favorite character in the movies, but in almost all of them, Zorro's character has a small bit of mask and the villain who says that under the garment is that they say daft. <br /> <br /> But Reed Hadley's "Zorro` Fighting Legion '(Serial 1939) mushuk fills his whole face with a genuine secret that fills it with a real secret. <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> It is one of the best roles in the films that Anthony Hopkins will be happy with "The Mask of Zorro" (1998). <br /> <br /> My interest in movies is very extensive, but for serial `s of l 30s / 40s There is a real fondness. <br /> <br /> Bond2a
