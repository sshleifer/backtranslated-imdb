The shore is back to the cabin, which is one of the few sequels to live up to the original. Black Humor, Good Suspense, Nice Long Girls, and of course, Psycho Killer. What are we looking for? I Think Nothing. We leave the gore and naked in the younger, because it is made for television. Besides being one of the best sequels, it is a great excitement to be a family. Recommended for everyone.
