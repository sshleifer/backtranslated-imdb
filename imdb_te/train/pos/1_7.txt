If you like adult comedy cartoons like South Park, Bromwell Hail is similar to the little adventures of three teenage girls. Kishu, Natella and Latina exploded sweet and behaved like bitches, I think Kyisha is a good leader. There are small stories with school teachers. Idiot Principle, Mr. Bip, Nadi Mathers' Teacher and many others. These actors are also great, Lenny Henry's Gina Asire, East Enders Chrisy Watts, Tracy-Anbman, Smack the Pony's Doon Mackiechan, Dead Reigners Mark Perry and Blair's Nina Conti. I do not know that this came from Canada, but it's very good. Very nice!
