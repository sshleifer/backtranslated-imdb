<br /> <br /> In December 2000, I received the pleasure of the first time I saw the first time in TV in TV. <br /> <br /> Infection expert (William Hurt) loses his family, Now a few years later he is in Russia or some people. I'm not sure where exactly it is, I know where it's going on in the area. However, due to the budget cutbacks in an epidemic laboratory, they have to eliminate most of their workers. One of them is Joseph Muller, a disgruntled security guard (played by Peter Veller, who plays Robocop, who does not destroy), and demands him to return his job. He needs this job because he is divorced and he needs to pay child support. So he goes there, fails in the fight, and some things have hit dangerous things. It will soon be revealed that Muller has been infected with a deadly pathogenic illness. In fact it is a serious one, killing one person in a drop of seconds of his blood. The term immediately comes out and the disease specialist (Hurt) is called to investigate and later he has joined with an American reporter. <br /> <br /> Muller is determined to go home to see his wife and son, and he can not do anything without damaging the entire Russian population. <br /> <br /> This film is falling down. We are a disturbed person (here is Weller, Michael Douglas at Falling Down), and they do nothing to achieve the goal there to kill some people in the program. <br /> <br /> We have a hero-type person (who hurt Robert Duvall here in Falling Down), both of whom are determined to stop sympathizing and adversary. <br /> <br /> The contaminated person is actually a good cinematic line with good story and some very good performances. <br /> <br />
