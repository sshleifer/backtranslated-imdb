The first movie is a nice one, but it's not as good as the fantastic animated classic that I found more sharp and lovely. This sequel is low, but not bad. The slapstick is very high, the script has its weakest spots and the plot tad is uninspiring. But dogs are very beautiful here, and Erik Idle is delighted as Mac. The film is good for watching stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes (especially Kruevalas), and music is fun. Acting is very good, Ian Graffried is attractive and Gerard D'Pardy is delighted to be a partner of Cruella with good performances. But the best film, it's a deliciously over-the-top performance like Krullella, with Glenn Close Glenn Close, more evil than she was in the past. Overall, nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox
