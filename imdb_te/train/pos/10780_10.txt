Most by my second favorite cartoon Spielberg, after the animations. If the ratings were low, I still enjoyed it and liked it, laughed, cast, watched Jess Harnell and Tess McNeill and there were wonderful, the whole cast was awesome, especially the epic <br /> <br /> < br> I like to see this cartoon again, it's pretty awesome and jokes are very good. Even I can remember the hilarious moment there Brain Kamos, you hear his voice and it is simply amazing, I love those cartoons when I come back to this cartoon and Animaniacs, the PATB theme has played the instrument, I love them
