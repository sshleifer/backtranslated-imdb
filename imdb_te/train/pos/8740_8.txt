There are great details in A Bug's Life. Everything is filled. The picture looks great and the animation sometimes jaws. The film is not a very horrible trend, it is basically taken on a modern sample sample of Kurosawa. I enjoyed the interaction with the character and the bad guys in this movie actually seemed bad. It seems that Disney usually makes their bad guys cut the carbon copy. Grasshoppers Dusty and Hopper, the main evil guy, is a grotesque creation. Check it out.
