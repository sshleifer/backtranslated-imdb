This movie is terrible. The final film of Vipul Shah is good. It's very good, but it's a good story. Athis Kapadia is a good but slow good 2 and a half hours. There are a lot of flaws in this movie but it still lights up a lot of entertaining songs and are not working well but they are still not an image of good overall Enthusiastically it's still nice to take into account the story and you are kind of relative The film does not really need a bit of errors and loads of errors and humor
