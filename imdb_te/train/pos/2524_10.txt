I do not expect Got and Hyde's performances as well as they do, or I wish you to act in such an artful well-developed movie with enough plots to keep you interested and adequate to make them original. The film tells me the unexpected masterpiece for me and I'll be on the spot for the next film. I especially like a vampire movie, but it is not a cheetah bloodthirsty movie, nor does it decorate the fact. Characters have all human features. It's a way to show the growth of characters, and you really have to forgive all their lives. So far I will give this film two thumbs. Definitely the best film I have seen in the past five years.
