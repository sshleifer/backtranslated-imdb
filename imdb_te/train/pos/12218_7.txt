Japan is in serious trouble. Deutos has contaminated Edon, seizing earthly forms and tying them to their irrational portrait. On top of that, the reincarnation of Ashura, the queen of demons, is near. The only thing that has been threatened with this grave is that Demon Wardens, who is just as bad as demons, has a fearsome man of warriors themselves. <br /> <br /> The Izumo is a retired Demon Warden, who took the theater to murder the Demon instead of killing an innocent child (in a battle that remembers the fantastically reminiscent of the Dunn Til Don Bar scene) accidentally up to five years ago. One night, he suspects a beautiful and mysterious woman named Subaki. Their luck (literally) and <br /> <br /> They are bound to the fate of lovers and enemies If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese fantasy / swordplay epic, you'd be wrong. In fact, there is nothing special about Ashura. This is a Hodge-Podze of most genres. Just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama, and romance. Director Yoziro Takita (Anamozi) is very politically deceiving the genre (comedy is seen in some scenes) and the final result is funnier, but fun popcorn movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely, errors in the picture. Some of the humor seems contrived, and from the point. And acting is not great. But seriously, do you see fantasy / swaddle play / comedy films for great performances? No, all of these are action and silly CG visuals, as we have the ass in Ashura. Not to be misleading, the film is not all the action, but it's generously enough with cutbacks and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy. <br /> The bottom line; The images are the faults of it and it is not a martial arts epic, but try it and it does have interesting visuals and good swordplay action. The reason is that the movie worked for me and it is very serious and the viewer has never had to be delighted by this fun and crazy swordplay fantasy action movie if their looks are perfect. <br /> <br /> My rating was 7 of 10. Fun popcorn image.
