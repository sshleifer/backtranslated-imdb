I really wanted to like this film and I do not think I was disappointed. Being an American history teacher, I was almost obliged to see the film, as long as history was not bad. Here and there are some mistakes (especially with the timeline - this film only appeared for a few months or the end of the year - six years is not in actual combat), but the overall picture and battle sequences are awesome. Unfortunately, the film ALSA is a pretty meaningless subplot involving difficulty in believing romance between a poor patriot and a great loyalist. For the most part, it really drew attention from the whole plot and just seemed to be "acting" - real honesty-to-goodness was a plot device instead of romance. <br /> <br /> Despite this romance, the romance is so much more interesting and inspiring, as in the mute clich√© of the "romance in romance" - plus, in many ways it is very later, the movie, PATRIOT, Griffith picture seems to be copied from !!! Both films pursued both an appalling leader fighting against the British and using the terrible and nasty tactics against civilians and the intention of using the "Springboard" to launch their own country in America! The only unique difference between the film's setting in Uttar Pradesh is that PATRIOT is in Carolinas. This might have been perfect if D. W. Griffith discovered their loan for Mel Gibson and the rest of the stories. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Griffith is an ill and big thing that many films have made in his movies. Especially at a national level. I rely on this topic and he is very guilty for this "preeminent company" (I do not have to be crazy - this is not a sarcastic) that he plays a black role with slavery.
