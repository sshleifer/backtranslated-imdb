If Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith had two lovely actors in 1968, even more appearing in a more fascinating film, I do not know who I was. I first saw this delightful little satire gem 25 years ago at the age of 25, and I failed to fail to see again for any year. It's intelligent, aggressive, neat, majestic, sweet, gently rebellious, and completely enchanting. Maggie Smith's desperate attempt to bring the right card in the deck is the romance of these two social misfits, both loud and funny, with a full-fledged laughing and accurate picture of the loneliness that stirs the heart. And the last freeze-frame on Ustinov's passion, anxiety, and loving face, "Are you right?" - Have you ever created the devotion and nudity of devotion and nudity ever and ever? Anyone who does not love this movie should know very well.
