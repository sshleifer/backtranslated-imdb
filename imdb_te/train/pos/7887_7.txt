Your hard core Freddie Fan then you may not like it. This is a satire of the nightmare series. There is not much to see here. <br /> <br /> Freddie is the story behind it. It's always good at nightmare movies. But death scenes are far worse. Visual effects are very good and acting is fine but the story is fantastic. <br /> <br /> I have read bad reviews for this but I have experienced this fact despite many of the errors. <br /> <br /> A nightmare on Elm Street. <br /> <br /> 2. Freddies Dead: The Final Nightmare. <br /> <br /> 3. A Night Street Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. <br /> <br /> 4. A Night Street on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. <br /> <br /> 5. A Night Street on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. <br /> <br /> 6. A Night Street on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. <br /> <br /> <p> This freddy is completely described but is all there. After Wes Cravens New Nightmare in my list <br /> <br /> (7/10)
