When I sit down to see 'Largo Winch', I wonder what the action sequences and lovely cars are. When I was standing, I saw these two; <br /> <br /> Carl Roden is not in conflict with a movie. Kristin Scott Thomas played his role, but in my opinion, the two true actors, Tomer Sisley and Mickey Manojvic, both performed well. <br /> <br /> Mixed linguistics have brought good color to the film, but I understand why people are frustrated. <br /> <br /> When the scene of Hong Kong and especially the amazing Croatian seaside amazed me both, and when I entered the beautiful island that I did not believe in Largo I hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen. <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500, and BMW 7; If someone loves expensive car - type cars; This is their image. This is a movie with action sequence, good acting, landscapes of extreme beauty, and more, with dazzling combat and a fully-fledged interior drama, a fast and well-written action movie. My vote is shining on a gloomy day: 10/10
