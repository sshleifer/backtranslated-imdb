Guys and Dolls is a unique play based on characters. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Nathan needs his money. Havana, Cuba and the "Doll" of his choice can not just take any girl off the scene. <br /> <br /> Brown (Jean Simmons), who took charge of Sarah Missionary. <br /> <br /> Sarah enough to go to Havana with him. They fall in love with each other, but later she has no role. Nathan led a worst game on the night of their death. Nathan's 14-year-old fianc√© Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) denies Nathan's gambling and tries to stop it from doing so. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When this movie ends double <br /> <br /> The wedding is happy. <br /> <br /> The songs in the film are good for this song. <br /> <br /> Brando is not voiced, they have been able to dub him, but this really does not matter. He has done an amazing acting job (which looks like Brando) and has driven his character well. <br /> <br /> I saw some films with Jean Simmons and I thought this film was weak, and she did not sing. Nonetheless, the singing was designed by Frank Sinatra, Vivian Blaine, and Stubby Kaye. <br /> Guys and Dolls Broadway production. Vivian Blaine has a wonderful voice and Adelaide is perfect. If you are musical, and you do not, I advise you to see this.
