I liked Antz, but I liked "A Bug's Life". This put paid animation. I'm definitely getting this on DVD. By the way, the widescreen version of the film should be made on the Disney tape. (I heard all of the letters on the screen are squishing in standard video format). Most ends will agree that credits are ridiculous! I saw only one of two sets, but I could not see another!
