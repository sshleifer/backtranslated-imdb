I really enjoyed this movie. Humor is sometimes not a bit of fun, but I enjoyed how the story dramatic and intense throughout the story. It was only a second film to see Verdon's performance (another 'An Saco Belo'), and I would see why Italy was tired of him, but he'd played his father's role. <br /> I know my drawback in Italy has taken place in Italy, I guess somewhere in the center or in the south, but I felt like having a representation of the location. The film can happen in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehley ... I think it's always important because the films have been linked to something. (Maybe I miss something?) :) If you like Italian movies, then I think you will enjoy this. This is not Fellini or Rosellini - not realism or new reality. It's a funny story of serious moments that any of us really happen.
