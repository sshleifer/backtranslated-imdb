"Atlantis" is a new and proper step for a Disney feature. A good choice to make this film through a mysterious legend like "Atlantis". I did not get any expectations for this film, but why did this film get very bad reviews, I'm not sure about watching it. <br /> <br /> The reviewers are not positive in my country too. <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect film, but one of Disney's greatest films yet, and I suspect the movie will always be the "Disney classic" fame. Well, another case. <br /> <br /> The sci-fi movie "Beauty and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (as well as Kirk Wise and Gary Truesdale are trying to get out of their monster movies, but not enough nonsense. "Atlantis" is a watchable, exit and This film is also a PG-rated action-feature, which is also my opinion (anti-semantic parents <br /> <br /> The story is imaginative, but it does not destroy the film.Comic book-inspired animation is the right and set-out of Disney's style, which is colorful, dark and The depth canvas sequences are pretty impressive.The film is also sometimes funny, laughing through the movie than I laugh more voice (SPOILERS) The roles of the film are also very popular, but unfortunately there is not enough screen time to get to know each other, so some characters remain (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> James Newton Howard is absolutely great. It's brave and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive about the film is how the Atlantian language produces a very nature, race and authentic sound. It's really awesome (the speakers are over) <br /> The script is strong and well-written but there are still some questions that are not answered in the story. But fortunately there are not many. <br /> You're a fan of self, listen to the reviewers and do not see "Atlantis", wait for you ...
