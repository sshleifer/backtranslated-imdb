I do not know where and where the Iranian directors come up with any theme. In fact, a very simplistic plot to come up with many directors --- but a film can not be projected as Zafar Panahi did. <br /> <br /> The film is a world of twitching <br /> <br /> There is a link between the football match and the battle between the sexes that you are coming behind the stadium walls. <br /> You seem to be in the picture, you have to look at the characters, and when watching the movie, you also want to make a glimpse of the football match. In the film you will experience the same enthusiasm and feelings as the actor. <br /> <br /> When you want to see what you want to see, you want to know the judgment, you will die to see what happens to the girls. <br /> <br /> I love the occasional conversations between smoking smoking girl and one of military training. It is like the Venus VS marks, which is really different from the very patriarchal society like Iran and the idea of ​​equality between men and women and women's struggle to equal rights and opportunities. <br /> This is the second <br /> <br /> I have met with Iranian movies, which must be viewed!
