I've tried to rent this on most occasions, but as a general rule, there is always a girlfriend who has heist flicks with the comment and who has refused the ensemble comedy, "Um ... nice, but for the movie that I'm not in the mood." In this way, "Almighty Solo Movie Night ". <br /> <br /> Anyway, Welcome to Collinswood. When the last time is not forgotten, it's fun moments and just a few moments to laugh. I do not know the fact that it is remake, and watch as simple rules watch movies on their own profit margins and in any way. George Clooney keeps it as a wheelchair safe cracker in a funny and brief assurance, for the most part I leave wondering for two things ... 1. How is every comedy good for Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minutes? And 2. How do they make counterfeit tattoos that are old and weird, and how easily do they wash? The cast has entered into their own right of good actors and great jobs, and they have the impression of having a good time in the film. The film does not need to be plotted in both the plot-wise and humor-knowledge, but I'd like to look at the exclusive features and see it so that it can succeed! Rent this one for a good time, maybe grab some friends and a pizza. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It's good to hear the less-appreciated Polo Kanten used, humming the snippets to me after the credits are wounded did.
