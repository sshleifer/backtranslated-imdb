If you want to limit Chaplin's attention to a beloved trick and smile from your stomach inquiries, see something else. <br /> <br /> If you love slapstick comedy with one of the best things you should see. <br /> <br /> This film is really a tramp that can not afford a girl. <br /> <br /> Chaplin's "Park Comedians," shot in Mac Sennett's Park, picks up with pockets and cops and couples, puts another explosion. <br /> If I see these pictures, I thought it would be considered a spoiler, checking these boxes. Everyone ends up in the pond except chaplin. He is Munta Durfee, a.k.a Mrs. Rosco gets the girl who plays the role of "fat" arbolle.
