This is one of the greatest love stories ever seen. Yes, I agree that some part of the content will be updated, but it is not far from the movie. Try to observe, criticize and celebrate any form of art from a seasonal perspective. Apparently "City in Sex" standards, Charlie Chaplin is terribly boring. However, when he was judged from America in 1925, he was excellent. As well as the progression of the Zionara mixed-race affair, the American "manifest fate" of pride and prejudice and the complexity of different cultures. This is the next step in the realm of films like the Gentleman Agreement. <br /> <br /> However, its purpose is not just social commentary, but entertaining and enjoyable, it does not forget with countless lines. <br /> <br /> However, the love is striking, it is amazing. Although some attack Brandy's accent, he is near his nanny and nature. Batans and Umeki (both winning the Oscar Award) and the other cast included to the top level. <br /> <br /> When you feel like a real job you can feel love for TÃ¡ka, Real Star, Brando, when the responsibility and credibility are crushed by her feelings. When she first met and talked with Brando, her speech was rare in a classic and cinematic. The talk between Taka and Brando is equally good in her dressing room in Tokyo. However, the mouth-sucking, exhalation and worrying of love in today's movies is not good, but it's good. It describes true love and passion, and not just "hot". If the film touches you, you are very young, very cynical or dead.
