Take a pinch of goodfellas, add to the godfather, add some Roman myths and less combo comedy, and you have sopranes about a mob that works from North Monday to New Jersey. It is entertaining as pro wrestling. I'm not the biggest fan of this show, but I admire James Gondolphini's very complex Tony Soprano, with the psychological illness of conscience's occasionally glimmer. I was also bewildered but murdered Uncle Jr., silver-haired Tony Sirico constantly came to admire tee works of folks like perplexed Paulie and graffiti-voiced Dom Chianese as the most beautiful Edie Falco like fake, tough-like-nails Carmela soprano. Violence is sudden and graphic, the whole body gradually climbs every season, but it often has a lot of little moments that matter here. Pine Barrens lost and sits in a damaged truk, and both of them persuaded both Pauline and Tony's nephew Christopher (see Michael Imperiali Law and Order's End).
