How is the viewer rating for this movie just 5.4? When you decide on your rating you have to start automatically at the lovely young Alison Porter 6. James Belushi This is very good, his first good intense role, I could not have liked anything about it but last night. He is also pretty good in gang with Tupac. Kelly Lynch, you should see her. Well, I'll do it. <br /> I'm thinking of what happened to Miss Porter. <br /> <br /> I have given you the Curly Sue 7
