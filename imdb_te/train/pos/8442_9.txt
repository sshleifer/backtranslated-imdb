The picture is amazing, Esposito saved some scenes. I enjoyed how to bring every detective in the series, some of the storylines that were not resolved in the series (thanks to NBC ...). It is great to see Pembelfnton and Belies together with their highest human and most basic people. Braugher and Secor did a great job, but it would get neglected as usual. It hurt to see the end of Homeside. Memories, tapes, and appearing on CourtTV every Friday and coming again is not the same. But the film did its work and performed a great depiction of alternation and life, and provided a family relationship between the unit. I enjoyed this very much.
