It's pretty much and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Excellent music score. I was twice in Japan last year and the film gave me this unique Japanese concept. The camera's movement is amazing, as well as the actors. It is dramatic and deep in your feelings. The Japanese people are very sensitive and kind, and it is very well brought to the fore. The director is playing a wonderful color for the light and shows the audience audiences, which is also possible to enjoy a movie with thumbnails and good detail. After watching this film you want to see more from the same director. It's a real feel good movie and I can only recommend it to everyone.
