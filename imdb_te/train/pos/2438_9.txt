It's a gem. Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and the excellent performances that led to all supporting cast. The film is not only related to Ireland and Irish history, it also increases the concept of many categories in the world and many categories of categories in those categories. The picture shows that with the intensity and sincerity, religious beliefs and traditions lead to a split on how love and passionate family is. "Love Split" title is not any good to capture it. It reminds me of the Russian history even though it is happening in the 50th of Ireland that erodes the life of the true story and the whole village and "murders". Intolerance and misconception are still very powerful in the world and unfortunately it is hidden inside the human nature. As Liam Cunningham's character states that "the likeness is always below the surface". Interestingly, people in this story are doing moral alternatives. Also the role of the Catholic priest and the meaning of what happened to him at the end of the story. The story makes it stronger, though the love of the two people makes everything conquer everything and makes us better. The role of Liam Cunningham is the subject of the narrative that he always wants to be. Again acting is a top notch. The story is fast. Irish villages are as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended.
