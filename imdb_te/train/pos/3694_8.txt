<br /> <br /> If you do not know what you think about the amazing collection of stars and directors from this film, it is not disappointing. <br /> <br /> The story of the paramedic and stabbed victim is also a terrible French voice (which makes me feel good about myself). Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi Award for moving and pure comedy. <br /> <br /> However, the Bob Haskins segment is completely different and the Vampire story is completely disclosed. The dialogue in Wes Craven's department was very forceful and the story of Chinatown was not fully understood. <br /> <br /> The film is worth looking for good bits. It's not too bad to sit through bad sections - they're the last 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ca vaut la peine !!!
