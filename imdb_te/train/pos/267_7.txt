This starts with the line of hijacking on London's Hickory Road with a series of robbery items that are unreachable in Hostel. The house that raised her concern for her sister, Miss Leman, asks Hercule Porot to examine this matter. <br /> <br /> "Hickory Declar Dock" is a great, brain exercise that is not as complicated as "One, Two, Buckley My Shoe". Murder, theft and diamond smuggling crimes, and the final twists all together in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, especially the psychologist Colin McNab and the secret American Girl Sally Finch, Inspector Japp's funniest moments (possibly closer to "toilet comedy" in this series) and the story of Miss Lemon.
