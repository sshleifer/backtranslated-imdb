The third review of this film is mine, which is the 'Ponton-Lust for Glory' by Frank McCarthy's producer Frank McCarthy's producer Frank MacCardy from the World War II, attracting hundreds of commentaries per day. <br /> <br /> As a reviewer earlier, a film has received more attention than other films. 'Pattan' focuses more on the difference between the two films, shortly after the end of the Second World War, and the MacArthur period, rather than the war, played a role in the Korean War, as well as the occupation of Japan's American governor Also applies. /> <br /> The main difference is, however, so that the two heroes will play. George C. Gregory Peck overcame the film more than Scott. Scott also played General Bradley while Carl Malden was playing opposite him, while none of the other actors in 'MacArthur' were at home, at least for their film. Scott, in fact, portrayed Patton as an aggressive and fiery man, and sometimes involved in the war, not the enemy of the human race. I suspect that General MacArthur was a volcanic figure in real life, but not how he appeared in the film. Peck's MacArthur is comparable to some of the Liberal intellectuals who have played some of his other films, a more reflective and brilliant bend. At times he appears to the political left. In his speech during Japan surrendered in 1945, many of his speeches were written by the CND's paid-in member and his policies in the process of reforming the Japanese society during the American occupation had partial-communal gas. In an effort to reward MacArthur's inspiring leadership, Peck makes him the best speaker, but his lectures are more indebted to the techniques studied by the rhetoric preached than any fire in the heart. <br /> <br /> Despite criticizing Scott's 'pimples and all' Patton images, these critiques 'MacArthur' tries to elaborate on some of its less attractive features. I think this criticism is obvious, especially in the Korean War. MacArthur does not know how to fight the war, but it does not seem to know his harassment when it succeeds and succeeds with the idea that MacArthur refuses to intervene as an outstanding general. Many historians believe that Truman was forced to remove MacArthur because the latter behavior became a threat to world peace, and Stalin did not choose to accept a stance, even if he did not allow his Chinese friends to insult. In Korean scenes, Peck's MacArthur appears to be more ideal than realism; We will look a little bit about his abuse and innocence about political affairs. (He knows Truman's comment that Puges knows Eugene, but it applies to MacArthur's approach to the international diplomat). Perhaps the film's attempt to paint some of MacArthur's warts reflects the period it created. Following the twin injuries of the late seventies, Vietnam and Watergate, it was difficult for the United States and congratulated the people to congratulate a soldier's heroic image from previous people. Another criticism of the film is that it comes between two stools. If McArthur's full biography, he must have to show his early life, which is not included in all. (For the first time we see the US resistance to the Japanese invasion of the Philippines). The influence of the general MacArthur's father is the fact that he is a military leader. I like to see what kind of man Arthur MacArthur is, and why his son thought of him as a leader and role model. Another interesting way of filming the fight against Korea and MacArthur's Truman was similar to the two people who were equally important and actors. I found it to be less interested in one of these alternative ways. <br /> <br /> I'm totally wrong to make the film unpleasant impression. Although I gave an explanation of Peck's main character, he rejected it with his usual occupation and intensity. The whole movie is a solid, burdened, bible, clever and good example for information. It's a good movie, but it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> In a pandemic note, Map DMZ, which showed MacArthur in the Korean War, shows a border between two Koreas that do not exist until after the war. (The border before the war is 38th parallel). Moreover, I think he was referring to the 'toxin' of MacArthur war. The war may be poisonous, but it is difficult to listen to a toxin for a toxin.
