"Cinderella" is a film about a young girl, her mother has died and her father is married. After her father's death, Cinderella's step mother came to know her well and worked around the house, after she was cleaned up after two evil clergy. One day the king sent a message to one woman to attend the royal ball to honor her son, to find a wife. In fact, Cinderella could not go, but she did. Cinderella was very worried and thought that there was no way she could not attend the Royal Ball until she found the fairy godmother. So she did some magic and made Cinderella a beautiful lady, but when magic changes back because she will be back at midnight. While in the Royal Ball, Cinderella tracks time and clock crosses midnight, so she runs from the palace and loses her glass slipper. Then the Duke of King ordered the women wearing the slipper. The Duke searched every house and finally found the women of the baby. <br /> <br /> Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luskie have directed one of the animated Disney films in 1950. A magical fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Cinema is a servant for her own family and she has no love for her, but has changed her whole life with magic and eventually found love. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" music about my favorite subject. While she was doing magic for Cinderella's fairy godmother, she sang a bibbed Bobby Boo. When I was a child, it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house, so I never forget. Cinderella and Prince realize that they are in love while they sing so love when they dance while they dance. Since every little girl wants to live a fairy tale, this movie is my favorite movie when I was a child.
