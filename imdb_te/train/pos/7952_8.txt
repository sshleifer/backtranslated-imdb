This is one of my favorite family films. I liked it when I was young and now I am at an early age. I still laugh at the same old jokes and shed a tear a times. I never paid attention to animals or at least UN-animated ones, but I'm standing. It's a very old movie, but it always has a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> If you do not have any other live animal motion pictures, it's like this. I might be giving this film a lot of praise but I do not think it's a show. I have a really great message "Where is the heart." Or at least the message I received from it. Definitely recommended for a good old family movie night.
