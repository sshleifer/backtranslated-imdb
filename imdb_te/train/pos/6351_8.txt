I thought it would be a happy lucky film when Grinch arrived. Although it has a little nightmare before Christmas touch. You know the kind of dark and horror. I loved this movie because it was filled with the spirit of Christmas. So Greynch saved the Christmas. And what's well done in ViviLe is that Grinch's little heart has grown three days. Merry Grinchmas!
