The film's trailer did not do justice. The film does not really know what it wants to get across, the first half of the film, the romance comedy and the second more serious, erotic play, the overall effect is much better than I thought. The movie is a big part of the date, but the trailer has turned this into a suspense thriller that never really did. Kidman, one of my favorites, is of course partisan, but if this film is somewhat quirky movie, sensitive, light proves. Three of the four stars. 9/5/02.
