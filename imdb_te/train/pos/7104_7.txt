Los Debutants is the story of two orphan brothers who moved to Santiago in the south after their mother's death. <br /> <br /> By the time Silvio had grown up in his brother's care, the two brothers were both alive. The owner's sexy and manifested wife, Gracia, is associated with. <br /> <br /> As the movie progresses, the characters are redefined when they start to look at the subtle and open ways of correcting the subsequent tasks. <br /> <br /> The film is made with good cinematography and fast paced motion. It is also pretty sexy with nudity and some very intuitive romantic scenes. It uses a well-known technique in different scenes from layers of different perspectives from chronological order. Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and many other good films use this tool. <br /> <br /> As we lay out the various layers, our understanding of the characters and their motivations emerged. Even if the plot is a little cliche, it's also intelligent and fun. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking at the movie I enjoy enjoying, but not worth it. I did not see many pictures from Chile and it was always keen to see the film Noir from other countries. Moreover, if it's available, rent it, but do not sleep anything.
