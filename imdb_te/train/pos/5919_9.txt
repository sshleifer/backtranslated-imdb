The street fight is a wonderful piece of ruthless satire. It's not looking for fun. It's not a comfortable experience, although it has some laughing-loud moments. A movie that you see when you need food for thought. <br /> <br /> The removal of this species is only a racist losing point. It is not a sarcastic of Song of the South, it is also a melting comment on the biases of Americans and society. Every race group shot in the film is shown as the fanciful caricatures of their stereotypes, which are the fanciful caricatures of real people. Through this rare exaggeration, the filmmaker shows how viciously these hard-line beliefs are. <br /> If you are willing to accept the misconceptions of the American culture, and if you are not afraid to see your own bias in the eye, this picture might be for you.
