Imagine what the kids like in this world: There is a large gang of children who have good taste in music and unite from badhead masters and teachers. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is in the world. It's like a Ramones record life coming. The characters are all silly, innocent and beautiful like the Ramones songs, and the music itself is, of course, spectacular. High school comedy films have really changed over the years, and you end up with the 70s classic at the end of the film, like "American Pie", which makes no endless sexual jokes. As the remake is evident in the writing, it can lead to the original appeal and can be assumed to be replaced by obscene, half-funny dick jokes, as Bill Hicks has used to call them. However, the main problem is that the Ramones can not be replaced. They were the perfect band for the film and no one was able to earn their place. So, the best thing to do is to leave the original isolation, which is aggressive and lovely. Gabba-Gabba Hey!
