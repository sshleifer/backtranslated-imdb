Chevs to Bravo, once their powerful film industry woke up from Communist sleepiness. <br /> <br /> Loner is a trilogy that has been added to all genres that you see in a modern "Hollywood" architectural miniature for the past few years. <br /> <br /> The story has many sub-stories that are often penetrating, interconnected, summarizing desires, collage, fates, and desires ... It's a daily life and leisure activity, It follows from thirty people in the middle of youth. And it's ridiculous. I had a point in the film that I did not stop for 40-50 seconds in the whole theater (about 100 people in a small art gallery). <br /> <br /> When the whole main cast is awesome (especially in the role of the coming Mexican star LaBana Mitchesska to face the hardships of all the emigrants) <br /> <br /> Jackie MÃ¼ckeck is a famous character of Jackab and the singles who wrote for continuous written Bohemian Must have. Miss this one! It has a lot to offer.
