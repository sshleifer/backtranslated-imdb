A child with theories that try to change things around him. A man who is forced to become a man because of the system. The truth is a hidden system, and the system that violates the rights of existence. The boy who inspires Martin Luther King is standing and tells the truth. A divided family is struggling with it. You can not hide the image. You see things, and you hear things, and you feel things, you do not ever happen until the day you die until you die. I'm sorry, a boy who disagrees with the balls, does not happen to him, a kid with a power, and a little boy like a pro-like pro, that eventually kills the movie, And 60's who look at how misuse is.
