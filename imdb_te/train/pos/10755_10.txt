Great documentary about the lives of NY firefighters all the time in the worst terrorist attack .. This alone is the reason why a collectors should look at the item .. I am not surprised not only by attacks but also "high fat diet" and some of these firefighters are physically visible. I think the doctors will agree with me with a lot of people, who are physically shaped by the firefighters at the 79th floor with 60 former governors. I now have more respect for firefighters and I realize that I am becoming a fireman job to change a life. French has a history of making a great documentary and this is a great documentary .....
