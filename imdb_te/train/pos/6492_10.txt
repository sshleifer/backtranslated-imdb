I'm not a very good writer, so I keep this young. The best WWII documentary I have seen at World War II. This documentary I've seen with different WWII documentaries (apart from English / North American) is the most complete WWII document I've ever seen. I feel that I have a great deal of great depression and why I came to power in Hitler, but it would be a good job to cover up the war. It's full of everyone and the goal / justice feels. It does not exaggerate or exaggerate the characters of different countries. It contains the original footage, including color footage and many eye witnesses (when it's alive in the 70s). It's great music and commentator. All in all I have given this one 10/10, because it's good. (I did not see them in the DVD version so I could not comment on them)
