Cuban Blood is one of those sleeper films that are very emotional to tell about life in most traditional ways. I saw really while sailing around Cuba in the Western Caribbean cruise. It was about the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the Revolution. When the Socialist regime came, not long after the revolution, the boy's father's property was taken. Everyone knows the age of the boy's age and the relationships that arise in a small town. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can afford. A class is a good acting and directed film. It tells the story of special effects or grand plans or realistic twists. It's an image about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their successes. Many times a year is a good picture.
