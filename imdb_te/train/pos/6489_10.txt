When I came in the first 70s, I saw this series. I was 14 years old and my father did not want to see it in my best friend's house. Every Sunday a week has become a custom, <br /> <br /> The events of World War 2 make for a sweeping sweeping document. The producers considered themselves to be the most important vital events, dedicated to each eighth part of the long term, such as 'wolf pack' covering nearly six years in the Atlantic War. <br /> <br /> There is an episode of Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> This documentary is not so easy today. Most of those interviewed have died. The list of prominent players that appear is an amazing insight into the idea at the time. Anthony Edin Foreign Secretary, Carl Dunnitz, h U-Boats, Albert Speer, Petraard Architect and later the arms minister Hitler. One of the subsequent episodes we saw in Trudgge, Hitler's secretary, he was with him in the bunker and he ordered him to leave the bunker after the suicide and testimony of Hitler's suicide, through the Russian routes. This and many others played a major role in the reality of the events filmed. The series did not include the Park-Code breakers of the series, but only after the participation of the series I created the revelations of the participants. So I can not blame programmers. <br /> <br /> The opening titles and music are excellent, and Lawrence Oliver's narrative script gives natural gravity to the script. <br /> <br /> The best documentary series ever made? Without doubt
