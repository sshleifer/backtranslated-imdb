To a surprise at a local video store, I found enough media satire to challenge Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers". And almost disturbing. When I see a reporter machine, I see my opinion at the end of 2004 is a great deal of magic in America's television viewing population. The question is, "Are we really fraudulent?" <br /> It's certainly sloppy to my attention. There is also a big theological question that triggered the story of Christ. Can oral communication and high dependence on the pillaging of television can produce a Messiah? Did Christ's story be exaggerated? Can be completely fictitious? It is something that keeps in the cinematic light of the movie.
