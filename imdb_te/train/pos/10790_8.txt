The spectacular formulas from the "Walker, Texas Ranger" band have the most unbelievable scenes seen in a TV movie. In addition, one can expect the outcome from a good go-go. However, this is a fun little picture, which will get the job: it stimulates. It's just what it's meant to be and it does. Stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot is not half bad. Acting is also good, it's not a surprise, everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you're a fan of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you certainly love it. Otherwise, do not waste your time. 8/10
