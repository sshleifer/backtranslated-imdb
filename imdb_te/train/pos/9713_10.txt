The series was screened at the cable TV station "Comedy Central" in the United States. It was cut with death and shown from the order. It is sad for the audience, it is not fascinated, it is not misleading. Fortunately, at the same time my cable company went digital and I got the BBC. In good and uncensored order, I thank you for watching "Genetics of Gentlemen". <br /> <br /> "The League of Gentlemen" is perfect for England's "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and Canada's "The Kids in the Hall". <br /> <br /> "Genetics of Gentlemen" is a step beyond. It's not only about dragging and lampooning cultural ills, it goes deeper and too, too, too. I can now say to most of you - it will ruin some of the people's groups that will annoy others. But its only comedy .. Dark, Dark Comedy. If it's not your thing, do not see it. If you find the dark comedy, see this - if you are angry and frustrated, then you will not be too difficult. <br /> These guys got the right, and the right button. They are amazing, they are amazing and I enjoyed the creation of each character. From the episode to the end there is a complete story. You can not see this one episode at a time, Willy Nelly, which is one of the charms of this series. See the order. Look at creativity and stylish and deeply distorted guys. No one and nothing have boundaries. It's my dear, "dark humor". Bravo!
