He is tho, obsessed, math problems or movie reviews or something is working, something he's convinced is important. <br /> <br /> Gene decides to order a federation shuttle and decides to make weapons technology 20 years before Borg. <br /> <br /> When she goes back in time and meets with Voyager, the junior will continue to meet at her early teens.
