Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) was simply pushed by his wife, because he was one of the most annoying and neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way, but he does not seem to get it to work, so he headed to his friends' home. Oscar Madison (Walther Mathau) recently divorced and lived in the Brahmacharas heaven. Smoking, gambling, hitting chicks, eating and cleaning has always been a paradise for him. The Oscar started his suicide attempts to go first to Felix, first in heaven, Felix cooks and cleans, and Oscar helps pay his residence, but soon the Oscars for women and Felix today's world may be gay). They invite British birds and find that Felix will call them and Felix and chatting about his family life, Oscar has refused. This, he explodes and throws, but Felix does not seem helpless and can soon have his upper hand. My favorite quote is "158 times you can not stand little notes on my pillow, leaving little notes on my pillow." We're all out cornflakes. F.U. "F.U. took me three hours to find Felix Anger!" Based on Neil Simon's play (written by screenplay), it has enjoyed a certain theater. Set and repartee and appear to feel like playing too (for good or for worse). Lemmon and Madhav have a comedian chemistry and Grappier has starred in Old Men Movies and Out to See, returning the funny / slab characters, but with different names (I'm sure to avoid royalty issues). <br /> <p> This image is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. Chocolate is soft, sweet and rich, strawberry tart, juicy and bright red (unless you get those nasty green ones). They are almost polar opposites, but together, highlights each other of contrasts and make a wonderful dessert. <br/> <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
