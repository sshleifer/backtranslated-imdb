Hales (2003, Dur Andrew Davies) <br /> When Stanley Elnates IV was found guilty of stealing, he was sent to 'Camp Green Lake'. At this camp, Warden, and her two followers, Sir and Dr. Pendenski ordered the barracks to hole after the hole after the hole. But what is the reason? <br /> I really do not intend to see 'The Holes', because I am a fan of Shia LaBeouf because I have to admit, I really only saw this film. Even if you are not his fan, it does not matter. 'Holes' is one of Disney movies that can enjoy the whole family. The story is written lovely and will have an excellent idea including including the past. They are not disorganized and really provide a great story. All cast great. Young stars act well and the combination of Jon Voitt and Sigourney Weaver is a pleasure. Shia LaBeouf can also work without any errors in the age of 17. It's a Disney movie, you'll surely enjoy a family. <br /> <br /> "I learned from failure." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
