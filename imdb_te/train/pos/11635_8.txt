Lisa Raisert (Rachel McAdams), who ran a nightly flight from Los Angeles to Miami, meets a businessman and meets a lovely guy who turns out to be a hired killer asking her father to die. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Red Eye is an excellent thriller that puts the audience on the edge of their seats. The premise is like cellular and phone booth, but Red Eye is better than those movies. The average thing about red eye, including the sumpens, acting and directing is average. Most image takes place on an airplane but it does not slow down the picture. This image is fast or slow with boring spots. Wes Craven makes a good job behind the camera. Instead of focusing on thrills, he focuses on the story and the characters. The film has a stake of suspense moments, but it's not really about the movie. I also focus on the small details of Wes Craven's other passengers and later. Red Eye really shows his skills to the hero. <br /> <br /> Red Eye plays well with his young, talented cast. Rachel McAdams gives a very attractive performance and her character is harder to hate. You might end up cheering for her loudly. Sillian Murphy gave a very creepy and efficient performance as a villain. He works beautiful at first but then the psychological turn is particularly impressive way. <br /> <br /> The film is also very stylish and it has all the creepy vibe. This setting works well because there is apparent fear of being alone and avoiding. Overall, the film's tone is consistently creepy. The screenplay is not as strong as everything else. There are some unrealistic moves to turn the viewer's attention. Many of them did not bother me but there were few people who shook my head. Also, the ending is disappointing. This is not just too simple, but a different approach is not good. Because the film is focused on the characters, there are no screams with some voices. If you expect a horror film then you will end up disappointment. Finally, Red Eye is an attractive thriller and it is one of the best movies of the summer. Rating 8/10
