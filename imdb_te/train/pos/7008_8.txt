Wow! No - a picture !!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm not a fan of contemporary Italian directors. Usually I do not like plays. I'm not a Will Smith super fan, he thinks he's a very good actor ...... But this movie! Such a great movie and good acting is such a good script and good direction ... Wow ... it's amazing. The film captured my attention for a minute and I did not like "the mask of happiness" (perhaps even though I did not like the performance of Will's son who was very bad actor when appearing for all the naturally-born actors, and last night " I've confirmed my feedback). I want to write spoilers and I do not talk about the story but what I want to say is that these films love movies, death and other feelings in movies. If you have a minimum of hearts, do not worry about it
