This is a good historical play. John Tortuur is a brilliant intellectual, like Lucifer, and painted the manic effects of the character, such as his strange dance. Emily Watson is fine in her supporting role as sensitive lover Natalia. <br /> <br /> The relativity between chess and the nearest madness is clear in the film that Nabokov ideas known as Goris and known "permanent innocence" (ie 'lolita') are known. I'll go now to read the novel. It's a touching and tragic end and it's hard to keep a dry eye. Amazing picture!
