I do not know why critics have tracked this movie. <br /> <br /> This may be a bit scarce - I'm not usually going to horror movies! I was also emotionally to see the daytime. I'm not bothered! ;) (The film is full of kids, hey!) ... Liam is always great. I loved Catherine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell). <br /> <br /> The house is beautiful in gothic and horror style. Special and sound effects are awesome. I liked the music score, especially for her elegant tunes and children for Eleanor, her journey to the end of her life, and how she grew up in her cold and lifestyle, eventually giving her strength, peace and freedom.
