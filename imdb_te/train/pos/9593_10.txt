First of all I am a Butch, straight white males. But with that handicap I love this film. It's about real people. The real time and place. And of course the 80's New York City. I grew up in homosexuals in the Eighties in New York and one thing about them is the way I want to live their lives. Whatever the consequences. It's adventurous. You have to worship. This is a great movie, it can be seen and what it takes to be a flamboyant African American or Hispanic gay man in the Eighties New York. It is in real life. The bottom line is in real life.
