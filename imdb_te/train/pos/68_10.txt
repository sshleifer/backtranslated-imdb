Stupid, boring, critter overrated film series like "Star Wars" is why all the hype comes, and a really amazing movie like this goes totally noticeable .. It's beyond me ... this film really opens your eyes. Unlike the boring "Elephant", the film is not just a special day until some "trigger pulls" are not just a special day <br /> <br / > What happened earlier? The film focuses more on what's going on. </ p> <p> Diana, who played very hot and very talented Erica Christensen, was a great life ... until ... She was shot on the head by the day of the shooting, luck .. Luckily she was not killed, but severely injured and should be in the hospital for a while, Causing her <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Alicia, who played the most beautiful and talented Busy Phillips, is an evil, cold-hearted, rebellious, The girlfriend does not have a positive character on her ... and she is safe when shooting is done .. Because it turns out, FRIENDS with her shooter and knows what she's going to do ... causes her to bring her to the police station and cause some questions. She refused to tell Cops if she knew she would be shooting But she still does not, so the school's lead will attend a funeral of her dead students, and after she goes on ... Prime decides enough enough, and she is forced to Visit Diana at the hospital .. In fact she refuses this, but a If Lisa does not do this, the Prime Minister says that Cops is going to continue to say something to her. <br /> <br /> Alone, she is happy to see Anaasia more than happy, both physically and emotionally wounded, but Diana tries to give her a friendly welcome, but in reality, Alicia is not just harsh and disturbing commentary responds. Here she is being forced, and she does not intend to be friendly with her. But sooner or later, that motive will change ... (and I say it's all :) It's really one of the most moving movies, and one too dark and disturbing .. Actually, I'm <br /> <br /> "It has so many graphic scenes and imagery! Amazing and uncrilable under the film picture! I am so shy that I 'm the only one who knows about it I am!
