<br /> <br /> The TV cartoon series, which featured characters from "The Jungle Book", opened with 90s of intelligent Disney fans, "Tales Spin". Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker fun from the cape Suzette, to the mountains, to the mountains, in the volcanoes, looking for treasure, looking for treasure, they're never seen before, and have fun in an action-packed cartoon adventure <br / > <br /> This is my favorite and my family's favorite. The Dish Affranook was broadcast in the early half of the 90s until real cartoons were moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, and I was on vacation once in 1996 before getting cable in March 1997. <br /> And good news: Today DVDs are here !!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
