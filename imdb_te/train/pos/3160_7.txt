The show has all the common characters in comedy: good guy, idiot, distracting, rich girl ... but it's set in the 70s. This is the only difference between the other TV comics. I do not know how you like this show. Its humor is painful! I mean, jokes are very direct ... It's a simple dialogue: "Faz: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you (audience laugh) Jackie: Fess You're an Objective (Audience Laughs) Oh Yes I'm. (Audiences Cheers and Praises ) "It's not funny. If you do not laugh at me (sorry in English, you're sorry), you did not laugh. It's not a brilliant comedy, it's insulting people. I love American comedies, but this is not good. I give 10 to 4. (Sorry sorry for my poor English.)
