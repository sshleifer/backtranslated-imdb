"Mother" recently two young adults aged 60 at the age of 60, lead to her husband's death and she wakes herself to a sleeping life that has a relationship with a young carpenter. Her daughter's married boyfriend. This film quietly passes on her sharp relationship with her grown son and daughter, on the passive Mom, quiet requiring efforts to relieve her young lover bed, and convolutions arise there. Some antiseptic drama, "The Mother", who suffers from mental illness, is doing a wonderful job of dealing with unsatisfactory problems. With a more mature audience, perhaps the best role for women, they are well understood with the main character, her needs and problems. (B +)
