Once you can spend the title of the movie, "The Bigger" is a great movie, perhaps John Waters's best. A magnificent cast featuring an excellent cast by Edward Frolung and Cristina Rickleys made this story so fun and very real. There are some shocking scenes that fit perfectly for young children, but they are for a purpose. Unfortunately, this film is not a mass production, and many people will be denied access. If the opportunity knocks, then go see this picture.
