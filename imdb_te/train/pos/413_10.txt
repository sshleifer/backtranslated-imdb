Surely this film is not historically accurate, it's great entertainment. Most Demilale films are moving slowly and plodding but then the action clip at the next episodes. The story is basically a range of peaks with very quiet moves. This action will take us from an Indian attack on a cabin. One of the best parts of the film with Jean Arthur has tried to appease the war-painted locals. She and Cooper were then taken to a war camp and tortured. Then comes a long battle with Chenen. The whole thing is ridiculous but fun and entertaining from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this age and she is shining here.
