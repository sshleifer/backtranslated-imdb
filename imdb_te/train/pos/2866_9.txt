I grew up in this classical Western lineup, and gave me a treat to watch the kid until the end of the evening on the end of the day. <br /> <br /> In this series describes the adventures of the Cartwright Family living in Ranch, near Virginia City, Nevada, from the Civil War Age. Their ranch (known as pinderosa), obedient father Ben, and his unmarried three sons Adam, Hoose, and Little Joe defended. These three brothers have different moms, all of which have passed years ago. <br /> <br /> Cartwriters are one of the most respected, wealthy and respected families in those areas. Ponderosa is so large that it is very important to reach its endpoints. Also, cattle need frequent tours to buy or sell and go out. No need to say, some of these picnics are not passing effortlessly. Despite being a guest, most of the cartridges must be protected from mutual cattle farming, or protect themselves from the towns of their wealth and stellar reputation. Cartrets make a fair bit of firearms in the air, but only shoot to kill them when needed. They also participate in various urban affairs, the political life of Nevada territory. <br /> <br /> One of the principal assets of the series is the three brothers, who are always three (despite occasional disagreements) between Ben and him (and often disagree). Now, a brother may hit another, but it usually has a good reason at the time and his anger will never last long! All of the characters are well drawn. Ben painted great integrity as a successful and great man. The older son Adam left the midway through the series, with the most rational and happy of the brothers. The middle brother, Haus, is a teddy bear's gentle giant, an insatiable appetite for food and a little shy around the ladies. Small, little Joe, a hot head, beautiful charmer, by contrast, is a lot of women. These three brothers experience different types of love stories, but their love interests usually end up in the episode, or else the marriage feels impossible. All stars in their roles, stars Pernel Roberts (Adam), Don Blacker (Haas), Michael Landon (Little Joe), and of course Larney Green, Principal Family Patriarch, Ben. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Today there are more shows like TV in this vintage west!
