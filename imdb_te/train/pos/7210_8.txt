New York playwright Michael Kane (as Sydney Br√ºhl) was aged 46 years old and deteriorated; The film opens, and Mr Cain's latest play flapped at Broadway. TV critics are kenning at Kane and he is drunk. Long Island Railroad lands in Cayon instead of his home in East Hampton, traveling to Montagu. Finally home, Cain is knocked out by a thinly-elongated heart-patient Diane Cannon (Myra). There, one of Kain and Ms. Cannon Ken's former pupils, a new drama called "Deathtrap", a hunky young Christopher Reve (written by Clifford "Cliff" Anderson). The couple believe that Mr Reeve's "Deathtrap" is a hit needed to restore Cain's career. <br /> <br /> "The trap is set? Wickedly funny Who's all-do-it." <br /> <br /> Eva Levin's long-term Broadway hit directed by Sidney Lewett is not far from its theater. The cast is enjoyable and the story's turns are still immersed. One thing that did not work (for me) ended the curtain call; Of course, it played well on stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie to watch again; However, without greetings, Greetings Reeve simplified "Hello" laughing at Cain at the Eastern Hampton Railway Station - although the performances were dead. This region is not actually East Hampton, but windmills and ponds. And, the very ballyhooed love scene is terrifying tepid. But, the play is very good, "could even ruin a wonderful director." <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sydney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Diane Cannon, Irene Worth
