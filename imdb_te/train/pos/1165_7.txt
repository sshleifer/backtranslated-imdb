As one other IMDB reviewer commented, the film starts a bit slow, but significantly improves when it goes along. Yes, it was released by Roger Corman, and yes, it loses some of the same theater grounds as the high-budget ancestors like Fatal Attraction and Pajon IVY. Nevertheless, her husband's loneliness and her closest intention to keep her husband's career as a blues singer growing up against the Freudian and putting her emotional and physical "vacuum" or "hole" away with her low impacts and the intelligent use of the settings. The film is a clean and sinking iconic symbol that uses a lot of space and the characters in almost every scene, although the movie is clearly suffering from the microbial budget, reminds me in many more ways, and a more recent scenario, the French film "SWIMMING POOL" It feels like me "in the morning Amara against the UP "may be borrowed from the simple to some useful ideas. With a small set of tools, Amanda Amanda sees an occasional mess with temperamental and falciplical perspective to surrender to temptations, but it is similar to other images in this genre. In the past (again, too Freudian) the twist of Amanda's stepfather's misuse is quite unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic response to Amanda's plight and this topic of the story. <br /> This cast is very good. <br /> <br />
