Why do the producers do not show all junk prospects in TV, why do not producers give six degrees chance? Will this series go on video? I would love to see how it ends. Place one in the video in the season and sell it. I'm a loyal fan of Six Degrees, waiting to come back. The set of all the tape shows my recorder. Thank you for this. I canceled the show and found out that I'm broken heart. I learned I'm going to cancel, why did not they tell us? I thought I would develop some of the characters in the presentation. The writing is pretty good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite time. I'm so sorry to go and see!
