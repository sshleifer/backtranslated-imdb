<br /> <br /> This is the deepest fan of horror movies ever since it really made me jump (or nodding). Out ... far better than the ring. I do not think it's a thing that many people say after we talk to the film, it's awful, and I think it's what I think ... then I know what I like. <br /> Now, if you need everything in a neat and tidy line, you may be disappointed in the story <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "There are very few bloody messes in the film ... the studio writers and the rest of the Vethavites will realize that you do not want to splash reds on all the things you need to fear.
