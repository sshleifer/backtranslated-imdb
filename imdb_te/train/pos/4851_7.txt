Ghost Train is a good and entertaining film, which is typical of good British comedy chillers in the 1930s and 40s. The antics of comedian Arthur Aski are not clear at all, but it can be overcome by seeing him as time or curiosity. <br /> <br /> For low budget wars, ghost train climate is effective, and it offers some real suspense. It's great for a dark (and yes, yes, vicious) night. Extraordinary, remove the capable hat and enjoy it.
