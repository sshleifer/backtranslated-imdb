It is a good footage in B / W 35mm film. You know that the movie will start at 7:35 am in a bar and in 8 minutes. <br /> Surprisingly, very few things, and step-by-step will make you realize that something is not right. It's very expressive, and your sensitive details reach the top level, and the film is not just for the critics of the film but to make it a better understanding for anyone. <br /> <br /> But how does it look like: European, small and white and low budget. Do not intimidate yourself. <br /> <br /> The movie is only 8 minutes (right), and I do not want to do it. Damage it. <br /> I do not understand why no one has spent a few minutes trying to find a comment on it and post a comment about it. 10/10.
