This movie is great if you have a mindless acting, motion acting, and much less plot! The film will have a special effect from the director of "Event Horizon". The clothes are like a mad maximum movie .The soldiers do not have any words, so others will tell you what to do. Eventually the explosions end up in a big shoot'm up image where all over the place. I personally liked Russell in "Tango and Cash" in "Escape from La / New York" and "Executive Decision". This movie should leave your mind at the door for no brain action sci-fi movie!
