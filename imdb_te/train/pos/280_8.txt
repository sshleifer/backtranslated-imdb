Killing is a good game, which brings some new elements in the tired style of the first person shootout MUs. This tells the story of Patrick Galloway's mysterious and talented warrior, who calls for a friend to his estate in Ireland to investigate some unnatural sickness. Do not expect to find weapons like set chains or rocket launchers in Ireland after World War One.All weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game and its functioning system. So you can shoot and rotate the letters, you are very fun and are also unique to this game! The graphics are great and they can run well on a medium power P.C.Level design and cool and atmosphere. Most are revolving around the game agreement estate and the building but there are many other locations that you can find when you are growing. Thanks to Clive Barker's talent, the game is an incredible storyline and storyline (very rare for the first person shooter) and I'm not good at acting in front of a great and very horror atmosphere but it's not spectacular. But there are two major errors in the game. First of all, it's quite simple, for example, when your mission tells you that all the doors in the room will be locked from the room that leads to your room's room, it limits your time freely. Secondly, all weapons antiques do not appeal to most fps players who use high tech weapons. The game related to the most difficult is very well balanced. Most of it has medium hardships, but sometimes it is very difficult, but discouraging. The whole endless is a great game. There is definitely the best FPS one.
