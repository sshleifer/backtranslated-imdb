I thought of Marie-Kate's and Ashley's characters as a beautiful movie centered around Sam and Emma Stanton's lives! But they are trying to make themselves and their parents happy, but unfortunately, this is not easy simply for them is not easy! I think this is a completely lovely and sweet picture and if you're a true fan of these wonderful young women then I'm sure you will agree with me here! If you do not see this movie yet, I'm really going to miss you. Big time, and you're definitely taking time to see it now! This movie is a true winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
