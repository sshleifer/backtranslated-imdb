When I was a child I saw this series and loved it and did not forget it. I finally bought a DVD collection and I recalled about it. This is how objective and realistic a daco is. Movie footage is unbelievable and interviews are fantastic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am sitting in Hollywood, <Br /> <br /> Note. I recommend some when Brothers Band, Private Ryan Save, Letters from Iwo Jima, My Fathers Flags and Trumpets fade
