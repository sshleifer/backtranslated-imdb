From "Insignificance" great movie, from a stage play, directed by Nico Roog. In the role of Roger's paintings, it has a lot of work on his "Do not Look Look", which has a fair use as Teresa Russell's lead actress. She is very good here, and is far from the problem in other rogue films like "bread timing" and "cold haven". As Marilyn Monroe "actress", Russell is very effective, she is very disappointing, but plays a loved siren character. She has worked well along with Michael Emil as Einstein, which is amazing. He looks awesome part, and if Teresa Russell does not look exactly like Monroe, she is definitely attractive to make a part of the ring. Other players, such as Emil and Russell, are inadequate. A beautiful work, intelligent script is well directed by rogue, but not exactly like "Valletta" or "Performance". As with other rogue movies, he relies on the most vague, majestic glasses, which is far less portrayal. The film is good in many ways (say, 60 minutes), which serves as a more modest piece. Still, a very convincing, passable image. At times the most wonderful, but somewhat total. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
