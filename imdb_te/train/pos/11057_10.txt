I'm 10 years old when this show is on TV. Until now is my favorite. Actors are very trustworthy. Alexandra Bustado is just awesome ... I ordered the DVD (15 episodes). They have no super-powers. They only have high human skills (strength, hearing, sight). 3 actors are very good in their rolls and are very believable. Every episode has a good story. At that time, there were no special effects or eruptions everywhere, so the script would be good, and the characters were pretty good. There is no fancy stuff like other programs. They did not try to make a joke in every 2 minutes to make a light display. I like good stuff on this TV show.
