I found this very entertaining little kids movie that really jumps and jumps much more adults than they really understand. Some things are inappropriate for kiddies, but just a few. <br /> <br /> In this way, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) cracks are very funny, from sex to culture to Insider-Hollywood to the breed. <br /> <br /> This image is great on a very colorful DVD. The little girl here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the little people here are fun to watch the dresses and hairdos. Anthony Hopkins's voice was very happy, so he painted the story as a movie. <br /> <br /> While I was at the theater, "fair," I saw on DVD, it's very good. I've seen it three times and each time it's better.
