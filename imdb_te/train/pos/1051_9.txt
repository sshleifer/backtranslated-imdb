This is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in Cameroon. In 2004, women lawyers and judges advocates, who have successfully questioned husbands for their misuse of their husbands and divorced a woman by a Muslim council. It's a long time - about two hours - but both the personal plaintiff and the defendants who represent them successfully in the defendants and courtroom chairs are fascinating in terms of presiding the two male judges. This comes to you because it leaves me with so many questions about this change. When and where will the seats of power in Cameroon come? Did many cases of the film appear to have a significant effect on the treatment of women through their wives in general? A Muslim court is granted a divorce, one time program, against the desire of the husband. I do not suggest filmmakers answer these questions. They made a film two years ago, not yesterday. And the film they deserve is an elaborate audience.
