The Home Room really surprised me. This is best when compared to other films written about Columbia High School. Apart from schoolroom shooting, the community and town's effects and consequences are not. The film focuses on two opposing characters, Alicia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erica Christensen). Alessia has been out on an out-of-sight shooting. She did not show any feelings about it. Dean is a famous girl and surviving single victim. Alessia has to visit the hospital in the hospital to graduate. Meanwhile Alecia is investigating as police may be known to be shooting. Alexia and Deanna are very different and can not get all at first. In the end, they grow up mutual understanding and become friends. (Most breakfast club style). The Home Room shows the power of intimacy and crisis after pretty school shooting. I recommend this picture to everyone and everyone.
