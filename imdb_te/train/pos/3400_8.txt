Domini Enfilren (Marlen Dietrich) spent most of his life on his father. She now has the freedom to die - but she does not know what she wants. Boris Andros (Charles Boyer) is a monk who has fled a monastery to taste more of his life. They accidentally meet in Algiers, fall in love and get married. <br /> <br /> He could not leave his past history and could not live without her. <br /> <br /> Another bad conversation, Dietrich and Boyer, is good for giving good performances but NOBODY can keep some of their lines away! Still, in a way, it is a classic. It's shot in a gorgeous technicolor (try to see on DVD) Every frame is breathtaking. Dietrich is always 9s (even in the middle of the desert) and hysterical poses to show off her clothes and her body. Boer walks around just looking aching (there is no shock). Still I'm never bored. It's wonderful to see and kept me in non stops stupid dialogue strips. At the end I almost fell off my chair because I'm very laughing! Now I love the sweet love stories and give them plenty of space but really --- it's unbelievable! It runs a very small 80 minutes. <br /> I would give this to Camp 8 as a classic.
