Since its release in 1988, Ogre does not seem to have a good reputation and I will evaluate one of the reasons for giving it the subtitle 'Demons 3' in order to help sell it better. Well, directing the film Lamberto Bava; The first two Demons films, and the man behind the Oggs and Demons, are some of the same (in which they are 'monsters' ...), but the film does not have anything to do with the other two films. But that's fine! Italian filmmakers are known for breaking popular films, which are not entirely clear; It seems to me that this effect from Heliicer has taken a good bit. The plot focuses on a woman's horror writer whose husband and son are moving to a fort in Italy. She followed her by memories of her childhood and lived in an underground in her basement. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the castle before it returns to the scene ... it can be more than just a coincidence when it believes that there is a murder in the dungeon. <br /> <br /> This film is clearly shot on the budget and it was made for Italian TV, so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant; But it's definitely a very good horror movie. Lamberto Bava may not have as much eye as his father Mario; But he takes the time to build a foreboding atmosphere with the well-congratulations of the film. The central setting, the big castle, makes this the perfect place for the story like this and Lambert makes its best; Even if it is far from high-profile films; Such Inferno-style pool view. Many sequences come out too long and the relationship between the characters is very important, especially the strange (especially between husband and wife). Blood schedule does not have much, but the baba needs to do some special effects. Ogre also looks really crazy and we have a good job that we do not get to see it too often. To be better than usual and recommended to be recommended, if we are imaginable, we will keep it to anyone.
