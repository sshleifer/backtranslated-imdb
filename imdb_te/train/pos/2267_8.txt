Even if I read something through the novel or Kurt Vannengot, I'd like to start now. From this first frame you can catch up and do not let end credits start rolling. The plot is interesting when you take unexpected places. The pacing spot is on, which is too long, which makes the perfect work of balance between unexpected twists and allows the viewer to process what we've seen. It's well told and well thought out. I think I did not compare this picture. It is intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. Acting is awesome, Nolt completely shines, Goodman once again proves that he does not need to go laughing and Lee and Arkin are spellbiting. I was really able to go ... less than a star role. Editing and cinematography are excellent, and all visuals are great for some unforgettable and surprising ones. I will go to other films directed by Keith Gordon and are explicitly related to both the author of the book. A scene of sexuality, and it has a lot of disturbing and disturbing content. I would recommend anyone to congratulate it; It's not pleasant. 8/10
