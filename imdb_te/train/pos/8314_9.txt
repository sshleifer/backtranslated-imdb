The film is actually a romantic drama based on the three sisters who want to become a popular girl group. In their efforts, the older sister meets the street hustler called a drug dealer and Sustin, whom she later goes on because she believes that she is "big time" because she has given her the ideas that she wants her life. Although he is accused of killing her, he really kills his soul, then becomes a drug addict and eventually dies in high doses. Strike is not a story of street life or Italy stolen, it threatens him, it can even overcome trash tragedies in life, and the times in the song and style of life and in the life of the young lady are trying to "seek out".
