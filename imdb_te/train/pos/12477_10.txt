Over the years my family and I have seen this movie. It clears the clean, perfect, heart, and moves the heart. <br /> Showing compassion between the two families of the twentieth century. The coincidence is the most unusual thing, as it has to interfere with God's hand. <br /> <br /> 5 yo matl macka ferland <br /> <br /> All in all, 10 out of 10 people. This sweet man is reduced to human story. With children in all ages, then glad to see this and it brings the family with the smiles and the view together with good feelings.
