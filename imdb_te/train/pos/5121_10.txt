I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for simple reasons. I think Travolta and Wenger performed more than average rates, I think the sets include the location and era spokesman, I liked the sound track and Charlie Daniels band. However, I thought photography was excellent! Internal scenes were filmed in the original club and Gillie's low ceilings - perhaps about 10-12 feet and a 2-4-foot fume covering a "smoke bar". The camera is getting shots through the smoke and actors, bull, bar, women, dancing, and actually the light on the bar! No feat! There is flexible lighting, but to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it should be less light shots. Ray Villalobos (camera operator) is the best! He had a few shots to his expectation, and their influence brought the reality to the film. Thanks, Ray - great work!
