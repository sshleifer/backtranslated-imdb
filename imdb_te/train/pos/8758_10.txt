In the film "Bracidown Palace" directed by Jonathan Kaplan, two friends Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) celebrate High School graduation by going to Hawaii, but Bangkok, Thailand, and more entertainment. They changed plans and their parents decided to go to Thailand without telling the change of plans. When they were in Thailand, Alice and Daleen met Nick Parks (Daniel Lapin), a beautiful guy. He told them that he would trade in his first class ticket to Hong Kong for three economies to spend a weekend in Hong Kong. They accepted his offer and both were arrested for drug trafficking after they entered the airport. They were convicted and imprisoned for thirty-three years. <br /> <br /> "It's not a friendly face friendly once you learn the true intent of a friendly face, they have changed their plans for their parents, they've changed their lives forever Things have a funny way of making things happening showing us what decisions we've made to make decisions. <br /> <br /> Sometimes life is not okay, It is important to think long and hard about the choices we have chosen because we can never go back and change our choices. <br /> <br /> The film is a great arrangement, which is shot in Bangkok mostly. Some of the favorite songs are 'Silence' by 'Delerium', 'Damaged' by Plumb, Sarah Bitman Man By the 'Deliver' and Nelly Furtado 'The Party Begins' I went out and bought the soundtrack after seeing this film. Young and innocent and these girls have failed to fully think their thoughts, making anyone a mistake, so this film is good for audiences. This is not youth or old age - we all are subject to human beings and mistakes. Nevertheless, the film dropped out of the question - who really smuggled drugs? - I will certainly give up this film two thumbs up.
