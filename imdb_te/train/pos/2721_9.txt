The original story (happened in Kansas in 1959) was the murder (Perry and Dick, two ex-convicts, a remote home in a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met). Richard Brooks directed the book of Chilling and disturbing Capote about the reasons for the crime of these children (they are natural Born Killers?). Criminal scenes are very cruel and haunting because of lack of senses and reasons for what we've seen. Conrad Hall, Conrad Hall, excellent black and white cinematography from Conrad Halls, excellent Country Music Music in a film that is both awesome about the execution of two main characters from Quincy Jones, Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. Jones, Hall and Brooks (as director and screenwriter for screen play) Academy Award nominations. Gripping is one of the best films of this decade, amazingly direct and intimidating
