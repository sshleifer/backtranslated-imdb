I find it a surprisingly light touch in the 1950s culture-clash. John Wayne is rarely the first choice to be a cultural attachment, and is diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull-run in Harold's. But at this time he gave up a more idle role than his usual bluff and he had his work done with a style. Duke is a really good man. His facial expression and body language is very subtle. <br /> <br /> Despite being an actor and screenwriter at the time of his screening, he was unable to dominate the film. His good intentions had a lot of chopper. He had authority over anyone, and the funeral hero Geisha gave him the discreet. <br /> <br /> Without a story of American attempts to deal with Japan as an isolationist, swashbuckling or political battles for hell are battles for the hell. I can not comment on the accuracy of its research, but the depth of the oriental culture of the Oriental cultures is well demonstrated. This observation, such as authentic clothing and clues, is a great deal of subtle-dance activity to see. Set pieces are complex and detailed. <br /> <br /> <br /> The broken romance between Wayne and his Geisha adds a little extra element and the film is just a political or flag-wave effort. The script is good without much word. There is a lot of Japanese dialogue, but the translation period does not interfere with the story for a long time. It is good to see plenty of original orientals in the sample. I can not tell whether they are Japanese or not. But they looked at that piece anyway. 'Blood Ally' (yes, I realized that Chinese) did not play Leeds at least by cross-dressing Caucasians, in contrast to other attempts like 'Ax of the Six Happiness' or 'The King and I'. /> <br /> Frankly, I enjoyed this more than those other movies. Initially the script is good. I never liked songs from 'The King and I', and did not impress with the 'Big Alley''s huge-ever anti-communist subtitled. <br /> <br /> I agree that I have not seen this before, and it is very good, as I have suggested to the more popular interests of the Duke.
