I liked this movie because it was basically low. <br /> If they are more confined to the studio, it may be more interesting (some of the plot elements were difficult to develop). <br /> <br /> The DJ played a good job, watching his memories and hunt. <br /> You can see a few miles from the picture, and there are other parts that you do not want to refuse to do. <br /> <br /> If this is a small movie, it is only the right time to tell the story Anything more and it would have started dragging.
