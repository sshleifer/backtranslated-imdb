This film does not require you to do a good movie, big-blasting, multi-billion dollar computer graphics or very good paid actors and actresses, all you need is a wonderful storyline and plot. This is the master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa pulls brilliantly. I recommend this film for everything I love epic life. And those who enjoy the Kurosavas early works. 10/10
