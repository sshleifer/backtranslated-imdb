I saw it in "Dance With Films" and it's awesome. I really felt for Jake. Talk about adding injury insult! Your parents get divorced, but you're also a monster later. <br /> <br /> It is hearty and scary - there are many movements that the audience have shouted with genuine fear. <br /> <br /> This is a good thing for a hero of the past. <br /> <br /> This film is really cool before. The Japanese horror film reminded me of it. Also, by combining the horror film Family Drama, the film is the best of both categories and removes both of the clippings. <br /> If it does not come into theaters, definitely get the DVD.
