I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Train station, soup stands, and other typical scenes, the bike ride reality from the train station, I appreciated the film that I really appreciated for the film. The film has pictures of Japanese life's bright colors, but you do not have to talk to Japan to enjoy this movie. Director Suo's tricks were very small; I highlighted the role of a soft filter called Tamoco Tamura, even though she was excellent, a bit bit contrived, many directors were very sensitive, and I danced with her characters completely. Or he cried. Or laughed loudly. Wonderful. A +.
