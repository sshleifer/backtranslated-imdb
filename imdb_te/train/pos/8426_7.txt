Jatocchi The Heroes (Shinto Catsu) is the first film produced by its own production company, although it is probably a lesser entry in the series, it is not a weak overall. It tells about our upcoming hero across two myriad towns, rival officials and the poor, and a series of trademarks from the set, repulsing the story of violence and low interest. This is a very predictable plot and it miraculously moves in fashion, but style and zipper along with style. For example, helpful Ronin is a remarkable understanding of the revolutionary character, which is disturbed in the order of being genuinely preferred or heroic figure, Zatoichi makes one or two mistakes by his actions and harms his actions, and the exploitation of the ruling system fuel. This is a tough world with one or two more than expected movements in the fight. Zatoichi turns into a simple bravura performance with worldlyness, with a vicious sad sense of mixing knowledge, grisly skill and vulnerability, while Shintaro Katsu seems to be a potentially baleful Ko Nishimura (later Katsu's superior "Snake") In Magadhi) is the two main executives in the film. There is also a good emotional turn as an innocent woman from Yuko Hamada. The film is not shaken and the events are not well-constructed, at least a small jerking time jump and the power of the platform loses slightly, that is, when the image is heated toward the end, it is very exciting and loses emotional effect. Zatoichi's action or scenes using his ingenious skills is directed by director Satsuo Yamamoto, although some gambling is less interesting and in addition to other scenes than in the movie. Still, I feel this, has its flaws and is not the best in the series but still fun, a good story and a luscious satisfying dose of Zatoichi's trademark good fraudulent cool dose prepared and quirky cool. The series is not recommended for fans, and a reasonable entry point, classy stuff is not real great though.
