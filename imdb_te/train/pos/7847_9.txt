It is believed or not, 12 minutes, this movie (for 1912) is a full-length movie. Very few movies have been there for a long time, but it does not set this odd little film apart from the rest! No, that's all what all the actors (except one frog) bugs ... Yes, bugs! This simple little domestic comedy was similar to productions featuring the likes of Larrell and Hardy or Max Linder, but this Russian product uses leaks (or models that appear to be errors). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were not yet recognized and I thought Linger was busy, so why did they use leaks! 21 years later was more realistic than a King Kong and a heck one - and using stop motion, the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well! <br /> <br /> Mr. Beetle starts sneaking for a good time. While his wife is standing at home, he goes to a thick club. But, unfortunately for Mr Beetle, he was caught in camera by the local movie bandwagon. Plus, he does not know, but Ms. Beetle is also carrying with a bohemian powder painter. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this domestic comedy than this, but the plot is age-old and entertaining for adults and children. <br /> <br /> Weird but very spectacular and worth watching.
