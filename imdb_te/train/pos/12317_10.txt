If the best work of comedy, the best work of horror, romance's best work, is negative about a Chinese ghost story, special effects have been discovered compared to modern technology. The film has a simple campus: a poor debtor is to stay in the secluded area while trying to collect the debt. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most touching love stories I've ever seen. It is a stupid, slippery comedy. Unlike some of the Asian films, a Chinese Ghost Story in the Chinese movie is not difficult to swallow. <br /> Think Evil Dead 2 if they threw an amazing love story as a mix. Although many have been neglected, the film is real. It's definitely among the best I've seen. It is not surprising that the ability to combine the best elements of multiple genres and cross the cultural boundaries everywhere to appease mankind. Highly recommended, 10/10.
