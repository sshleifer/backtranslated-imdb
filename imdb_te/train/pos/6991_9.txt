This is a fantastic picture. The cast is great mix of characters and the story is good. The film is basically about a good doctor who steals the dead bodies of the dead and takes him home. When the bodies are in his home, he removes stuff (I hate to use a simple word, but I forget what he removed) and puts her into his wife to retain her youth. Then a reporter, Patricia Hunter, searches the situation and begins to find answers to why brides die. Her doctors go home and interesting things happen. Definitely see this oldie, but if good to you.
