I saw this movie on the show. A lot of danger too. If I had not been sleeping for the last two days for only 6 hours, I could not come home early in the work. If I did not come home from work earlier, I would not see this movie. <br /> I do not know what I missed, but I missed a lot. <br /> <br /> This film is very much. It's almost played on Kevin Bacon's influence. That and the reason (hence the above verbiage). Ever character is linked to some way or another. Action, reaction, interaction, interaction. This film is amazing. I'm going to find a copy to buy.
