"Atlantis: The Last Empire" is a shining gem in recent rock studios produced by Disney Studios. <br /> <br /> "The Jungle Book 2" or the parents who sit through a Pok√©mon film will surely appreciate it. <br /> <br /> The film is too small to try the original story; Previous movies are just about the stories that exist. "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters Inc." All of this will be the same, but it should be noted that it was made by Pixar and distributed by Disney. Recent films from Disney Studios have been released live on videos and are already a continuation of successful films. The quality of those images leads to profitability. The new era began with "Alantis", "Mulan", "Lilo & Stitch" and "Open Range". <br /> <br /> The good part of the film is dedicated to the search for Atlantis, which captured many imaginations. Hundreds of years. Michael J. Fox, along with young Milo Thacht, voiced. Milo Washington D.C. Was appointed by a museum. His grandfather was a renowned archaeologist who devoted his life to discover Atlantis. They seemed to be wasted by his peers, and they would not want you to follow me in their footsteps. After failing to convince the museum board directors to sponsor his expedition, he comes home to find a woman in his dark apartment. She carries to her owner Mr. Whitmore. Wittmor is a close friend of Milo's grandfather, and wishes to send you a team to find Atlantis. Mr. Whitmore is very wealthy and paid for the best of everything. The band that accompanies him is like his grandparents. Overcoming the journey is filled with many great obstacles and is great fun to watch. When the Atlantis arrived, the viewer was caught. The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery, not only the discovery of the public. <br /> <br /> The animators have done a tremendous job in the animation. The film was very successful, connecting traditional animation with computer-made images. The easy achievement was achieved, and most viewers would notice the difference in both. The characters are believable human. There are some good chase type scenes, many of which are going on. <br /> <br /> The creativity of the authors really shines through. Atlantis culture, including the whole language, developed well. References to Atlantis from the historical sources such as the film Plato. Atlantis's disappearance of the world is described. Trusted, if by young audiences, that magic really exists. <br /> <br /> The powers of Atlantis are not properly disenfranchised, but are explained in this way. <br /> <br /> Although set in 1914, the level of technology is unrealistic. The submarine is the most naval submarine of Captain Nemo, who completed sea pedestones with subpads. Massive maneuvers are driven by steam boilers, so they have tried for some era technology. Women's roles are women who have the same role as women in the leadership. This is not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> This is because my other favorite films are my favorite gift, not just one single song. The first film, a tradition that begins with "Snow White" and "The Lion King", is almost every Disney film filled with playful songs. What is this great and all, seven dwarfs "without hi ho! After millions of times it is almost impossible, but this parent leaves. Once on the screen, each person suddenly heard a song and hit the song. <br /> <br /> The storyline and depth of the animation are the same as the parent and child's attention. I'm ready to look again with my kids.
