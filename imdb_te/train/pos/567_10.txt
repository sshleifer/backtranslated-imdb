Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann arrived in the squad to perform the finest Western pieces and this was the best. <br /> <br /> The true actor in the film is the fabulous Canadian rockies, story. <br /> Stewart and Manne played the fullest role in all five Western films working together. Here are the exceptions to the right of the parts that have some exceptions, the characters are inscribed with the characters strongly. <br /> Stewart is a true friend of the film, the sidewalk Walter Brennan. <br /> <br /> The head of a dove called John McIntyre is a villain and he is an acclaimed actor. He play delightful old codgers, power figures and especially evil and artificial villain in this case. <br /> One of the best Western countries.
