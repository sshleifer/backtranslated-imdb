I like the ART's fan, art, paintings, sculptures, etc. I liked it, so it's a favorite, it was a woman's art, especially naked bodies that she was unable to do because she was her perfect family (father), she was shot naked at the beginning of the film, but She wanted a man for her films, but her family was painted her The moral of the men, because it is not allowed. Furthermore, Artemia can describe her mentor as a nude to her boyfriend and her art. She fell in love with the guru for her art, and the art teacher also seems to be in love with her, and in the end she sacrifices her freedom. He said he was raped, but this is not true. Artemicia fell in love with her, but she told her that she would be very worried if Artemicia, her father and art teacher, had been damaging her to tell her artistic hands. I think this is a great movie about ART, and an artistic love, it's worth watching. Like Valentin's Servie Artemisia, she works very well, and I like her performance as "Pansy Osmond" as "A Girl's Picture". 8.5 / 10
