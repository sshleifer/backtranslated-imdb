I saw this film on a really boring day on Thursday night. I have no expectations, I'm negative. The only version I saw in Jimmy was the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifa (??) But seriously .. this film is very beautiful! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with Fallon. Why would not I meet a beautiful nerd like that? :) Movies like that are amazing. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday in Thursdays. I'm not a sports fan, but American films with baseball have impressed me. <br /> <br /> We do not have a sport here in Norway. <br /> My first comment
