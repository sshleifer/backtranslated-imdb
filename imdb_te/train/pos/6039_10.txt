Lucky and filming enjoyed every minute for the extra role in this great movie. Went to the premiere in London and made a great chat with Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon to my wife. Then a couple of weeks later we went to the cinema with our bike club members. What a wonderful image, it deserves to be there with all the great biker images. Now we have the DVD Sue my wife enough to get it kids. I get a bit of stick from the club who feels like I'm a movie actor Oh well dreamed only one. I think they are just jealous. The trouble of the first part of filming is only the weather, rain, rain and more rain, but we're in Wales. Hopefully a follow-up will keep me posted in the zone. Danny Beck
