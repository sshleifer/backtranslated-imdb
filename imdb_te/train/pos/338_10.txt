I saw this film at Amsterdam's International Documentary Film Festival, and made great contributions to the directors and Tobias SneakyBams, all of which were exciting and talked about New Yorkers. The film is a less prominent feature of the episode of Cancer the River on Your Right, the epitome of cannibalism. It is equally important that he studied as an anthropologist with members of the loving-and-gay-relationship Tobias Shenybum. His reunion and inevitable holiday-taking at age 80 was very moving. I can only recommend anyone looking for this movie moving story.
