I love jack jokes like 'The Clutch Is ...' or 'Top Clip Guy, Black, Oily Skin, Spice ...' He is just hilarious! Daniel started to catch up on him! Good thing Jack is not in the team anymore (in a way) or it's sarcastic mania !! I love all the plots (Season 8, a little bit, I must confess) love, the actors are great, I've started to pick facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal's ... It's just theoretically possible and exciting ... oops! Their i go again !!! Sorry, I also started to pick the features from Carter, and all of this is driving my parents Nuts !!!!!!! Well, I end up, I think for another three seasons or even better, especially when they keep packing parts with this humor, drama, action and so on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
