This is a great movie that John Travolta does not think he gets enough credit as Saturday Night Fever or Grease in Travolta's career. He plays a man in love with a girl, but there is a lot of pig to accept her feelings. Instead, he prefers to ride a mechanical bull, because he wants to show his wallet. Although this was done in the 1980s, it is still timely. The great country music soundtrack is amazing. 10/10
