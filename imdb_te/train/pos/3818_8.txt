Secret Sunshine director Lee Changdong returns after a multi-year absence to film-making the world back. He has already had three critically acclaimed films under his belt, who now employs the legendary science director Jean Doyon and her considerable (Cannes winner) talent for Leanie Sheri's primary role. <br /> <br /> When you look at Secret Sunshine, one of the most obvious ones does not really matter what particular style is to follow, but chooses the features of the attributes when it's necessary to tell you what to say. She follows Lee Shiny's story when she moves with her son to Miligung city (which was translated to Sino-Korea Secret Sunshine). After her husband's death, she moves to Milyang after her husband's death, so the film is derived from the tragedy. And she opens a piano shop and things get better when she meets a bit of a male arsenal mechanic Jonkan (played by Song Kango). <br /> <br /> When we meet Mamigong and see her in the store for her, we (and Jongchan, in good detail) follow Shine, her fracture is visible quickly. She is a troubled woman who is trying to grasp her own strength to overcome the tragedy and we will see that she finds it is not enough. The Secret Sunshine still largely performs the dramatic arc of Aristotle, but some reunite the audience, especially the catharsis that end up with the ending, while the novel symbolism of the name of Millenay, the sunshine's talks and the images used in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie is very good. Particularly characterized by the role of character, it quickly produces a painful play, but she meets Shine's attempts to deal with her losses with a layer of subtleties. Mr. Song has a much lesser role in the film than any other film, but he does it adequately, and it is good to give her the venue for Geon. Technically, the film is well done in a scientific sense. No elegant aesthetics used here - the director is clearly trying to tell the story. I think that I can not make my real report and stable, and the distance between Shini and the audience (or at least me) is quite a bit depending on the time we spent with Shini. I think it might be some of the nature of this work, because if total empathy goes forward, then we can not see the impractical problems of Shina. <br /> On the other hand, I have always been with Shiny's plight, despite her tears and very rare behavior. <br /> <br /> The film is still very impressive, after the tragedy, fighting, self-fraud, loneliness and trust in me, along with the meanings and its ruminations, are well done after credits are completed. Inspired by a strong mainstream performance, I honestly did not notice its 2.25 hour runtime. And something says. Well done. 8/10.
