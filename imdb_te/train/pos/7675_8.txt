After seeing the movie last night, I lost the frustration of the companies I was trying to overcome in the film. It is so big to see how the level of adultery loses without a major government change in Cambodia. <br /> You will be in the review. An uncomfortable central relationship is a very somewhat portrayal image, and I also like to go to say it is also enjoyable. The film was correctly edited at the time of the running and Thi Nuuyuan's performance was awesome. <br /> <br /> I also thought that Ron Livingstone had played a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> It is good to have a little more insight that Patrick thinks he's supposed to help Holly, explaining the role of Chris Penn. I can not explain here - see the movie. <br /> This is a good, thought-provoking film with good intentions. I hope to get a better release to get a better size audience and get more support for the K-11 project.
