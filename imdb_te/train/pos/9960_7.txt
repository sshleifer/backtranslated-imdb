I saw that the film was very trash before touching the theaters and I did not have much hopes for it. I figured another "Dance You Got Served" film with another nice dance moves and horrid acting. I'm at the theater and this is the decision and Spartans Meet and this choice. My wonder is that acting is not bad at all and the film is actually pretty cool. The fact that you have a lower rating than you got is certainly ridiculous. Instead of listening to the worst post here I recommend you do not have to spend a lot so I want to see a matin√©e appearance of this film. I am very surprised at everyone else. This is one of the best performances of many superior performances when it is dancing in the movies. See cinema and judge for you. <br /> <br /> It is going to be released instead of judging based on comments before the release of the film and for the movie to be removed. <br /> <br /> Film is moving closer to its proper rating. More than 1000 people have gotten 9 ratings, slightly higher but can help at least get rid of ridiculous votes of at least 1.
