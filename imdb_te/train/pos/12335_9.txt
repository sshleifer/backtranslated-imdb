Warning: Has a spoiler. Carnie plot and terrible acting in many cases. Fontaine is great, but some others, especially Richard Naye, Ivy's husband, are very wooden. With Ney replacing Ney, there is bed, dying of Arsenal poisoning. Yet the film is very juicy and so curiosity. More reliability in the book, than its films. Jon Fontaine Poison (and played as an adulteress, which was just astonishing - I did not play with children) was an amazing stroke. She is just her normal zone fanie self. As the murderers intend, she "dies by falling into an empty space on the ground floor."
