Zombi 3 has an interesting history in making it. Firstly, Fulzi's hit is a continuation of Zombi 2, making Zombie 2 also a campaign to deceive people by thinking of a George A. Romero's Den of the Dead Aka Zombi. Is it confusing enough? Generally, none of the movies are related to each other, but who cares when they make money. Fully guess he does not care about the product about half way through Zombi 3 when he decided to go out. <br /> <br /> "Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines, militants to eliminate it from a plague Stealth and zombie run amok Scientists want to create an antidote, but the army is ready to cut everyone without prejudice. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really liked this film, but I heard terrible things, but the Goofy dialogue was a lot of fun, raising awareness about pollution, playing the army, It is a time of serious imagination, but it's a fascinating direction, <br /> <br /> Other Jumba You can hear the radio DJ breaking the good news, "When you see men in white suits and gas guards, drive them for help." The course is played. Later, they stole a scene straight from the crooks, and gradually, one of the most impious persons was mistakenly killed. <br /> <br /> This gore factor is good with zombie groups in every corner. How cool is it? Can I count ways? 1. Zombie BIRD 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Birds. 4. Swim in a pool without pool. My favorite zombie gas station is a maniac holding a maniac. He threw the whole apartment trying to kill a bad donkey and a girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite coat ?? When a sergeant insists on burning a zombie, scientists say, "When the ashes are in the air, would it come to the ground and contaminate everything?" Sargentent daringly answered, "Now you are talking about sci-fi." <br /> <br /> Extras: Gallery, Trailers, and Interviews Scientists have mentioned "science fiction", claiming he is going to direct with Matey. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Must watch for a zombie and funk fans. <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
