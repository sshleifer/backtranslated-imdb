"Footyard Parade" is one of the amazing fairy tales that has been built against the Warner Bros. Depression produced in the early 1930s. The series "42nd Street" and the Gold Diggers series were also produced and literally, millions of Americans forgot their problems for a while and enjoyed themselves. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> His most famous musical "Yankee Doodle Dandy" almost ten years before. Where he dances in the most original dance of dance styles, his hands are normally deduced towards him, and his legs make all kinds of intervals and kicks. <br /> While almost all musical stories appear at the end of the film, they have the value of waiting. I believe this movie was taken before the foundation of the production code, so some dresses and scenes are bit by bit. <br /> The storyline is that there are a lot of laughs and exaggeration cast. <br /> <br /> Along with those who have already mentioned, Guy Kibibe is his best surprise here. <br /> 10 to 7
