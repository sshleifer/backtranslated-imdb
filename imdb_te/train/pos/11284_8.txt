Tarzan Locks Barker's time when I was a child. I often hear Johnny Weissmuller from the old people called "Tarzan" and I saw a pair of Vesuller's last films in the role and I thought he was out of shape. Not many years after I came across "Tarzan and his companion", then I understood. Veseller is shaped in the film and has an unparalleled character and strict look through other Tarzan, such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Joke Mahoney, Danny Miller, Miles O'Keeff and Christopher Lambert. For the film I also amazed by the beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan a strong, self-minded, active and sensitive presence that pushed TouchJon as Jane's way ahead of the movie and the pond was nude to her wonderfully; The explorers kiss her by surprise, do not kiss her, let him do it for a bit and do not let any big deal out of it); Such behaviors can not imagine the upcoming "janes" like Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart, playing the most perfect sweet harmful women, the African jungle <br /> <br /> The silly personality of the character of Oswalen steals Tarzan's performance, which Vasmullar is primarily taken when it comes to action; The combination is perfect. <br /> <br /> "Tarzan and his companion" stands as the best product in its genre (another highlight of the film is not Chetta's second character and not as the main character of Tarzan films), and possibly the best, Greatest Adventure "(1959) with a high budget and strong supporting cast (and convincing Gordon Kat /> <br /> Jane and her mate is good for <br!
