<br /> <br /> This kind of story will be invented from many other movies, and I'm not going to be bored too. It's a knife / sorcery image, a kid that realize how important he is in this world, a "nomadic" adventurer, a nasty assistant / magician, a princess, a hairy creature .... You get the point. <br /> <br /> The first time I caught this film was a very tough winter. <br /> <br /> I continued to watch for the extra five minutes before turning the channel, but when I was holding the site of Galfax I decided to stay and see it till the end. <br /> <br /> A white, furry creature, compared to dancing, but not nearly as useful or fun to watch. Some of the white shaggers hit him and forced the actor to wear. There are scenes that appear as if the actor can not move within, or he's almost slept. Though he is not in the movie too, some scenes are valuable! He tries to talk smock to Bo Swenson, taking the solo-chebica match to a higher level. <br /> <br /> I really bought this film of that character, and it is nowhere! <br /> <br /> GullFox looks like a sheet, but he has done this movie !!! I never saw the sequel, or the only reason to search for it is because of his absence! Probably the final image to be, the trilogy is full, the Gulffax returns a lot of anticipated!
