These first two seasons of this sitcom were very strange and they were not very funny and there was a drama element that struggled with Bill (mater) with all the common problems of life, but the subject was a bit depressing and did not mix it down with comedy. It then became one of the most humorous sitcoms made by the BBC! Chemistry between Bill and Ben characters is very funny and always has the most spectacular and memorable sketches in each series. Christmas specialties are hilarious and a real dish for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The lead actor Gary Olsen Bill goes out of the game very ill, such as up 'n' under and very funny man RIP </> <br /> This poorly-esteemed show is missing from our television screens and is often not repeated - It looks a bit later in UKTV Gold, but it's a fantastic joke to a new audience of one or two on the BBC
