I've come to Nancy Drew, who looks worse ... because of all the bad reviews. I thought: I've heard books like Nancy Drew though I read the books. But I was wrong. Sure, it's not a carbon copy of books, but if you make a movie, you'll need to edit it to make it bigger for fun. The plot was enjoyable and very scary, and Emma Roberts was really incredible in her own way of playing this classic role. Many funny moments and many commercials are in vain, as Nancy is a dizzy at any time. She is intelligent, conservative, polite and real. The film is full of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I liked this movie. No image, no image! And if you decide to be clever and believe me and go see this, as I'm frecking, prepare for some scary because of the heck moments! Be it a bum-bump or see what you think about this movie ... I've made a mistake. I loved it, I got this movie! I also love Emma Roberts now. She is like a small-bree van der Camp from DH. Love it, love it.
