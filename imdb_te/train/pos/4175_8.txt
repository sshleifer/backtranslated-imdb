I always wondered what happened with the feelings of the old Slovenian films that seem to be in them ... I was surprised at that moment if the concept was just nostalgia. Or "feel" packed its bags and decided to say "Goodbye" somewhere between our movie history? Or did you do it For me, I saw "Express, Expers" for the first time. <br /> <br /> The film has three properties, it's somewhat unique and it's looking - it's the soft flow of the story, the colorful warmth, and the most appreciated - the lack of excessive use of oral communication (many other (not just) Slovenian screen The writers should not be considered at least). There is no use for words, you can understand each other by means of other means (yes, or better). Just watch Bakovic and Cerar. <br /> <br /> In this way, in many words, why do you recommend "Express, Express" to all of you, why should you see a Slovenian picture <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bakovic Vivaldi's music is dancing here That scene ... a treat. <br /> <br /> Treat yourself. Look.
