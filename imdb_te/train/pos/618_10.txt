<br /> <br /> The film is fantastic. <br /> <br /> I said, 'I am sorry'. Cast, sequencing, effects ... everything! Magnificent! I mean, this is love story, yes, but it's good from the rest, it's said in an entertaining and good manner. <br /> For me, it is a representation of the modern fairy tale. It's like the modern Peter Pan ... <br /> <br /> I'll buy a copy of the copy of this market. <br /> <br /> This film is really a must see double ... !!!! 10 stars for that!
