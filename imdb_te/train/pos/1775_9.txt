I often wonder why this series is too slammed. I thought it was clever and even very cleverly written and performed. I think it will be seen in the light of the coming of it in the coming time. Many of the upcoming and upcoming young comedians appeared and all went so much. This fact is what the people are aware of its value and it has to be issued. Sally Phillips, Simon Pegg, Peter Sarfinovicz and Julian Rind-Tutt of the least successful Green Wing. Authors Graham Linehann and Arthur Matthews are the best comic writers of the modern era. Anyone who can create a comedy like Father Ted is not eligible for publishing. If this is ever issued I will definitely buy it.
