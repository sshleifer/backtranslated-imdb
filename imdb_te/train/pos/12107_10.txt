When I lived in New York, the film appeared as a kid in the film. It's not as good as a horror hotel but a pretty creepy movie. I bought this movie on DVD and the DVDs I purchased included DVDs and DVDs that I do not have many scenes and subtitles spoken in French and / or Italian. Then what other actors said to be speaking English. Kind of weird. <br /> <br /> Instead, the film's role as the character of the Elcy takes her dress and nude, in the DVD box, some of the actors' names are different than the IMDb. Julia Elizabeth (Barbara Steel), filmed in a scene and another scene, is trying to force the protesters to push through the bed and kiss her by kissing her. The scene remained in the TV version, but it was edited very much. I wonder if any extra footage is included in the reviewed ultra-edition? It's sad that some of these old low budget classics have been bundled into bit and sold in all forms of editorial versions. Where are master tapes and unused footage? <br /> <br /> Before twenty minutes before being delivered to Allen Castle, the rest of the movie was very beautiful. There are no special effects (but Hubert's face is good after the Julia clubs). The creepy climate and the strange, exotic and seductive form of Barbara Steel makes the film much better than it should be. If honestly Barbara Steel does not exist in the film, it becomes a bigger zero. She makes ten people in the movie!
