My name is Julia ROSS Joseph H. Lewis, a mesmerizing 1945 B thriller, one of the best directors for Hollywood Nair. After these lengthy training of the Gothic Pictures Lewis from 65 minutes of Columbia Pictures, poverty has been featured in Western Western, East Side Kids comedy, Horror Melodros (including very strange Bela Lugosi Shocker the Invisible Gosthost) and Standard Studio B Production Co-ED, BOMBS Over Burma, San Falcone in Francesco) --- all of which is of great talent Arrived from Mr. Lewis built for skilled iyu well. My name is Julia ROSS (SO Dark Knight from the following year) Introducing a director who has mastered the rare and delicate art of telling a dark and scratchy story faster and efficiently on the most modest of budgets. Although their heroic architecture expanded, the later Lewis Productions gun crazy (1949) and The Big COMBO (1955) were reliant on improved camera work and efficient low-key lighting. Very simple resources. <br /> <br /> My name is Julia Rose Most of the British secrets (which are set in a studio-bound England) are more traditional than Noir attitudes and lymphocytes. A young woman (Nina Foach) accepts in the home of an elderly lady (Dame May Witty). She is two days old for her arrival and she wakes up from her whimsical sleep, with a new identity - the old lady's daughter. She says that she is a nervous breakdown, and she absorbs a complete and seemingly inept helpline of her troubles. But long before she was the grotesque and embarrassing truth behind this dark mystery, her "husband" (always terrible George Mammad) killed many of his true wife and she was robbed of her participation in a fierce and ill-advised scheme. Lewis is one of the most distinguishing stories of this sort of untold stories, as Lewis touches the scarcity of this product, which is the first in his true intense efforts as a film director.
