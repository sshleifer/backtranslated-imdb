James Mitcheller's books became the most popular among readers of distant places in the 1940s and 1950s, with strange noisy names. His Tales of the South Pacific Roders & Hammerstein became a big hit in the Broadway hit. South Pacific directed by Joshong Logan and is natural to make a mockery of another Michaare hit Soyona. <br /> <br /> The Japanese were kindly to American films during the Second World War. I'm sure it's not easy for people who struggle to change the Pacific War overnight. There is a simple number of fraternization policy and the crux of this story about interracial sex in general and those with the occupied people. <br /> Sayonara is a related image today. In the ways that the civilian owner could be legally abused, the military personnel always worked for his personalities. In the United States at that time, Si√±ena created fraudulent laws on books in many states. Today is a big problem for homosexuals in soldiers. <br /> <br /> Joshua Lohan is the most familiar. The South Pacific is racist as a part of its nation. <br /> <br /> Margan Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith and others have reached some good job. But the film was stolen by orientals here. Micho Taka Brondo's sweetheart hit the mark. But true stars are two assistant players Oscar, Red Button and Myoshi Umeki. <br /> <br /> The buttons are the member of the Air Force who enjoys all of you. He falls in love with Matsaki Umeki by Katsumuti. They will do everything they can to marry and break them in military cruisers. They know what is best for Batans and Umakis. Butans has a TV comedian and good talent, but he has not been able to make a good part of the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> And Miashi was the first to give Umeki's Oscar Oriental. During the Academy Awards, Moyish Flower starred on Broadway in the drum song because it took great care. I made a special effort to see it in Broadway, the first Broadway show I saw. <br /> That the Oscar has somehow suggested. <br /> <br /> Our war with Japan really exists and as we have seen with a great country and culture in Saoneora. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Montalban plays Nakamura, Kabuki theater actor. If Sayonara have been today, Logan will never be away with it. But Montalban is fine. <br /> <br /> Good location and great story. This image must be restored more frequently, it is very ethical.
