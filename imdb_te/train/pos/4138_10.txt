Another reason to see this happy movie is Florence Rice. Who is Florence This was my first response when opening credits were on the screen. I've found Florence Rice, a real beauty that just turns in a stunning performance. They'll all make this grip in the collective piece. Since 1939, it has a different time, but it has an attraction. It shipped you into another world. It starts with light comedy, but it is very serious. Florence Rice runs the comedy from the comedienne to the heroine. She is a weak and at the same time strongly confronted with a girl from a girl. Look at her facial expression at the end of the film. She has acted in forty films, and I'm looking for thirty-nine people. Alan Marshall is in Flynn / Gable, and proves to be the perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebson and Una Merkel offer some amazing comedy time, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30/40 movies, do not miss this one!
