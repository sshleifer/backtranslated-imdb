I liked the movie, but as everyone has said, some bits are not adequately developed. Three girls were very swollen when I went to jail. Sure, they were supposed to be innocent American girls but still ... I felt like they lost the bond that they were supposed to have bonds. <br /> For example, when they see the montage, the way they insist with each other for the photograph is very awkward. </ P> <br /> Then, there are some very vague parts. I understand pretty much that I did not do it with the dance character, but I can see that it's confusing. Also, why did the camera stay with a very durable expression after the camera placed the bags in his taxi trunk? <br /> <br /> In the past, I was crying when Claire Danes was convicted; She is a great actress. <br /> <br /> Also, I saw the bitch Thai prisoner killing his ass. Talk about the lack of closure ...
