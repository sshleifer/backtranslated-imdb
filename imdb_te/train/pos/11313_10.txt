Gino Costa (Maximo Girito) is a young and beautiful drifter entering a road bar. He meets the young, beautiful and unsatisfied wife Giovanna Braganza (Clara Kalamai) and her old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa) bar owners. He shares his mechanical skills with some food and lodging and has a relationship with Giovanni. They decide to kill Giuseppe, who is both car criminals. Their relationship is affected by misconception and police inquiry. This masterpiece will end in a tragic manner. Luchino Visconti Nair and the neo-realistic film is the best. This post was first seen in 'The Postman Always Rings Twice'. I liked the 1946 version with Lana Turner, and in the 1981 version, Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange was one of the hottest sex scene in the history of cinema, but this is definitely the best. My vote is ten.
