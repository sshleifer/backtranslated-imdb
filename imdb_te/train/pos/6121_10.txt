How does anyone like this movie? This movie looks great, in the first week I was seen on the shelf at the video store and it was stolen .... The Best Horror Movie Ever !!! .... I took the carrot and he ... well did you know hahaha? How not funny? The only film that comes close to touching this is the Chucky bride and just great !!
