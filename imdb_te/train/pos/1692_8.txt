Like great classic bugs bunny cartoons, this film has humor at different levels. I introduce this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Both enjoyed the film - sometimes laughing ... and my daughter was not much of a sci-fi fan. The film has been laughing since I've seen it a few times ... adult-level comedy (i.e., having so many fun experiences, heart or r-rated stuff) Adult level comedy For example, Martin Voices are based on different movies / actors roles. Marsian pilot, Blaze, Jack Nicholson's voice and habit; Scientist, Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove's. Special effects for this film are very surprising. The scarcity of the top 10 actors actually works in the film's favor, and the actors / actresses play their role - in fact the producers have chosen actors and their skills to meet the needs of the characters in the box office draw. Wayne Alexander's "Vern" character for example). I had to write this review ... children are currently playing for 3rd time in 4 days at dinner. A rainy day or a late night weekend is good-nothing-on-and-i-boring image.
