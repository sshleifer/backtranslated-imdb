This stylish action film has been released for nearly 5 years. I saw this film almost 10 times and made great effort by Goutham. From my perspective, I think the film is actually flawless. Surya ACP Ambulachan-no doubt..Classis. Jyoti has done a great job of her role. The character is well suited to her.The films are a role that Pandia plays in the role. Jivan plays the role of Pandya. Bruetal and fearsome <br /> <br /> Jivin has won the Best Villain Award for Daniel Balaji, Devadarshini and other good roles. <br /> <br /> Stone screenplay, full-time dialogue and fairy tale by Goutham. Harris Jayaraj is all the chart busters, but BGM is very well suited for the film. Cinematography is rich by RD Rajasekhar. Peter Hein performed acrobatics. Antony's editing is accurate. Kokka Kaka is the perfect coffee film action and romance. </ p> <p> Some Hollywood artworks also compete with the nipple. Undoubtedly.
