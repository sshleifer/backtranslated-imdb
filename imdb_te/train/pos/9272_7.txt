The first of the Panahi films I saw, I saw at the Melbourne Film Festival. I was fully realized by the different characters he was creating and how they respond and how they behaved in comparison to Aussie children and how to deal with other levels as well. If most people see these pictures, they can see people and avoid racism, often they are fueled by unknown fears. There are clear big political differences between Oz culture and Iranian culture, but I found more subtle differences between the characters that fleshes so successfully on this film screen. The ones that seem to me are remarkable and very special. I found a comprehensive view of the letters.
