This is a strange, cerebral, surreal, subtle image. If there is something like "intellectual horror" movie, this is the film. I was scared and I wanted someone to see me with it, it's just a plot! I have to watch this movie again and again. If you're a guy who likes "my dinner with Andrey" and Godard, or you do a lot of mind-changing drugs, you probably enjoy the movie. Wow.
