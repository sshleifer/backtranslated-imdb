I really enjoyed this movie. Acting as the plot is amazing. Jeff Combs has more talent than he has found. The only part of this film I am going to finish is all over. The death of the creature was very scared for the science fiction channel. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting religious beliefs in the film. Jeff Combs represents an anti-chirst that certainly played a Messiah number and creature (or the shark you liked). There are some special scary scenes that have 'world experience'. I noticed this only after my third view of this classic creature feature. I know many people can not get the instructions of Christianity, but if you look closely you will get it.
