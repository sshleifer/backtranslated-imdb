"Kolchak" is really a TV series that fits into any category. Part horror, part comedy, some social awareness thrown out, and I think we are not ready for anything. Since I started looking at these shows in the Chiller network, it was very sick (I never actually saw it), and I realized how really different and interesting. <br /> <br /> Darlene McGavin is a Kolhak journalist for the international news service and Simon Oakland has always been an angry boss, Tony Vincenzo, the Chicago News reporter's exploits in the show itself as part of the story itself when he searches the city with winds for modern stories that die overnight . The underlying attraction of Magawin really separates the show. Somewhat Goofy guy, always dressed in the same suit, can not help but love him. His jokes are very good, and his and mysterious editor, behind and back in between Oakland are apparently happy. <br /> <br /> The stories are pretty good, and acting are very good. * Not great * for the special effects of the 70's, and the performance suffers, but if you suspend the infidelity, it is a fun series which is time to advance what you want.
