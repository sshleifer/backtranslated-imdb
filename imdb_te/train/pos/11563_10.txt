Many years after the television series I first saw, in the beginning, I did not care about it. Then, as the series unfolds my memory time, I see it again, and it's totally hilarious. When Neil Simon is based on the stage, it's not much 'open to the big screen', and its strengths are one. Walter Mottau and Jack Lemman are both Oscar and Felix, and the supporting cast is fantastic, especially the 'Winnie' by John Fielder. Felix's narrative stories brought the Finger's narrative stories down the line, facing the Felix surrounding the Oscar Crossing and Apartment in the middle of a ball game with Felix Dinner request, and 'Piguan Sisters', and in fact, the epic cafeteria scene (later Norah Efron's 'Wen Harry Met Sally') . Razor-sharp conversation too. When Feelx feels that the boys are taken to the highest, Oscar said: "They're vitamins, he's the most healthy person in the room!" Fantastic!
