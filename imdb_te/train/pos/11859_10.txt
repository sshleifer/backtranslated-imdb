All Balires and Shot Callers on MTV Cribs will remove Classic Movie Scarface from their DVD collection. It can give you an idea of ​​Scarpes as a "gangster movie". Sure, there are gangsters and group there, but it's not a scarface point. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is a caban shelter looking for a new way. He comes up with a group group and becomes a famous drug lord. Montana has everything you want to do in your life. Classic phrase: "Tell my little friend Hello!" In Scarface. This quote is what I always comes when I think of Brian DePalmas film, Scarface. It comes to my first 10 favorite movies. I'll rate it *** 1/2 (from ****). The image you must see. Fabulous.
