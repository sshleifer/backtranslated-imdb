I saw this movie with my kids (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd Annual Roger Ebert neglect film festival. After the movie, children in the audience were allowed to ask questions, director and tian-ming wu. He (through the translator) told him many stories about his life and film production. <br /> <br /> Along with all tanks, both my children really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> I have to paraphrase many subtitles for my daughter, but most of the image is visually self-explanatory. <br /> <br /> I do not give anything away, but the bottom line is better than 95% in the Hollywood trash (especially children's movies). <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> There is a "true" / original king of masks with 12 masks at one time. The actor learned to do the training and to do up to 4 masks at a time (then they will cut and change the 4 new masks).
