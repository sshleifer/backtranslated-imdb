I'm glad that this film is enjoying the other films, I know that it does not have a great reputation, it did not earn money at the box office. I thought it was amazing and there were a number of reasons - Bagdanovich Touchs was easy to direct, the cast (especially the Kolen Camp) was perfect and did not appear well in the Big Bad Apple film. You've seen the worst movies!
