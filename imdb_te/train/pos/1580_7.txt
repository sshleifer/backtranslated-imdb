This is not a searing look at the Holocaust, but the closest story of events involving small street in Berlin and some of the participants. The film is currently in New York City, where Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampee) is mourning for her husband's death and his family and she comes to her. Ruth's daughter Hanna (Maria Schrader) slowly finds her mother Lena Fischer (Doris Schude) raised with Aryan woman, and she goes to Germany and finds herself 90 years old about the events on Rosenstress. Lena talks about Berlin in 1943, where Gestapo Rosen holds all Jewish wives in a building on Straussie Street, Aryans getting married and waiting for a nine-day women's waist outside and shouting for their release. Eight-year-old Ruth (Svea Lohde) is waiting for her mother to come out and she does not want to be somewhere but she meets 33-year-old Lena (Katja Rieman) who takes her inside of Lena's husband Fabian (Martin Feifel) and eventually seeks her Her first film was directed by Margarez Von Torta, which was directed by the director, Europe is one of the most respected directors in preparing inta provocative. This is not one of the Nazi paintings we see in horrific degradation to Zeus, but we see that some serious treatments are being issued but instead of reconstruction of this small incident. The movie tries to shock anyone or try to open doors to discussions in situations, but it's just light in a small but real-life program of historical times. Part of the power of the films comes from its actors, and especially shines by Riemann and the young LoHead and it is good to see Scradder (Amy & Jagger) in a good role. I feel alone enough because this is a great movie or events because I consider going to change your perspective in WWII but because of the innocent lives I think it is important enough to retell this true story.
