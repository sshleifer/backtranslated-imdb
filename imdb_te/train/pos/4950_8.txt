When it comes to ending a movie, acting, directing, and acting are very important. Good when the director / scripts are found correctly. Just clocking in 82 minutes, 10 items or fewer stories, they try to understand the inner contents. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman (Lucky NUMBER SLEVIN) "HIM" was played by an aging actor in any of the characters he has provided. He is introducing "him" while traveling on a supermarket in the out-of-the-direction section of the town via Kid (Jonah Hill, click). Kid insists that he has a star in his car and talked about his absence in the film over the last few years. He was not much coming because he did not come out of it, and there was also a way to go to a indie film that works at home ("I did not agree if I did not accept it."). Kid is the cousin of the director who participated in this indie venture and soon falls in the middle of him. Difficult, he decides to check the local market. He walks quickly to the beautiful Scarlet (Pazzage), which operates 10 scouts or less. Not only beautiful but intelligent, she started using her as her main research feature for her upcoming independent film role. <br /> <br /> But he does not just use Scarlett, he helps her, so he can see him deeply in life. They travel together to get back his car from a cheating spouse, and she teaches her how to work when she gets a new job, and how to succeed when she faces Target as a target of local clothing. This is one of the most ridiculous moments of his glimpse, since the retail world of the chain stores ("these shirts only have $ 12 bucks! How is this possible?") Can not fully realize his perception. , As mentioned at the beginning of this review, is sudden but sooner. Although they formed a special relationship, these two friends were always friends. They know what to get from the farewell and the other. <br /> <br /> Scarlett's clunker car is L.A. It's quiet but inspired moment that sits disgusted outside the building. <br /> It is a great independent product, and it will not waste your time.
