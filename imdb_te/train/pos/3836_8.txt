Very interesting and witty image. David Lynch (literally quoted by the existence of red curtains in the film) and Franz Kafka's novels (The house keeper in the film is known as Mrs. Grubac, which is one of the Der Proges ...) but there are clear references to Belgium's colonial past in Africa . I can not explain the exact content of the film: this is an important part of the colonialism, as well as the inability to bear a past, but the main character's personal memories are also central issue and his exploration and love for social. <br /> <br /> If you try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, the most fascinating movie (beautiful scenes of beetles, larvae and other nasty insects alternate with great scenes and dark atmosphere gives an additional style). Maybe I can say that I did not get much of the film, but I was looking for 1.5 hours like hypnotized, I liked the visual quality and the lovely Mysteriousity.
