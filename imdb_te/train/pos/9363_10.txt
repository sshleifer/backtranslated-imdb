The film is awesome, it's the movie you see, the director / writer other than the movies you see in other movies rather than the other movies. Sandler has done a good job playing a role outside his comfort zone and has always done a great job as good chead. The film is great for a mature intelligent audience. Acting is amazing and can only be overcome by the writing and direction of the film. The film focuses on true Americans, past generations, no stereotypes or racism. This film is about damage and coping. Instead of choosing psychiatry, it does not need to talk to you, but your thoughts will guide you, rather than a person who is not a miraculous healer. This film is all round amazing!
