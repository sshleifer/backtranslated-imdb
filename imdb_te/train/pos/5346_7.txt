Carol, the girl in the middle of the story, was moved to Spain in the late 30th century, a foreign territory contained in a civil war dispute. For this girl, everything is new, it's aliens. <br /> <br /> War and her father are her constant worries and she is in New York when she sinks in her regional culture. <br /> <br /> Immanuel Uribe directs these figures. Carol's family was clearly broken, Carol's mother marryed an Air Force pilot with the left event, with the sympathetic sympathies of the rest of the family with the fascists who won Franco and the controversies. This story has nothing to do with the next, better, but easy to see image. The magnificent landscape of northern Spain is shown. Do not expect too many activities for the twins in the neighborhood of Carol and her boyfriends. <br /> <br /> Clara Lago Carroll Lagoo plays innocently and innocently. Maria Baronco Carol's mother, Arora, went to America. Rosa Maria is the mentor of a friendship with Sarda Carol. Carmolo GÃ³mez plays Alfosso, a man who left Arora when Aurora went to America. The actor has played major roles in most Spanish films, but he is not only an enigma throughout, but can do nothing.
