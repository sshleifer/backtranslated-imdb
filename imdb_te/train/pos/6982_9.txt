Good show. <br /> <br /> The basic background is at the crossroads of humanity. There is a set of moral dilemmas. Humanity has achieved many technical developments, but does human dolls have enough maturity to deal with its new dolls? In a fantasy world there is a moral decline. There are religious fans who are willing to kill to care. I guess it will be a problem with Cylons and slavery (based on BSG background). <br /> <br /> This program is not BSG - not until the humanity is running from a ruthless issue and finally making their own. <br /> The first few episodes I have seen so far are not at least shoot-m-ups or space-based special effects. <br /> This is a very good story, characters, and themes. It has good performances from actors. They can create a culture similar to modern culture, but the alien is at the same time absolutely believable. As with BSG, this exhibition is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, probabilities and disadvantages. It may seem a little odd as human society has a variety of worlds, including the negatives, antique cars, and chicken. But those things are really much more to create a semi-familiar theme than anything else. Anyone who is stuck on those details does not really point out. Whether you come from a mafia-style culture or a rich and high-tech culture, the human and human nature is not the same as the 150,000 years ago, but the technology that we have long ago in the world. Wonder if the authors are trying to tell us something.
