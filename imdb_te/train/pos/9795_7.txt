<br /> <br /> I've always said I'm better than animated Batman films than all of the animated films. <br /> <br /> "Mask of the Phantasam" is the best thing ever, then "Worlds Finest", "Sub Zero", but it 's a disappointment. , "Return of the Joker" <br /> <br /> In this newly animated film, a mysterious new Bat Girl Girl in Gotham and discovering her friend or foe in search of the vengeance of Batman Are intended. <br /> <br /> The tone of the movie is very tragic and impatient for most of the movies, which is very frustrating. Bruce has acted bizarrely for a long time, and the villains are re-used from the final pictures, and while the action scenes are stimulated, they are not really new. It is not a dramatic effect for other films, especially in the "sub-zero" play and character development. <br /> <br /> At this time, I really feel this, I have a blast, and the surprise of the new bat girl is surprising, <br /> <br /> (** half ****)
