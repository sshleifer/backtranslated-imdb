Errol work for the Public Safety Department and his job is to check sex offenders. Sometimes he is employed and beaten on sexual offenders. I'm not blaming him but Allison comes so his retirement is ready for him. Errol is now her training and job shadow to do her job. Allison was initially innocent about the job but she did not realize how much it really was and it was all Errol's fault. <br /> When his job is not a police officer, he begins to go far beyond his invasion to find a lost girl. <br /> <br /> It is a very good movie about a crazy guy who knocks out the boundaries and works outside. His "practice range." Errol did a good job but for Allison's safety. It also has some good mystery and when it's just that I have found, it's more.
