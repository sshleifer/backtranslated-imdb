I went into the film because I was dragged there and the audience had a lot of elderly ones and I thought it was a place because soon I left again. However, the film is absolutely attractive and aimed at older people. All of the characters were real and believable and I found myself discussing movies, characters and storyline later. There are some very immersive scenes but they need and help you to better understand the situation. For all this, this great and valuable movie - not just a little mainstream but the mainstream people will not enjoy this movie. It's a thrilling and interesting film experience.
