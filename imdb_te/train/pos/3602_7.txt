The story of a troubled boy who is rotating to boxing for self-esteem and anger management is rarely a new thing, giving the girl a fresh twist to the storytelling instead of the protagonist. <br /> <br /> There is a problem in Diana school. She should not be away from the fight. At home her father is constantly putting her down. Her brother trains training in a gym and decides to train her when she chooses one day. <br /> <br /> I would call this rocky "rocky girl" which I did not expect. But this is not what it is. This story is of great importance as it is actually a boy from the main character and a boy. That way you can face more problems at once. When she came to boxing gym because she did not agree because she was a girl-girl because she had a problem, and she was a girl at all. It is also a story of how one can change life to someone. How positive things can you grow. <br /> <br /> The movie does not feel much different, but I say the truth. <br /> <br /> Michel Rodriguez is very good in the title role. It's a shame that it's really hard to type in "tough girl" now, because she's not part of the "girlfight" because what's really not. <br /> Maybe this is your average underdog story with a twist, which is the way that Rodriguez's audience is elevated. Display. I am rating this 7/10.
