Actors are great, especially Kenneth Branagh. It is good that Robin Williams has a comedy role in Osirik, a bit strange to see him in such a product. It's really great that Kenneth decided to use the perfect version of the text, this certainly happens to be not quite sure ... viewers director - through the parts, thank you to see the amount not selected. Also - thanks to God in a classic form of the film; NO to Surreal Fanfabarias! Although "Titus Andronius" impressed, but still hamlet a different story, at least it is my perspective.
