I love this movie because I grew up in saddle racing. Pat Boon behind Salky reminds my father that, unlike the jockeys of the race, ordinary height and weight men will move to the Trooners, rather than the drivers. <br /> Yes, the 1944 Home Best Picture in Indiana, but this is a very different picture. April love makes light and easy looking and good feel. (Pat Booen's religious / ethical perspectives have banned him from ever-changing fare.) In Indiana, with Walter Brennan (portrayed in black and white films without any hint), it strengthens and battles and makes the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying Big emotional investment ID required.
