I'm a fan of Mitchell Leicesen because I have a great estimate for renting this movie, but the print that I've earned is very bad, so the image is so dark that it's worn from use and correctly repaired. You can not see one of the scenes shot in the dark. I believe this film will share the same opinion as the first review. It's unusually departed and should not make lines and rhythms of your typical Hollywood 30 movie. Heck is not your typical Hollywood film of any era. This seems to have been influenced by Europeans as a director because there is a certain risk factor for actions from the early shot, which is in the movement and management of the camera that meets Megi (Carol Lambert) and Skid (Fred McMurray). You're half hoping to start "believing" from the show boat. It starts with some laughs and poor Anthony in a scene that does not speak of killing the English word Freddy. There is a bum on the skids he has overlooked. So he will sign up in the Army to hide the attacks of the world. He was just released and in the screenplay of the screenplay, she escapes her boat for New York. This film kicks into the high gear and when we begin to get the French film that siblings vibes the entire activity. The scenes were well-directed by Lombard and Cecil Cunningham, the film Pulse gained. He and Lambard are very good at McLaren for every other fall, increasing his talent for the trumpet. Then Temptus comes in the form of Dorothy Lamourr. Enough plot. This film has a spectacular matted scenes for me. They are very good. And Lombard scores run in the film, but in the second half, a little more is called Freddie and he fails to deliver the goods. With a heavy dramatic ending and you do not believe in the movie, this film is not small, but it is not your distinctive feature in design, design, and direction. It is worth a look. It was one of 37 hits in the 1936-37 season. I do not know its exact rank.
