The 4th Pokemon film was laughing at me when Selbe was dead. You do not have the courage to be Pokemon sucks! I liked Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so I do not like it when people like Pokemon, like all other Pokemon movies, should be enjoying Pokemon. So, without further care, please tell Pokemon greatly and experience the people of all ages. And also, why do not all of Pokemon-haters give too little rating for all or Pokemon movies? I do not understand ... they can not do that ... That's why there is no reason why you should vote without proofing that Pokémon is really good: 1) Pokémon is only a small child. 2) Pokemon Stupid. And 3) people do not like Pokemon. I think this is why people do not like Pokemon.
