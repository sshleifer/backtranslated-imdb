I am reminded that the film's barrels produced in the past few years have entertained me, and I'm attracted to a lot of viewers, and I'm reminded that I was scared of the film's blood at a very young age, I was not afraid or worried. <br /> <br /> This setup is simplistic: a psychotic inconsistent dentist destroys ligaments and possibly bodies in the mouth. A brilliant twist, however, is that the dentist is the main character of the film, and thus some being a dimensional bad guy without obvious inspiration, any role in his development is very extensive and he is very human and believable. The viewer feels about his sympathy and his victims, and hopes to do justice to it, finds a way to cover his tracks and return to normal life. <br /> <br /> The horror film really does what the "torture." And "dentist" makes no better than any other movie I think, for the first time, the film has tons of tons, which does not have modern lamb movies.) In a scene (dentist), the dentist is mentally disturbed And for the first time a little kid needs to see him For the sake of the Udi and the child, the incident ends without injury and I do not spoil what's going on, and secondly, when it comes to gore, it's all the worst and witty nails. <br /> <br /> However, there is a flaw in the presence of a movie that you have never heard of. In particular, it is special for fans of horror, and as another reviewer says, just a few days, But we actually want to know about the background of the characters, how good it is, and the image is bigger, so there are some minor errors that can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> <p> It is strange, after years of accustoming to film gore, I want my eyes to cover my eyes when suddenly watching blood. "Dentist" was scared and totally uncomfortable, and it earned my full approval.
