<br /> First of all, I do not think this series is a sequel to "The Jerk". I mean, it's not called "The Jerk 2" ... it's "The Jerk, Two", which leads me to the character's character names at the same time, which actually revolves around a completely different person. /> <br /> Think about it: There is no connection to the previous film, rather than character names; A completely different story; Different cast; It's a partial music. </ p> <br /> <br /> This film tells some of the credit. It has plenty of laughs at it .. Mark Blankfield at his lead.
