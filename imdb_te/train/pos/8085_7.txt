One thing I can say about this movie is very long. I bought this film a few months ago. Because of the 70's (even though I have never lived with them) is actually one of my favorite decades, especially for music because I was happy to find what I did in 1978! I saw this movie is very good at the beginning, but after 50 minutes it started getting very boring and repetitive. The animation impresses me! It's nothing I've seen before and it's pretty looking. But the film was honestly a bit better, it was just struggling to just speak it further and alot the story than just 15 to 20 minute scenes. The film was then selected for the last 5 or 10 minutes, and it was again good but unexpected. In my opinion, I felt very long. I knew it for 13 minutes for 2 hours and it looked like 4 hours, though it's still a long time for the cartoon but boring for the movie too! But overall it's okay, and I'll see again "I'm not doing anything for days." I'll see what's new and I hope that's good!
