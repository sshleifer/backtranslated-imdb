Rich, falling in love with the alcoholic Robert Stock Secretary Lauren Bacall. He married her and stopped drinking. However, Bakal was secretly loved by Stocks' best friend, Rock Hudson. And Stocks' nomfomannic sister, Dorothy Malone, and later Lyst. <br /> <br /> The glossy image of a beautiful technicolor with jaw-dropping fashions and decorations (initially check Bacall's hotel room). Everyone looks beautiful, beautiful, dress-fit outfit. Basically it is a soap opera with grade A product values. The story is also fun and initially some of the conversations are ridiculous. Acting by Hudson, Stock and Baquel is not good, but it is great to see them as young and attractive ... especially stock ... My knees are weak when he laughs! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is a brilliant performer - for her role as Best Supporting Actress. She is sexy, violent, vulgar and sympathetic ... all resolutely. <br /> <br /> Fun, glossy garbage. Do not miss!
