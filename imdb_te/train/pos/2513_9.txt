Beautifully completed. Very angry. Friendship can not endure, but in the end it can learn a group of friends or friends. I looked again and again. The music is also amazing. When Kai loses a friend, he meets a boy named Shao, who has been with his true nature. Under Mallepa's lawless streets, they fight in their own place in the melting pot of Asian species, and sometimes know that you're spending more than willing to pay. The inches are surprising when the film ends. I could not get enough of it. Gutk and Hyde perform an excellent job of acting, proving more than the boys they are singing.
