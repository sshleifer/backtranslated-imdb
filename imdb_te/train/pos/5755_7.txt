This is a pretty strange picture. It appears as an exploitative film with over-the-top violence and dubious situations, but it is unusual for each other to be built around the rural characters in the fight against a 'other' attack. The film is a vast stereotypical method of Vietnam veterans, in a long line of films that portrayed the war shields as dangerous snails. Chris Christopherson's last line, 'I still do not lose a war' because a long trial of murder and destruction meets with the death of the police and his brother, especially the chilling scene. However, Christopher is a good enough actor, and attractive enough, bring this villain to a surprising depth. Vincent was obviously a golden boy, but had enough intensity on his good cut goodness. The film has some comparison with Winchester 73, where Jimmy Stewart is trying to cope with a criminal brother until he is forced to act against him <br /> <br /> Christopher, Vincent, a beautiful Victoria Principle and Bernadette Peters make it an A-grade range give. <br /> <br /> Vietnam-pre-reagan introspection is a long-lost perspective on the American mind of psychological disorder, and confusion, and a film industry that is ready to discuss such issues. <br /> <br /> In this channel, a great network that plays older movies from the 70s in the 90s, is a political bent.
