That's great fun. Everybody has great actors. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It is a well-written screenplay by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon in Vegas). Although I can not see them, I do not like soap operas. I love this movie from a very silly and wall to hit any stupid soap in the paneer television. In my opinion, it's the best film of 1991.
