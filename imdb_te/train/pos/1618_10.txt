This film is amazing in every way. It touches the complexity of love relationships in a meaningful way, but never lectures. The script does not coincide with any role, not even the fainting Johnny. It also features spot-on direction, product design, casting and benefits from performances. Cher is so perfect in the film and she is far superior than her "Cher". I watch Moonstruck at least once a year and I viewed this Christmas Eve again with my 16-year-old twin daughters and they loved it as well. It's something that everybody has a heart and you are happier at the end of the leaves.
