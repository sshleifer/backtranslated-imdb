The first of all movies is a movie in art. The plot is full of surprises, earning a little kid a million dollars and pretending how he will spend it. I was separated by this way. Walt Disney really really outdid themselves at this point. Comedy has been evaluated many times but other times unexpected. I'm exactly right or this film is OK. It also teaches a lot about sensory teenagers and I think this kid is really clever and a bit of time smart pants. But it sucks. How a heck of a heck like a kid hot police babe and let his father go free for him. Let it kill a killer for ten years for free. If so, I'll be hit with a 'sneak jack'. That kid is really lucky. Return to story. Film producers know what they are doing when doing this movie but it's not right. Acting is good and bad. The kid does not have a chemistry to the woman, but the brothers are wonderful. On the other hand, special effects are dull. Plus this movie is not based on reality. I hated at the same time.
