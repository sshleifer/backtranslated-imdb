There is no time for this movie. Once Jeffrey Convitsz's best-seller's controversial adaptation, this image appears to be just a mainstream version of your typical spookfest. Next to the gruesome touch (especially those crazy, at the very end), it is a glossy horror movie for those who do not care for genre. It has an outstanding cast in small roles (Jos√© Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, and many others), but some of your audiences are not your average low-bens film (producers of 70 'disaster movies) have a similar idea. I liked to look at the well-known faces, but this story is very stupid and the film is about how high the class works, but it's the scale of your average 70 pages exploitation (though not entirely bad). However, it's a pleasant movie for viewers with a particularly surprising feel. As always, the matte work of Albert Whitlock is the best. Overall, pretty entertaining.
