I have read many reviews from this movie and say, "What's wrong with you?!?!" It's amazing! I thought it was wonderful from the start of the film and the story is well said. I believe that people who do not like this movie do not pay much attention to this film. There are very important scenes, you can be confused if you do not take care and the scenes will not make sense. You really do care to see this film again and I want to see you alone. This story made sense to me and as I said, well said. Every scene in the film has a point and everything fits at the end of the picture. <br /> All the actors have done a marvelous job! Sean Connery is always very good in his role. Laurence Fishburn is an amazing piece of tanny Brown, who has played a very interesting role. Kate Capshaw is a nice touch as well, and looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a surprising surprise, I did not really expect him greatly, but he removed the great show. Ed Harris is a real gem in the film. He plays a really sick person and really makes you look at how his character is disturbed. Look at his eyes in his scenes, wonder! Also, she is one of the first characters, one of the young Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) ... is not a bad place to start. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who will like this cast in this cast. This is a great movie and must watch. Listen to other people's opinions, see the movie and come to your own conclusion. I hope to see this film, and I hope you will enjoy it as you do. Thanks for reading, <br /> Chris
