Edmund Burke said, "Every bad thing is not good for me to do anything." Hollywood often gives us the worst because enough families can not see quality images. This film is an amazing story for loss and trust. There is no violence, no vicious rights, and a PG rating is not eligible. The western scene is well depicted, and some vistas are just breathtaking. The actors are a bit young for their parts, but believable and talented. The music score is too loud, and in some places the dialog is completely drowned. I was rarely surprised by the movie Endings, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Sometimes good guys win, and they win with honest trials. We've loved the movie and the message and we recommend it to the whole family.
