The first film I saw in the Rocky Ann & Andy Theater. My dad was my sister and I, and the funny thing - when we came home, the father said to us "what do you want to do now?" And we want to see Ragge Un & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took it back to the theater to see it - at least I remembered how. I was five years old at the time. <br /> <br /> The film is very scary at the age of five. The sequence with the sweet giant ocean and hypnotic camel scene .. I can not remember much from this film, naturally, the beginning of magic and some scenes - I found it again <br /> I remember the love of Rangie & Andy.
