Yes, it was above, yes it's a bit cliché and yes, Constance Mary's whole babe and again seen again worthy! Jokes and gags can get old and repetitive after a while but the performance is still fun to watch. <br /> <br /> When it comes to being a family show, humor is reduced and writers have included ideals between family values ​​and deceit. <br /> <br /> <br /> George Lopez is funny. Do not take him seriously and perform the winner. I'm sure he does not feel his role as serious or virtuous paragon. <br /> I said big, dark, bitter spot Benny. I hate that role ... I am not listening to her anytime I mute the TV anytime for 30 seconds. There is nothing funny about her conversation or her humor. As a mother she should be worse and I'm surprised, and that role has been such a miserable man in the role of George. <br /> When I see Benny: Bill Engwall is better than her to see the show. Now there is a bad sitcom ...
