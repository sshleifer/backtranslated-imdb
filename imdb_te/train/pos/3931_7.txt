<br /> <br /> A young lawyer has initially focused on Abraham Lincoln's early years as a fictional biography, primarily focusing on a trial that defends two brothers who were murdered. <br /> <br /> The interesting picture of this important American figure and the film is well made, but Stephen Douglas seems somewhat incomplete without great moments from his presidency or his discussions. The obvious motive is to play Lincoln's character, and he develops qualities that make him great. <br /> <br /> In the role of Abraham Lincoln we can show Henry Fonda effectively a silent strength. Fonda's show includes some gangling techniques and other effects in displaying Lincoln's character, especially with some efficient makeup and occasionally a bit public. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is a great and surprisingly Ford's general assistant cast (sometimes referred to as his stock company), but there is no ward bond in the most fruitful actors in Hollywood. Bond appeared in the top top film films of any other actor, both original and revised list. He also appeared in 11 Best Pictures Nominees. <br /> <br /> The film features a scene in "Kill a Mocking" in "Kill a Mocking", where the scene is the most influential in the film.
