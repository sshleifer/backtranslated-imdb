When it comes to movies, I'm pretty good, and I will complain about anything I've done and wrong. <br /> If you read the last review (it's half, half of it is written in the caps and the film does not have the original information), you may be sure that you did not do this very well. Unfortunately, if you can read more than 3 lines in the same review, you have found the cause of the poster for radiation: the director is homosexual (or the production team is crushed ... apparently). <br /> <br /> I have never received a review earlier. However, the film is based on its merit, not the director's sexual orientation. First let's see a quick list: 1. A great plot? Sure. I do not want to give a shred away, but the plot is the most comprehensive and exactly what is expected to be based on a commercial. It's a thriller, it's not horrific, and it should reach that point. <br /> <br /> This story may really be true, because it is true (and the plot is very confident about realistic events). Amazing acting? That's yes. Robin Williams was relieved of the chains from the cast of a long time comedy, and he developed a number of serious writings that he wrote many decades ago. He has once again played a high role in The Knight Listener, a radio host who plays as a radio host and gets caught up in a moment ... well, I'll see for you. <br /> <br /> In the exciting direction? Sure. Now, unlike the other poster I mentioned, I really knew something about the direction. I'm now going to school for 3 years in the art of directing. Of course I did not really think the difference would make a lick (the only thing you'd need in the direction), but I thought once again that something significant and basing my view here should be set up once again ... the director's sexual orientation (or product group's accusation of drug habits is not). <br /> <br /> Patrick Steetner's direction is dark and dark, and he is lighting up to help those who are able to use "tension and release" than angles and angry and fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts. Some really can really show a story through your camera, others need to have a story with a camera. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, I really appreciate when someone dares to use the camera. Lighting, cinematography and editing? Great all around. I've already written a lot, and I've gone over ten more paragraphs about these last three things, so I'll close that. <br /> In short, look at this movie. Listen to people who have different intentions to disperse them, especially if they are openly ignorant with their intentions of the 1/4 of the way through their post. Enjoy the show! -Ben
