It's very good, it's made for TV movie. This could not be exactly the case in the suburb of Circa 1970 and the sort of neighborhood. Punk teenagers are the worst & most worried part of the movie when the family kills the dog. Teenages do everything to hurt and harass this poor family. But boy !, the main character does not eventually take the punk young men's vengeance. The father / homeowner is not necessarily taken out of punk teens and it is not quick to retaliate without police assistance. He stands up to them and protects his home and his family. <br /> I saw this on TV like 8 or 9. I've never seen TV and liked it. Definitely a good one! It's a sort of movie that's not too late to catch a weekend night and watch a weekend or stop an afternoon movie. It does not show them anymore. <br /> It is definitely worth looking at!
