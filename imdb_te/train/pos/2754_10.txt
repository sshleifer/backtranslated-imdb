I really love this movie, 3 years later or last week saw again. This film is perfect, great acting, great story, great direction / camera-work / music. It is a gift that you can show. Very bad jaco von darmalal did not make further movies after this. Top 5 Work. <br /> <br /> This is 3 days after 3 years, the comment above. It's never out there because it's not more than 10 lines. Anyway, I saw yesterday "Le Humeim√© Zour". There is no doubt in my movie Top 3. It is a masterpiece with the movie Paradiso. Soundtrack is also good. I'm really excited about the new movie "Jaco Van Darmas". I hope I will finish my movie Top 3. If you see this movie, rent it. Or better. Buy it. Because you want to see again.
