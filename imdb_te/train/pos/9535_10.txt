The second work of Sam Mendes (and his best work in my opinion), the director rejected his Oscar for the year, the director was three years before the Oscar winner for his outstanding acclaimed but controversial American Beauty. <br /> <br /> This is a relatively wealthy and happy family story from outdoor shows in difficult times in the Depression, for the local mafia boss played by Paul Newman by Michael Sullivan, two children played by one of the great Norse hanks (I must say, not his admirer) A successful man. His eldest son, Thirteen-year-old Michael Sullivan Jr. learns how much money his father's job and money will get after a year of joyful ignorance, which he has played perfectly by young Taylor Hochlin. He is excited by his curiosity and his expectations that he is unexpectedly witnessing a murder, committed by his father's boss John Rooney. Such a discovery triggered an innocent spirit, causing many events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of time, all the backgrounds and decorations are created entirely, when the narrative is well written, editing and cinematography are almost flawed. But the main line of the film, the most important moments of the film, and the key to points and film success is the difficulty of father-son relationships in bad times. They are very deep, strong and believable. Tom Hanks makes amazing and is one of the best performances of his career in a very unusual role for him and all the acting across the board is amazing. Eventually Paul Newman is worth to say a good score and as a result we get an unusual work for all the people involved in making this beautiful (but one more time sad) masterpiece. This decade's film-making great achievements and unfortunately is one of the best movies of the year.
