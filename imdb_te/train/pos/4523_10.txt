When I heard Adrian Padar drag in the film, my expectations were low on watching the whole movie. <br /> <br /> A wide variety of "Mrs. Doubtfire" became ridiculous and I thought it was a delicate one. Brilliant comedy. He is absolutely trustworthy and sympathetic to be the prestigious entrepreneur to release his wife's playmate through his cross-dressing during the pasada. He airs these needs in a completely unreliable manner to the audience. Julie Walters is wonderful, her habitually, is the proprietor who teaches unconditional love.
