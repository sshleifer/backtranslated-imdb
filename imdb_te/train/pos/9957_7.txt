This film is surprising in IMDb. Like many movies, this is not Shawshank. If imaginable, dancing competition / personal growth film, it's a reasonable good. To verify from IMDB ratings, a female step dancer wants to have 8 hours for an hour and a half. The film reached 250, and "voted" with several 1, which does not have special effects for many of the films that are not about the mob, nor does it have white or non-straightforward characters. <It's an American movie, but it's not a US film. The most implanted instructions in Toronto are nonsensical, and the final competition is in Detroit's boundary city, and some viewers may feel that the audience is set in total. <br /> <br /> I loved music. I liked the dance (but it's not $ 50,000 worth the money ... but I know what). <br /> <br /> I agree with the title sucks. I do not remember anyone in the picture that words, it should be "s". <br /> <br /> There is not much to hate (and honestly, 1 vote, you hate it), so I am the only expression of the kind of hatred of people, and it is sad.
