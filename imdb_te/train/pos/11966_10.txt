This amazing series. You will laugh, you cry, these wonderful people are part of your family. This family deals with one another and the guide is a great example of helping our lives by helping each other through their crisis. They have many good things, and many bad choices, but they never turn their backs on the family, they work through problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, the beautiful thing I have seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers middle child syndrome and is better with everyone's help in the family. DJ, the eldest daughter, her father is growing up whether or not it will. One thing they all share is that they miss their mother. Danny (Dad), Joey, and Uncle Jesse are very much loved by these children, and it's obvious in every episode.
