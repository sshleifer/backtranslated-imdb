It was one of the best crime-drama films of the late 1990s. It was a great cast, filled with a powerful storyline and many participants made great performances. Pacino was great; He should have some nomination. As long as the viewer does not care about his louo-sinaya accent, John Cusack is great. If you can not stand this dialogue he may be hurt. The belief that the role of Pacino interacts with Cusack's character is dramatic, and sometimes a bit ridiculous. Danny Ilayo is as good as ever. David Pearler is a great assistant. Bridget Fonda is good but not memorable. This film has many characters, perhaps the most mentioned times. It may take a second view to remember, "which is Japan?" After many cross-references, one should stop and think to revise. Not too sting to the end. It was built up for a long time and then was a bit depressing. This is one of the few issues with this image. As the film "Big, Blockbuster" is not considered a big screen hitch, the film also forgot to exist. Pacino and Aiello are great but the lack of movie "splash" in theaters may be accounted for nominations. It was a semi-successful in the home market, and viewers are still learning to have this title outside. <br /> Made in 1996, it is still standing and popular in the coming years. <br /> You see your lemon pudding (you'll see) and watch this movie!
