It's one of the favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> The role of Parker Posey is over-the-top entertaining, the library's literature never loses anyone who works in the world of books and stocks. <br /> If you're a library student, this is. Then buy the poster and hang on your wall. Soundtrack is highly recommended. I have shown this movie more than any other librarian friend - they fall in love.
