Stargate SG-1 is some kind of spin off from the 1994 film "Stargate". I decided to expand on this topic. The show gets rolling from the very first episode, a retired Jack O'Neill has to go through the gate once again to meet his old colleague, Dr. Daniel Jackson. Through the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent guy does not let her go, and Teal'k refuses her false god and is a quiet and kind warrior who has a team. <br /> <br /> The main evil boys are called Gouald, which are parasites that can be inserted into one's brain, and therefore do bad things, controlling them. Any goulad that has a large number of energy is often considered "system lord". The warriors behind the Goulald are called Jaffe, who can insert the parachute goulald in their bodies until the body is in the brain. <br /> <br /> Through the episodes we go through the Wormhole that is readily transported to SG-1 Jack / Daniel / Tellock / and Sam's exploration team and other spheres (called this device Stargate) and they are new cultures or bad Guys confront. There are some episodes around the world, that are, they can not reach once in the episode, and instead of dealing with land-based problems. <br /> <br /> Over the years, you knit close to SG-1 team, and more role-structured story lines. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8.75 / 10 ---- There are some examples of story stories though this is great in the show. Not always rounding up and focusing on the front door for the past few years. But still, top notch science fiction!
