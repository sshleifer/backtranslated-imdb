I bought this game in Ibe I heard that AB is the same game. The gameplay is actually very similar, and is very addictive. Once I played twice, I immediately went back to eBay and they laugh every day with my kids, so they can also join the fun .... I play this game and the storyline is that if you're really in a movie, it's brilliant. If you are free to explore due to the limited nature of the storyline in a single player game, set up a freelancer server (easy and software included) on your own PC and play it for your heart content. There are still a number of freelance servers on the Internet, so multiplayer is not a problem and you are not threatened because you can not often target other players as you want. So get a copy of this game, learn by playing single player campaign, then arrange an online presence and enjoy your. The hidden spheres, the wormholes, the secret bases, the list is almost infinite - this game is staggering, huge systems, as well as all kinds of other types to explore and destroy. Wonderful game and especially if you can get for a couple of quid on eBay. You get it with full written manual (blue box, not Xplosiv red box), it's fine!
