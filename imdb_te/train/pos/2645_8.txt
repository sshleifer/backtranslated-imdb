Such movies did not attract my attention. You see, I want to see this film again for twenty-five years. The one I saw and only it was like a younger ager that might have been released year by year, 1977 <br /> When I remember the movie, there is still a high desire to see it again that deep-handed emotions have been touched. The movie searches and searches through the human element of the father / son, which is sure to touch every human soul that sees it. Why this film has not brought storage and less depth is often shown in many other movies, I do not know <br />. My memory was real and I was delighted to see it again after watching a copy of the movie. Rating reflects movie content. The VHS tape used was a DVD that saw this 1977 product and took away from the quality of the movie to watch this movie.
