Michael Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school girl with a fraudulent scout and 2 x 4 on her shoulder. She is ready to fight for her father, especially for anyone paying for her brother's boxing lessons. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas is amazing as Adrian. Their emotions on each other are shaped by the squared circle.
