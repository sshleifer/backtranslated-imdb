I was not fully aware of the first 20 minutes or so over the film. Like many other people, I found myself pretty boring, watching this bite bite icicles and waiting for an hour and a half to bind them. However, if you sit through the creation of his first work to see the finished product, you know very well how good the movie is. I was really sad that it found so many people retread the ideas made by these impossibly boring or other artists. <br /> The Rivers and Tides is a silent study of the artistic and techniques of Andy Golds's Word, which completely completes his work on things in nature, usually the natural use of nature through the entropy process. It is slowly moving and emotional, but most part of the movie is to say that Gold's art is no longer needed. <br /> <br /> "I'm undoubtedly one of them, People who complained about the CDs that come with written scripts should listen to their music as well as what it wants to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics, I'm just kind of a person who believes the artist wants to know what I do not want to talk to him through the film, he will, after all, lose his train thinking and find himself unable to explain some of his work, but you see the movie But if you want to talk about his art, do not hesitate <br /> <br /> If you want to know what a musician wants to hear, you need to understand the words, not literature. <br /> <br /> The work of Andy Golds Worthy is very good, seeing the film, I'm happy to make the film in order to display it. In fact, although his work is not generally the kind of shipment to the studio, photography is the medium of expression it can be, and I can see the work that goes into his art, and the way things only use things from nature. Whether you like some of the items on how this film is presented or not, the golden wardrobe is enough to make sure that the work is perfect, because the film is not the star, the art of Golds Worthy. And it feels like I know director Thomas Riedelsheimer, who has no musical lack or given little special effects and the slow-moving nature of the film.
