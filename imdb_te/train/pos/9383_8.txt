Director of films 'Last Seduction' and director of 'Again Me Kampi' comes from another Nair style. John Dal, who created a niche by creating the films on the themes of adultery, in the early 90s. Although I do not have much opinion about the past seduction. But these days, Mr. Dahl has directed television shows. This is an insult because man has talent. <br /> * Spoilers ** This is a very fascinating movie. For Wyoming town for the job. But he did not prove lucky and the owner of the bar was JT. Walsh makes a mistake by a successful man from Texas. He was given a job to kill his wife (Boyle). But the cage decides to break up after making a pre-payment. On the way out of town, he struck a man on the road and returned to the local hospital. Cage randomly encounters Walsh at the time, he also appears as a local sheriff. <br /> That cage meets the real hit man as Dennis Hopper, avoiding her clutches. <br /> <br /> John Dal is the co-author and director of the film. Thus the director shows that a project may be better when he brings his ideas to the fore. Directing has a good standard, but when I watch the movie, I made a TV movie concept. There are very close frames. However, the film is not enjoyable. The film has a good pace and the structure is perfect. <br /> <br /> Cage has played a dramatic role in the role, although it has been somewhat strained for his performance. His facial expressions are in Mark. Laura Flynn Boyle was hot and performed entirely as Femme Fatale. Her hairstyle is very far away and any person can go on her knees. Hopper played his role. But I feel that he has a false impression of this role. He did not convince me that he had the characteristics of Hitman. <br /> <br /> When looking at 'The Hot Spot' and 'A Perfect Murder' Because some sub-plots are the same. Overall, it's for you if you're a fan of Noir movies. Recommended value. 7/10
