The movie Evil Breed: The legend of Samhain has a very small idea or effort. It is ridiculous with the specs of ultra-fast "slasher" style death and death plain frustrating reactions. The cast has been rated to a D because the actors have a very low potential, and the stupidity in the film is very questionable. The way they were portrayed by people like their age is very different. The romantic odd split fits in the idea it really does not offer much, and in any area respectable but very quickly run down with absolute gut-wrenching death. An example is the poor mate who has lost his anus, and the scene is about 5 minutes. It's terrible that the kids are fighting. The film is a good choice for some terrifying deaths and practically torturers.
