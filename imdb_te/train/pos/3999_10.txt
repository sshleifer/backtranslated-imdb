I'm embarrassed to say that in the theaters I will lose "The Mother". I saw this evening on DVD. I gave 10 votes, one of the many things I gave here. The English independence was filmed with such great care and quality. It drew me motionless. Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Kathryn Bradshaw have a sincere and completely absorbing story of gratitude for the performance, low-key and total humanity. Cinematography is amazing. The score is difficult for the plot. The storyline is fabulously dressed by honeyfee kureshi in epic and worldly lives. The story mentions big problems with the sensitivity of an impressionist painting. And some of those big issues are very controversial, explaining that they have won many awards despite the nominations. This is one of my all-time favorite movies.
