When I see a number of reviews, 'Eddie Murphy is a misfire'. These critics want him to look at a part of what he's working today, and the past can soften their attitude in the past ... "Golden Child" is not Hybro Entertainment, but thanks to some cast it's new life clips, and Murphy is one of his best roles. I can not understand that its efforts are not 'love'. Could it be released if one minute of adventures have come up because of the weakness of the foundation? Steven Spielberg started with Indiana Jones; This is probably one of the biggest sins that is unfair to make a scapegoat when it is not entirely dangerous. <br /> It's not crazy, but occasional observer Hidalwood's spiritual idea starts and ends up to understand 'ridicule'. It is more important than belief in this story that audiences have a tour of guides to show them the mysterious scenes. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy are in line with the bill that suits this ability. You buy my advice ticket and take the ride.
