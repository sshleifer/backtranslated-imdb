I suggested to rent this movie to my friend, who has already seen the movie and that it is okay. I thought the title bit campy since I called the version "Fear: Halloween Night" at our store. I thought this movie was a little bit of a Halloween hole with a killer wooden guy. But it opened a good scene and the murderer immediately killed two victims and saw his son kill him after twenty years, and he also committed suicide, and his father tried to commit suicide until a wooden statue survives with his fathers' soul His friends Ruu is his girlfriend. Very good for a sequel and I did not even see it first.
