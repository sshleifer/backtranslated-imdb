The more I watch Nicolas Cage, the more I appreciate him as an actor. Now watching this movie (in 2005), I see that it is not really enough for the genre of movies that came in the early 90s. I do not really think it could be considered a film noir, but it's pretty dark at times, mostly lights and odd people of letters. </ P> Actors did a good job with their characters. Although the characters of Hopper and Boyle did not develop, however, it was sometimes difficult to understand what they were doing and I thought why they were doing. Hopper likes a love for him or some kind of person. The plot is good, and some parts are very unreal and I have the parts to be directed to the director (ie when he first saw the sheriff). In all, this image is definitely worth looking at. *** 1/2
