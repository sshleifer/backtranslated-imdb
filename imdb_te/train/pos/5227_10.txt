"Men in White" is definitely one of the ridiculous, if I ever watched the ridiculous, funny movies! (And I've seen so many people!) It became "Gold in Men", and two worst people who stopped the attack from space. There is also a simulation of classic movies like "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove". Anyone who says that the film is bad is something wrong on his head. Here are tones funny clothes and jokes, and you can really hurt your mouth since you laugh very hard (it happened to me!). If you watch this movie on TV, see now - you do not really worry!
