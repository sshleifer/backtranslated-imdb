If you do cult 70 sci-fi, or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Bukaro Banyo", you might like it. It is a stream of sci-fi's of the magnificent 70s, including a 22-year-old Junkyard and one million years from Earth. The film is a pure 70. Put on Steve Miller's "Fly Like a Eagle" or Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of the Moon" and you're ready!
