Surprisingly terrible and disconnected directly from Disney's videos, the audit sequels denounced. Like the previous sequel (The Lion King 2), I'm very happy that Disney has brought back a lot of voice actors, which makes a big difference and they put a good level of traditional animation. Plots are spinning around for a while but jokes are distracting from a permanent string until hilarious from lame. Broken broken plot and jokes gave us some silly musical sequences, like most jokes, from fun to a quick tour to the fridge. Most of the MST3K-like moments are muted and can not be completed and do not add completely to the other movie, except to be a vehicle for an hour-long past. The new characters are at least fond of, and older characters do not do their work, so I can not make them wrong. Overall this movie is not bad and it makes for a good frivolous filling between very good Lion King titles.
