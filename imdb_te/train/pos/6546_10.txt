I was probably one of Nancy Drew fans. I've read every book three times and I've played Nancy many games. I liked this movie. It kept entertaining all the time you saw. I went with about 10 people with my friends and everyone liked it. Three women who appeared in the early 40s in their 30s were sitting behind us and asked how they liked, they liked it! So it's fun for all ages. You have to give it a chance. And it teaches a lesson, and everyone around you is exactly the same. Overall, this move was great. I'm going to see a second time! So please stop bashing. Its a good picture!
