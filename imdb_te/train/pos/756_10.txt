I'm saying this kind of shows, shock horror, I'm a girl, I feel I have to express my opinion. I saw Dirty Sanchez, Jacques and I would do it program program, overcoming Jacques. Story lines and interviews are designed to be more interesting. I've seen a few minutes of the jacuzzi film on the other night and can not believe how little it is, all the things that kept joke in the joke after all. It should always be a quick, easy performance to edit the shocking enthusiasm. It is not my thing that the drinking of my duck Sanchez from the Jacobs league and drinking it to me is a matter of great entertainment.
