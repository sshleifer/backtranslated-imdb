After his toes in the pool at Guy with "The Strange Vice of Mrs. Ward" (1971), director Sergio Martino becomes another Twisty Suspense thriller the same year, "The Case of the Scorpion Tail." Like the previous one, The beautiful lots of George Hilton starring Martino's satanic / giello hybrid "All the Colors of the Dark" Co Dude. "Scorpions Tail" also featured actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg as Martino's "Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key" (1972) as a happy pair. (I love that title!) I think Edwige Fenech is busy with the month they shot! In any case, this film is in the direction that Martino fans expect, as well as a twisty plot, some nicely finished murder set pieces, and beautiful Athenian location shooting. At this time, the story became an insurance researcher (Hilton) and a journalist (Stryn Derberg, a charismatic and intellectual sister of the Farah Fouseet) in a plane crash and a $ 1 million inherited legendary murders of a beautiful widow. I really thought this film was discovered by half, but I happened to be dead wrong. Although the plot makes sense in this Giovanni, the film should look again and again to fully appreciate all of its delicate pictures. Highlights of the film, for me, Anita cat and mouse fight with the killer at the end, a particularly suspension house break-in, and a nifty fight roof on the roof; Explosions of good actions in this film! Fine folks at No Sham still have nice subtitle and interesting additions, thanks for another great-looking DVD. Whotta turned it into a great outfit, this lost Italian gems brought back from Oblivion and its ongoing quest.
