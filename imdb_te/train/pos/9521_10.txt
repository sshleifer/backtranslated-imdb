There are a number of reasons why I think this movie is brilliant but there are a few of these 1) Tom and Tyler good acting 2) brilliant machine gun scene that is part of brilliance 3) I twist the idea that the end is a good I finally guess all credit to all credit Sam Mendes This is because the 3-point image image form is as good as well. I am a film student in college and have studied this film in more detail and it is one of the best films I have seen over many years. I made this film a big thank you to all the people. Finally I want to say that it's just pure illusion in the scene shooting in silence until the gun gun scene John Rooney "I'm Happy You" is the very good sequence in the movie where it gets pretty good <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> <br /> "
