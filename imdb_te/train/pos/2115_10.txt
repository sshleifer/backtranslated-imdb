I've been disappointed after seeing you've got mail, and I decided to look at the original film, which prompted a shop in this shop. I was amazed at the film. It is a real gem and one of my favorite films from this moment. Acting is very complete, the story is beautiful, if you do not see, I want to see you today. I'm not against making it back and sometimes I like a newer version than the original version, but at this point you agreed that it's a classic mockery of classics. Do not lose it, go to your video store and give shopping around the corner today!
