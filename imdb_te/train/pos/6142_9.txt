The delightful Disney film with Angela Lansbury is a middle-aged sphincter whose interest in World War 11 will turn to witchcraft in England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury is a part of the film at the age of 51 years. She is back to Jessica Fletcher but at this point it is the benefit or the mother and mother of England during the great dangers. <br /> <br /> In the witchcraft trying to get some information on the witchcraft as a professor of the movie Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson. <br /> <br /> The three mini darlings that live with Pryce in order to escape the London bombings are fantastic in this enchanting movie, even if we're not old enough. <br /> <br /> Tessie O'Shea, Rody McDowell and Sam Jaffe are given less to do in this glamorous film. <br /> <br /> When I came to life to make an autumn war I finally ended up with the Nazi expedition in the small British coastal town of Ben Stiller's film "Night Museum".
