Twenty-five years ago, I was shown in some children's classes in this movie gallery and I remember the kids enthusiastically; They're spellbound! It's not about the termites living in and living in "clay casinos", but also about other animals that use insects. There is a spectacular sight of a Cobra who is struggling with a monitor baton while watching the Mongol colony. It is not good for pest classes, it also teaches ecology, because of the relationship between termites and other organisms and the total ecology of the organisms around and around the insects. <br /> I'm available on DVD, I can see it again and show others.
