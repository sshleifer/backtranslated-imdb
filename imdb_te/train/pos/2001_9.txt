I'm "Oliver!" I was fortunate to see in 1968 when I was a young teenager on a big movie screen in Boston. Later, in the summer of 1969, the film was still enjoying playing a leading film in Leicester Square, London, after receiving the Academy Award for Best Picture of the previous year. <br /> <br /> <br /> "Oliver!" I remember reminding me that the victory would end in Hollywood, with not all of the talent in Broadway in both theater and the screen. Charles Dickens, a part of the literary heritage of the English-speaking people, brought this legendary story to the London stage by Great Britain's Lionel Bart. His fascinating musical success followed New York and the world. The film was taken in England in the summer of 1967 and was later released in 1968. Sets and musical numbers are mindless. The song "Who Will Buy?" Hundreds of actors and British filmmakers really deserve to correctly correct his Oscar. Some Canadian and American talents are part of this amazing production, but mostly tribute to the fine craftsmanship of British film studios such as Shepperton. Good performance! Elstree, Bourmwood Wood, Bray, Denham and other film studios in Ealing also funded many of the films in the world.
