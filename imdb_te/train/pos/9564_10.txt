<br /> <br /> Mix a breathtaking cinematography with amazing performance and gripping plot and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The dog bite dog in the movie, holding the edge of my seat and being horrified in others, drowned in my tears. <br /> <br /> This film has made me very deep. It is contrasting with the shocking and tender 'love' scenes of surprisingly violent scenes. The film is incompatible with its Cat III (nudity) rating; There are no nude scenes, and there are no 'kisses' kisses or 'make' scenes. <br /> <br /> The message I received from this film? All human beings may seem to be either violent or cruel, but with a mild side. Edison Chen is doing a brilliant job in the murder of Pong. <br /> I am rating this film 10/10. It must be seen.
