This story is perhaps one of the most powerful ones I have ever taken. John Singleton certainly went above and beyond when mixing this single masterpiece. <br /> However, as a college student, many of the actors, Epipus and Rapport became the best, despite having a number of problems with Singleton. Serious. In a sense, when they are in trouble with many college campuses, they will not be displayed or displayed publicly as they believe in the film. In some cases, it seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually happen. However, even if it is a bit more dramatic, the film is fantastic and I am surprised, unable to speak, just think. I'll always remember things from this film, a quote from Laurence Fishburn's character, "Knowledge without knowledge, you can not see your power." Gorgeous, just clever.
