A country-boy Aussie-Rules player (Matt) goes to the night, before the most important AFL trial match he wants with his cousin. <br /> <br /> He has combined the drug deal with a local brokerage-shark / drug dealer short for a fast-stay (which is like a gangster but somewhat strictly Australian). Needless to say, Matt is confused in the mess, and it is not long before his mind shunted backwards as tomorrow's match-insights unfold the night's insane events. <br /> <br /> Achieved Western Australian professional Shakespearean actor Toby Malone is at the Sterling show as the youngest country-boy mate and has performed well over his age. John Bachelor was short, and was one of entertaining events by David Ngongbujara. Roll is fast, often funny, and an hour's most valuable use.
