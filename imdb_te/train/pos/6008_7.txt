When the film first saw the film in the early 1970s, I was in awe of this film. Visually amazing and the events in the European and the United States are associated with trying to look at Antonio in the last 15 minutes of the event: "tyrannical" companies and big business interests in your mind. In the middle of a desert, the main female feminine experience of a natural home stream, a plane painter in psychedelic design (also made fixed British Airways a few years ago) has been copied by world-wide campaigners for decades. Pink Floyd also raised their fans after the film's release. <br /> You can see this movie 30 years later. Today the establishment contains more material for anti-fiction films - playful facts, documentation, fine performances, and excellent screenplay. Antonio is out of date; A flawed intellect. <br /> <br /> He also gives the same feeling of Antonion's "Blow Up". <br /> <br /> "Zabriski Point" will need to be analyzed when it is released. This is a great movie if you watch it on a wide panavision screen against a lot of TV screens. The visual and aurul (Mick Jagger, Kith Richards, Pink Floyd, etc.) is still the attraction of the film. The main couple are not great actors but they are beautiful and natural. One of them (Mark Freakt) died in jail in the United States, and in this film he expanded the reality of values ​​that did not change personality. <br /> <br /> Antonio comes from "synchronization". But watch carefully and mute sounds of ordinary actors make you appreciate - Rod Taylor, G.D. Ladies in Spreading, Swimming Pool, Cops in the Air Strip. Real noises but conformists differently. Antonioni was related to 30 years ago, but his understanding of the medium is not yet questioned. He knows what he's doing.
