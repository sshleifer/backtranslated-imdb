The film is not about a school shooting, it's never actually seen. But it adds to the film. People about it and how they deal with tragedy. I showed students who were out of Columbine shooting and gave me a sense of closing them too. Acting is amazing. Three major actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are great in their roles ... I recommend this movie to anyone. This is one of the movies you talk about when talking about it. This initiated school fires, debates about human emotions and reactions to all tragedies. It's a tear jerk but it is well worth it and I'll see it again and again
