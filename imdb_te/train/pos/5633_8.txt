Farah Fouet is amazing in this powerful 1986 drama, where she plays Marjorie, a woman who manages to escape from the clutches of a victim. <br /> <br /> When she arrives at home with her rapist Joe (who plays the role of scary James Russo), she has to play with two of her roommates (Outside Out!), Marjorie Joe's frightening demands. <br /> When her roommates come home, they show a great deal by Marjorie's actions (at the lowest possible) and Alfrey Woodward, disappointing Marjorie <br /> <br /> I found Diana Scarridi very frustrated, but Joe He finally admits that he has come to kill them all. <br /> <br /> Overall, the Extertis is a wonderfully thoughtful and well-featured movie.
