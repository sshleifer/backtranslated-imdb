If you're a fan of Altman's big collective fans, if you're clearly visible in big films like the lowest films like M.A.S.H., Nashville, Gosford Park, and a Wedding, then you'll be entertained by Halthee. The two women are concentrated in the Health Convention for the Presidency, many of the regular regulations, such as Paul Daly in the 70s of Altman, Carol Starr, and Gernda Jackson, starring Caroline Burnett and Henry Gibson, Lauren Bacall. There are many episodes in the film like most Altman collectible films, but it is not nearly as impressive as Nashville or A Wedding, which is MASH. Or Gasford Park. The whole thing is a clear satire of health movement filled with over-the-top, extravagant, ironic characters, with a wrying commentary on the whole thing with guest actors like Dick Cavett. Altman's characteristic pessimism about the politics and public appeal of the entire electoral process, but most people are very impressed with the film. This will be one of Ultiman's last films like this for a while!
