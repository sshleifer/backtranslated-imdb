I do not bother to watch this movie in theaters, but remember that I have heard over and over. In the end I saw this week. For some reason I look forward to seeing that I'm not very good, so I'm totally amazed, sitting with it and stuck with it and I have found myself totally retiring. I read a lot of other user comments and talk about her fight in the ring how many people impressed me, but what is wonderful about Diana is that she is a real fighter in her life. What she needs to do is find her where she is and where the ring helps her. Very amazing story and I was surprised for the first time for Michel Rodriguez - her amazing work. Adrian and her coach are also very good. <br /> <br /> This film is a little bit tight around the edges, but it does not matter slightly. The story, determination and performances have totally overcome any errors (however it comes with indie filmmaking). Find her and succeed in her circumstances and a K.O. For Michel Rodriguez!
