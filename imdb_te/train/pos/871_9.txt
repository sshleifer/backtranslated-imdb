My Lies or READ My Lips examines the 'external' lives, and the people living on the edge of our vision to deal with the 'fit' requirement. <br /> <br /> Karla (Emmanuelle Deoos) makes some important comments about the period, which has created a long, thoroughly entertaining little thriller. A plain Jane, mostly deaf, an unnoticed secretary for a company, is one of thirty social and sexual assaults and does not cool down its perspective in the future. Paul (Vincent Cassell) reacts to a recent statement by Carla's assistant and a recent release of ex-canyon peerless. At the first meeting there was a mutual physical repulsion: Carla was a coarse, unkempt sleazy guy who was hoping for a well-groomed, sensitive person who was able to fulfill her fantasies and not impressed by a clerk. When Paul stopped the job by stealing a letter that cost his work, their feelings quickly changed and Paul Karla's lip was able to read that he sees his way to spy out his previous offenders who threaten his life. So the team entered this odd couple troops and entered the principle filled with dangerous suspense to get Paul's safety and independence together. These chance characters fulfilling the roles in their lives to fill the chinks in their walls alone in surprising ways are full of turns and edge of each seat suspense. <br /> Devos and Cassel Bravura performances and the rest of the cast is uniformly strong. Once again, Alexander Desplot built a musical score that increases tension and cinematographer Matthew Widdipid, all the right lighting and angles to represent the characters and the hitchcockian concept of suspense. The director Orchard cleverly manipulates a sensitive and transcendental factor to the story: he shows the difference between the world's hearing and the hearing of the world without hearing, and by doing so has some powerful social comments. This is the best film in the best of French cinematic style. Recommended. Grady Harp
