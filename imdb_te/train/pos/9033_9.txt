I have seen this film without knowing anything about it and found them similar to Billy Elliot (2000). Two pictures have a troubled father / son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow the mines and dreams of a better life from their father's town. Two sons ridicule their fellow students and both have a strong female role model who teaches them. <br /> <br /> The main difference I found between movies is the October Sky Infinite interesting and touching image. Laura Dern puts on a moving show and Chris Cooper has performed well in the American Beauty (1999), so he drives the father who refuses. Joan Johnston surprised me with his subtle direction, different from his other directing features such as Jumaji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001).
