This animation is about very simple and straightforward versus bad plot and action. Human animations are animated by animating other animations. The females running from the left to the right seem to look beautiful, look around, and make her move well. Why not use this rhodoscopic technology? It's very effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice, in its prehistoric setting and worn by a woman who is clearly beautiful in various sexy ways, is her luxurious body that works as a pure iris. Some hates it and treat it as another Moroccan male sexual fantasy, while others (including plenty of women) admire the esthetic quality. I certainly did not care! Baci can only be seen in the cool world, Lashkalar loves to animate the luxurious children, and I do not think he should be able to prosecute himself from an adult for a lot of animation. <br /> This is a distinct, very different from standard Disney or anime fare, and for this reason the watch value is probably the best of Bakshi. For those who love animations with luck women: try adventure adventure cobra too. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
