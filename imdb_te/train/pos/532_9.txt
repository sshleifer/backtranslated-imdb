Lovely, romantic, innovative and funny. The focus of this outstanding film is almost unparalleled, beyond the well-known "love love" as Ghost. We know that at the end of those tall stairs at the end of Peter and the end of June we find the ultimate enjoyment, that joy is on the go. The moral of the story is, of course, timeless: all of love achievements. But in the struggle to win that victory is played in the celestial arena of sweeping vision and celestial glory. The Extras of more than 500 attacks depicting various ages and cultures, the directors 'paradise' s appearance is memorable after six decades, most of the CGI era. <br /> <br /> For all the cosmic progression, Powell and Pressburger know that one important fact: The best story is told at a small scale. The fantastic, positive romantic aspect of "Stairway" is bound up with the ultimate simplicity: June's tarrope is preserved in a rose petal. <br /> <br /> The story and the set is one of the ages for the ages.
