The DVD for "Danaja Makabra" (the Castle of Blood) is very odd. Parts of the film are in French with subtitles and the rest are translated from French to English. Sometimes, the characters have switched between two in the middle of the scene! When I try to get the movie subtitle or just dubbing, it does not make any difference! <br /> <br /> The story is supposed to be based on a po story. In fact, Poe's character appears at the beginning and end of the film-even though it does not appear to be exclusive. <br /> <br /> A wealthy person can not stay in his home in a manner over his luck. It's like a simple bet to win - even though the house is very cool. However, the great man tells us that the borrower had died in the past - and still wants to do this fool! While at home, he meets barbara steel inside and gets mad for her. However, later, she finds herself dead for more than a decade! How will it be? I can tell you more about the plot but I do not want to spoil any suspense. <br /> <br /> The film gets a lot more marks to create a creepy atmosphere. Home, black & white cinematography and music work together for a scary movie. For the plot, it's interesting - especially there are many turns and turns - and you are very surprised at who's ultimately dead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm worried about the poor snake. <br /> Moreover, parents want to know that there is nudity at the end. It looks like a wonderful beautiful woman, but it is rarely necessary for the plot.
