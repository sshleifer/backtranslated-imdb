I did not expect much from this, but I have to admit that I am going to laugh a few times in this film. If you're not confusing in the first ten minutes, it might be an image for you. Ditto if you are kind of watching Amanda Pete Shuffle cards for an hour and a half. This is definitely not a memorable task of comedy, but this is a master who has given low budget indie genes. To summarize the playing field for comparison, cut through studio films with 100 or more factors, and see what you will see! Kudos to Peter Cohen and his network through this. I'm looking forward to his next attempt.
