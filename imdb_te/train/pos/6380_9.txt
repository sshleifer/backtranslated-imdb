Atlantis: The Last Empire is a better picture than I thought. I never thought this film would lead to my expectations. True, the film started slowly, but when I was wearing the film my desire increased further. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a man named Milo. Milo believes in fictional Atlantis. Along with his grandfather friends, he embarks on his own amazing adventure. Also, he must be beyond friendship, betrayal, trust and more. The voice cast is good. They only know how to bring movies with their voice talent. Whatever the case is unique but unlikely. Animation is not the best, but still nice enough. Overall, this is a good family picture for all ages. I rate this movie 9/10.
