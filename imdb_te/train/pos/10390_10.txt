This is one of the greatest fantasy films ever made, next to "Star Wars" and "The Wizard of Oz". It's not as real shame as former films (perhaps it sticks to stories based on contemporary or sci-fi settings, and it's a small market for the British's, movies) but its amazing <br /> , May be a child, an adult or a teenager to enjoy this movie (now I am 18 years old), but one First, thanks to the classic films. I absolutely adore this film. It is the fastest but not the fastest, the use of beautiful sets, dialogue and color (both sets and cinematography rival Miles Rossoa (perhaps my favorite classic film score) is Oscar winner), and state of the art Oscar The special effects of the winner (for the time, and some are still amazing). <br /> <br /> "The favorite movie of the time (next to" Robin Hood Adventures ") and it really deserves more attention. <br /> <br / > This is a real adventure of robots along with Robin Hood, my desert island movie, which can be seen again and again without irritation. <br /> Stars: **** Excellent)
