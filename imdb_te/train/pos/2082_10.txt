I was able to read the wonderful novel of Pearl S Buck in my ninth grade history, and I enjoyed every exciting page in it. <br /> <br /> Some of the subjects accept: There is no question that was broadcast in Asia in 1937. Actors in the main Hollywood film <br /> <br /> With this kind of barrier, executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin (among others) took trouble to pick an amazing and stellar cast hand-pick. Paul Muni plays Wong Lang. Muni is at the peak of his powers as an actor during this period, and he does not like his mind. <br /> <br /> When you spend time with makeup (it's good, but no one really wants to make a mistake for the Chinese man), his performance has all the vermicilite of his best work. <br /> Then is Louis Rainier. Owen's plum role was given to her despite the lack of her experience in Hollywood, as the actor of the Vienna actress grew up with her last year's Oscar winning for her performance in a tremendous jaighedge. Her performance was the second consecutive Oscars, the first time in history. <br /> <br /> Rainer's performance has been criticized, and her success is here. She is called wood and a note. There is a small grain in that respect. However, it is said, you have to go back to all the book you need to do. For Roxer, the book played the role of O'Lan, though she was not written Chinese; It's actually a fantastic performance, and I've seen one of the best transitions from the book to the screen. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the cast, it is MGM. <br /> <br /> In Hollywood they had a large list of stars and character actors at the time, and had a big budget to pay for the best best, ultimately they were the best. <br /> <br /> The film makes Wang Lung's marriage soft. O-Lawn Somewhat. In the novel, the wealth of meat comes with wealth, and he takes a mistress, destroys his wife, but her feelings are not merely a woman. In the film, Wonglong returned to his wife, and two pearls he had taken from his earlier years had long been known to be her true love. <br /> Carney, yes. But it's Hollywood. If they observe the obstacles that are against it, the laughter of the movie may be open. But despite the dangers of real Asians in the cast, the film is surprisingly well worn with the passage of the seventy three years. In fact, the most interesting thing about this film is that it is a disaster.
