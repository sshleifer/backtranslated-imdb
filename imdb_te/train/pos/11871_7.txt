Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, the film does not paint the picture easily without forgetting. Al Pacino, Tony Montana, is a cuban refugee in the pharmaceutical world, rather than a powerful player in Florida when he runs a criminal state of his self-governing state. This gangster movie must be a tough, violent, loud, gross, unpleasant and a "f - k" record repeatedly. Almost three hours, and yes it can get repulsive. <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Logia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrotonio, F. Murray Abraham, Angel Salahar. Pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation. He will give up a strong stamp and bring reality to his role. It's not a movie that leaves everyone thinking of going out of a catastrophe. Is it strong enough for you? Crime does not pay for long!
