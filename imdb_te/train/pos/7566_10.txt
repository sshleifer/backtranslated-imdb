The name of the young lady Bonnie (Pole). She is attractive, apparently spends a good life, but suddenly she gets rid of her home and life through her house dude and the Various and Sandwall Evil Helchmen. Now she does not know what is happening in hell, a group of armed forces clearly wants her to die ... and why she would die? </ P> God, I hear whining all the time. Now that content is very cheap for the product and people can create their own movies / books / comics / internal organs, there is no one to confirm that quality is quality! We drown in the trash! In fact people think that these people can not see any movies or have not read any book recently - we're already floating a dead person in a dead person. It's a folks like Ferrari and Rodriguez who are lying to So-and-Soos for these innocent people, throwing $ 8K on the table and making it ... well, I say that you have a better action film than anything you've ever seen in the film ... seen. I've seen the box office. You are staying away in droves. <br /> <br /> It is good to snap a copy, get twenty minutes in fun and get in your life. <br /> This is the perfect entertainment. You made an entry as Bonnie, with most questions and the whole thing will end. The whole perspective is preceded in many ways but is not the time and such compressive amounts of such a captured tasty gun. You're there for the weather, the mystery and the guns. That's all - all filmmakers are promising, and they deliver. <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to think about making such a budget in my heart black gloves. We have passed a good number of indie films around here, but we rarely see this shorter polishing, and we have never seen a good looking action. Hell, you can assign MI to these two guys: 3 and it draws me to see me. Bond franchise. Hell, anything. No, of course, better yet: I want to see these guys make a feature on their own and stay away from Hollywood to hell. <br /> We have seen the best indie we have seen and the most effective indie calling card we have ever seen. The DVD's $ 20 and donkey features bonus features. Take your movie ticket budget and put it next to this.
