I really enjoyed the pilot, and it's amazing that I hoped it would be better. Patrick Warburton was a riot, and initially I thought he would not be able to defend his role. Him and Megyn price have little chemistry at all, but hopefully they will get more comfortable around each other as the season goes on. It must be unreal to be Megan's star to be his last appearance ["grounded for life"]. <br /> <br /> Bianca Cazlich and Oliver Hudson are really new to the entire sitcom scene, but I'll get better in time. My wonder is David Spade's character, not the overall vision of this pilot. The way he gives his lines is quite different from what I have ever seen on TV, but I think it's his style. <br /> <br /> I feel that I'm not sure about couples, or singles, all doubts and conflicts and about this decision and your decisions. <br /> <br /> I think CBS has given them opportunity for all actors. If only this opportunity and time is given, this program will be one of the best sequences.
