Fred Guineau, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar, and Yvonne de Carlo Star in this funny, funny movie. In the end, Fred Gwynne was truly great as Hamman Munster, grandfather Lily (Yavne de Carlo) and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is as happy as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. Both Hermann and Grandpa's wax figures blame the town for both. Both have to delete their names before they are too late. You'll laugh out loud as I did.
