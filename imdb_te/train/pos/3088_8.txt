Unfortunately for me - I stumbled on this program at the end of this lifetime. Before I was canceled by ABC, I caught some episodes (about three). I loved the characters, and the storyline - but not all of the great actors! I'm a fan of Sex and the City, two characters I found (Bridge Moyannan & The Tractor "Smith Jared"), as well as Jay Hernandez (from Carlito's Way: Power to Rice) and Erica Christensen (Swimphon). I felt young actors enjoy watching their cause, and felt that this show would further span their career. I hope this should get put back on the DVD at least, and maybe WB will pick it up for a second season? In the meantime, I see this from the beginning of the ABC website.
