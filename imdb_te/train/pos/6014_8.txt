<br /> <br /> There are reviews on how the ZP does not have any place, the act is wood, the dancing scene does not mean anything, the main point misses all. <br /> Be honest. It was produced in Los Angeles in the late 1960s and early 1970s. <br /> You can see H-I-G-H in your mind while on some psychedelic substance. <br /> <br /> Find some kind of buds, smoke or get a light hit of acid. Seriously, this simple and ingenious reviews of ZP miss the point. <br /> When you look at the big screen of the movie (I see the fortune done three times in the 1990s) <br /> <br /> If you want to see you drink, you can at least congratulate the end of the trash. Soundtrack "Beware With That Ax, Eugen," "Come In Number 51, Your Time Up."
