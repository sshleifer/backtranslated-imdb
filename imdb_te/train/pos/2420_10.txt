If you enjoy the subtle (yes, I am obscure) actions and the reactions of John Candy, you can not like this movie (pronounced "solime" by Salvatore Depsquall). A big buffoon - unobservant (and unknowingly) watcher always saw Candy as a wider actor. And sometimes he ("see strips" and "splash"). But, when possible, he is really razor-sharp and very subtle. It's very painful, he has cast in many roles that he has shown on his wider side because we can not see anyone else. Oh, yes, the picture. You can see "I'm going" with a frequency of a "cassashock". It's fine. The plot, though slightly twisted, is really deep for this kind of scorching. It's the candy and always under-ray joe flaherty and the eugene levy lets you make the candy bounce off ... and they bounce hard. Exactly worth SCTV or any other work of candy is worth a glance at anyone.
