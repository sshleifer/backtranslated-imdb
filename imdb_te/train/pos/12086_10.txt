A wonderful family drama / humor featuring McColline and Garya, every time I see it, it warms and warms. Grannies are good for up to 9 years of age for all ages. Summary period is summarized in 1962. Gaur, her two children and aunt Jane (MacLain), who are struggling in this story, face this home without head. In the late 1940s, Gerrer went for a run, "family" headed to take over the long unforgettable cousin who left the side of the Rackshackle Road side. Good but decent as a determined mother gets the gear, the restoration of the cafe and the whole family into the opening. But wait ...... Aunt Genie is an old circus performer who has a jesser sense of card tricks, magic powders and humor ..... she loves to get kids and her crazy and sometimes dangerous games ... Cube missile crises (realistic events From standard TV news) and a "miracle at the Lord's" together with a "ghost" prank full of hands A happy combination. The film enters, philosophers, questionable and the intimidating alert compilation of the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. In the end there is one of the miracles of faith, family and the love invented. Oh, and the music from the early 60's was great! <br /> <br /> Filmmaker is a regular film
