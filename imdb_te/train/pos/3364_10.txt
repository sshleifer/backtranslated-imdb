<br /> <br /> I am very surprised that a lot of people have voted on this film, and I'm surprised to write something about it, but my comments are similar to those already written. Image. Fantastic acting between Mastrarine & Lorraine. As the film describes: Slow humanity and love between these two outsiders grew and Fascist Radio Announcer's continued continuous inhumane movement pace (dealing with Maestroian's colleague) and followers "and coming from the show". This is a good image for me to be human. Some argue that anti-fascist "message" is clearly distributed, but I do not want to kill the film anyway. My vote is 10/10.
