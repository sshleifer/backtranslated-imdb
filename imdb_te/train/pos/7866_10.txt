<br /> <br /> Madhavi (Konkana Sen) enters the house of her boyfriend and is empty. She looks here and there and then goes into her bedroom and you get the picture - Ah! Another girl ?? Two-timing Baddie and yes indeed he was his two timing but this time was a GUY. <br /> <br /> When you look at how this film is, oh my friend, you are not a spoiler, but I do not want to give it a chance. It just answered the revelation of P3 people. I thought it was a superhit picture of illness. When I went to the theater, I took pen and paper to write bad things about the movie "But I was completely wrong, and that's why I only did not get enough of things.It's great, not a great story, it's not a criminal and non-commercial film like the protagonist, Because wit and screenplay in the screenplay If you give birth to a bad image, how can you handle a brilliant film that has a dumb and superhit movie? /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma is kind and she has a role to play when she is born to play the role of one of the most beautiful actresses I've ever seen, Not only is good, Sandha Moradull, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni, especially the screen   కాల్పులు జరిపే సంధ్య మొర్దుల్. (మరియు అసాధారణంగా చెప్పాలంటే తార శర్మ సాధారణంగా మాట్లాడబడుతుందో ఊహించండి) <br /> <br /> చలనచిత్ర పరిశ్రమలో ఎలుగైన హుష్-హుష్ సెలెబ్రిటీల యొక్క కొన్ని వెర్రి పాత పార్టీలతో సినిమాలు తెరకెక్కించాయి మరియు ఇది ఏమిటో చిత్రం గురించి ఉంటుంది. And for half an hour through the picture you just feel the same. But the film gets pace and gets to the good hero and it will go forever. Will Boman Irani accept that statement ?? 'This is a good story, Mathivi'. (Thank you). The great thing is that these people are so stupid in style and can not complete it, solve social problems and do not boring them. Finally, it tells us all its roller-coaster ride and maddy are just laughing at all these people. The reason why I love watching movies. Ecstatic film-making. The screenplay is beautiful, intelligent and witty.
