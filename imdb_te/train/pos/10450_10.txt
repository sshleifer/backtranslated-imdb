This is a fantastic movie about two cute human beings, one that is attracted to each other, and one that is attractive to both innocent and virgin, as I thought I was scanning TV channels. Ethan Hawk (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 TV series (Nicole). This gas and guy are warm and very warm to your heart and soul and you think deeply into your past relationships and you really wish you deep track down the tracks over the years and wish following a string of your hearts or a string of hearts. Jesse and Celine have a great conversation, with deep-eyed relationships with a great magnetic blast between them. I look forward to this sequel in 2004 and if you see this movie, you feel the same way.
