What is "Cry Freedom"? It's just a great and unique experience for making South Africa and blacking blacks in the country. The main character of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), chief editor of the newspaper Daily Dispatch in South Africa. Woods writes several articles, where he criticizes the views of Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Woods will soon meet Bicco and change his view of him and begins to understand what the blacks in South Africa are doing (from the top to the right from the police chief). When Biko dies in police custody, Woods decides to write a book about himself and decides to publish it. <br /> <br />] Woods has to escape from his country to publish the book and he needs to keep his family in second place, so the world can be realized. <br /> <br /> Attenborough was able to make a good movie about the people, the main message is black and white, as we all cause people. The story leads us to South Africa and this world is a great way to find out what happened in the land and I only rated it with 3200 people. We can learn something from this film. Although it was a bit long, the story was not presented in any short way, because the director wanted us to see how hard Woods was to get the book published after Biodo's death. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Woods and Bikos also has been shown to be great for families of those two people and all the problems that they face. But sometimes sacrifices must be made (Bika's death), so the truth (Woods book) is available.
