I watched very little from the movie, and just watched a quiet hourly pass - but it turned out for an hour. Big-city-making-good-country-boy-lost-of-what-most-intense short story, it's funny throughout, the roles are fascinating and the pace is a fantastic if the roll is an amazing </> <br /> Toby Malone is his lovely shoot With the real star of the movie, the country boy and local Aussie Rules football hero said that the big city came to the big city to try for one of the big teams. He is a local pirate's smallest supporter of John Batcherler. Look for these two. <br /> Very recommend.
