Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80s. It is a movie that is breathtaking by the excellent acting and very interesting direction touch. In japanif√©, both European and American film lovers are interrelated. Screenplay is filled with very compelling and beautiful characters. Ed Harris is giving one of the greatest performances to date. He played his alcoholic drink in each line, feeling his broken heart in each line. Robert De Niro once again thinks of us as one of the greatest actors of all time in simplistic but very realistic performances in his career. Jack Fife did not get boring because it clearly showed its leaders the distinctive character of the distinctive Hollywood character. No one is hero after the war. Everyone is losing, the film is about the general truth. Like the heroes of this film, you can not do anything after the war. Jack Fife is about soul diseases that create war. That's just amazing picture.
