About 15 years after I stopped airing, I love this show, but I love this presentation. I do not know why, but I'm happy watching it. I love Adam the best. The only place I found to buy seasons on DVD was in Germany, and it was just the first two seasons. It's frustrating, but it's OK. I'll be watching online. If anyone on the 14th seasons is available for a second time, please email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already have the first one. DVDs from Germany only down side, they only play on my portable DVD player and my computer. Oh! Good. I still own it!
