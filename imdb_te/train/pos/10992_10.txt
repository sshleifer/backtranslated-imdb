Damn, I saw this film at least 4 times and I'm still bored. <br /> <br /> Visuals are very good and are in harmony with the perfectly suited music. <br /> <br /> CGIs are very bad IMHO, but the black and white concept about it and totally clean interiors are just the whole visuals ... just a genius perfect for such a movie. <br /> <br /> However, this film has very few errors, e.g. <br /> <br /> I thought the film was a bit "slow", but I could not understand those beautiful parts, and I totally loved that person. <br /> <br /> I am quite distracted by the entirely complicated story, this conversation with the person down here where he's saved all their data, while in the subject of the underground glue of the digikoff, : D and the end must be displayed something may be emphasized, they are back and back-true-memory portion for a while and "loud" Yagaligaru, but again this was not without flaws, the film is very good, will not be watching again and again. .
