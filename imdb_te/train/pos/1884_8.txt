This is one of my favorite comedies. It does not like to forgive the hero's destructive lifestyle, but it is valuable that drinking is not good, the movie is fun. It tells the unlikely story of a 40-year-old bachelor who is continuously drunk with the title of Arthur, who inherits a vast wealth, but only thinks he wants to do something if he is married to Susan. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the most fascinating drinker in the world. However, I agree with Moore Arthur who can not imagine any other actor in the role. The ladies of this song are well shot. Linda Minnelly is the Linda sparkles, and her moor is the greatest of the screen chemistry. Jill Clayborough Susan, a wealthy and more suitable woman for Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, the film is literally made by Sir John Gielgood, who portrayed Arthur's satirical but moral butler, Hobson. Both of these have a great mutual interest in Hobson's long-term employment. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and guardian of disqualification and advice. The most interesting relationship in the film is not Arthur's romance, but his exceptional perception of this exceptional and of course the denial of the servant. It's the butler that you'll remember well after the end credits roll.
