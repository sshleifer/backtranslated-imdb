OK, this film starts out as a cheesy Life Time movie and is not well up to the picture well. The script 'Cheese' and 'Flush' are not complete and will not be directed to most part of the cast. My girl was stuck on my nerves for the first half of the film. I do not think this is one of her best acting jobs. The only reason I bought this was because it sold it and Ellen Berstein was in it. She is amazing but it is not one of her best acting venues. The story is based on real events and it helps the movie. Actually, I do not like the film at first and I'm getting embarrassed when I see the balloons traveling stills, suppose where I want to get it and finish it with! But when it reaches the field everything will be forgiven and the story comes close. If it does not bring tears to your eye, nothing is there! It's cheesy and imaginative, but it makes you feel good about the world.
