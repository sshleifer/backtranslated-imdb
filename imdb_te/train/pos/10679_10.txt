The man about the house is the real situation comedy in every aspect of the word. The comedy film Robin Tripp (the character played by Rich Richard O'Sullivan), found himself after a forest party and ended up at two ladies' home, called Joe and Chrissy. Ironically the party has been saying goodbye to their old flatmate. <br /> <br /> The man is a special cooker for man Cook and Mortimer's Show George and Mildred, which features two characters Joe, Chrissy and Robin. The two characters are actually Mildred (the late and most missed Judez), making the man's lichippenes about the house, especially taking some of the best lines of the series. A semi-regulatory character Larry (Doug Fisher) was a disadvantage, as he always waited and he wanted to take something (and never again). A version is called a three company but this does not stand a chance as compared to this distant originality. Thames has taken a risk of producing comedy about most people who share flat with 2 women at the time of Conservative, but at the time the ratings show that about 20 million people have good old fashion bid inspired casting and sharp script. Modern comedy can not reach that high standard. <br /> This program is available on the network DVD
