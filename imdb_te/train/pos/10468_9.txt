Monstervision I grew up. Hosting with Joe Bob Briggs, the same host from the late night Pen and Tellers. This event retained me on Friday nights in my high school years and gave me some memorable memoirs to drive outside. <br /> <br /> Without doubt, the best night is always television. If you do not, you are missing. <br /> <br /> I know John Bloom and Joe Bob are live, but I wish they were back to where they were ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... Is anyone sitting at 4 hours "swarm" and sitting? <br /> <br /> Long live Monstervision!
