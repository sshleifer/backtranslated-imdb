"Sam Mum Himmlen" is perhaps one of the 3 most beautiful films I've seen in my life. It did not win the Oscar, I did not tear the tears. The film is in a kind of class, the Oscar win will probably be taken away from it !!! My dear friend Anders (Nieberg), you have done a real miracle here with your pen! Kai Polak, with your creativity and support to all of you have given love to all of our world. When you enter this world of our world, it's exit - you can really say you did it well! A special personal thank you from all my soul, You brought back some valuable memories from the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my little mind and present Beingness was created by many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. Thank you all for my blessings. Love and Light, George-Gabriel Berkovitz Solahheler, Johannesburg, South Africa
