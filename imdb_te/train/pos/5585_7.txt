This is a talkie, but the dialogue is very limited and is in German. <br /> <br /> <br /> Hayder Lamarr (17) Hedema Lamarr is an obsessive (stereotype) with a loving marriage, and her father returns home to Germany. <br /> <br /> In a famous and funny scene, she is bathing when she is separated from another one morning with a horse bath. After she leaves her dress in a horse race, she has to go to the chase she chases. <br /> <br /> They sit for a while, in a jen moment, sitting on top and giving her a flower with bees. She is thinking of her honeymoon and her husband and an insect. <br /> When she returns home and looks for our young companion, she finds the rejected reality. You can use your imagination here, but his head will disappear from the sight and see that she gushes with pleasure. You can imagine, since he is not exactly dressed up ... sure, a gesture for women by director Gustav Machha, and a shock for the 1933 audience. <br /> <br /> This beautifully painted movie is the only high guilt of Mars, and a strange ending.
