60 seconds / (2000) *** (four) <br /> "Gone in 60 seconds" is a powerful, soft, with high octane star power and awesome looking automobiles. If you view this product by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock"), your eyes on your cars are attractive to cars. Although the film masks weakness in most places, its definite feeling and enthusiasm will become a moderately successful summer thrill ride. <br /> <br /> Film Giovanni RBC ("Mode Squad") is named after Young Crook Kip Rhys, when the movie is opened, the powerful Criminal Raymond Caliree (Christopher Ecclestone) can not deliver a long list of expensive cars. His brother, Randall called "Memphis" Reyns (Nicholas Cage), a retired talented car thief, in order to complete a job instead of his brother's survival: make fifty fifty cars model, color, year, and four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis sent for the first three days of his bandits bandits. Murphy's previous business, Mirror Man (TJ Cross), aging and brilliant Otto Hollywood (Robert Duvall), and Sarah "Sway" Wyland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy yet gyff retired car cheater. Atle Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott), and Danny Austrick (Chi McBride). <br /> <br /> Memphis and his crew contributed to the drive and tension of the subplot film with two police detectives suspected of previous experience, Roland Candlel (Delroy Lindo) and Drycroft (Timothy Olifant). <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development; The audience will be able to learn about these films despite their harsh lifestyle and imagine hard personalities through hard core and stylish weather. To make matters worse in the film, the dialog characters are characterized by a strict cultural sound. I do not think that the thrillers need profanity and obscenity. I honored the director's decision to keep it from serious foul language in a film that was very inefficient in an R-rating. Nevertheless, I believe in the film "Gone in 60 Seconds", that the dialogue is reliable and authentic, for the development of the character's enlightenment. <br /> <br /> Despite problems, the characters work effectively because of the top notch and are responsible for full cast. Nicholas Cage's dramatic performance is serious and convincing. Angelina Jolie's worst performance here is complete. Delroy Lindo is very tight and believable. <br /> <br /> With a satisfactory first act of describing the motifs of the motion picture and character, the film has a standard structure, produces a faster, faster action, but does not introduce a depth and strong character. In the second step we are facing some problems: most of this section casts the story, which can not really be built for the third action. There is a lot of time in the middle of the cinema, and a sex scene offers a solid middle plot, a whole lot more. The third law is a very large angry rush that has one of the most serious car-chase scenes ever very angry from the wall-wall excitement and ever-shot. <br /> <br /> "Gone in 60 Seconds" Soundtrack is a great contribution to deal with inspirational action scenes. It does work with this film despite many destructive flaws such as car chases. Directed by Dominic Sena, the commercials directing have a very attractive style and a decisive attitude to granting audience with two hours of thrills, thrills and enthusiasm in "Throat in 60 Seconds". <br /> <br /> <br />
