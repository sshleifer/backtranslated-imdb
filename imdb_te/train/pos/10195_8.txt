Joe Don Baker is almost always one of the more promising actors than his material, almost always appreciated. He is a big or a hero in a ton of films, and Wallace Bierre has a strong, glorious presence in the half century before him. Baker may sound laughing at the sound coming from another actor and is great about him. He's really no cliche, clear or silly, which he puts in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud, seems to understand what he does. It's what the Walking Toll trio is doing well, and the same magic is here in Final Justice. It achieved considerable success in theater and 80s in the video, and it was more aged than most well known Action Flowers in the Age. By moving the move from Texas to Europe, there is a real timeless quality that does not stay away from you on the screen. To be honest, I have always enjoyed the pictures of Gridon Clarke, who was no nonsense director in the same vein as the 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this was his best. Final Justice, one of the lost gemstones in the late 80s, is its true grit and torture on MAN On Fire. I feel if I make this remake with rock, I'll love all of a new audience.
