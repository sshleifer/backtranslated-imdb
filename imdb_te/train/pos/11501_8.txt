I remember this presentation a little, but I remembered that it was great! My older brother reminded me of the show recently and got a statement for D.V.D. The network, again caught in pulling this from the air, so what else can they put in a different place? It must have gone at least 3 seasons. Why not? Network executives feel they are 'gods' in the entertainment world. But they are wrongly predicting and flat at a good performance placement from time to time. In fact, they have more flips than 'hits'. This is one of the poor decision cuts out of the lineup. Anyway, I'm getting this for my collection.
