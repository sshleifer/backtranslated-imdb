A fascinating performance of Will Smith and a rock guitarist mid-solo, the director's previous contribution to the "Seven Pounds" actors (the Pursuit of Happiness), is a story I tugs at your heartstrings very harder than a movie that I loved. Remember the name of Gabriel Munino because he could cross some of his films without recognizing that the actor who added to the project was not a high profile. <br /> <br /> When I first discovered Will Smith's plan, when I called for her suicide at the first scene, I had two and two scenes, Rosario Dawson's character was a desperate heart <br /> <br /> The author / director booked the books First and last scene) I still think it's right to put it, it's the source of urgency and tension. The film breaks the heart of the gradual finding of the film, the gradual finding and the relationship between Smith and Dawson characters, and in the store for both these misfortunes is knowing the back of the mind <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie Smith's character is a divine One of my friends whom I thought was a gift, and I understand why  సుకున్నాను: తన ఏడు ఎన్నికైన సమక్షంలో ఇతర సార్లు అతను కఠినమైన మరియు స్కేరీ కావచ్చు, మరియు అతను ఒంటరిగా ఉన్నప్పుడు అతను తన పరిస్థితి పూర్తి బరువు అతనిని కోసం చాలా వచ్చింది మరియు అతను పూర్తిగా విచ్ఛిన్నం. <br /> Finally, I can not tell you about the crash scene recycling, and it's been amazing in terms of cinematography, attached to the music. Put it on your list.
