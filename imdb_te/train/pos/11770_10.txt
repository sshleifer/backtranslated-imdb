I'm not good as James Bond's fan of Timothy Dalton, even though it's his 3rd bond outing, it's a smile. Belushi brought some good humor to his part and Dalton neatly hammed it, but was probably underused. Some of the good people applied to Jack Nicholson's base. It is a bit shocking to other Brit, but the patience is a smile.
