I saw a fair share of comedy and standup movies but this is very original, it's very fresh, why you wonder why you went to the right to walk in the video store. Murphy has some pretty impossibly jokes but it's just too funny to pass. Every film is funny only. It should be called "The Most Excellent Comedy's 107 Minutes", Murphy is a comic intellectual in the film, and "This Clock Doolle!" He talked about ice cream man, moms throwing the shoe, an aries, racism, and you could possibly think and could not have them could with his aunt. If you see a comedy in your life please all the films if it is delirious.
