60's are a well-balanced short range between historical facts and good plot. In four balls, we follow the North American family, with 3 members. But we do not see them. We also follow the story of many characters, such as a black devotee, an eccentric student leader and a soldier in Vietnam. Filmography is just extraordinary. In the first chapters, we see some scenes and scenes in the Vietnam War. The next chapter does not start when the last one is finished, it will begin for a while, give us a little mystery about what happened to us. Generally, the 60's mini series, not only for fans of hippies, but also for everyone with little curiosity.
