I wanted to do King Soloman's mines beautifully. My only reservation is Alison Doody. Her performance was excellent but she was not from the makeup and hair period, and she did not appear in the area adjacent to other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quartmine. It is nice to see the tough looking actor for a long time in this role, after sitting down through the movie after the film's film with fair-haired, fair-skin actors like Wall Killer, Brad Pitt. He was an excellent choice and I enjoyed every minute of this film. This version is not compatible with the Stewart Grinder with the 1950 version. It's not designed for a large screen movie and TV movie. I thought both the Qermarmines were believable but thought that two medias should be separated. I look forward to watching again and Patrick Swayze will see again this kind of characters.
