As you probably already know, Jess Franco is a fruitful person. Hayes has acted in hundreds of movies, most of them are rubbish. Nonetheless, he incorporated an occasional quality work in assembly line robbery. "Sukabas" is not his best work ("The Doubblock Doctor Z" or "Vampireros Lesbos"), but his large list has a lot of trademarks that are interested in anyone in diving. He combines romantic (alternating between full-frontal nudity and leaving somethings left to imagination) and surreal collective. It's a very spectacular picture with great weather. I especially liked the constant naming. <br /> <br /> However, "Sukabas" has many users who do not like and I can see where they come from. Its flexible speed, but I can deal with that. There is more problematic incoherency. The script is clearly moved here and I'm not sure what will happen to me within five minutes of the film (and it never really came from that point). Anyone who wants some material with their style will see elsewhere. Moreover, if its horror film, it does not turn into really scary or breathtaking. Still, I am really entertaining by all the psychedelic silliness I do not really mind all these major flaws. (7/10)
