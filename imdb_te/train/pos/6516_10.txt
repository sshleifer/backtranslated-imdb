Hello. I saw this movie 14 days before today. I was a history mentor who spent so much time on my hands. I want life. I found an excellent comparison picture to hit the mountain again. If I was white I saw a lot like Jean Luffit. Also, from my favorite line Mr.Petey in the whole movie - "This baby can shoot the eye of a chipmunk from 300 yards !!" Oh, and my favorite scene is when the British arrives and his drawer is dedicated to his work, and if the drum is to end the war, he drummer to death ... but it is not. Well, I want to say about this movie. Oh, another thing .. Bonnie Brown is Beeoch Swinging is an insane geographical bipolar mood. It's all.
