<br /> Sprayers * - My quotes are not accurate. <br /> <br /> Everyone is always sarcastic in social commentary and financial parallels - how true. But for me, I see more than this film. I love the marks of this person in a luminous white suit. The world around him is very confused and dirty, but it does not stick. <br /> "It's intelligent - what is the ratio of ink to petrol?" The only moment of defeat when you realize that his discovery has not worked after all - there is almost naked standing there. Even so, it's a "disappointing" general disappointment when being ashamed. He really scared people. <br /> <br /> "Sidney, but we also want to stop. <br /> <br />" Do you want to show any signs of pain such as betrayal? <br /> <br /> The role of Daphne is also noticeable. She is sick and tired of money and energy. She thinks she's finally in love with her father's company. For the first time, she ignores Sydney more than anyone. But that moment when he dropped his car and she would go back to see if he killed him - and yet he was thinking of the beauty of his discovery. She eventually found something worth living her for. The funny thing is that it is not even romance. It's friendship, but the title is almost matched by such ephemeral nature. <br /> <br /> When she learns that she has absolutely no inability to take care of her father, she enters into hatred and temporarily seeks. Sydney. Fortunately she really finds people living in this world more than energy, money and lust. <br /> <br /> "Thank you Sydney, if you say yes, I will hear you." <br /> <br /> "This crazy business seems to be nothing, but with the bubble, quirky beat starts and Sydney off, fits his stride tune: dunesale Where do Duffy do not really know us - but they are not really in love She was not really a scientist He helped get the fugitive and she was "a shot in the hands of hope." (Polyanna) had a nice relationship with a cont'd Billy Joel: "It's more than I expected ..." <br />
