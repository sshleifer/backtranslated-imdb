<br /> <br /> At the time, I saw movies with my girlfriend and I can not tell Ned Kelly or his story because I can say that I do not have the best time. <br /> <br /> It is very important to know whether the heroine has any blessings. <br /> If the events are true, I do not know if it is fictional. But Ned Kelly is depicted as a hero and a fighter for justice really wants me to believe in the truth. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I do not think he played a role of a Red Neck criminal or a thief. This is my opinion. <br /> <br /> It's a great Western-Heath Ledger as everybody's favorite is as good as ever and a sexy Naomi Watts looks beautiful on the screen. <br /> <br /> Give the film a chance to cast a cable. Otherwise, I do not think I can recommend it.
