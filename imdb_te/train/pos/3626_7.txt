This effort, based on the true story of high school science teacher / baseball coach, Jim Morris, is to try for pros for his players and to fulfill his life-dream dreams for excellence. Dennis Quaid, a stranger for sports films, had enough confidence to play Morris' role and the producers did a credible job of rebuilding real world events, a mourning tampa bay devil race that led to Morris shortening. The first half of the film dealing with the rag tag bunch of high school baseball players (see the oldest to be original in the high school) is less efficient and maybe a little longer. Overall, this film faces some of the fastest problems and we can probably do some extra subplots. Nevertheless, it is still a movie with an emotional plot, which is once again a national entertainer for a reason known as baseball. GRADE: B-
