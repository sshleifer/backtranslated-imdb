I will never forget the events that run up to this film or to Jonestown in Guyana. It's very tragic but needs to say. Powers Boothe Leader Rev. From Opacity to Total Madness Give Jim Jones a commanding performance. If it is released in cinemas, he can win an Academy Award. It is kind of small series you do not forget. You will not forget the images of cruelty, control and innocence of that protagonist's cult. His growth and the threat from the fall and the outside to destroy what he considered as a paradise. Mass suicides Many people (900+) are terrifying of anyone who has blocked the will or jones orders. We do not make such small sequences until we open up the mouth to find out what happened to others.
