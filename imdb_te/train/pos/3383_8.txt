Especially during the filming of science fiction (1973), which is an outstanding sight of everyone's faulty future. Many people, and nothing does not work. People living in wealth are only great. It was set up in New York in 2022 (I think), and this reminds Calcutta your worst vision. <br /> <br /> When I saw Orson Wells touch of Evil, I recognized Charles Heston's performance. He is able to portray heroic or partial-heroic people (perhaps). Here, he is cracked because he is a very corrupt person (who takes rare food from the richest), and is completely corrupt (active, forgiving). <br /> <br /> The film is overnight, and everyone is sweating, except one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Even though I did not see it before, I know the famous ending (it is not revealed here), but the end is definitely foreshadowed. <br /> <br /> The great scenes with Edward G. Robinson: The Council (with big voices with elderly Jews, so it appears), where truth is revealed. <br /> <br /> The gritty, pre-Star Wars dystopia sci-fi.
