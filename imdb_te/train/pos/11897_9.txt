It's a small little horror movie that really appreciates indie film fans. It has good acting, gore magic, and a good plot. There is a reminder of films like The Hills Hey Has Eyes and Gummudheed. It is clear that the budget is not as big, but the film is really made up of actors with atmospheric and majestic performances, much less of the movies that have filled up big budget special effects today. The picture really moves and has excellent direction and good camera work. There are no scarcely scenes, so the length of the film is a little lower. Moreover, everything will start for the sequel, which is very interesting. So grab some popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy this one.
