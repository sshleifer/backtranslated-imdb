Well, magic works in mystical ways. Centuries ago, another of the 4 prisoners trying to flee with the help of a prisoner written by the prisoner was surprisingly astonishingly ended with suspense. If it had something like a theater-drama (almost everything happens in the cell) it never got boring and it did well. In the tradition of "Cube" you are caught up with characters and if they are guilty, you have created some sympathy with some, and only change your mind through the twists that take the story. Some of the events have been guarded by you and there was always a touch of madness in the air. All is bad and fun and I do not expect anything (a friend has rented it), it's a positive surprise!
