Gozo, a part of the new wave of Japanese cinema, takes on a number of creative directors, editors and photographers, working on historic backgrounds, and Japanese call "duration pieces". Gozo is very creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Brilliant, too. Traditional beliefs, such as the new wave Shamanism, ghost and the occult powers of Japanese samurai movies, are certainly part of their ancient culture, but the Samurai of Kurosawa has not really been explored in the mythology or the Zyotichi series. Another good example of this genre is the Onomoge (2001). I put Sogo Ichii as the most interesting and creative director of the new wave Japanese Directors. Recent recent Japanese period pieces I Twilight Samurai of Yolada (2002) and Jatocchi: The Blind Swordsman (2003) of Shinto Katsu.
