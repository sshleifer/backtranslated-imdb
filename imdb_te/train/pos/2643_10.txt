I can not say much about the plot that has already been mentioned. I did not see it in the film about 25 years and its memory never left me. Where am I looking for each? I did net searches for it in the past but got empty. Last night I was thinking about the film again and it was trying to remember who I was in but I saw the last one and I'm not sure if I had the correct image name. I searched only 10 or 12 so I decided another search and I finally found this vision. I'm right. If anyone knows who can get a copy of this wonderful film to share with my family, please let me know now. Tawnyteel@yahoo.com I really appreciate it. And this movie is not well seen and it is well worth anybody who has the opportunity.
