I loved this wonderful movie. Farrah Fawcett played a part with a rich and good heart. She plays a woman who runs aggressive steps to protect her and her friends after a stranger attack. <br /> When she was alone in her home, the police denied that she would enter her home and attack her again. <br /> <br /> She had to spray her in her eyes so as not to call or get out of the police and she banned him in his oven. <br /> I'm the land. They are very easy on these criminals. It's time for more stringent punishments.
