This is like Murder Sheet Route, one of those programs, after a stressful day at school, I sit in front of the TV, and watch. Why? I honestly enjoyed it, and it's no longer a shame to be in the air. Dr. Mark Sloan, doctor-turned detective, Dick Van Dyke solves his son's murder. He is a very unknown but very effective assistant cast, joined by his real-life son, Barry van Dick. Victoria Rowl was also nice, but I saw that each series would change her hairstyle. I also liked Scott Bayau and Charlie Schollters, but I particularly love Michael Tuckey as Norman and hesitated that he was suddenly disappeared. This performance is very fun, it seems somewhat clear at times like great guest stars and columbo, but it's somewhat darker in every episode. In conclusion, with a great series, two thumbs and a 10/10. Bethany Cox
