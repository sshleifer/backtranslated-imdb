I said that the beans are finally happy to be spilled in the film. Bravo "The Spice", Bravo! The film is a ridiculous farce of filmmaking. Especially for student film! I give credit to Spazz for taking care of the absurd amount of time to find a rare image, and then comment on it! Many people I know do not have that kind of time, especially a few read it. Kudos to you! Anyway, the film is at least unbelievable and just below a narrow storyline at plain silly. I understand the idea behind the creativity of Charlie Angels, but why did you put such gruesome actresses! What's the role of the director, write, produce and edit the picture too! Choose a job and put all your love for man! It's a shame because it's he who has done a good film about a killer toothbrush. Again, thanks to Spazzi for pulling the curtain back in the picture, people like you are rarely seen.
