With this picture, it's about style, atmosphere and acting. True, I did not believe all of the development of the plot, but it does not matter - stunning acting, unexpected plot turns, and excellent weather sucks me right, and along with me for the ride, and I have great time. Kenneth Branagh is the owner of the voices rather than a great actor, and he once again proved to be a flawless Georgia voice. He is very talented in supporting roles (Robert Downey, Jr., Schindler's List and Fallen, Tom Berenger, Daryl Hanna, and Ibet Davewat from Robert Duvall) I just skipped away. I recently bought a copy of this film, and I was not sure to see it. One of the best thrillers of the year. If you ignore this movie (and you have the chances), then I'll check it out.
