The film is very happy, and this is William H. Has a great album of actors like Mikey, which always displays these kind of characters, perhaps his high representative, Fargo; And George Clooney is a good actor who shows his comedian work in co-star Cohen film "Oh brother, where are you?" It's one of my favorite movies ever! But it's hard to say "Welcome to Collinwood" here in Mexico. My city is not in good places to buy some good movies. I tried to buy at the blockbuster but they did not know by the real name, so I would have a little easier to find out if they were the name given to it in Mexico, I do not remember because of me! Cheers. A.
