First, I did not see "blob" because I had a wonderful experience from 7 or 8 years old and an adult. Pages on horror movies today can be written in its effect. And yet "the fear of teenagers" is more written in his social suburbs with the 50s. <br /> <br /> It looks as though you are getting out of our modern world. But some of the frightening moments of "The Blob" packs are like a band where children live unobtrusively when adults are not afraid. In fact, there are some pretty sad moments in its candy-colored world. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen gives a lot more than the story, we believe in the audience and really catch him in the moment. <br /> <br /> If you remove your post-modern voron filter, there is more love than you can meet the eye.
