The film has fallen through the crack of film history. This is better than some other New York images of the same period: "The French Connection" or "The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3". The film is a surreal reality to utilize more humor to the plot line. <br /> <br /> Ron Lyman transforms a Bauwara performance into "Batman" and his career is not ill, <br /> <br /> Gordon Parks is directing it and coming after "shaft" it looks like the first . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the flip side of the previous attempt was made and the majority of your interviews were approached. <br /> Unfortunately, the film is not available in the United States on DVD or VHS. United Artists really have a gem in their hands and it is a shame they do not do anything.
