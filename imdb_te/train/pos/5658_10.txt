This is one of the best shows ever for this TV. Complete the secret and intrigue and twists and turns. Compulsive view. I was lucky to see this in the UK. They might have come to the wrong order of the episode, I can not remember, but at least every week is a normal time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we know it is unique. We missed one of the episodes, and it made you sad and madly for a week. <br /> <br /> Great casting, excellent acting. Gary Cole is fully client, better than his role as a custodian. Luk√°cs started an amazing show for the black boy, and Five Turko is also the best after the Party of Five. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some confusing and disturbing bits, and I felt like I later explained, there was no doubt in the series. It's weak, and they can say that they have killed it. Can we go to WHERE? Why did they do that for the best performances ever made? Shoot the executive
