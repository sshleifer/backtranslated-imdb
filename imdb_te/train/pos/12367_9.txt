Well, I waited for a long time to see the film after a long time after watching some clips on Bravo's The 100 Scary Movies Movie Moments. The plot is simple, handsome model Alison Parker (Christina Ryans) moves into an apartment building in the Hell gateway. Although a bit slower, the Sentinel is the right creepy image down. It is a mixture of Woman and Rosemary. Acting is good, and there are some really uncomfortable bits, such as the awkward scene with the chubby in the middle of the dead father and skin-eating cake and laughing eventually a weird mixture of clumsy individuals and cannibals. It's very odd, campy but in the end, I really believe in a great movie! My favorite one from the 70s, it's nothing original. It's absurd and very creepy! Perhaps one of my favorite of all time. 9/10
