From the NASCAR maniac view like I did, the picture is interesting. You can see many race cars from 1983. Strict, racing scenes are not very realistic. <br /> <br /> I used the film primarily for 80 years to see from Reynolds: Bandit Movies Burt behind the wheel of a fast car. <br /> <br /> If you love Nassar and Burt Reynolds, then watch this movie. If you only love one of these 2 things, I would also like to see it. If you do not like NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you still have to give it a chance, but keep in mind that the film is far from winning the Oscar Academy Award. <br /> <br /> In the 80s this is a simple comedy. If you like movies like Cannonball Movies, and Police Academy, you'll love it too.
