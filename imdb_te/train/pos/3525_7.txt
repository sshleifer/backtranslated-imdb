Man, this is hard DVD to come by. I found the Spanish Impression of Region 2, which is expensive. <br /> Is it worth it? Yes good. Kurt Sidemak (I have read the credits "Robert" on IMDb.com, but the DVD credits list is Kurt), but it also has familiarity with other murder mysteries, Elisha Cook, Jr., and Thomas Gomez - but my decade-long pathetic film is finally satisfied is. <br /> <br /> In particular, the respected, self-restrained engineer (Alan Curtis) finds himself in a New York bar with his separated wife and two show tickets in his pocket. The woman with a strange hat is on the jack beside him and he invites me to join him in a musical review. She accepts a little bit of darkness. <br /> <br /> In the show, foggy star notices indicate that this woman in the audience is wearing the same hat and annoying the off stage. The drummer and cook in the band goes to the silent lady, but there is no response. Curtis takes the woman to her house and asks her name, but she does not give it up, and she does not know her. <br /> <br /> If she wants to be a long-time devotee she talks about night ships. <br /> <br /> Well, Curtis murdered his wife to go home. The head of police, Gomez, turns him to DA. Bartender, not the Latina star, not the cab driver ("Alpe"), and not the drummer - and from her - her only alive is a Phantom Lady with whom one is remembered <br /> <br /> Curtis was convicted and sentenced to death. But she's probably innocent because inspector Gomez thought over things and made no such stupid story with no one with a brain. <br /> <br /> They unofficially re-investigate with Curtis-loving secretary Ella Rhys. The ominous bartender goes through a car, perhaps unexpectedly, so he is out of the film. The hot-closed Latina was excluded because the program was closed and she was uncooperative and ignorant with the source of the hat anyway. Elisha Cook, Jr. was joking by the real murderer but before he was shown in a scene, he pounds the drums in the advanced jazz group. His sweaty face assumes an expression, which suggests intense attention but a brutal, orgasmic insanity. His eyeballs go up, scratch his mouth, his hammering becomes crazy. <br /> If nobody is the best, Thomas Gomez is always reliable. However, the best performance, perhaps the franchtone tone. He is a real murderer and he hugs his nun. He is reserved and artistic. He adorned when he was fious. I do not exactly know how to put this but the tone is as well thinking of acting as well as his role. Anan Curtis is an innocent engineer near Kelvin level near zero and is in B film. <br /> I do not know why it's considered classic. This is your basic murder mystery by Cornell Woolrich, some of the others are not good. But Sidamque directed is sensitive. A man rushes up and winds around it with a hat on his hat in a gutter. <br /> <br /> <br /> "
