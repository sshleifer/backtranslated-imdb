I heard Eddie Izzard, but did not see him in action. I know he's a trade-off, and when I see him on HBO one night last summer, I put it, without knowing how my husband reacted. Well, he's cut us away. He's always better than Robin Williams. He has total control of the audience; When he 'Eglebert dies - no he's not', the general, the audience does not know what the ending is. The touch of inspiration for God as James Mason, and the version of Python Spanish Inquisition was organized by the Church of England - 'Cake or Death?' Priceless. My jaws are sad from the smile at the end of the show. We'll be able to see him again, a few months later we have brought out the TV lists and we're lucky to tape the next time he arrives. If you get a chance to see this presentation, cancel everything and tap it, you will not be disappointed.
