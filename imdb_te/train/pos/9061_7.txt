I really liked the movie. <br /> <br /> I read a lot of times as a kid and enjoyed watching the movie about the book. <br /> <br /> I am a boy and a boy between 11 and 8 years old. Talk to the girl who saw this movie. But happy, in the end, she was happy she saw it and also said she wanted to buy on DVD as soon as it came. <br /> <br /> I do not think the film is "gross" as I predict ... Tho has reached a pretty high point on the macro-o meter. why I do not realize why Woodley had a "Daily" line in relation to her private parts ... it was only a surprise to me (and you could listen to the gas that the audience could hear at that time In the film) ... why is this movie in the movie? The original film does not add anything except the shock / gas factor ... but better than the other. "Pepsi" is a good girl.
