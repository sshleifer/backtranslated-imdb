The film was a surprise to me, it had good clothes and laughter, a non-stop action pack with gun action and explosive tones. This film has a lot of surprisingly good turns and turns. This plot is great despite what others think, ultimately keeps my whole time up to the end. At the end; It's a great way to get an action movie buffet to spend time.
