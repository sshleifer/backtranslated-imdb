I'm thinking of a B-rated film that I read this movie. I was amazed and excited too. Eva is good, but the Lake Bell stole the show. She has a wonderful comedy time. The jokes in this movie are surprisingly real and really fun, one of them or two flat jokes. This theme is to be tied together, on the day of her wedding, a woman (Eva) dies and excludes a woman who goes out with her husband, but her sounds are distracting, but actually very good. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Overall, its worthwhile movie watch, when it comes to dvd on DVD.
