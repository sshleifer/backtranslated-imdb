Before reading this review, I read this review, it's a statement against the Iranian people ... If you really want to read something, hopefully, I'm against politicians. <br /> <br /> This film is not banned in Iran (See IMDb trivia for this movie). This is a shame because the picture looks great. <br /> <br /> The film "Gabbakka" does not exist at the International Film Festival in Berlin. <br /> If it (runner-up or second place). Why? Because it's a film about oppression. This is not entirely a problem for women. It is trying to keep people down. A comparison of the government's view of the need for a film to be banned. But nothing is forbidden by banning and / or they can disappear this movie! <br /> <br /> Another reviewer has a great summary: "Humor about a tragedy", it's pretty cool!
