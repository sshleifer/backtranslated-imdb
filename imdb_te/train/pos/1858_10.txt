Unlike other commentators who commented on the film's ability to cross the breed, this powerful film offers a complex and in-depth storyline, which represents organizational racism and its effects. The Washington Fisher presents the story with a carefully hand and critical eye, cutting the bodies of women, maintaining the dubious stereotypes or satisfying the whitewash of the white eyes. I think this film might be a bit too happy at the end; However, it is deep in Afro-American culture and lecture, and some Afro-American - Anthon Fischer's life is seen by some white viewers.

In a film permanently racist and sexist stereotypes are directed or starred until week Two of them are waiting to say, Denzel "Malcolm X", "Hurricane" and others before the "Training Day" Oscar, which is not for other great actresses and color actors, or refusing to express their appreciation for motivating work.Racy and sexism and heterosisism "American Beauty "," Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil "," American Pie, <br /> <br /> Derek Luke Hulkva Tutu, and I wish him the best. All of the other actresses and actors hands hands down, while I take the problem with another straight fur, light skin sistuh's choice of sistuh. Everyone wants to see this film. However, it may not be for everybody. Much Luv. 10/10
