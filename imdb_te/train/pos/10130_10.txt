The pilot is well done. This refers to the bonding of characters in future episodes. I do not think anyone can create a good pilot for this show. It exhibits excellent creativity on the writers. Although it is the very first episode, there are many events that are held in the future seasons, although not everything is right. An example is Ross and Rachel's future relationships. <br /> <br /> Despite the horror of the first episode, it has been overcome by amazing plots and spectacular actors. <br /> <br /> Great start to brave comedy!
