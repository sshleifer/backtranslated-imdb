The jokes are clear, the garments are corny, and the characters run the concerts - but I can not stop from laughing at his most entertaining film. See how many times I've been, I'm still getting a kick out of this, and I highly recommend all lovers of mindless entertainment. It has a lot of fun moments, and some of the best scenes I have seen today. If you have a bad week and if you need a stew, rent on your way home on Friday night to give your weekend a good start.
