There are many people who are unfair in this series, but guinea pig videos are very fun. The devil's experiment has some really amazing effects - just the infamous Iball scene but the most realistic skin slice on the foot and a heavy weight hammer is quite realistic - especially for the vintage and low-budget of the video. <br /> <br /> The film was initially a "serious" violence / fake smile picture in Japan in the 80s. This is a theme, the theme: A young girl is holding some men and faces brutal torture, let's see where she is breaking. This leads to brutal torture - keeping all the potentially realistic effects, including the ones mentioned in the previous paragraph, as well as the maggots in the hot oil of the hot oil for the slave girl's hand and the next glittering wound. <br /> <br /> The less effective sequences are at the start of the video and the three men dropping the baby on the head when the three men are thrown out of the head, and three men throw a second sequence and the floor pushing her. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the role of "experiment" is painful for everyone and takes a good amount of money. Abuse and hard work on the camera. Her reactions last for hours as she had headphones in her heart. Some of the remaining abuse she takes is a string in the net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest. <br /> <br /> When she gets to the office chair, Jack Daniels is forced to drink the bottle, where she has a disturbing scene of a punch that looks like a punky guy holding another and a frustrated wait. I did not see this series as I helped you to decide whether you wanted to give this episode a shot. Devil's experiment is 8.5 / 10.
