I love this piece of creative genius - and an amazing story - and an amazing cast (everyone else) - an aging rocker, this film ever mentioned about Heep and Quo - my 2 favorite bands - and amazing storyline. I still can not recommend it well - and Mick Jones is for most people (aliens leader and primary songwriter alongside Lar Gramm) - I saw this great work more than 10 times - Bill Niagi - Jimmy Nail - oozes talent from every hurry - then Astrid .... and Karen ..... what more can be asked for an aging rocker !! 10/10 - Bloody bright. <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, originally from Windsor, England.
