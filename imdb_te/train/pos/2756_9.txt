I chose this picture based on plot summary and critically quotes on the back of the box. I'm not big for foreign films, and I do not know what to expect. I do not care for the subtitle either. But I totally loved it! It has a simple, affordable quality that feels good about life. I found myself laughing repeatedly. I would recommend this picture to anyone who abhors foreign images with subtitles. This effort makes it worthwhile.
