This odd David Lynch illustrates the "good story about brotherhood love." This is especially "odd" because in the last 15 -20 years the film is not a type of lynch. The dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Mulholland Drive) and the opposite. I know his fans are very disappointed. Some are happy. <br /> <br /> I have counted myself to one another and I have those three "dark" films. <br /> It's another - a real life story. He did not speak in years to see his unhealthy brother until the western Iosis Wisconsin, but he wanted to see it before the next death. Well, I guess that campus - old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an "odd" image of the bushes, so lichin are the character! <br /> Richard Farmsworth plays the title role. He is the face of each person, face-to-face, voice-wise, low-key personality. Wrinkles on his face tell a lot of stories. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of the film are not very good, but this is not very fun when it is shown primarily. The character's adult and psychological challenge is that the baby (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but once begins her tour with Alvin Strait (Farmsworth), story is about. I played this role for most friends and thought that the film never won, but I am more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. For them, it is a sleep pill. <br /> <br /> I saw his tour is pretty pleasant but you need to know beforehand that this is not a suspense lynch crime story. If it's slow and ok with you, you might like it. Ashwin meets along the way Some people in the film enters the skin, and when the disobedient young girl flees and he gets into trouble, he has done some nice town to help the old man. Harry Dean Stanton received the third billing, but it was a joke: the last few minutes of the film! <br /> <br /> Ioa's scenery is pleasant, I have lived there for many years and can confirm the rolling hills and richer grounds.It is good with good people .... this film.
