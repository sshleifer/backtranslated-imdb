I finally bought a "show people" copy to my collection. I can not comment on the characters, plot and overall quality of the film without previous audiences repeating their own words. Most of the M-G-M silent performances of the comic strip, outside characters and the value of looking at it. I really like the scene that Marion Davis plays in her role and played the role of the film's main character, Patricia Pepoore. Make sure she read her lips, because the title card indicates what she said when she watches Merian Devis, but "I do not think I like her!" Pop in maize pop, tap and be ready to go back more than one third of the history of movie making. Have fun!
