This is a good example if an actor does not know how to film. This plot is ridiculous, and really does not make sense. <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can persuade anything, but the film is no exception. Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... Everybody has good talent. But it's a megastar that reflects the supreme presence of everyone. Without him, this film could have been a non-starter ... The story split / mistake identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good vs evil - everything, really! An amazing performance in all the ways of Amitabh, in a silly movie! And did I say it's funny ridiculous?
