I was impressed by the scene when I ran from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City and Yukon a few years ago, but I did not paint in the real locations, although this film is beautiful and beautiful scenes. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a wonderful place, but the film is not a real place. When the story went to Dawson, I thought Anthony was feeling the man, utilizing the best of outdoor locations, much more if he was shot in the original location. Here James Stewart again struggles with himself, does not like to take part in him and helps people standing in the way of earning money, and can not be seen away from the murdered people on the other side. Ruth's Roman prestigious woman, she should not be cautious about anyone, and Corey is a good girl. Man shoots the shootouts, but the film's high point is how good he is in open sequences. He uses outdoors and he helps through the winter scene, the predominantly white, as with the green colors of Browns in "The Naked Spar" and "The Man From Spray". Like Mann Stewart, it is more distinct from the elaboration of the traditional Western, Stewart character.
