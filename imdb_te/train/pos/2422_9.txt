Yes, this is a low budget. Yes, this is one of Kandi's early films, but it's his funniest! John Candy has not been removed in "Going Bercer" in its SCTV days so far and it shows. If you leave him while trying to help a man with his hand, Candy will separate the door from the apartment when he's sexually abused (huh? See the movie!), Or the path Euguene Levy (creator of Kong Fu Uu) phone, or only the candy Number of facial expressions that just check your pulse better! If you want John Candy as "Only the Lonely", I would not like to watch it, but if you enjoy John Candy's SCTV days, this is a must watch!
