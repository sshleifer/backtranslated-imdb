I d.v.d. In "Things to Come," and my VHS version is quite clear compared to that. Audio fair, but sometimes hard to understand. <br /> <br /> When I liked the movie, I found a copy of the book and found it. I have some details of why it happened. The best things about the film are the little things that I did not notice at first. When John Gibble was playing with a toy aircraft in a Christmas party, it was like a dive bomber, using the sea power, naming the battleship "dinosaurs". Ships gas-powered overwhelming, an undeclared enemy sneak attack by plane. Flying wing flights were wiped out. Strong rolls for women through the whole movie. <br /> <br /> There are more, look at the picture to enjoy them.
