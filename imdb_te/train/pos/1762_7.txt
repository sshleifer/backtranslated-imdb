All right, deal here: if you are easily offended then you may want to stay away, away from this one. There were a few painful funny moments in the film, but I was very tightly scraped as long as I laughed. Actually, I probably blushed more than I laughed. And if I literally get out of it, then I'm damaged in. If you do not have anything in this movie, you will be embarrassing. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that I laughed a little, but I can not give it a blanket recommendation. In the case of its subject matter. If I say, "This film is so happy, check it out!" And some sweet, little old church-going woman goes to the theater and graphically has a heart attack in one of the obvious sexual situations, which I do not need on my conscience. <br /> How rare is this? Alas, try something 100 times worse than wedding crushers. A. My mother walked out in the first scene. <br /> <br /> Here is some cleverly ingenious comedy, but I'm looking forward to man (Judd Apatow) Freaks and Geeks and Andekard. I'm all for the pleasure of Michael MacDonald; Kenny Rogers is the same person with white hair and beard suited to give a run for his money. Paul Rudd, "I heard you ya one more time, I will cut off this place", it's fun but one of those who do not congratulate the majority of the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite the surprisingly, raunchy, He is a virgin, as he is a virgin loser, and he is a little bit weird, and he is a little bit weird.After all, he has more videogames than an Asian kid and a BOSS of Million Dollar Man Collect the toy <br /> <br /> But man, oh man, please be aware that it warns its R rating when it goes on. It's definitely the motto of Autov. According to him, he developed some of the guys (especially Rogen and Malco) and spoke the way they normally speak All the dirt in an attempt to find new ways for our all. That way you can talk to, or acts that way, if you love the film. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of the excesses of pornography and sexual jokes. I find the feminine, clever humor is more entertaining than the 200 uses of the word or fratboy sex talks. But it was me. As I mentioned, here are some absolutely silly moments, but you have to ask yourself if you are sitting by one of the most vulgar movies at anytime at the theater. I do not know how many women are interested in what the men discussed when I play poker. Honest ladies, you do not want to know. <br /> Wherever you go - take over my humble and honesty. Be your guide. It should not be seen by your Sunday School class, mama, grandma, any family of any opposite sex, any children under age or sexually obscene or anyone who is easily hurt by a clear sexual discussion. If you want to see any of the above, you do not have any feeling of being inconvenient.
