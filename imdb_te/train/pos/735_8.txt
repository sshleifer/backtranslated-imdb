The students of the Vince Lombardy High School are a fantastic cult film from 1979 with a new, dictatorial principle named Miss Togor (Mary Voronov). Togor blamed students' musical interests for a music scholar and their violations. <br /> <br /> Previously, she wanted to record this song. Absolutely impossible to resist the image. First and foremost, the soundtrack Alice Cooper and the Velvet Underground are not surprisingly alongside the epidemiologic nonstop assortment of Ramones songs. Some of them include "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker", and "Blitzkraeg Bap". Next, the cast really gives them all, with an ideal choice for the Soles Riff character; She is a real pleasure. Vinten von Patten and De Young are enthusiastic as Tom and Kate, Voronov has a very delicate and disgusting Togor, featuring Clint Howard, Eglebauer and New World Regularists Dick Miller, Paul Bartel (especially the music teacher Mr. McGrey) and The Real Dawn Steel Llappudu will be a lot of fun. And, of course, there is a treat to see Ramones playing themselves. <br /> <br /> The film has a real spirit. Power level writer, co-author and director Alan Arkhuls have brought many turns to the proceedings. There is also a great sense of humor. Gag of paper airplane is an excellent example of this. This expanded to the "wipe" style of the scene transitions. <br /> <br /> There are also happy giant rats who have created Robbatin with noticeable makeup effects on one of his first venues. <br /> Reject and protect one's power. <br /> <br /> "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is quite simply, excellent culture film. <br /> <br />
