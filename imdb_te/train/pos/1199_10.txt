This is the most compelling and superb performance ever given by Robert Taylor. It was completed in 14 years as "Johnny Eger". His looks are still a shock to see, but he is now maturing that this gritty, violent character gives him the edge. Charlie Gillon (Taylor) is the last of his race, a buller hunter who killed for bull but killed for pleasure. The buffalo is amazing to see not only humans but also his wild eyes killing. He is primarily a loner, people around him, but they do not like him because of his sociopathy behavior. His partner, Sandie McKenzie (Stewart Granger), is suddenly ill, and goes along with him because he is a failure. Charlie kills the Indians and captures the beautiful Debra Pagant. Charlie tries to seduce her without any purpose, but Sandy also finds herself interested. Granger is sad to see, so frustrated with the chase, and wants to go with the girl and her baby. Drunken Skinner Lloyd Nolan is fantastic with his clever cracks and hardyian playing. Rove Tamblyn plays a half-race character trying to fit in a white world. The group is an odd blend of good and bad, young and old. Finally, Taylor ridiculed by his buffalo, because he had many hunters and left Sandy with the girl and ran away. On the night of the return, Sandy goes with the woman, leaving Charlie with a queen to get Charlie to have a girl. The last confrontation comes in the storm and the final scene is surprising that you should never forget. It is Taylor's film all the way and he is really a very short time actor actor.
