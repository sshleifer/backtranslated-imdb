Max is a deep psychological insight, which is easily corroded into an unreasonable superhero story. Julie Winters is a "freelance social worker" in an unnamed slum city, committed with crimes, and there is a lot of trouble working for her and everyone she knows most. <br /> <br /> <br /> Maxx is his girlfriend and client, a street bum - or other way he feels like a cloth super hero. <br /> <br /> The drippingly bad voice of the gorgeous ubern, main villain, gonna especially the late Barry Stigler's work - the maxi art, story, or fantastic voice work. <br /> If you have a chance to see this, do not miss it.
