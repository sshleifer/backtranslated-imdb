My passion for Chris Rock varies with his paintings, and after Lethal Weapon 4 I hated him, but after that I hated everyone. He will save himself as dogma. Well this is his best, I did not expect it to be good. I removed my donkey from the whole time. Chris Rock offers a sweet fantastic story that supports some of the funniest comedy I've seen in quite a while. Loved it.
