The best-selling horror novelist Cheryl (a solid and sympathetic performance by the lovely Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (the favorite Paolo Serra) and their son Bobby (well done by Patricio Vince) are summer holidays. According to local legend, the area was blamed. Cherry, living in the dungeon, finds a creepy, hair, nasty ogre (David Flosse in a sturdy dress). The deep sitting of the cheryl beast has to go through the fear of childhood, so she can defeat the foul. Director / co-writer Lamberto Bava is an expert in creating and continuing a strange and desperate nightmare mood. In addition, the standard ruck'in's avoiding the frightening flick routine for creating a fairy tale of ignorant and provocative dark adult adventures over the source head as how Bawa is frightening us. Sabrina Ferrelli's friendly school teacher Anna, Hatty actress Maria, and Alex Serra, Stephania Montoris as the victim's artist Dario strongly supported. Gianfranco Transformo's glossy cinematography has plenty of fluid tracking shots and great weather lighting. Fabricio Sforza's gnarly make-up F / x, Simon Boswell's stunning induction spooky'n'shuddery score, and dam, dark, cobweb-cover cellar all hit skin-crawl spot hit. Well worth looking at.
