Although I'm not fancy of James Ballus, I really like this movie. In this movie, you can see really big performances, Linda Hamilton and Courtney Cox; Cain is already big of course. The plot of the film is simple; That sliding door is similar to the picture. But this is said in a mild manner and I like comedy moments. It tried to replay my own important moments directly, e.g. If I removed the girl for a movie and not the other one. It tells us that the people around us can play different roles in our lives. We can remind ourselves that we care about what we want. Life is not always good on the other side as we think; Maybe now we have the best of us, all things are taken into consideration.
