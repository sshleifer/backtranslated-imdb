Roman Polans is considered to be the most important directors of our time, and is considered to be in the backslide of the classic "Rosemary's Baby" and "Chinatown". Perhaps the film's portrayal of Paulenskiy is very interesting, he has the ability to create commercially attractive images such as the predefined artworks, and he prefers to create more personalized low-key movies. "Le Locator" or "The Tenant", one of those movies; <br /> <br /> Paulens plays a young man looking for an apartment in Tolkovsky, France. When he finally finds out, he finds that he is empty, because the previous tenant, Simon Chowley, tried to kill him by jumping out of the window. After Simon's injuries died, Trevlevsky was engaged to him, while believing that her death was caused by the remaining tenants in the building. <br /> <br /> The same claustrophobia focuses on a strange conspiracy, which is not entirely on Tlkovsky's head, with his immense effects and extravagant infestation in his other "apartment-back" films ("Revolution &" Rosemary's Baby " In the dark of Treklovsky, the legend of Palencius was portrayed by Polanski and his performance was peculiar And wood, slowly working for the Polans, because a simple and supporting actress who has almost no life in capturing herself in this commanding sub-world that lives with the collection of satellites to Trellovsky really gives life to the people of the building. <br /> <br / > Beautiful cinematography from Palans in this film is to increase the feel of the camel  ి సహాయపడుతుంది, ట్రెల్కోవ్స్కీ కోసం కేజ్గా పనిచేసే అందమైన భవనానికి జీవితాన్ని అందిస్తుంది. . గందరగోళాన్ని మరియు పిచ్చి భావాలను కలిగించేలా పాలిన్కి వేటాడే చిత్రాలను ఉపయోగించుకుంటాడు, అవి అతీంద్రియ సౌందర్యంతో ఉంటాయి మరియు అది భయపెట్టే మరియు ఆకర్షణీయమైనదిగా చేస్తుంది. <br /> <br /> If there is a flaw in the picture, it's definitely a bit slow at first. This sounds like a turn but in reality it simulates Trlkovsky's own boring life which works perfectly slow slowly at slow speed and gradually he enters a different kingdom. Moreover, the shiny plot is not easy to understand because of the complex layers. <br /> <br /> "Tenant" may not be interested in everyone with mental horror and surreal stories. The experience will be proud. "Lea Laditaitre" is truly one of the earliest Roman Polanque's works. 10/10
