It's a great movie to see with your girlfriend. My friend and I both played the love at the dance and the video store. We had to get it. With no great deal of violence and such a warming story to relax and just enjoy your night. I would recommend some of the girls to recommend this movie or to the girls looking for a beautiful image.
