I checked this as inspiration when browsing through the image store and hopefully surprised! My mother and I have seen this movie together, and we enjoyed it thoroughly. It is not a typical "chic-flick" with a delicate love story and tears, but it certainly struck a nerve in the twist at the end. Although it is unexpected and tragic, it does not harm the overall impact of the film. I Reese Witherspoon is also a great actress in this film, her debut, and it is definitely worth watching! I did not recognize many supporting actors, but they all led their important supporting roles. "The Man in the Moon" is a reliable story about falling in love with a young adolescent for the first time. Many women are certainly from Vinnespoon's words, she is closely related to her subtle gestures and her sensitive emotions (as emotionally as a teenager). When she plays a confusing character about her love, she does not come across as being undoubtedly and immature, and she is very grateful for taking into consideration many movies today.
