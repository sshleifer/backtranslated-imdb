An attractive film based on a true story, she accused the Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) of killing her daughter's daughter. She emphasizes that a dingo is taking her baby, but this story is very suspicious. The Australians explained that the film was actually about the media circus in this case, and eventually led to the belief of women in the lynch mob psychology, which is based on just the hardest evidence. I loved the media interrogation films, and there were also tough views on how people were trained by the justice system. I always thought that Garry 12 Angry Men should be shown before they go through their tasks. As is often said, not as a generous film, how much of our events affect our fools and how we treat human beings with a desire for vengeance. A Cry in the Dark is also clinical. Shepcy's film is not dramatic. Some people may find boring or powder, but I'll get engaged.
