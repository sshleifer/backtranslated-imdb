The title is a street car sound that wears on the anthototopic and rails. People who live in the dump can not have it all for the metaphor. The mourning of these individuals is shown by a street car passing to a middle class that represents a relatively inexpensive rich life. The little boy and his dear yet sad mad father's trial is very touching. It is Kurosawa's first film in color and he uses the most surprising colors, only the colors seen in dreams. The picture is over surreal and beauty. The compassion of humanity, but as always, is concentrated on capturing the beauty of the Kurosawa film. This is a major work by the genius of the film.
