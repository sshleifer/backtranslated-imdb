I love the cartoons. They can not show movies with 'real' actors and scenes - even when the computer effects become more frequent. They come across boundaries ('The Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), Scene ('Aladdin') or Reality ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples in 'Ice Age' when they see a clay flock in the now-extinct mammals that are chatting as old places and migrating to rural areas. It is a pleasure to see such scenes, at the same time we have a well-known and stupid feel, which usually laughs at us. Ice Age is not as good as the top animated films of all time, it's a really fun movie. <br /> <br /> This story is for Manfred Cold War mammoth, Sid, an idiot sloth, and Diego, a Saberat tiger, and a man returns to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, naturally, they have a lot of problems. Scrat picking up throughout the journey, the unluckiest roost of history, desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: on the glaciers, on the top of the dead trees, in the ice caves. <br /> <br /> This is a very predictable ending and a middle class, a range of funny moments with some character-building moves, but some scenes, such as nappy changing or dodos, animals are likeable and it looks good. <br /> <br /> Mammoths come to life with cave painting before the eyes of Manfred. <br /> A fun, 7/10
