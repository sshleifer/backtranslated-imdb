I bought a renewed version of the movie I remembered most from childhood and made it perfect for an interesting afternoon entertainment. Bedknobs is absolutely in full form, with deleted scenes (especially Macdowal) linked events much more distinctly. The slightest ambiguity is that the scenes have been revised. Apparently, the soundtrack was lost or damaged for the footage, so some bright sparks in Disney decided to dub the scenes with a new conversation. Half cast is nothing (except for some good reasons) and the whole thing is very low. Some lip-synching are pretty poor and David Tomlinson's voice is David R. Tomlinson (it's really a reference to Germany's suggestion, I think) that it is absolutely nothing. However, the full versions of all songs are good to hear (though 'stage in the right direction' still does not exist) and the magical moments in this film still shine. And you're challenging not to challenge my headache when young Paul Angela Lancebury and gazes as innocence at the cousins ​​"But what happened with my knob?"
