This is a very good movie, not only for Lady Death Comics fans, but also for animated films / adventure and fantasy series. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a innocent girl dead <br /> <br /> She wants to take revenge. The rest will see from the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, the characters are like the original comics, they are in the form of ghosts. I can not read the first part of the comics story in the first parts of the story, the passages in the film are only the last one, I can not tell you if the events are exactly like comics, but ... one way or another is Lady Death story!
