This is Jack, after an insomniac, he visits dead friends, throws out of a building, and for a long time, can not tell the reality from illusion. <br /> <br /> Dominic Monaghan, like Jack, is really believable. <br /> He's trying to introduce a dog (another hallucination), and suddenly in Jack's bathroom and in the bedroom they come out without any explanation (more hallucination) and you're an interesting, enthusiastic 43 minutes And the shower scene is enough to get back any dome fan.
