I'm not a follower of the genre of a particular movie. I am categorizing the films industry or industry only. Valentine is the second industrial film of director Jamie Blanks after his Urban Legends. Unlike Urban Legends, screenplay and storytelling is very weak. Once again, unlike Urban Legends, the basic elements of the film are very active and iconic and Valentine is fine. <br /> <br /> As the first basic and iconic element, the increasing hate of serial killer is so down to Earth. From his secondary school years, he made his soul against his classmate girlfriends with his soul, who ridiculed him. When you look at the first element when watching the movie, you come to see this view of humanism: "No one is totally good or bad, in fact someone is badly called secretly heartfelt." Since the story line and direction are very weak, we can not be satisfied as we deserve. <br /> <br /> The second iconic element, superb collectables at the end of the 90's: my favorite Jessica Kaffle dies in the coolest way to die. When she met an arrow from her bow and when she met, she met and met with her blind date. Katherine Heigl is the first starter who killed the biological laboratory when trying to hide under the human body patterns lying in surgery operations charts. Denise Richards killed the third person, and she received a Valentine's Day gift at a whirlpool bath. Jessica Capcha was killed in a mysterious and unexplained way, and was later considered her serial killer. Fortunately, fortunately, she's going to kill her secretly, she never knew, 'Before the murder, the film ends. In the end, Benita haha ​​is very lucky because the senior killer is not classmate of David Bouronaz. <br /> <br /> The third and last iconic theme from the Blind Date Librith Scene is a day celebration in Soundtrack, Dorothy's home scenes and the final killing. Everybody liked the soundtrack as long as I knew. Hard Rock is not always good in a serial killer-mystery film.
