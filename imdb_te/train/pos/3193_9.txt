The film begins with the real footage of Gary Gary, which was randomly taken in the parking lot of a television station where Gary works in Bayer Town. Gary is a small "diverse"; He is a hypocrite and runs an old Chevy (after Fassett) named Ferra. The filmmaker received a letter from Gary, who later recruited some of the footage of the local talent contest with Gary's spectacular performances as Olivia Newton Dawn, by inviting Bever again. Oh, my. Two short films from Gary's storyline, the first of which was first portrayed by Sean Penn and Crispin Glover, entitled "The Archie Kid". If you're in mood for mocking someone, it's a must-see image. I was twice as lucky with it, especially with the performance of the Crispins. After it turned out, I had to rewind the film again to see Real Gary and his shining idiocy. Although Olivia focused, I would have liked to be one of the "fictional" stories as a jab in Gary's Barry Money Deception, as well as ridiculously ridiculous.
