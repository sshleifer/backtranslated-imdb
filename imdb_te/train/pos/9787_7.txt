This story is beautifully acted. It was sad and heartfelt about a young man's journey to find out where she came from. Her mother and father were killed in a car crash, and Stephanie adopted her mother's best friend after she was diagnosed with dyslexia and her life a bit after she was called 'miracle baby'. She found her along the way and affected that close around her. Her relationship with her guardian and ex-girlfriend of her custodian is very sensitive and delicate, and the supporting cast is real, 3 dimensional and reliable. Set up a fiberglass factory in a small town in Australia, which gives you a pleasant feeling when it comes to warm, delicate, romantic image, and credits. After reading some of the other rather shallow comments about Hugo Weaving, I want to include that he is brilliantly cast, and very sexy. No, he's not a Brad Pitt, but he does not mean he's not attractive.
