I thought this film was very enjoyable. I saw this movie with my wife before my first child. So I'm not just watching family fun and I'm still enjoying it. Many of the reviews pointed out that this film is not shattering the ground, it's unexpected plot changes and the film is supposed to be predictable and boring. If you see the film that these people want to have a religious experience, then they are disappointed. It's just an animated film; Not much more. If you want this movie to be back and fun, you will not be disappointed. In closing, this is definitely not the best film Disney made, but it's fun and does not mean the bad reputation I received.
