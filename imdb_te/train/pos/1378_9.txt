I saw this small Belgian gem two days after seeing 'American Teen'. Do not make a mistake about it, the roller coaster ride in adolescence, it is American or European. A young 15-year-old girl (Pauline Aquadour plays, sometimes resembling young Scarlett Johansson), a girl who wants to be in a cold swimming pool, just another attractive girl (Adele Hennel), 'nissons des piers' (or 'water lilies' in America) is. It is clear that it is far higher than Florian's attractiveness. This all-in-middle image is just plump, unattractive friend, Anne, who's just any other girl wants a boyfriend like her age. Also, we show a normal range of teen pastimes (broken hearts, shop lifting, alcohol and / or drug use, casual sex, etc.). It takes time to work in your system (which is the Michael Bay fans, note: sailing s-l-o-w, so unclear), but if you do not have trouble, water lilies are a charmer. Not rated here, but hard "R" is pulled due to language, nudity, and adult conditions.
