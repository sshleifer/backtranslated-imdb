I have owned this movie and have seen it several times since the years of release. Prince does not stun us with his extraordinary acting style or anything, he is a musician and I think what he's displayed here is, he's just the best one to tell this story by effect. The film is very simple and fitting, but the director / writer is wrong, still it's a great film with good music. Principals and moral beliefs are very strong in purple rain, and more movies are basically based on what we teach as children, reflecting the environment reflecting the art.
