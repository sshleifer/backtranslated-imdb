<br /> If you do not know who Barbra Streisand is today ... (Is it possible?) ... they know who she is! <br /> <br /> This show has won 5 Emms, <br /> <br /> The plot, I refused. <br /> <br /> In a hospital-filled room, she ended up with an amazing version of her signature song, including a segment that was a little girl (at the time) ... "People". ... a musical tour of Bergdorf-Goodman, when it tries to break the poverty strings of Barbra it's better than the sounds ... <br /> ACT III ... The best part, Just like Barbara, musicians, & some great songs, like. .... "Happy Days Are Here Again" & amp; <br /> <br /> In all, most of television history has made one of the greatest performers in the world!
