In my second view, years later, I realized two things about this film: 1) I enjoyed it very much, and 2) because its hanging was sharper than the necessity. Before I restored my initial protests I had laughed my way - lowspeep and layers and airheaders (even * the good * -stream the headline) is not just internally funny, especially when the length feature is drawn. At the end of the film's opening spooker, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and the unforgettable Halo Jr. in the unforgettable scene) show such a peculiar sense of comic movements, as well as more confusingly written jokes (eg Ted Hell failing to identify a specific resident) as ill-acted Work (eg challenge). The winter and Reeves team members can not get drunk with the Bill and Ted (the only scene in the entire movie, if they do not fit in). > (Side note: I have occasionally entertained the first film - it has different kinds of funny feelings. <br /> I give it 7.75. Surprisingly good pleasure.
