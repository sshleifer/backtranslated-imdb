I'm competing with Opening Night and it's just another film with the personality of Bergman. Both films are simply amazing, they have greatness of difficult thoughts they perceive at first glance. We have a great meditation on the relationship of art and life as an actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), who learns more of her role than the one she plays. One of her fans was accidental death, a young girl who announced her love for Myrrh, and then she was hit with a car, leaving the actress in a deep way. She begins to influence her at her age. The only solution to her is alcohol. But it does not help too much and one step away from mysterious full madness. The scene for killing her dead girl's imaginary (or not) spirit is one of the most thrilling scenes I've found in a cassaved film. The movie ends with the intellectual premiere, which he and a Jenna Rowlands shoot a theater scene that improves a scene, as Myrtle drinks the early night to do his part correctly. The scene is live directly with the audience, the laughter is real, the chemistry between the Casavas and the Rowlands is absolutely fantastic. If you are interested in a movie that offers considerable ideas along with the likes of Percussion or great entertainment this film will suit you well.
