<br /> <br /> Let's say this is not the best film ever made, but I voted for 10 stars in the same way. Mainly because of my feelings in the end. I and all the people around me are just touching. This is something you do not often think of. We all are a bit flattering and frustrated over the intricacies of modernity, lazy manipulation or teaching. The final story of MEN is a story around a young woman around Jane, and a sparse friendship between Rich and Richard, a breakdown man. It may have a frustrating and valuable piece of it, but it is very ridiculous, achieving complete success in the lack of humanity and intolerance and has a good feel against inequality. <br /> <br /> Acting from Branagh and Bonham-Karter is particularly incredible and strong in his role. The picture between the two chemistry is also visible. <br /> The title comes from the title Richards, a junk-made aircraft and his old paintings. Flying here is a symbol of full life for both Richards and Johns, so that one can continue and face another. <br /> The beautiful and funny picture that I would recommend to anyone. Do not let this happen to you.
