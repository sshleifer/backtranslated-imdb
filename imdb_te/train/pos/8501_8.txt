I think the differences between the two cultures are a great example. It's a great image to show in a sociological class. I thought it was pretty funny and I must say that "I have the band and job together" plot is a sucker for the device. Many people do not know that this movie is not just comedy. It has some dramatic stuff as well and I think they mix nicely. Overall, I give a solid 8.
