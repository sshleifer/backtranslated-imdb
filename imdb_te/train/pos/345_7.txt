It is mostly boring to say the first hour or more of the film. However, it was the Valentine's Party. In addition to the twist of the killer's identity, the hot bathing scene is one of the few relatively memorable of the film. The scene in the garden with Kate was well filmed and the very last scene ('twist'). In those scenes, some of the real suspense and thrills and hot bathing murder scene has an outrageous (to be slashers of the way). Early murders discouraged.
