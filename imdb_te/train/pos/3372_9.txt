It's time to give a tribute to the great Charton Heston after a long time, but this film is not one. <br /> <br /> This film, made in 1973, attempts to publish the future land in 2022, and is manipulated by human race authorities to eat the universally produced food called "soyent green" made with human meat. It is ridiculous at the moment when this weird and inexorable film is released and at that stage the population of the population of 2 billion pounds is unknown if the meat consumers do not know. <br /> <br /> The producers of this film Unfortunately, the green message they deliver is not the greens party of today's culture. Thanks to God. <br /> <br /> New Zealand, Fiji, and Borneo started the cannibalism by local people, which had been abandoned by human civilization for 40 years before the film was taken. <br /> <br /> Another silly estimate in the film was that the film's tape of radical feminism turned out to be the backward sex slaves in 1972. <br /> <br /> The film is stupid and is quiet now. There is no reason for Edward G. Robinson's performance and return to the film other than academic reasons. <br /> <br /> It was a movie and it was not recommended for me by baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All other reviews in the film have read the same sound in reference to a dystopia society in the future, a centralized theme that appears to be just an environmental disaster occurring in the USA. <br /> <br /> The film is only the merit of the Earth.
