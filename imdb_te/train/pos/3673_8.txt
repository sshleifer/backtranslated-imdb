Back in 2004 I saw "True", Tom Tycoor's collaboration with Paris J. Tiam. I loved it and was surprised when I saw it. This was my favorite documentary and appreciated the format. <br /> Yesterday I saw the courtesy of the internet <br /> <br /> I should say that it looks great on everything. Every little and photography is beautiful in the shot, the worst being nothing special - but still clever and clear. Then I read the trivia here and in 6K all the DP's work would be more justified. Sin City-Esquire (good for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine", and "14th Arundemment" - my special favorites are "Quis de Seen" first scene. "True" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" still stunning colors (my eyes, they shiver!) And "Quartier Latin" gold imprison gold nourish me. <br /> Yes, these are some pretty short films. <br /> <br /> Let's get into content now. I thought it was so successful (and I mean a lot) that it was like exegesisism. You do not have the treatment between the same themes or two shorts, and these artists are considered limited to allowing you to explore beautiful and in-depth contents within all shorts. From a simple love story I come from a simple love story to a social commentary in a terror comedy in a weird monologue with a dear-comedy-in-Paris-barbot-shroder. I love surprises! And this film has them! It is great that they took the opportunity to inform the director's meat of things that are not common in the main movie (I have come to be hated). It's not quite experimental, but I can breathe this breathing space. <br /> <br /> I'd like a short time and love acting. I love simplicity and love love. I like simple feelings and beauty and eccactism, and generally it's a very lonely film or isolation. Just think. <br /> <br /> Previously, well, there are two shorts that are not exactly right for me - "Quais de Seine "(I think it's a good-natured, perfect and possibly necessary, but it's a commercial like) and" pere-lachis ", although I love acting, I thought the themes were forced. But it's me. "Tour Eiffel" I did not even love but maybe because of my different sensibility from the Silvine Chamet? I do not know if the film is already a special interest for people who know the actor and the directors, so they are surprised (see in a funny role for Alexander Payne) and their fundamentally "Do this director do this?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> I would definitely recommend this. Sure !!! So, see if you want eclectic beautiful love!
