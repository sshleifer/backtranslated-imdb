My comments for Vivia: - A fascinating, ideal love story featuring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us back to the families of the bride and bride sleeping on the ground, playing games together, their friendly hobbies and mutual respect. About the sanctity of the marriage of Vivah and the importance of commitment between the two people. Yes, Central Romance is fun. But romantic moments between the married couple and their courageous resistance to modern court ship games will crave for you idealism. Marriage and groom estimate that the film ends, causing burning injuries to his new bride: "I will make your dressing" <br /> <br /> Vivah - A lot of good things - the wedding of the wedding, the beauty of Indian culture, the beauty of Indian women Last but not least a nice IDEKIM waiting to get married ... playing through the rules! Simple yet beautiful; Such a simple story ... no idea ... the villain - most of Suraj Bajataya films. Suraj Sir returned to his best. He made this film complete with the method. It's a very sweet movie - the current generation teaches a very rare marriage and the good things of the union of 2 families. I think AMRITA RAO - very nice & she has acted very well. She has good scenes - but the last half an hour I thought it was absolutely right for Shaheed Kapoor - who is a majestic retire for change? I liked all others acting for the former. Chhoti means Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahid's Bro & Atta. It seemed to be real and recognizable. Another credit for his credit came after Suraj Sir Mein Pyar Kiya, Hah & Hum Sat Sath Hain. <br /> <br /> Amazing chemistry between Shahid & Amrita. <br /> <br /> All the things like the sanctity in marriage / relationship, the avoidance of courtship, the mutual respect, the protection and the place, the "official" wait for the marriage, the prayer / - are all shown here and further in Vivah. There are still some good audience watching this movie. Some of the audience / audience are already happy when they see me, they are thinking of the wedding that you've sang to me :) If you ask me the success. It was Amitabh Rao - our actress-Vivah {results for a good performance} in 2006 in the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE Award! Whether she hats herself, Vivah, Shahid or Amrita film-winner and other awards; @ At least it's Cheyy !! Recreating the beauty of Rama gives us a gorgeous look in India and to show the best role of the course of Suraj Bajtasya. Shudinat Kapoor and all others who have made it to Vivah Shudnat today as legendary !! The plot, to share the same stage as the plot of Dilip Kumar .......... That does not mean! Congratulations to Amrita Rao - To take her career with another award for this award .... I personally feel - she wants to make films with Shahid Kapoor only !! They make a beautiful couple and remind me of their screen chemistry {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla}. Some of the points I have noticed, some things: - # 1 Carefully observed, Amrita Rao is great because she always wears traditional clothes. Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapoor is very fond of us - not ready for marriage or early marriage ... but Pramam carefully listened to a step-by-step discussion given by his DAD - full confidence in Anupam Kher. In the end, "honesty" and "trust" reflected in his first conversation with Amrita. Most people do not have a first meeting with the first stranger plus enough to confirm a person for a limited time. But as I have seen in the film, I have a feeling - two people who are prepared for every one can also connect to the 1st meeting, its possible !!! # 3 overall picture - Shahid & amrita are 4 or 5 scenes when combined - or shown together. The hero & heroine are always dancing or dancing or dancing, unlike other dances / wedding-based movies - is cheap. But each of these 5 scenes are: - characterized by temperance, innocence and other respect! # 4 I really liked the relationship between Chacha Alak Nath & Amrita Rao. These films should highlight the indifference shown by daughters / girls in some parts of India. # 5 romantic scenes between the main pair are very well filmed - no less scenes and songs are beautifully shot! Words like "jal", "praarthana" e.t.c. In the story of all the girls who love this movie :) Personally, I like many dialogues in this film. # 6 is not the last - the whole hospital scene where Shahid's "cindur" is put to "Amrita" while struggling for life - is amazing. Touching those dialogues between the pair and U / LO-I-cant-do-without-U; Feeling off its a hats !!! <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** *******************************) *** IF YOU ARE ME: - Rang De Basanti, Lange Raho Munnabhai, DOR, Corporate And films like Kabul Express, VIVAH was one of the best films of 2006. In fact - I feel like Vivah is better than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all time pass / shade / style / worst films view / business !!
