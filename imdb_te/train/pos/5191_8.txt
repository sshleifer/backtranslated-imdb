Scott is correct. In the middle of the film, the best 2 person knife holds. Sword battles are not good with most warriors. However, the middle fight is best compared to Japanese samurai movies. In my opinion Chinese saw scenes can not surpass Japanese in terms of entertainment value. Particularly important is the scene of a man's battle with a group of enemies, excel of Japanese movies, for example Loan Wolf and Cub Series. Although Japanese spent only a second or a minute in the film, it made the intensity of those movements much better. But, these Chinese stories are an example of overcoming Japan. In the middle of the film, the scene fought with the most exciting choreography for five minutes. Other fights in the film are good, but they get 7 for a scene. If you do not see it, you must. John Woo man.
