I loved this film 'Spring and Port Wine'. I was born in Lee, 7 miles south of Bolton, and I went to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20. My work place daily by Fernworth is through Little Liver, and sometimes on the bike it brings back the memories of the working class neighbors almost always but they can always help you if they could. Frod Dibna Bromwich was in the corner from the saint. I have my bed. If the movie is not released at first release, you can be sorry to compare it to a soap with a soap street, I agree that it is soap, but then 'kitchen sink play!' Called. Shortly afterwards, watch the film for talented actors who often get home names from the characters on TV, I'm mainly looking for the area's shots and feeling good to be poor but poor!
