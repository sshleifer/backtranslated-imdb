Thomas Innes always has a masterpiece in bringing complete housing stories to life with fullness and skill. "Italian" is such a film. Solid acting, especially George Beben, is a real-life concept of migrant rentals in New York with the father of the silent child actor George Beban, Jr., and excellent sets. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the modern day and begins to read a story about an Italian immigrant (George Beban in modern costumes) and we mutated with the story of George migrants. He raises enough money to bring his future husband from Italy to Italy, marries her and has a son with her. But times are hard and family struggles to survive. I was not mother to my mother, and I could not avoid problems with the dirty formula, but oh well, I was surprised why the Dream Dream Factory was fitting politically correct behavior for women in 1915. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the film is that Beben is unlikely to retaliate against a criminal owner who has been in jail, and in the last minute he will decide on his plan. Very well. I loved the curtain effect, it was great. Excellent use of lighting in this picture. <br /> <br /> I will give you 10 out of 10 for "The Italian".
