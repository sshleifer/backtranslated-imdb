George and Kim travel in a remote cabin in New York with their little son Miles, whose car turns into a deer and becomes deer. But the mischievous events are just a frightening adventure movie, where the legend half-animal and half-man Wendigo, haunts a small town ... "Wendigo" by Larry Fessenden is often a thought-provoking horror film of lenderfoot into a disappointing family play. Performance is great, the characters are well developed and there are some bone-chilling moments. Wendigo's subtle climpsus is efficiently maintained and is not clear what is true and it is not clear if the stories are going entirely in Miles head. , "Wendigo" is my first introduction to Larry Fessenden's work and will not necessarily last. Give this image a chance, if you do not mind seeing something 10 to 10.
