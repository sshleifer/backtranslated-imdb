Does anyone know the exact quote about George Eddie Ecca, Pitt Fitzpatrick's "Time and Love"? They were told that they were talking to Charlie and Anna in the church. Otherwise I would rent the movie. This is a great movie. I love Serendipity too! Great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not want to be alone, <br /> <br /> "I have committed suicide and granted her love and he has denied it for 7 years . <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want, you can not do it yourself <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> No one is disappointed and do not take real love for everyone! That's the hardest story in my life. <br /> <br /> The music in this film is also amazing and meaningful! This film is DP and spiritually stimulating. Honesty is waiting for Love, if it is intended, it is, no matter, it makes it happy! This is not impossible even when the second time! Thank you!
