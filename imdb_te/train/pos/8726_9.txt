Now have a family image! Recent films that have been targeted for families or children really deserve their view of the public; But this is one of them. My whole family came away from the film, was amazed, entertained, soapy and happy. We're still citing small stories from here and there. <br /> <br /> Apart from its beautiful and amazing animation, the characters (they are small and imaginative) are well developed. You can not understand one of them. The personalities that bring these small organisms to life with voice and talent combine with the skill and artistry of Disney's best animators. This is a suitable image for Walt Disney. I think Mr. Disney is acceptable of this new film ... The hero, flick, dot and small heroes of our time can get popularity like Mickey and Minnie. <br /> It leaves the theater to see the family again and own on video or DVD. I have a lot of interest to see again .. I miss the first time. (My kids are very quick and clear and never before embrace the characters ... my daughter is still talking about the little "dot". <br /> <br /> This movie is fun for the funny, hearty, intelligent and great whole family!
