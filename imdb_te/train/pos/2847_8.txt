As it is commonly known, the volume movies are very good with American audiences (I think they prefer a standard plot line). New York, I Love You, the second stage of a series of films that deal with cities and people who live in them. First, 'Paris, JTime', I really enjoyed it. The film is made up of several sections, each directed and directed by the director (most of these are French, but there is a very funny episode directed by Joel & Ethan Cohen). Like 'Paris', it is directed by many different directors (Fatish Akin, Meera Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakir Kapoor etc.), and 'Paris' with New Yorkers, like Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricky, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Haki , And has experienced veterans such as James Ken, Chloris Lechmann, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really fly, and others can not destroy it by someone (although I suppose it depends on personal taste --- I can not reveal them working for them myself & not them). The next entry in the term is from Shanghai, China (from Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece). English is mainly spoken, but there are bits with Yiddish & Russian subtitles.
