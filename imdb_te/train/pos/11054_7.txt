My siblings and I stumbled on the champions when our local station was broadcasting a summer re-run in 1970. We will fully worship it. Compared to normal American back runs (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you get the idea), it's something exotic and mysterious about it. It has a similar style from the Avengers (British and spy / adventure generation). <br /> I would like to see you again - hopefully holding it up. I told this presentation to others and nobody listened to it, I thought it was anticipated by its entire existence. But the web has allowed me to keep track of it. Hopefully it will find new generation fans.
