Eddie Izzard is nothing short of funny genius, and this is Eddie at his very best. His subject was very witty and happy, and his delivery platform was the best test. Instead of insulting the audience's intellect, he relies on his wardrobe preference, Hitler, moon landing, and humor from the British. With the most memorable laughter, one can not help, but some of his lines can not be repeated. Never, "Do you have a flag?" Should always be considered one of the ridiculous lines delivered in stand-up routine. Top Stripe Standup is a fan of every fan of "Kill to Kill". The best British stand-up comedian I've ever seen, Eddie Ezzard was not able to win the live style. Nevertheless, it should not indicate how loyal his honesty is because he is not commercially successful in the film. "Kill to Kill" is a treasure, luckily going to the home video, and can enjoy again and again.
