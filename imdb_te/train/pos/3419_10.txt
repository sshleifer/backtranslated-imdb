From Iraq, Camp Anaconda Medical Support Unit, my 23 yr old daughter from one year just had "welcomed home", I was forced to get this DVD. I wanted to listen to the feelings of the other back vets to make me not wait until something awaiting to return something bad to understand her mentality on arrival. This film works as a great start to start emotional vacuum of our vets all the Americans regardless of the war and peace on your take. There is "Take Action" on the Paramount ad issue of the entire image. Incredibly emotional image. <br /> <br /> My daughter has seen this DVD. She took into consideration emotions and actually made a commitment to retain another 6 years. She took the time she spent in the sand, she did some good. Local Balad children have the first rate of medical rate for various general ailments that typically do not buy free with escort and translator. She appeared on her shoulder in Iraq tour. "We've changed some hearts and minds out there" Great DVD you have to keep an open mind and look at all sides
