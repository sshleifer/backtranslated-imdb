I have seen the DVD of this movie, which comes with excellent commentary track (in English). Cambodia (subtitle in English spoken in Thai, Cambodia says) is the training of children who have killed the most violent scapegoats to fight and kill the appetite. He will kill some people in China and send claws, killing a partner in rape. Cop Woi is a loose artillery who suffers from his father, he is shot and comma. Wie's chief is concerned about his father's friend and unwelcome behavior of Yi. He grabbed his father in his dealings with drug dealers and sent him to a coma. Pong escapes and meets a woman who meets her mother and repeats her father (Pong does not speak with the Chinese and she does not understand but she preserves her) appears to have a sexual relationship with her father, which can cause Cat III). Vai Pong has become more engaged, but Pong is almost unstoppable. Pong steals a boat and takes her to his married wife and becomes pregnant and meets herself with the evil (the trainer for the boys) to fight and obtain the dragon. The terrible repugnant woman had a huge showdown between Yi and Pong with the main victim and left him as the next boy to kill the dead pong and kill him to die and die as a killer. The film is made with a beautiful soundtrack. There are very brutal violent scenes. A long nail woman pulled her feet off. Knives to the neck and torso. Guns straight to the head. And many very serious blows. It's probably serious and downbeat is terrible but definitely worth watching.
