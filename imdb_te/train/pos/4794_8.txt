It's David Lynch's immensely, but for change - the life-cementing history of Alvin Straits Travel, but it takes patience for it to stick. While Straight's slowly moving as John Deere, when he meets some kind of stunt on his pilgrimage, he learns more about aging, painful regret and mysteries and ultimately family and reconciliation power.
