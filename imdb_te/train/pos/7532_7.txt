Batman: The final episodes of the animated series (B: TAS) are broadcasted only five years after the New Batman Adventures (also known as Gotham Nights) and 24 episodes. It's not a terrible appearance, but it's not as good as the original Batman animated series. <br /> <br /> The first thing, animation: long and sweet, Gotham is not dark anymore, the sky is always red and the orange, b: this made it, but it was drawn on a dark palate, the color of the sky is more ominous In this exhibition, the color of the sky is very bright. Everyone seems to be like other children who do not look like Batman: TAS with Gotham, cool art style on Gotham. Art style is okay, but do not remind me of Batman. Each character has straight lines, squares and triangles, which appear as characters less human. In the original series (B: TAS), the characters appear as realized versions of the drawings. B: The animation may be more stable than TAS, but it's definitely not good. <br /> Next: Some parts appear to be very dull and kid, but some are stronger than TAS in B: (Two faces trying to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2 are some harsh treatment). <br /> <br /> In the future, as Batman needs to think about the last episodes of the animated Universe, many villains will either die or lose their lives. Poison ivy is clearly sinking when a cruise ship explodes; Two-penguin penguin, killer krok and kill him, so he went to Yercaum; The Joker falls on an exhaust tower of an industrial plant (he returns later in the Justice League animated series); Catwoman goes away from France leaving Batman ... The series is over and they do not mean to get rid of some great characters! The intentions of the villains are pretty bad. Nothing! In B: TAS, we learn that these villains are mentally tormented and destroyed their lives, so they do this, in the event, the villains commit crimes to advance this story. Although Batman does not even care about the remaining capacity of the warring people, he will hit them to the innocents. This is a cool and diminished version of Batman's character, but since he's been doing this job for years, he can see why he's so tough. <br /> <br /> Redesigning role models: they are awful. Gordon slimmed down about 100 pounds ... was he sick? Most villains include STUPID (Joker, Ridler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter, and Killer Crock in Worth). However, I think some characters are good (Bane, Scarecrow, Bat Girl). <br /> <br /> There are many mistakes in this series, some episodes are cool - Edge, Mad Love, Bear the Creeper, Girls Night Out, Old Wounds, The Legends of the Dark Knight, and Never Fear, Favorite. <br /> <br /> All the crossovers shown by Batman in the Superman animated series are great. <br /> <br /> The absolute WORST episode about the show, the creators say that they prefer the animation of the range rather than the original. They talk about the DVD features of the original Batman animated series, about how proud they are with the art style, and how some characters are popular, but in the end they are difficult to animate Clayface (for example, on DVD features of the new Batman adventures, "B with T: Hell, it's fresh and new <br /> <br /> It's not a bad performance, but I still do not like the original animated series - at least the show is its audience Because of that, I still recommend it.While some parts of this new series are awesome and worth watching. <br /> <br /> Superman: ID Animated Series and Justice League: The Animated Series Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures is a great follow-up to the Show.
