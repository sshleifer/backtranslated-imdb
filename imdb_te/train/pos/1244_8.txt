I first saw this movie on television a few years ago and apparently loved it. Charles Dance was one of the most horrific villains that anyone had ever imagined. His sophistication is brilliantly contrary to the good hero. I've never seen an Eddie Murphy fan but I recognize his irritating role as a winner: a bit of "Axel Foley Through The Looking Glass". Charlotte Lewis, using a hacknain term, but only one applicable, bright, superb. Some scenes have been created wonderfully: the dream scene, the bird, the silly fight scenes, and the confused confrontation. Through it all Murphy's modern man suddenly fell into Oriental myth, Kurt Russell's stunned and peaceful version of his oriental fantasy romp. Like the film, we're James Hong, despite its unmatched actor, whose scenes increase Derek's quality. Since 1955, Hong has defined a career as a "career law" of his career. "Golden Child" crazy; This is not accurate; But the most pleasurable and fun fantasy has the most zealous features that are worth looking at. Four years later I saw again the "Golden Child"; I enjoyed more! It's really fun too.
