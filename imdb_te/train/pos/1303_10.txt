Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker have reconstituted their songs since the 35th anniversary of their trilogy called "cream". That's the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys looked at it: all thinner, very long hair, jungle clothes and loud music. They played a mix of rock and blues, and this was a great piece of material. <br /> <br /> These guys are now at the age of 60 and they still show and high level shows us this wonderful DVD concert disc. I have always been familiar with Clapton, however, never ever come out, but Bruce and Baker have no hopes, for whom I have not seen for decades. They were surprised at me. When he was young, he appeared as a speed freak near Baker's death. Now he is healthy, looks in shape and his drum game is solid. Bruce looked a bit bizarre but his voice was as good as ever and a joy to hear these old songs. It's just amazing stuff and show off from the guys who are learning what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Some people have criticized the program for being less-key. I do not agree with that. I have no complaints. The concert is great. The second song, "Spoonful", is the highlight of my concert. <br /> Most recommended.
