The photography of this bid-budget product is surprisingly bad. Colors are muddy and a very 80ish look of wheat and photography. Directing and editing is often a lot of uninspired and TV-movie. The film first aims to torture its viewers with sensational images of sex and violence. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's score is a simple and smooth work of this overdrawn, desolate composer. <br /> <br /> If you still love watching the film, the most moving family story is the version of the European Edna Ferber's Epsom Giant. You wonder why Clara married this idiot, and his character is even more profound and more judged by him. Clara gives her a spiritual lesson, a great and moving statement against the terrible events in her country. At the beginning of his international career with his daughter, his lover, young Antonio Banderas, understands that lesson and ultimately tries to live it. The plot was built with the start of the mirror. All the actors do a great job. I'm wondering "who's the actress who plays Blanca?" All the time, but of course, it was a really young Winona rider <br /> In all, this film really made me want to read the book.
