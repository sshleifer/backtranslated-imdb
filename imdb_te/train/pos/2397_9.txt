After watching and beloved by Greg Lombardo's most recent film "Knots" (co-authored and directed by him), I decided to check out his previous work, and the film was very valuable for labor and rent. A tongue in Macbeth's cheek in Manhattan, the spectacular Shakespearean favorite actress, has been updated and moved to NYC. I was impressed by the script's underlying wit and intelligence and wowed through the plot of the storyline drama glasses in the movie story - and very cleverly at that. The lives of trials and tribulations in Manhattan are very shakespeare play, and Central Park is rarely better used than the surrounding forests of Macbeth. Mr. Lambard is clearly a fanatical place in his heart for New York and New York stories (Knots is a funny and warm sex comedy about New Yorkers, a good measure for Manhattan offices and downtown grass) and a considerable amount of time around Shakespeare's plays. The film is well-known and the story reflects a deeper understanding of the important drama in Macbeth's major part. Another amazing Shakespeare "play in a movie" - it reminds me of Al Pacino's "Looking for Richard". I recommend to check Macbeth in Manhattan.
