I never heard of this film until I was crossed by the IMDB while browsing. I saw that I got very serious reviews. In fact I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it was really good film. I saw a group of friends and we laughed more than most recently acclaimed Hollywood fluffy comedy shows. It's a standalone movie and the simple thing is that it portrays its subject (sex and dating) without Hollywood Forgery. I specifically suspect that the public opinion of the film depends very much on their life experience. You can not get these pictures if you have never dared or parted because you can not meet people like these characters. If you have it, you'll recognize in many cases where you are filmed in funny fashion. The ending is very good, and in contrast to many Hollywood movies, women are not as real, helpless, virgin romantics.
