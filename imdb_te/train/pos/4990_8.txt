As noted by other critics, this is an unfairly depressed-era film. Written by Frank Borghaz (directed by two Oscars) and Joe Swirling (Leave Her to Heaven, The Western, Lifeboat etc.), which is hard-thinking about the residents of New York City Shantown. They were forced into adultery, beggars, and women into adultery, but they were a community of good and evil people, complicated loyalties like any group. <br /> <br /> The most popular features of the film are probably the difference between the primary Spencer Tracy's character, Bill, and Loretta Young's trinity. He is not the burden of a constant sense of survival - he's tough-talking, physically aggressive, and apparently fearless. If he blusters, Trina actually hangs rough (that word can be applied to a character so ladylike). His devotion to him is obvious, and complete. When she is pregnant, she says that if she wants to leave she will raise herself, or "I'm glad you leave the kid." The performance of Lauretta Young (at age 20) is weak in her, she does not feel weak or dependable, but a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds, and nothing more.
