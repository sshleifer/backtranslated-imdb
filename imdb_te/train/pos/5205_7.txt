An American group of religions and their preacher decides to visit the most extreme part of Ireland to study ancient religious practices. <br /> <br /> If you have been repeatedly warned about the dangers that can be halted (local creepy Irish Guy, Nach), they do the job, and the outside of their difficulty with the outside of the cannibal family in their neighborhood. <br /> <br /> If you have sex with porn stars and low budget horror And if you think it's equal to terrible tons, act, then think again: Dark Breed An adult stars, but of course, not be involved in everything from the Oscar means "talent" provided, and expected performance, almost no nudity. Bad (except Gingar Lin Allen, we can do wonderful French 'as we know, but its Irish is lousy). <br /> <br /> The Evil Breed opens the striking style with the brilliant killing of the brilliant two couple: After a few short-lived canvas sexs, the silicon is a better hottie pulled from the tent, half torn; The guy is cut off his hands and feet and is baked on a spit. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after the onset of this, things begin to go deep and deep: we have a disturbing bunch of lead characters, twenty somethings become just cannibal chow chow, and are subject to a fair amount of waste in the form of some terrible false scares, Weirdo is a lot of blarney about murders druids from Gary (Simon Peacock), and some of the worst, horror films of all P-srim, post-modern conversations (how intelligent!). <br /> Then, this film never gets better, director Christian Well takes a serious decision: a man raises his head over his head and handsome blonde Gillian League (but there is an absurd sex-in-the-shower scene that has a porn star) needs). Later, the cannibals grow rapidly when abandoning the top meat-eating gear, and the film is transformed into a veritable blood vessel: Gary spoils his donkey (about time) and screams with his intestines; Ginger Lin kick boxes are a mutant; Jenna Jameson was released, exiled and her silicon breast implant strangled through a messy manger; A person receives a penalty by a cheese wire; <br /> <br /> Taylor Hayes was naked in the midst of bloody, wounds and between her legs with a dead fetus (specifically her possession and use of fertility). <br /> If all this is, the less interesting things are worthwhile, and the last rating of 7/10 earns Evil Breed. <br /> <br /> Christian Viell finally left the project due to a very troublesome product and studio intervention. The back was shot, and the gore was heavily cut for a US release. The good news does not flow as well as the film, and a terrible ending, the UK DVD (I watched version) appears to be quite relatively intact as Sweeze's concern (13 of the whole movie have been cut only).
