This film is so bad, it is not even funny. If you see this stuff to shoot, be clear. This must face a survivor and a survivor. Even the detectives we all answer the answer ... why? Stunning acting from the two prominent women we see how we ignore affects the same things we're affecting. Yes language is sometimes hard, but it is well suited to the characters. Some loose ends are left or unanswered, but in all the movies. The main problems will solve and this movie makes a major statement about how we feel about all the adults after such major events. Highly recommended for teens and adults.
