I really liked this version of Emma. Kate Beckinsale is so amazing that Emma and Mark are strong enough. I can not complain that I am in Mr Woodhouse. A man can not believe that many of his daughter's life is eating or selfish with his selfish life. As always, I love places where these zen Austin movies are shot. The settings are so spectacular. I would like to visit a very good England like Ireland and Scotland). The actors selected for the film are the most awesome alternative to Emma and all other story lines. I'm glad I came to see this one.
