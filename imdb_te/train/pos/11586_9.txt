Someday is going to write an essay comparing Paul Nussie's "Woolfman's Fury" to great Spanish surrealist films, "LDD" or "Unchain Andelue." Naschie is the best work of ambition from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br / > Dalí and Bunuel probably liked it, and eat their hearts to see what they were supposed to do to remove their brains. <br /> A mishmash about the "A Professor Walterman" for a "B" to a "B" - his first name, you mind - a Yeti monster bemoan during the Tibetan trip and it is understandable, one of his jealous colleagues, the famous daughter of famous Dr. Wolfstein, And knows that his wife is cheating on him. <br /> <br /> "Walterman" He is a wolf, a wolf, some murdered, buried, buried, anuburized, wrapped in circus freaks, wired to various engines, grouped with classical electronic effects, embedded with powerful amicors, mixed, switched to a sheep, with a thigh maximum Nazi fetish boots A woman in a gown whip him, Avoiding him, pretty, female doctor will help to recover from the castle, circus bizarrely deprives an ax, and his cheating wife, he finally returned to the wolves of the women will have to fight against the wolf incarnate. The woman with Nazi boots burns her from the lugger pistol with silver bullets, they die together, and the doctor goes to the studio reporter who does nothing until the morning. "See! What a lovely day!" <br /> <br /> "La Furious del Hobri Lobo" Paul Naschie wrote in a hurry. Original Director Enrique Euglez was dismissed and replaced by José María Zabolzá, who was drunk in an intoxicating drug throughout. He was unable to work frequently (it was time for his 14-year-old nephew to make some changes to the script) and Naschie directed the most neglected film. Jabulja rallied to make some action scenes in Nashchi's previous films "Wolfman Mark". The scenes were quite different, but luck was enough to use twice, and Zadal helped the run out of Zabalza's refusal to get out of bed to finish the film. Post production is a nightmare. No one was aware of the editing, the money was gone, the Masterprint had been disappeared for a while, then a film distributor went into the dirty kidney before the executive Jabalja Theater in the pre-release screening. <br /> <br /> If you have an image that works somewhere else, you can leave it. We are surprised memories of movable castles, fence tombs, chains, whips, and dark twigs. Although such fans are hypnotically viewable, the whole story does not make much sense because of the breakdown of the breakdown implemented. Pouring it in a scene with rain and Wolfman lightning procession; The bone is powder in the next shot and he is louder at the full moon. Then it's raining again. And yet you do not see it as a gaffe. There is a dying dream where conflicts exist, the oppositions are identical and the causes of the effects continue; Wolfman first gains power cable and shouts, then the cable creates electricity. People say it's affecting the low budget - if they have more money to spend, I'd say the film is undesirable. This is a miracle that does nothing, and not because of the results it achieved, but because of it. It's easy to laugh in these things and it's easy to remove it easily. <br /> <br /> Paul Naschki died when he was 75 years old. He is ill with pancreatic cancer. A year or more, working on film production projects until his last days, but with his family, Madrid, Spain passed away while he was receiving chemotherapy treatment. His great, varied, and surprisingly long career is a legacy of the one who strenuously follows his artistic perspective in the face of universal mainstream discontent. And yet all of us have an eleven-year-old kid who watches his movies like "Woolfman Fury" in awe-inspiring awe. People who do not like Euro Horror will be surprised if it is just a minute in one of the pictures. You can watch it for free in the archive or buy on a DVD for a nickel. It's very valuable. <br /> <br /> Many others in the film have seen all of these films. The mess of the problems he encountered during the production and the subsequent film was probably an artistic disappointment for Naschie to forgive. I do not intend to pardon him, but I would say: "Wolfman Fury" churning out at this or any weekend swine flu cineplexes in a full-screen public publication that is stronger, cut and deformed, even though I was rather sarcastic and vulgar. <br /> <br /> The world has lost a great artist this month. <br /> <br /> Remember his pictures and remember. <br /> <br />
