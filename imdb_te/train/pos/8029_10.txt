I'm with the curiosity of the rifle using the rifle in this movie, and the talent of the bullet that he thinks has been shot. If I rely on Carlos Hathock's sniping, I guess it's a 7 mm. Round. I'm also interested in the gun. He commented on a rifle that could be used by a Vietnam man in his final sniper movie from his father. Beckett notes that the best sniper rifle ever made. I also want to know it's a rifle. I know this particular rifle was made in WWII or early. <br /> <br /> For killing Mr. Hathoks, his long shot was 1.47 miles, and he killed 93 people and killed 14 people without confirmation. After his brief shot in Vietnam, he trained skiers in the USMC for the rest of his career. His sniping profession is still referenced to our brothers and sisters trained in the USMC. I have found his name from my friend who is a former marine. Any information is great.
