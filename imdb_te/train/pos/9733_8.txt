'How Friends Are Losing and How To Make People' is an entertaining, loose, adaptation of Toby Young's memoirs of the same name. It's also a great title for helping to fill the line in the IMDb reviews! The primary incident is something like a dramatic book, but a romantic narrative has been added and the end is definitely Hollywood. Simon Pegg, despite playing the irritating person, is his favorite and funny self and pretty much in this movie. Just a few years ago he was wondering how he was just a TV sitcom and now he is rubbing shoulders with Hollywood names. A good support cast and an amusing, easy watch - a male 'Ugly Betty' variety, but funnier.
