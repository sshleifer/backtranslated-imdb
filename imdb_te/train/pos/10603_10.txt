I'm constantly following my 4 and 5-year-old daughters to look like Nickelodean, Disney and the like. It's all old and old tired cartoons again over and over again. Since my daughters could not go to the afternoon this afternoon, one of them was ill, and I wanted to take a rest and relax. I left the TV and looking for something else, and I just left the channels alone. My finger stopped Harry's voice and stopped surfing the moment. Every single thing that this man has done is that I worship and when he sees that he is working over a little duck ... Well, I can not change the channel! My daughters were instantly enchanted by the cartoon and we saw the show together, and I loved the message I painted. It is not a proponent of "rights to homosexuality", but not for anyone who has ever been expelled for children. I have friends who have chosen for one thing or another .... Very fat, too skinny, too feminine, being a bully, being smart enough, having only one parent .... You name it! Kids, as a rule, are very cruel to someone else, so I'm happy to see an entertaining cart that tells audiences an LIFE message. My girls are already accepting others and do not take others to be different. My eldest daughter actually stands up for her friends if they choose (having a single Mom and that little girl is taken too often - hot in my heart when Cassie is standing for her!). <br /> <br /> You have lost the point of this sharp little cartoon, because you feel that you're being forced to "grant some rights" to the "homosexual rights" If needed ... you need more help than any television show.
