A bit quirky and bad taste borders; But as intelligent enough to see. Jane Hachard (Helena Bonham Carter), a wheelchair-bound lady, was averse to Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist, a daily flight on a human flight. He builds an airplane in his garage and wants to fly it. He wants to restore his own troubled life by killing Jane, who is suffering from neurological disease, with his speech and very low motor skills. Wheelchair-bound and spirit-filled, her last stomach desire loses her virginity. Richard does not directly help her. But the document is ready to loot a bank to pay off Gigolo. I have seen this film ambitious and funny. Also in this role, Carter is a particular attraction and favorite.
