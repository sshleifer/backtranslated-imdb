From the 1990s on Aston Images location, it's my favorite, which is more than "peruation", which changed me to Austinia. Before seeing this "Emma" I saw two previous versions, but as a Lady Teziel in a Emma, ​​everything was wrong and the other seemed to be half as bad as she was, but here she is right and young and silly and stubborn. Normally I know the product's perspective and the charm of the atmosphere of the novel is well known; In fact I was one of the most beautiful and not great items I had ever seen before, but not the nature of Christmas. The script is exceptionally well and the adapter's attachments, such as the grass of light that reveals Emma's Harriet in the church, are all kept. Knightley was not as strong as I expected, but I was very happy with him: he emphasizes the plain-speaking, practical feelings of the character of Emma and his chaotic perspectives against Frank Churchill are very funny. Bernard Haypton Mr. Woodhouse is almost a person of carolion absurdity; Samantha Morton is absolutely soft as Emma's invasion and she is sure to be sure. In the same productions of "Pride and Prejudice", finally the roots of the characters can be believed - especially in some cases. I have this product and that's a pleasure.
