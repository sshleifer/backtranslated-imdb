When I saw Napoleon Dynamite I saw it cracker bag. Just never stooping the beautiful sentiment and being soppy yet. Some amazing cinematography and the main girl is very intelligent. It will be captured more than nostalgia of time. It's a real heart. Childhood Achilles injury that is sensitive and painful. A simple story is always effective when done correctly. This Glendine Ivin is a big future and I'm looking for his next project, for one. Following is always a very special thing. It is the second album to be the blues of many. <br /> His next film is not like a shark movie. Cheers for everyone. Enjoy your movie.
