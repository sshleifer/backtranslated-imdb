First, I thought the ring would be more than normal picture than normal plots. I was amazed! Of course, the plot is simple - a girl fall in love with two men - but with Hitchcock's laughter and fear, brings us to a silver platter, with compassion and anguish. He exhibits a fairly popular crowd, the ability to attract the girl to both, the tragic things that come together with the most open minds of his great films (North West, North West, Rope, etc.).) The master has done greatly in front of his thirties!
