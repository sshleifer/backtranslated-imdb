There are funniest jokes from this cheek & chang flix. This is the first thing I saw with these people. I realized this was really good. My dad really recommends me get it. What a great role model, and my grandma actually bought it for me, knowing what it's like. I have a family. Well this movie is good and the rental is great if you want to see a good classic. However I should warn you, it's not gut-busting funny. It's not as funny as it has its moments but it's something about Mary. Check it out. I'll laugh. Except your anti-drug activist or something.
