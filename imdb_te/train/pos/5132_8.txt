Jazz fans will fund their work in this classic mini-show jazz's best men. <br /> <br /> Jazz men give us extra treat to Mary Bryant's person singing a classic version of Sunny Side of the Street. I heard her sing before, Bryant sounds extraordinarily like Billy Holliday. It's a compliment to them. <br /> They also have their instrument. The black cinema of its time is full of white stereotypes, the film is viewed and wealthy. Great product values, just a lot of good music.
