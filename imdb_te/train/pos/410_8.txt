Every day I rented the movie on DVD, part of the winter marathon watching movie every night. Many awesome American Action Adventure Movies (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life) Zhu Warriors made me brilliantly the original filmmaker. The story is full nonsense, but I found the lack of loyalty, good-heartedness and refreshing irony of the film, and the picture looks stunning. Certainly, the special effects are so flawless that technically technically produced by Hollywood but the filmmakers are more interested in the color, composition and movement more intelligently than the realism and the shots are very breathtaking. In one shot, supernatural characters stand on two pillars of rocky stumps, a big moon rising in front of them, and the image balance the three elements perfectly. On the other, she is like a missile that heats hot by the sky behind the bright-knife with a princess-warrior pillar. And colors are used rather than expressing emotion to represent reality, explode from shotgun., /> <br <br /> The comic book characters have the same simplicity and directness, offering themselves deep depth, but resonating more deeply to refer to the archtypes. Physically, most of the actors are amazingly beautiful. Even though they lack the skill of all the novelty <br plot and thin characters, I found too close to the tears at the end, and so naturally without their straightforwardness, sarcasm or fraud. <br> Moved and <br /> <br /> Actual, good-hearted vision of actors' beauty and simplicity of the director. <br /> <br />
