The entertainment of the 1959 murders in Kansas's 1959 murders, based on the captat book, was shot in Brooks and Cinematographer's Hall Black and White, offering a documentary feel. There are good performances as a police chase killers and forecasts from Blake and Wilson. The scenes that led to the murders were shot in the original home of the crime scene, with the sound of the Aesop's windstorm, very intense and chilling. Brooks is very enthusiastic and uses many interesting transformations between the scenes. The only complaint is that it is a little longer, with the denomination pulled out and somewhat preachy.
