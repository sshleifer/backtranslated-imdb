Really, some of the 'kajones' showed when Antony was made. He went to America where he worked on contract with most luxurious studio (MGM) and created the most horrific picture of the American society I have ever seen. After seeing LA first hand, the most accurate role of rush, exaggeration and innocent city. <br /> If Antonio meets Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The burial of the studio after such a short and tedious return. I believe that Antonioni proved to be the right thing to see this movie. Where he predicts the end of the hippie / civil rights movement in American politics. Everyone is more interested in their pockets and the relentless expansion of the unpaved (yet beautiful) desert and living space. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> I would like people to look at Jabrisky Point with an open mind and an open heart. <br /> <br /> We have forgotten about it, commenting on a pure and unique image on a turn in the history of the most powerful nation on the planet. <br /> The unexpected gem.
