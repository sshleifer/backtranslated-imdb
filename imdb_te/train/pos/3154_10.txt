This program is a delightful joke! Jokes are original, God and I love Eric and Kelso! Yes, after 8th season Eric and Kellso were not on this show because they were not funny, and Randy was a real dumblass. Randy, Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can remove the funniest characters and change the "I'm a cool person" (Randy). It is not his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny, which is still not in the early seasons, but it's not alright. <br /> <br /> The 360's are awesome, Circle, Red Mental-Misuse Father is the real kind :) and Kitty has always been halfway over halfway. Hyde tries to cool all the time, he also has his moments. At least favrioutes characters include Jackie and Donna. They're cool, but without Kelso and Eric. <br /> The great event. Dumbass!
