I've seen the Thin Man series - Powell and Loy is definitely great, but there's something so sweet about Pawel and Arthur's chemistry in this film. Jean Arthur Shinez when she was at Powell. Between them is a vivid internally buzzing. The film may not have the intelligence of the thin man series, but it is mesmerizing. When I see it, I'm sure Powell is carrying an off-screen deal with Arthur. My friends felt the same. At this point, I have a movie that I want to come back (removing the breath and laugh with Powell) and there's no end to his lovely fun smiles! Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, is perhaps the closest thing to "perfect man". Well, this path is very tight, but I can not help.
