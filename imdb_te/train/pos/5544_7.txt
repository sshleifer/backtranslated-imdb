The PRC was poorly low, making this mood a gold medal with a short thriller. <br /> <br /> "Strangler" is basically a set of film, fog and shadows, and does not hide or set sets of techniques that use very poor series studios. But here, it works well. Charles Middleton's ghost (known as Ming the Merl√®s) churches around the swamp killing the murderers of his misdemeanors and creating some sympathy from the viewer. His last victim is Ferrerman's daughter ... He looks directly at his fate, but also with his relatives. <br /> <br /> A simple simulation by Rosemary Laplan is someone of the coma going to her acting style. She refuses to kill her and offers herself to the stranger to cut audiences, and the stranger's goodness has completed his mission and that he will return again and remember that he will be punished somewhat. Ullmer (directed by "Dietour") directed by "Strongler" would hang from the nearby tree and the stranger would complete the job. But who is the complainant? It is not the main attraction story, but the covers set, lighting and simple mood of the piece. It is the best hour of the PRC behind "Dewey"
