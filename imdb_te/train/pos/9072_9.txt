I remembered this as one of my favorite books as a child and now I want to read my 5-year-old daughter. I knew that the book was coming soon so we went to the library and went to the book and gave us preview papers the following day! We went home and spent the afternoon reading the book. No need. The only thing common between the book and film is the fact that the main characters' first name, a bet, and the amount of eating a worm is quite a lot. Oh, I almost forgot, the kid who cooks a lot of worms liked to present his masterpieces to the French voice. How to bet, the number of worms that must be eaten, the time frame in which he has to eat worms, how they cooked, the progress of friendship, climax scenes, etc., nothing. But somehow it did not destroy the movie. The characters are all enjoyable, and the picture does not leave me disappointed. Careful for parents, it was a moment when the adults in the room could hear their breath together and when Billy's little brother referred to his penis as his "masculine dick". When our daughter asked those sitting around us an awkward episode came, "Who knows better?" LOL. The movie and the occasional "closing" film gets the foul o'clock. My daughter thought she was sick around her worm 3 and 4 (and just holding the blank nacho container in the case) but it was fine by the worm. She and I both enjoyed the movie really and enjoyed a wonderful time sharing experience.
