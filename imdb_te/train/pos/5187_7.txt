This series is similar to what you expect from Mr. Spalberg. It really is one of those frightening, funny, childish performances that you do not forget. Just like the outer limitations (another great performance) this little series does not do much. It's great, and is deserved to run longer. It was a great show and kids could see, but some of the exhibitions were somewhat scary, but they were all at the end (such as the Twilight Zone) that you end up with what you realized or did not want what you did. I remembered seeing some of these in science fiction when I was 10, and now I am still enjoying it when I see them. Really a fun, fantastic performance. I liked it, and still do.
