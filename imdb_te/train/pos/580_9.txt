When I see this movie, I am with my father. He encouraged him to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites. After seeing this movie, it became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> One river flows It is the two brothers who bring a different way of life for everyone. Norman McLean (Craig Shepher) is the eldest of two brothers and he is placed in academic line. Paul McLean (Brad Pitt) travels in a way filled with a rebel young brother. These characters follow their own way. </ P> <p> This film is not a problem. You'll get fun through the whole route. Acting, directing, and script are all perfect. Unusual two things cinematography and score. Robert Redford wants to enter the world. <br /> <br /> It is a remarkable film that is a classic. It's definitely in my book. You can see this movie if you can never see it.
