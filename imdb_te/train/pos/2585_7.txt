There is a rare gem that you have not seen or you do not even hear this. In the 80s, Dennis Quaid was a hot body, but disappeared from the Dennis Quaid scene in the early 90s. In 1993, he hit three screens on the big screen, all of which unfortunately had a bomb attack. <br /> <br /> "Verdal Napalm" is a silly movie about two brothers Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arles Howard). There are ... fire starters: yes they have the power of pyrokinetics. <br /> <br /> The Wild has decided not to use his power after the rape incident on his youngster. He and his brother killed a house that had left him, and he had them. Nowadays, Wilder is married to a firefighter and whiskey (Debra Winger), who is under house arrest, embarkment (see film to better understand). Wallace did not speak to Wallace in five years because Wallace put her hair on fire at her bachelor party. <br /> Wallace prefers his pirate authority and uses it as a fun way. He runs the carnival and the head clown. When Carnival Wilder arrives in town, Wallace decides to meet again with his brother and decides to see Wade, Wallace is in love! Vida's home detention sees its end, but Wilder is engaged. So, Wallace begins with the steps and fun. Brother vs. Brother ... fire with fire! <br /> <br /> Some great fireball throwing in this film ... Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> In this movie, Wilder firefighters during the firefights and after the wards are singing songs. Jim Warne (known worldwide as 'Ernest') as Wallace's Red Neck Carnival Friend. "Wilder Naplm" is brilliantly painted ... and sits wisely ... far off the wall and the off guard guard. <br /> <br /> Give it a look ...
