Prix ​​de Butte was created to change the sound from silence, a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. It was initially silent, with a dubbing soundtrack in France, with the lines of French actress Louis Brooks, but silently released in Italy and other parts of Europe. I am very fortunate to see the immense new revival of the Italian silent print of Sinatech de Bologna in Tribeca Film Festival. I did not see the talkie version yet, but I thought the quiet version was very satisfying, since the dubbing was poorly finished (louis bruks clearly speaks in English, so it is not enough how her lips are). In addition, the film is made entirely silent, some titles and less for dialogue No need. Prix ​​de Butte tells his story with a visual, imaginative, imaginative camera-work. The inauguration was instantly dynamic, the fast-cut scenes and swimmers of urban life broadcasting on the open beach. Visual attention is reflected throughout the film, symbols of clothing, machinery, decoration, and painted bird, singles photographs, and a diamond bracelet. <br /> <br /> Louis Brooks is responsible for protecting the film from darkness. This will only remove the heart, reflecting that it is her last acting character. Beautifully beautiful, she dominates the film and gives a more natural and more grossing performance. Here she is well aware of her character, Pubst movies, a woman who has a very meaningful and sympathetic woman. She plays the role of her future husband, Lucian Garnier, to stay away from her lifestyle and secretly entering a beauty contest and earning immediate success. She has a glamorous new life enthusiasm and she experiences her love for the one who emphasizes her giving or losing her. All characters have a nuance. The fiancée has inspired Jalie and not just a brute: he loves Lucien, but she is unable to attract her limited person from him or attract other men's attention. <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ************************* *************** Caution: Bottom Spoirs ****** <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The film ' She is a housewife, her mourning, potatoes, and the coincidence of the cuckoo clock indicates the time behind her; A nightmare tour, Luyenne, was critically reduced between low lives and her husband Macho's criticism in the right-of-the-fair (in the silent version, after her marriage at the end of the film), she was unable to move on to her current existence; Particularly the final view in the projection room she sees on the talkie screen test. Louise Brooks did not appear to be more beautiful than she was here, she was brought on her shoulders in the Albert profile, her shoulders were cut in white fur, her face shone with her hair and her face shining on her screen. Her delicate corpse on the screen and the double shot of her still alive film is particularly sharp: louis vuitton outlet, Louis Brooks film, despite her disappointing failed film career.
