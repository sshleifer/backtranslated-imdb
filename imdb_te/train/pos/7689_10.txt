This black community was in front of crack epidemics, gangsta rap and AIDS that surrounded the tubes in the eighties. Good, hard working families and all the sufferings and difficulties they suffered. Black America is a different group of seventies. Six-time civil rights movements are still waiting and flying high, times are hard but still worth fighting. Keepin 'water on your head, made you a wave, this show showed how the black society worked hard to work together with people and families, before laying each other and everyone in order to survive the ghettos horror. It is heartbreaking to see that there are black pipes up to now and what they see now.
