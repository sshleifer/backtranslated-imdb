The film starts an aggressive, slightly slow moments in the middle, but usually moves well, having very good moments, and then finally ends Act 3. I was able to see LA Premier 2 times (with 2 different subjects). Jason Lee is an actor, but he does not hesitate to man. He was ridiculous and had his own, but he worked as a good assistant actor. Julia Styles makes her 'okay' in the new comedy role, but she does not steal the film, she must be the star of the caliber. It is difficult to see how much of an 'average' character is going on for a very talented actress (10 Things, Last Dance O, O), after which she does not play the role and is featured in the movie (in Daniel's Day-Lewis 'Gangs'). Selma Blair is a good young actress, and does a 'OK' job. I did not expect her an Academy Award, and she did not give me one, but her appearance was adequate. Chris Koch offers another movie on 'above average'. Perhaps the problem is more than anything in the script. I like this film! But it is not a movie that you have read and studied ... 'It's great!' ... This story has been 'repeatedly. Not quite new here. The rehearsal dinner scenario is the best of the film, and Larry Miller gives a brilliant performance in the supporting role (he might be the best surprise of the movie). If you want to see pictures of laughing a few times and want to have a happy evening, I can still recommend this movie, but unless they do not end up, go back to the church scene, or you'll definitely be disappointed.
