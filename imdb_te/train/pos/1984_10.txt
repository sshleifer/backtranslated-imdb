One of the finest music ever made, is timeless and one of the time and again seen value. Delicious! Acting was particularly spectacular by Ron Moody as Fagin. <br /> <br /> The two young children who see Oliver and The Art Dodger are wonderfully talented. Oliver Reed is doing great work in filming Bill Sykes, where he can not help you but he comes to a terrible end ... he does. <br /> <br /> Dancing is cleverly choreographed and mesmerizing. Oliver has his own with the Fairfair, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma. An image for the whole family.
