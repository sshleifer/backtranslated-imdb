"Painting is what you see, then you remember it well." The Diddel Helder (Ronald Coleman), The Light Man Failed Illustrator. The Roddell Coleman and her first major role is in Grand Old Hollywood style starring Brville's supporting actresses, Ida Lupino, a solid performer by the dependable character actor Dudley Diggs (who co-starred with Colman in Condend) and the magnificent actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The film's title and opening sequences focus his attention on missing the dick. He and childhood girlfriend Massie (Muriel Angelals) play with a pistol and he giggles through the gun powder discharge. A catalyst for his injury when he struggled in Sudan. He is a well-known painter, but he is already amused with ambition, and can not reach his full potential until his attention leaves him. Enter the evil girl Bessie (Ida Lupino), and set in his self-destructive motion. Lupino is very powerful in this role and Coleman plays well. She is reminded of Betty Davis in Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite Coalman melodramas, which is well acted and directed.
