In my opinion Vivah 2006's best movie, coming from a director who has proven successful throughout his career. Nowadays I'm not very interested in romantic movies because I can see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and very imaginative. However, I've seen this movie three times now ... and I believe this is an awesome movie. <br /> <br /> Vivah goes on displaying the usual characters into a brilliant and realistic story of traveling back to the traditional way of engagement and marriage. When it comes to marriage, we reflect what we do (or do). In that sense Suraj R. Barjati has done a very realistic story of completing his homework and doing a well-made highly entertaining story <br /> <br /> In this film many sequences catch your interest immediately. <br /> <br /> When Shahid Kapoor came to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way she tries to see her without being very clear before her and her family. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita when he comes to see her - 'Do Do Anjaane Ajanabi'. It's about not knowing what to do with shy shahid but a good conversation. Similarly, the linear nature of Amrita, the limited eye contact, the shy features the answer to Shahid's questions. <br /> <br /> * Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) emotional breakdown when she feeds with him in the Shahid party. <br /> Clearly the film belongs to Amrita Rao. You can not imagine that the actress in the role of Poonam has not replaced anyone else in the film. She looks beautiful throughout the whole film, and perfectly portraying an innocent and cowardly traditional girl. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor is going to be a brilliant performer. He gives a good performance and shows that Surgana is less than Salman Khan in the film. In fact, without a shadow of Shahid and Amrita doubt, the pair are made on a beautiful screen. <br /> <br /> Overall, VIVAH has offered a similar promise, a well-made and realistic story of the two families. To suit the cinematic film, as well as the excellent Suraj R.Burjatyam directed by Top Stripe performances, excellent story and great music. It must see!
