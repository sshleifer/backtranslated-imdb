I have always been a fan of David Lynch and Lynch with this film has been confirmed by critics that he is sincere to make images outside of surreal illumination that has become talent, style, and artistic he has become famous in the last decade. As the image is G-Rated, it is pure lynch in style, pacing, and tone. The film masterfully moves with hypnotic speed and is full of scenes of real emotion and energy. A Lynch will be expected from the movie, and the transition scenes are breathtaking scenes <br /> <br /> Cinematography is amazing. It's also quite refreshing to see an image, grace folk and unmotivated characters where the characters are all friendly, and the characters are all friendly "good" or "bad". /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth will do a beautiful twist with a beautiful twist, brilliant performance like his daugher, most notably Sissy Spacek, and Harry Dean Stanton, but a small but infinite crucial role. <br /> <br /> <br /> David Lynch critics have proven that he could make a powerful moving motion as he did in the 80s with 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man'. Critics seem to lose faith in the last decade and critics end up with his latest movie 'Mullahland Drive' with this film showing that he has the FWWM and LH method, and it looks like if he has produced surreal imagery like 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' ', Received it in appreciation and lynched on the Oscars nomination Tubaddadu. <br /> <br /> 'Straight Story' I've never seen one of the most moving movies in me. It is a love story about family, friendship and kindness of strangers. I would highly recommend it.
