I've read reviews of Kerching in IMDb, and apparently, I have not seen a positive review so far. I was actually like kirchin. Kerling is a teenage boy named Taj Lewis, who makes a website as a Rudebay, to make £ 1,000,000 for his mother. Taj and his 2 friends - The website offers a lot of interesting facts to stop Danny and Seymour Taj from being exposed. I found this presentation a lot of fun and I enjoyed watching it. Acting O.K., but it's definitely good, the characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, the friend of Taj, his folly makes him funny. And Tamaz's other friend Seymour. Carlton, also known as the owner of the café, is also known as "The Chill". We can not see him, we can only hear him. Taj's brother Omar, and his sister Missy is very fun. And Missy's best friend Karisha. Almost almost exhausted by Taj. Also in the comedy, karsting play drama loses love life and loved ones.
