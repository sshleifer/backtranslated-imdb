Note to the previous reviewer: "Iliad's Science Fiction Simulation" by the screenwriter of this movie. So if the suggestions are painful or not, no apologies, it is the basis of the film. They are willing to steal ... but P.C. <br /> <br /> Great flick but very small. Perhaps the author, director, or studio wanted, but did not come out pretty damn fun. <br /> <br /> A big budget reconstruction is not fun, and maybe screenwriting does not do much justice. But it's fun to dream about the potential there. DVD release with some minor additions is clearly available but I do not think NTSC players play. I am an expert and therefore this is still trying to figure out. For now, I live with the VHS incarnation.
