<br /> <br /> The last battle between the rebellion and the empire. The second Death Star will be completed and when it is completed it will spell Doom for the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi horse, returned from Tattoo with Han Solo and Princess Laya, now revealed as Luke's twin sister! The Endor Forest led to an attack on the shield generator on the Moon, leading to the collision of the Lando collision on Death Star. They know that they have been given a very witty trap, and Pulpatine's emperor himself knows a second Death Star structure. <br /> <br /> I like the original trilogy to get back to JD. It has excellent music by action, drama, romance, great battles, fantasy acting, fantastic action sequences and John Williams. Mark Hamill was matured in a Jedi Knight, an innocent boy boy and his place was a calm, Jedi relaxed to protect the galaxy. Lia is still fine in the movie. 3P0, R2, and arm are made to their characters T, while James Earl Jones is still the film's greatest villain: Darth Vader. Ian McDiramid is also a spectacular villain like the sarcastic and wildly emperor Pulpatine. The action sequences of this film are breathtaking and the sword fights are serious and awkward. John Williams's score is still very good and enhances the movies at many levels. <br /> <br /> When signed,
