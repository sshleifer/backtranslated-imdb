"Lost", "24", "Carnival", "Desperate Housewives" ... in this list and will continue. This, and other high-quality performances, prove that television is in the golden age of history. "Lost" is a pure genius. Incredible layers of personal, and psychologically practical stories, sophisticated cinematography (the word is amazing when describing a TV show), a killer score, is illustrated by great performances and compilations. Anyone hooked on can never see one of the most important creative expressions on television. When looking for only one episode for a week, it may have problems, but the DVD format is actually a fantastic way to watch this. They hope to keep (as I'm sure).
