I've seen this film at least 4 times since '84 and this is great every time I see it. It is a very compelling version of opera carmen with fantastic flamenco dancing, bear bones sets, and, of course, amazing music. <br /> <br /> Carmen is a story in this narrative story, up to the other, doubly tragic end of each parallel. Apparently the low-budget Spanish production, the film features some dance of Spain's flamenco dancers. The combination of opera music and the combination of dancers' shoes on the stage set will tell a more powerful story. <br /> <Foreign image.
