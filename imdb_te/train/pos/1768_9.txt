I did not laugh at this for a long time. I went to early screening and was surprised to see that I was dying to see. Throughout the film I was tired of my eyes from laughter. <br /> <br /> All the audience shared my smile, and applause and frustration throughout the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Steve Carrell (before I'm a fan). He proved his amazing talent for humor in the film. He has a genre never seen before. And Katherine Keene is always good. <br /> <br /> There are comic elements in this movie. Some thanks to Carrell, and some thanks to the writing (Carl, too). <br /> <br /> The waking scene and speed dater with "clear problem" are totally harassing. <br /> When I release it, I see '40 Year Old Virgin '. My advice: go for heavy laughs and see for a very enjoyable picture on it.
