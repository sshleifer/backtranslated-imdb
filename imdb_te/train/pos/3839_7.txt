Paul Verhoeven is the director of many good (and bad) science-fiction films in Hollywood. But long before he broke into ordinary thrillers in his homeland. The story is in a basic Femal Fatalale premise, new or not is not. Vershon feels that it can be further improved by adding a series of Dream Sequences, which is used as a way to advance the plot of the plot rather than to define our main character and his condition. Screenplay is great, this conversation helps to blend story effects. The really good movie is that some amazing acting. Gerron Krabe is a wonderful "tortured artist", and supporters are very good. <br /> <br /> Zen De Bunt's cinematography adds at least some life to the film, helping Veroheven to be at least as talented director. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
