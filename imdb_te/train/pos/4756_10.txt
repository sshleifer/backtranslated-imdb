This is one of the more attractive parts of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialogue and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments. Simple sleek Wump "dancer" (such as Serling's willingness for the role, will she appear in different episodes?) And other classical characters, but Jack Old's "Old Man". I will take into consideration the funny, light version of this "Maple Street on the Manly Street" - or perhaps the 20-minute twilight zone parody of "The Thing". In another note: I thought the young girlfriend of the episode would eventually go to other things - he was very well - but "Ron Kipling" was missing after just two TV credits for his name.
