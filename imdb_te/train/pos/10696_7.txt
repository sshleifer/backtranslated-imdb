Every time I see Nicole very much. I like this picture. You can not refuse, but your heart is broken. The first film I saw as seen in the film is Kim Novak - Lawrence Harvey's version. The Russian speaking in this movie is about beef small enough, and I'm sure it's good enough to cheat someone who is Russian or who can not speak. Funny how funny people miss the point. No Goodnight Russian guys were well cast. Finally, Ben Chaplin has to kiss my hat, as nobody else says, he plays a sap as a great honor and a certain heat between him and Nicole. For thinking, guys get paid for that, wonderfully.
