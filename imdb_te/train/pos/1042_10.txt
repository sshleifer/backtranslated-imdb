An American woman, her husband and children in Europe returned to his mother's house on "Rich on the Rain", a 1957 film based on the Lillian Helman drama and Paul Lucas (whom I repeat his stage role), Betty Davis, Lucille Watson, George Cowur's , Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Donald Woods. The anti-fascist worker in the underground movement was wounded several times and the Nazis required a longer holidays on his wealthy mother-in-law, Court Müller (Lucas). But he finds that in housegouts (colauris) is suspicious of real recognition and he has not really escaped to sell him. <br /> <br /> The great performances in the film are far more exposed to the liberal idea of ​​Lillian Helman. This is certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle during the release of the evils of war and the safe access to American homes in what is happening to people in other countries. The film's big controversy is that Paul Paul Lucas Humphrey won Oscar in "Casablanca" in Bogart. Humphrey Bogart broke into a wonderful screen presence and amazing Rick, but Lucas Kurt. <br /> <br /> If a Betty Davis does not like it as a film, she has done a wonderful performance here. Kurt's loyal and loving wife, Sarah. Her acting tags in the heart, and the love scenes between Kurt and Sarah are beautiful and soft. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film made me laugh with emotions and honesty. Lilian Hellman is not everybody's tea team, but unlike "The Little Fox", she wrote some of the truly sympathetic characters and a nice story given by casting and production values ​​by Warner Bros. Highly recommended.
