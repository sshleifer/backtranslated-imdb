Yes, it's a bit of a silly movie, if you're looking for an Oscar appearance, forget this thing ... But if you love John Candy's joke, you should see. He lost John Candy before making his great brand comedy, and he was the only one in the same movie: flights, trains, and automobiles (with Steve Martin). His best work is probably a good assistant performance, hot-headed Saul Depsqual by Eugene Levy. Richard Libertini, Allie Mills & Pat Hinglele also have good performances. If you're a John Candy or Eugene Levy fan, you should see this blurry and out-of-print movie.
