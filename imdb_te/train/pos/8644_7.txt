**** = Best writing to be recorded in books and never forgotten <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 = A classic in time; <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/ <br /> <br /> I'm one-of-your-face summer-blockbuster-quality of Brad Pitt's face I've rented this movie which is awaiting the celebration, but I'm happy and disappointed, it's quite a play, and La is horrendous ... I remember some emotional Duchovny voice-overs. <br /> <br /> Pitt always plays a shaky talent, perhaps as a violent and disturbing alcoholic husband with a dismal and unhappy husband. In the next stages of the film, I found it difficult to see him - he was unpredictable and scary. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is full of strange and sensational scenes that do not have my breath only once, and I do not understand the action scenes. I really won the brilliant dialogue scenes and I took gas in what I was looking for. It's like watching a rhino and a lion put on a sword and watching like they gnawed each other to death. Again, I am very impressed with the screen writer (s); <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the performance of Juliet Louise. This talented young actress is very rare nowadays. In this film she brought me a few moments. I mean. <br /> <br /> On this occasion, I clearly remember that the girl's emotion on your head is unbelievable and in some cases blurred. <br /> <br /> I would cheat the handicraft handwritten by filmmakers. Only "KALIFORNIA" giving a *** rating. But the darker feelings are too strong and discouraging to retain it. I believe everyone will see this movie. I really do.
