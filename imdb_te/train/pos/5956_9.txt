Yes, this is an ultra-low budget image. So acting is not a winning award, and at times the actions are slow, because filmmakers are shooting long scenes, then not one million instant, and then earning into a movie. The film features a striking script that takes vampirism seriously, which explains and develops a full story. Unlike the vampire story, we get detailed information on genetic information, legal and law enforcement, martial arts action, philosophical ideas, and some good metal music. Kudos to director / writer / lead actor Dylan Wo Leary. How this man fulfills and performs these roles is beyond me. I think this film will appreciate, you must be well versed in all kinds of themes to see what the author has done much research and all about these things. There are some great camera work, very interesting camera angles and an underwater bloodthirsty attack- I have not seen before, but pays courtesy to the underwater zombie attack in Fulzi's Zombi. Casting is really nice, sexy female sexy really exists. The main vampire also appears to be perfect for the role. The female victim will hurt. My only complaint is that for a low-budget horror film, it should be more nudity. If you want to see the original vampire movie with a great story, this picture is for you. I look forward to seeing Mr. O. Liar's future projects.
