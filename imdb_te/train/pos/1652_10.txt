The series took me to Daiton and I loved this story when I was younger. But I disagree with the above comment. From what I read in the past, Holm's performance does not lead Deuton to refuse to release the series, but three books have been translated into the screen. A great example of this is the rumor of Border Crossing, ending Samson's field career. The scene is not in this book, going to the West Germany from East Germany to the West Germany and the Polish border. This whole story is a cloth. Changes in the set are similarly damaging the integrity of the story. I am convinced that my view of Holm's performance has played a role in Samson's negligence in his wife's defiance and is trying to make the class divide a bridge across the ages. Samson pays for his father's emotion and has its impact on his life. Clevemore commented that he would probably run the department if he earned his education. I think the actual damage to performance is due to physical performance than anything. Holm is relatively small compared to the book's Samson - the physically impressive man has the ability to use his size.
