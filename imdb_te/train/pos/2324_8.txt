I saw this movie and I was very passionate. As I grew up in a boy's villages, I thought I was a kid! The swimming pool (also known as a "tank" in central Texas) runs in rural areas as an independent nature! The story is very believable and I've lost it all and finally he cried. By pain we go in life ... life can go and forgive.
