At first I saw the film at the Berlin Film Festival and I never saw the Hong Kong movie before. I thought I'd be sitting on a roller coaster: action was very quick, and there was not a boring moment throughout the film. It has martial arts, love, special effects and a fairy tale. My favorite scenery is Taoist drinks, sings for him and struggles - one of the many scenes which stress the unusual musical piece of the film. This image must be perfect !!
