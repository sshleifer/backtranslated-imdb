This film really surprised me. First there are my doubts about it but for every minute this movie is good and better. <br /> <br /> It is not for audiences, it's not very strange criminals, like a clear portrait of man, boyfriend and husband. It's not really for you if you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content. <br /> <br /> The storyline is sometimes somewhat difficult, but in the end I think everything has done well. Thinking that the ending is unexpected and if you do not think it will end. <br /> <br /> I think it's good that I'm going to act. It was not for a long time awarded to the Oscar, but at least it caught my eye. The depiction of jail bales is always perfect but it is very entertaining. Shawn Parks' film of the Balus Jail Mate Clinic is great and very powerful. <br /> Take my advice and look at this movie, do you love it or do not like it!
