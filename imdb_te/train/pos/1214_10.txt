It all started with True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horses Get The Club for Safety. Noble Hart met with Horse Don & Zon & True Heart Bear to see them. Later, Turtle Heart & Noble Heart Hunt went further to look after the guardian Dark Heart but they could not go to the club to ask Dan & Zon to take care of the club. Come back after True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse, who sent Dan & John back to camp. The club & cousin bears rose up to get ready to fight with Dark Heart. In the end, Dark Heart will have to tell Christie that all care bears and kids (Don & John) Dark Heart is bad. They work together to save Care Bears. Later, True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horses Dark Heart shadow discovered and returned to their care to find their gone. The Kids (Dan, John, & Christie) come and go but hard to stop Dark Heart. True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horses Don, John, & Christie are helping to free other careballs, but Christie's route & Dark Heart is hit by magic. Christie looked more like Dark Hart but did not fight with the caretaker, but he could not because Dark Hart would not have the power to save Christie himself. Help protect the bears & kids Dark Heart Christie. Now Dark Heart has been a real boy who has been in love with Christie since suffering. <br /> <br /> Dark Heart is now a true boy and help Christie to work on camp. <br /> It's never seen & the best care Bears movie. All the cautions have movies and I can not wait to see "Care Bears: Big Whiskey Movie (2005)". <br /> Who does this movie like?
