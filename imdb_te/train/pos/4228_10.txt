Top Stripe Colombo from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I especially like to interact with Colombo and Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As a fine Colombo fan, he does not recollect another person who does not form the murderer in other episodes. When the boxes and nephews are trying to find a "message" in this box, it eventually rises upon him. <br /> <br /> Music is very good in this episode, which is among many others.
