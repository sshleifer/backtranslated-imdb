Terry Gilliam's future (he has already done in "Brazil") to tell the story about a virus that destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> This script has some simple tricks in it but it's very entertaining and Gilliam proves that he's got imagination (the future scenes are just great). For casting, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stow (what happened to her) were just perfect, but Brad Pitt suffered when she was playing the roles in her hand and all he was not trustworthy. <br /> * My rate: 7/10
