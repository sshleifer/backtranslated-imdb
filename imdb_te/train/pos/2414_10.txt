Monarch Cove is one of the best Friday night drama shown for a long time. I write a long time and ask for a long time, in a lifetime, to broadcast it. Every single person is very interesting, the plot is true. However, the film will last a long time. I love to see Bianca and Jake's baby grow up and new roles in the film are planned for her academic future. Also, bring back Katie to help her look at her niece and promote her life. Grandmothers is great seeing seeing their problems work, but it needs to restore the status of family business work, and let us see how to survive by Jake and Bakek's marriage.
