Since the day I saw this film in 1981, it was one of my first 3 favorites. I was under the script for Amazon and it was finally on DVD at 10/17/06 - I was surprised at the 25th anniversary of the film. <br /> <br /> Last credit appeal of the film - "Thank you for filming this island for the Manhattan people." Each city (West 12th Street, Ansonia, Old FAO Schwartz, The Plaza, The Roxy, Cheese Brigade, The Establishity, and City Limits is a country & west club). If the whole ensemble cast as well as the screen on the screen, this intimacy was clearly disclosed. I laughed, I cried, it's better than CATS. Dorothy Stratten is not only Odin, but also the final character of Audrey Hepburn (she has a guest role in the film) and opens her inner glamor. Buy it, popcorn make a big tub, and curl with someone you love.
