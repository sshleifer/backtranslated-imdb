The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role), a new spy kid in the block, brings his detection to his identity, who intends to end the CIA's latest program "BlackBriar" for super-killers. I saw yesterday and today's predecessors. Identity I remember and the lead is weak (but still enjoyable) in the chain for the weakest plot, and the film Chase is easily a little bit in tops, action and suspense. <br /> Who has the boy, the ultimatum suspense? When you learn that Bourne escapes the bosses (and the boy's police are obscene to the police), this is still amazing looking at him. <br /> <br /> These two $ 150 million big robots think they can create 10x more suspense than the two guys with handpuffs and mopeds than those in Transformers. <br /> <br /> Although he played regular roles for Paul Greengrass, who had this weird style, he could not allow a camcorder in 10 miles of CIA headquarters. He has been seen to hear my different complaints over a long period of time, as the actions of the Ultimatum are less than tremendous rotation, a variety of tools used as weapons, candlestick, a hard cover book (I can not see it again) and an electric fan (do not ask). <br /> <br /> The performance was good, and Julia Styles' role came to her "Nicky" evolution. A new highly sympathetic light. Damon plays the role of his signature with the reserve or probability (it feels minus but Matt Damon really escapes the CIA and the Interpol feels like something), but when he struggles to recognize his humanity, he has considerable movements. This desire for a real life is getting boring, and in almost dominant, but just does not work well in ultimatum (in the enhanced script). <br /> <br /> "Bourne regrets people he kills and motive <br /> <br /> Sidenote: Despite the fact that he was a superstee and hunter until the CIA, Interpol and the police had time to go, Always hurt, Bourne did not intend to make small efforts to hide his features or to duplicate some new passports, perhaps sunglasses <br /> <br /> If you have Pulse and Love Action Movies than Bourne Ultimatum, Hell Probably the best action movie this year has come, in fact, you're a fool to watch others first Yi will be. It's kind of a touch, however, near the end, but I feel almost tempted to overlook that. <br /> <br /> <br /> This summer, at least "
