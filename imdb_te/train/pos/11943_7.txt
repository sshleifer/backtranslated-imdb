I am a big Woody Allen fan and so I can not do anything when I watch this movie. This is how I should see Alan see his amazing film match point. His new head, Scarlett Johansson, was shot and wanted to be seen as his other movie (which is unique in Allen's work). The scoop is much lighter than the MP and is the most enjoyable item of humor scoop. The plot revolves around Johanson's character (a journalist student) who gets a tip of the hot story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and decides whether she has the value of finding the truth. Oh and all of this happens with the help of a male magician Allen. <br /> <br /> The detective turned on <br /> <br /> I must say that I fully enjoyed the performance of Johanson but I am a bit bias, I could never watch a three-hour frame and enchanted with Johansson. She is a ditsy, yappy, male friend of the stereotypical monotony of the character plays a different kind of inspiration. She adds the correct body language for her comic effect. <br /> <br /> Allen Allen ... He is still playing the same role as Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something that happens in this film makes me wonder if I see a nerve little hiccrowdigue again. He's not casting his next film and most of the time is exclusively ... Jackham is delighted as a joyous, millionaire murderer. The latter behind the camera ... has been spent. <br /> <br /> I can not say Jackman will do anything special to play his role, but he does not fit his role. <br /> <br /> In terms of plot, it is the Curse of Stings of Jade Scorpion. Johansson and Allen are more than anything detective-like. Yet I laughed at him at the end because it was a little clever than your distinctive Hollywood version of your distinctive Hollywood version. Unlike everything being black and white, things are painted in gray. Absolutely innocuous, there is nothing or a clear guilt. Although the plot seemed to be a knack for an old Woody still a liner. I found interesting in his last film ... for humor, smile and be merry. <br /> If you enjoy Allen's work, it does not need to tell. If you do not see any other ...
