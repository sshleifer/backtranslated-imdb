Acting is pretty cheesy, but in the 80s, people in the area are now Detroit area automotive engineers, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Jay Leno is showing his age at his tonight show last night. He looked pretty young here 17 years ago. <br /> <br /> Lenno also holds a little bad car owner, with its modernity reminiscent of this remake. Collection. I'm sure Vette drafted in the opening sequence is his own car. <br /> <br /> Simple 80s image. See it and have fun. No computer created!
