A fantastic picture about the two cops who loved the same woman. One of the police (periar) killed her, but all the evidence was unsuccessful to the other (Montland). Unfortunately, Perry did not know who was the other lover who had killed Monthouter, and that Manind had relationships with his daughter. Montand must certainly find the killer ... and a great end! Highly recommended.
