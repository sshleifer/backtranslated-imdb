As Steven Spielberg has produced, the writings are directed to the feelings of Amazing Stories, and naturally, it must always be the best of the best. Unfortunate mistake. Some parts are just amazing, but very often it's a mixed bag. In fact, it may have led to a decline, it is very mixed. Some episodes have mild humor, some drama, some horror, and even an animated one, which did the same, but the good 80s version of the Twilight Zone (which was not around). <br /> <br /> In general, I would like to have a mix of stories in a single edition program, but they did not work here entirely. Some of the more spectacular dramatic episodes have been felt by Spielberg as the "Ghost Rail" part of the self-directed "Life Train" episode in the late-night network. In that episode, it gave hope message, and gave us a fantasy story, but the whole thing is to build it just the end it does not blow me away anyway. The horror parts work better than drama, but they are very dramatic, and they grow tired to see. By acting, this anthology has some big stars like the original Twilight Zone. Harry Keitel, Beau Bridges, Charlie Sheen, Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, Tim Robbins, John Lithgow, Ria Perlman, Danny Davitto, Patrick Swayze, Christopher Lloyd, June Lockhart, Kathy Baker, Wired Al, Carrie Sutherland, Milton Berle, , Yanukovich and many other famous celebrities. It's fun to see well-known actors in each episode of the series. Great directors also participated in parts, such as Spielberg, Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Bob Clarke, Joe Dante, Mick Garris, Paul Bartel, Joe Dante, Robert Gemicus, Danny DeVito and Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> AMAZING STORIES Sometimes amazing, usually good, occasionally mediocre, and every time a true stinker. Came out. But, this show has a nostalgic value for me and it's fun to be sitting on boring afternoons and seeing some episodes. <br /> <br /> John Williams' theme music is also caught on the head for this show. <br /> <br /> My rating: Good show. 30 minutes. Each episode. TVPG
