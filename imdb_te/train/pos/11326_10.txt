This series I saw in the first 17 episodes was just amazing! I am not interested in an anime series from Neon Genesis Evangelion. I'm not sure whether the series actually happened or I did not do it, I did not play the game, but I understood what I heard. <br /> I'll give 10/10 in this series. It's great story, interesting characters, and some of the best animations I've seen. It's also a great Japanese music! <br /> If you have not yet seen this series, check it out. There you can find sub episodes on some anime websites, which directly belong to Japan.
