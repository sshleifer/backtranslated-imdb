There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie, but can not I really do? This movie is a movie that you want to sit in, laugh and want to shout. I'm serious. Do not watch this movie if you are easily angry with pornography, sexuality, nudity, homosexuality ... and the relationship with nature. A woman, and it may not even be a factor, can see this film again. Tray Parker and Matt Stone are completely cool. In addition to their other initiatives, I think basketball is the winner of the prize. I'm thinking now about the stupid things in the film. See the picture !! That's it. This is very difficult because I left this comment because I was one of those individuals, such as Ozzy Osbourne, who had a curse on almost every line that was interrupted from their mouth when I spoke. I'm keeping professional. Best Picture. Yes heck !!
