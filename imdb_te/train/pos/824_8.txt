When it comes to creating the universe, George Lucas is the undisputed master and his last star wars movie is very good (and in comparison with the previous two films in the original saga). The recently released Cevin Revenge is really in the picture. The ultimate battle is more confusing when the emperor Skynalkar went into the hands of the Emperor's bullets. It took into consideration the love he felt for a strong battle between Louie and Wader and she was her love for her children. Actual films (especially episode II) are less than original films, and they are good for one reason. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marc Hamil - He looks like the changes that have really gone through Luke are true. In all honesty, I believe he should be a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, he seems to have done riders and blade runner between the two final chapters of Star Wars, as he appears to have grown slightly. He plays an amazing role in more comedy (clearly inspired by riders). Small Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher will never really be a good actress but she does a good job and is definitely passable. Ian McDermid appeared in the film and I can say that he was one of the most successful villains ever when watching Episode III. James Earl Jones still offers voice for Wonder and is still very good. <br /> <br /> The film is the Star Wars universe, the previous (two) films, but it's always been Lucas's Fort. The final war on Endor has done both in terms of general effects and tense knowledge. When it was added to Clommax's total tension, Lucas decided to take three fights at the same time. <br /> <br /> "These little creatures are destroying almost every scene, a team of teddy bears with throws and arrows I'll be very hard for young children when laser guns and powerful machine guns can defeat Troopers. /> <br /> Jedi is all very good movie in All Return but Richard Marquand Irvine Kershner The fact that less than intelligent rather than an accomplished director. Yuroksnu to include the universe of George Lucas, is a stupid decision to lower the brightness of the image. <br /> <br /> 8/10
