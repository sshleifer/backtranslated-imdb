Stardust is not exactly a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances. I've seen the film, I know it's one of my favorite films. I'm right. <br /> <br /> <br /> Star Stunt is a fairy tale than a courageous movie. At the end of this memorable 'Aura' movie is at the end. The storyline is well written, and it puts your seat on the edge. Like every story, it is somewhat less for morality. So in our hearts we know that the evil brothers do not take the throne, but the innocent boy overcomes every obstacle and hardship during his journey. The real love for us is not Joaine and Victoria, the deep and the manipulation material girl. <br /> I need to give extra credit to Claire Danes. She will literally shine in the film. This glitter has her eyes that fit perfectly in her role. In addition, romance in her and Cox films has a more prominent chemistry. The remaining cast is well known actors and actresses Stardust is making a very interesting and 'high circles' film <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is an amazing, place of magic and plot. The film was very disappointing to nominate many awards. Give it at least 9/10 stars.
