Riget II is a good sequel, but the first is not as good. This series does not seem too intense as the first one. <br /> <br /> We are at Danish National Hospital, Danish Riggsaspetet. Ms. Drussey has been hospitalized, her work is done, but it does not require fate. She immediately haunts the ghost and Helmer everyone is mad and if the black forces fail in the kingdom it becomes much worse. <br /> <br /> This story has a lot of humor in the past. All through a lot of fun, but you will take the series a little less serious. The story kept a lot of stuff from the last series and added some new ones. It's well written, but some of the new stuff are just crazy kind, but they are saved by more like a comedy. Good story, but good, not realistic and the first series is not thrilling. <br /> <br /> Actors have a regular cast. They are very good. It's odd story and setting. With some of the parts being a whole freak show and changing the characters, it's in the show and it's not true and keep it from real work. And yet, these actors are absolutely perfect for the whole situation. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good features from the first series. Cinematography is one of those features. Trier's world-famous hand-held camera gives this series suspense and reality. It gives the unique ability to move and follow the characters of the camera and the use of these abilities in the Trier. Good, movement, great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watch. <br /> Get ready to make a good impact on this sequel. Get ready to see some more. I do not think the green thing looked good at all. It was unrealistic and felt unlikely. Never less, the effects of ghosts are really good. But digital effects are very good. Little Brother is just odd, but you have to accept it. Also, I'd say that the effects are good from okay. <br /> <br /> Music is also great. Moody and good. Some of these are really touching. It's really nice. The first one is the action scenes and there are little music and it works very well. <br /> All of this together makes a good sequel. If you see it, you can see this without disappointment. It has the same feature in the first series. However, before seeing this I will see the first series. This makes you up to a row do not miss missing do not miss.
