12-year-old Arnold Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene. His feelings are arrested with the fact that his family is not interacting with him (or it is not the right thing). His only shelter is his grandfather, who alone has mercy on him. Realism has attracted lovers of "true-2-life", but not for those who desire it.
