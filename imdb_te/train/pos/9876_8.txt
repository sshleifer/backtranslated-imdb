Lilly is a real fun little portrait of Mars, where she exhibits actress Judy Garland's comedy skills with standard singing scenarios. This plot is designed for Lily Mars Tagging producer John Thorneve after her big break. I think the light of humor and nothing too heavy here. I really recommend this film to all. Judy is breathtaking in this role!
