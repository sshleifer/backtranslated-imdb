It's not for Academy Awards and approval, it's pretty cheesy, but it's just great fun! I have no smile like Bill and Ted. <br /> <br /> Although I love the incredible adventure, the Bogus Journey is very ridiculous to me. Death Flippin is happy and Bill and Ted are more enthusiastic. People have grieved me to love this movie, but it is really a very hypocritical movie-viewer that it's not too entertaining. If you like it, you're probably the world fan of Wayne, Dude My Car, Dumb and Dumbler. Even if you are stupid, you have to accept it, they wink you up and rotate on your tick box. So look for them kicks and giggles!
