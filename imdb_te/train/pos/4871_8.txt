It's a Serbian or a balcony introduction and enjoy many of the characters, characters and many other films of Jowes and 'Judaica'. For example, the earliest scenes, the remote village in the mountains of Serbia, the integrity and lifestyle of residents, the memories of the good days of the Communist rule, and the awakening of the young brass looking at the nuisance of the Soviet hymn. Kusturika tries to get out of Serbia's tragic history as described in his previous films, but in this process he creates the whole world. <br /> This is not a political movie, it's a case. It's a fun film before. Custodians create a set of characters that we care about. Music also plays an active role in his other films in this movie. His style is live and grotesque, we now know he's about his characters and we know he wants to feel the same. Current space, history, and magic can be developed as a sprawling place, and the colors of the Doonier Rousse of modern films appear. <br /> This is not a perfect image. The main fault length, some editing and outlook were useful, at some point in time when the director's thoughts and repetitions were performed, this was one of the most catchy, entertaining, moving films I have seen recently.
