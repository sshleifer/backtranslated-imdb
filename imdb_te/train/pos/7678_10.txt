I saw Halley along with another film about Film by the Trade at Trade and Child Sexual Exploitation at the International Film Festival. I'll trade out the water. <br /> <br /> Holi is a powerful and spectacular picture of many levels. From a completely artistic and cinematic perspective, it's amazing. Sound-mixing, camera angles, direction and acting. <br /> In addition, it organizes the subject matter. It's tasteful and non-exploitative. It provides child sexual exploitation problem in both education and accurate. Motion picture producers attracted attention to the details, which really captures the child's sexual abuse and inferiority of the epidemic of smuggling. Very often when dealing with this type of matter, there is an excitement to rape audiences and graphic scenes of violence. Holly can do all this without getting into that typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I am Halley two different film festivals, once in America and once in the Netherlands. I can not say honestly that I did not move the audience more. People are listening to conversations just after the screening and asking what they can personally do to fight children with sexual abuse. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to everyone and its content for everyone.
