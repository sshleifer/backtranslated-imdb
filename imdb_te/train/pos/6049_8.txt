Freibard road trip comedy, gang keeper, "Stoner" and the perfect marriage of a good British movie. <br /> <br /> In this genre, the main characters that set the film apart from other movies. Stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have a great chemistry and their characters are the most fond and realistic. The main story centers around their road trip from London to Wales, and adventures and mishaps along the route. This small film is also a great heart - he's not just for biking fans, he's left with Gary Stretch's Fred Desire for deducted family, including dreams and sadness, surrounding each other's characters. The love letter to the Welsh rural and the London streets of the Welsh towns captured the pub and lifelong pub life. <br /> <br /> Stylish, slick, excellent soundtrack, favorite characters and funny storyline - I would recommend Freebird in heart rate!
