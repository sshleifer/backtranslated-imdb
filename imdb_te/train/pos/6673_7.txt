All user comments that I have seen in IMDB for this movie do not really do justice. First of all, let's say this film is not taken seriously. It's a fun, yet stupid movie, not only to enjoy it. If you watch the movie with the intention of filming the movie or the movie is ridiculous, you will be disappointed. However, if you want to see a Goofy movie with some talented actors / actresses and a little better catch-fatwa, then you will enjoy it.
