Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 Stars <br /> <br /> "Mr. Mr. Destiny" theme has been recycled from many images over the years. The same extreme, dramatic concept that works in "It's a Wonderful Life" as mentioned in Charles Dickens, and in rare cases from recent stories of its thrillers in the story of a century ago (see "screwd") "A Christmas Carol." "This is an ungrateful man taking a guided tour of his life and looking at what his life was (or would have) the first time. <br /> <br /> In this type of movie, the Guardian guard protects the ungrateful and defines his past, In this case we have shown the businessman Larry (James Balloons), who is an unexciting wife (Linda Hamma Ilton) and yearns for big life with big meaning convinced he would have improved his life if he hit the ball in the state championship in high school years in high school.This small little moment in his life recalls a big impact on his subconscious side, but only one action from high school I suspect that a grown person wants to However, Larry is driving home from a night work, where he is a penpenter with Jon Lovitz, and the car breaks up and he turns around in a bar looking for a paid phone, and his life turns out On the way the bartender (Michael Caine) decides to be reluctant to say. <br /> <br /> Let's look at first we will remember his childhood baseball strike. <br /> <br /> The barrister is not worrying about other customers, perhaps even though the bar is old and scattered, it never seems to have ever been protected by these two men. In fact, Larry also makes a comment about never seeing the bar before. Most likely, this is one reason Larry is expecting before the audience. <br /> <br /> Bardender Larry, an angel of the Lord, such as Clarence, removes his unique drink, which is like Larry's life in the reverse, as if he had been going home for years earlier. But there was no change before Larry, Jimmy Stewart clarrens removed his life and wiped his life until Larry removed Larry without making any changes in his home. He realized that Larry would be totally different from his life. Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton, he married Ren√© Russo and entered a large building with children. He finds that Jon Lovitz is not his friend but his employee. And all the surprising fact is that his new life, Larry has always wanted ... He finds himself lusting after his old wife, Linda Hamilton; Sometimes money and a great-looking yet shallow wife prove that a man does not make everything in life, such as a brilliant wife and love and true happiness. "It's a wonderful life", which shows the audience a person's life, and shows that each person has an impact on people, "Mr. Destiny" is not a wealth of material wealth but a spiritual lesson. <br /> <br /> Mr. Destiny, Not happy, but a sweet, good-natured comedy does not take so seriously. The problem with "It's a Wonderful Life" is "The Family Man", which is effective and memorable as "It's a Wonderful Life". But many times only you can rip a single movement off of a famous movie, and "Mr. Destiny" knows this, and actually plays right. Do not try anything it does not; Besides, it is something that does not try, and this is obvious for the audience. <br /> <br />
