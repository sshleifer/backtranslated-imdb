Only Stanwick's performance was saved by Barbara Stanwick. The story and other performances are very attentive and the film is really enjoyable today. Betty Midler's version is very interesting. Stella Claire, an independent, free-spirited single woman with her pregnancy, declined to help her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or her friend (John Goodman for a lesser estimate). She played very smoothly by her daughter Jenny Trini Alverto and Jenny's father was able to do her best and eventually decided to make a decision to change her life. Through the film, there are many smiles, tears and memorable moments between Midlar and Alardo. Marsha Mason turns out to be Jenny's co-starter, wealthy that has a good effect on her. If you like good movies of midler, goodman or emotion, you'll enjoy STELLA's Betty Midler's version.
