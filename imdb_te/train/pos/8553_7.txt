I saw the film scared I was disappointed. I was finally amazed. The American pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies all the time. Yes, it's not true if I say enjoyed as mush as I enjoyed the original ones. The Beta House along with the previous two pies certainly lost the first two pies had something.It was not gonna be the first two already scored a classic. But hell-it's a lot of good moments still funny and I think you have to be the first film to pick it up if you have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school. Beta House 6/10 deserved but I gave it 7/10 for PIE being another slice.
