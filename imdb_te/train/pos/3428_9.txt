I saw this film tonight in NYC at Lancmark Sunshine. I do not know what to expect, I have read it much about it. All in all, it is well done. It does not focus on the generalization of "anti-war" statements, which I have been away from politics. The soldiers mainly talked about their understanding of the tank in training in their camp, and how difficult it was to return to civilian life. It is good to see Paul Rickoff and Camilo not only fight the Mezia War but also say it is difficult to refuse to go back when opposed to personal courage. No mistake - it's not anti-war film. It does not see it or live on the souls of war on their souls.
