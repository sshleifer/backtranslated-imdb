Although the title is what the "Pigs is Pigs" is not Porky Pig actor. Instead, it is more impressive than the character of John Bellusi in "Benishi House". His mother repeatedly confused him, but it was not good. <br /> He goes to another house, where the disturbing scientist is able to play more than any human being (eventually surprising). <br /> <br /> I've often said that this cartoon is a place that really is between great cartoons (Duffy Duck came out three months later). But there is nothing wrong with it, they do some nice things here. <br /> <br /> It's not a great cartoon, but worth looking at.
