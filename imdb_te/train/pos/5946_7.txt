"World's Finest" is a unique plan. This is not a trailer for the Superman / Batman cross over movie, but it is not in this form, however, with the characters, actors and plot line anyway. <br /> <br /> There is a big tease, more than a daily real movie trailers. The trailer will hype up for you nothing. In that respect, I really did not like this little project. When you look at this trailer you are hungry and more happy and sad at the same time - Perhaps the entire length of the trailer is never in existence, and you feel cheated afterwards. You wonder what happened in this type of place. <br /> <br /> Sandy did not make sure to showcase Collor's skills, but did not make it as real as his previous film "Batman: Dead End". <br /> <br /> This small one is, from the technical point of view of a scene, it's great. People already seeing "Batman: Dead End" are already cardboard sets, cheap homemade costumes and third-rate actors. The smallest is not always impressive and obviously the budget is not high in the sky, but for the most part it is very attractive and professional, with nice clothes, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting. The smaller one can build a good quick and distinctive trailer, perhaps a bit too much shots to be completely reliable, but hey, it works well for the trailer style. It has some catchy shots, but the slum couple, mainly Superman flying sequences. It was clear that the man was standing in a moving car, with a camera-focused camera from below. I found a pretty ridiculous thing to see. <br /> <br /> Michael O. Hern has appeared as a pretty good Superman / Clark Kent, although he is certainly not a great talented actor. Clark Bartram again reinventes his Batman role and Kurt Carly appears as an amazing Lex Luthor. The rest of the cast is well-suited for its purposes. <br /> <br /> Recent recent modern restart of the film's two major superheroes, "Batman Begins" "Superman Returns". It's interesting to compare style and character therapy with these images. <br /> <br /> It is truly exciting and fun to hear how Kurt Carly plays the role of Kevin Spacey, who played the role of Lex Luthor in "Kart Karly" Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> This is a good looking, constructed and more hungry, although you do not know much. Waner Bros. Whatever has happened to the actual full length of Superman / Batman images? I'm developing a few years ago, but nothing has been heard since. Two new Batman and Superman films were made instead; "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". <br /> <br />
