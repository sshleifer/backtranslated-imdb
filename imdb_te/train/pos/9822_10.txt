When I was first in high school, I saw this movie first, and the film stuck with me for years. It's not about soundtrack or cinematography, or conversation and some bad acting, it's about educational purpose and the message behind it is very important. It is not a bad thing to have a kid when you're still in high school and in high school, but it's a problem. Tons of girls I know all have kids now, and I guess they did not see this great movie, and if they did, they clearly did not get the message behind all. You're not taking a chance when you're in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. This is not a legend. <br /> <br /> You will not necessarily lose your dreams, but you have to take a spouse in your future, because you have a child to think about it first. <br /> <br /> The picture has a clear message: Say no JUST!
