This presentation is Fabulous. It's complex and well written and all the characters match with the terrible snack. Jonathan's cake was also loved by a boyfriend who loves him. Because our airspace is filled with worst like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it's nice to see a drama that does not play much drama. It is always a secret to see how each character is connected to the next situation. It really is annoying to get a program that makes us think a little bit and it will be thrown out because it does not pay too much attention to us too. Some of us are not sheep. This program is lost by some pretty loyal fans, not just people.
