The best film of 2006 was in my book! PERIOD !!. This is one of the best 100 films in Bollywood in my book. This film does not have too many reviews and is not very popular. <br /> <br /> Vivah once again succeeded from the director. Hahk and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj once again removed a wise one Vivid. <br /> <br /> This year is the simplest and most beautiful movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> "Hollywood remake style, like Pole 2 and Don, are doing bad things. br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story is very beautiful and has a great deal of connection with the arrangement of the Indian system, and I also want to be a part of it.Our system that teaches us to show loyalty, follow them and show their obedience to their ideas Of course there is no power in choosing your spouse and it should be a small meeting between the pair and the ones that decide it as brightly shown in this film. <br /> <br /> Returning to the movie ..... Vivah Engagement and Wedding The story of the jurisy between the Sundari, the person to meet the girl, the two understand each other .. They are for seven generations (as our system says) Imagine whether or not you love each other for a variety of weddings. <br /> Amrita Rao is very good in this movie ... Shahid Sar ... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are superb! The songs are BRILLIANT. ! I am particularly like Hamari Shaddi Main Huffy REH GA Chair and Anjane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> I am sure of those who still believe in the entire Indian culture and tradition! <br /> <br /> In the meantime,
