For starters I've always been a fan of Batman cartoons because the theme is universal, 'everyone is alive - alter-ego'. It's true in Batman's mystery. Although the whole story is good, I was disappointed that they did not really do this for franchise. <br /> <br /> If you recognize Bathmohan's recognition throughout the film, you can easily find the credits posted on this website (if you do not see it already). I was disappointed, they were not as big as the film. 75 minutes for any movie. Batwoman's secret identity is also much earlier in the movie, Midway's scene, and then good weather, because good guys can always win and the new character, known as the Batluman, will not appear after the movie's ending. br> <br /> <br /> I'm not sure about the new animation style used in this film. I love the elegant new characters but there are a few details that are called for details. Some parts of the animation appear awkward and rigid, which turns your attention away from the story. I really do not really like the bright atmosphere used in the scenes, it loses the dark and gothic feel Batman. Similarly we've got to know more about the bathroom's personality so we can build the same deeply compassionate concept with Bruce Wayne. And I want to be with Bane. In a typical child fashion, the bad person easily meets easily by turning him down, falling, getting power or doing something dumb. <br /> <br /> I would recommend anyone to watch this bottom line, its good entertainer and a Batman fan. It's a good storyline, universal attraction and it has great superior performance. I wish I could make a more permanent change to the story by staying in Bathroom to make things even more interesting. Just introduce her and leave her after she completes her. Finally, I also want to recognize someone else for a change. <br /> <br /> Do you secretly solve the mysteries of Batman and fill the details with him later. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] He is stringing her with me forever and she does not even like it and I can not believe that she is dumb enough in love with someone 20 years old. I want to see the time when Tim Drake leaves because I get old man's sick. In short, I would like to see all the characters in Batman Beyond. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
