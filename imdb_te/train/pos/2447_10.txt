George Lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still does not. But this is a work of art. It's not always show jokes to keep laughing every time you remember it (and that's momentous return jokes). It has a playful look in the show and the characters range from an old, small drunken to a dyslexia young man. I do not know who will write this presentation but that person does a great job. I'm sure they will get positive feedback from the critics of this great country if they continue to perform. If you're looking for a good, classic comedy, then Jorge Lopez performs for you! The title of a bad thing. George Lopez? Really? The Bel-Air Fresh Prince named "Will Smith" is expected. Simon man! However, this performance is genius! 10/10
