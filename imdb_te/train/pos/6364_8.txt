"Atlantis: The Last Empire" is everything that the previews suggest. It's not often you find it. Most of the time, only the best parts of the previews show and then the rest of the movie is terrible. Not with this one. I have enjoyed the original platform, even though there are no sub-plots. The animation did not break like "Shrek", but it's fine, nothing less. The storyline and storyline are well received and some of them are slow spots. This will keep you keen. I found this one enjoyable. "Atlantis" gets you and keeps your attention. You have to think a little, but not too much. If you think a little about it, you can find out what's going to happen, but it's not exactly how it's going to happen. <br /> Actors are also good. Mileo J. Fox, Milo is a wonderful choice. His personality is fine. The grateful nature of the commander Rourke is also well-chosen with James Garner. His role reminded me of his performance in "Maverick", and I also liked it. I really liked Claudia Christian's role as Helga Sinclair. Her ability to play no nonsense personality is very interesting. <br /> She is a villain. This is very bad.
