One of the characters as his imaginary trolley drive across the rubbish dump where the title sounds sounds. The film is based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live on the edge of the dump. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see the first color picture of Akra Kurosovo. Some promotional subjects were only available in just a brief version from the original three or four hours due to run time error. I waited to see Kurasowa wanting us, holding for the full version, a full version of the 140-minute version just waiting to learn the most recently released by Criterion. <br /> <br /> Last night, I saw mixed emotions about the movie last night. The first of its visuals is associated with each other. You can see all the six films in the film. It is a wonderful picture of its use of color and he can understand why he took a long time to paint (he also has failed projects). This film is a visual work of art. (It looks like you're going to watch it on your widescreen TV but it looks like a normal TV ratio). The rest of the band is a mixed bag. The part of the problem is that these people's lives do not quite come together. They all work differently in different stories, but they do not hang one of the filmmakers. I can not ever blame Kurosawa because there are not many things in this box, especially Robert Altman, especially those in the multi-film movies of the bomb. <br /> <br /> Do not say there is no reason to see the film. All Kura≈°ao films have always had a reason to see his movies, whether they work or not. The first trip of "Trolley" was one of the best of Kurasovo's and one of the rental prices was valuable. The most spectacular movements in the history of film are checked and taken on the trolley. Although the father and son in the car touched (although ultimately very sad) and other bits and lights (such as actors across the band) and a person is usually associated with samurai films or crime dramas to portray someone else. <br /> <br /> The film's masterpiece from the film maker is much better than most other filmmakers wins. <br /> <br /> 6 and 7 total, the pieces are very high.
