I had a six month home baby and she had time to struggle to sleep really bad time. One morning, when she was sleeping for a particular difficult time, she woke up when the Doodles Bops came on the THRR, and left for the rest of the show. I sat in her bouncy seat, saw her legs with her legs, waving her hands, literally laugh at this show. She kept her whole entertainment and happy whole time. I have also received a video of them, and I have something to calm her when I'm drying a little bit. Tuesday and late at night the Doodles Bops are not a cup of tea, but I do not get it right because I need some time for housework. The biggest surprise about Doodle bops is my baby T.V. Do not even like to watch, play with the toy or our T.V. Apart from our little toy poodle, doodle bops completely captured his vision. I do not know if she will like them in the future, but now she's in pairs.
