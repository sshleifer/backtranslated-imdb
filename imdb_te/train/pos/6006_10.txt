When I was a child, it answered my questions and removed the fears or misconceptions that I had. It's easy to see because it is animated, which makes it unthreatening. It does not have moral bias or "preachy" dimensions, so no one should have it objectionable. It's a reassuring of a fun movie that simply gives menstrual truths, the "fact of material" way. I showed my daughter.
