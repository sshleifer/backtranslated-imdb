Olivia Davewilland, in the role of a brilliant, murderous drama, played against Phoenine effectively against her former linear wildflower genre. It's fine, because Fontaine is amazing. The script, written by Charles Bennett, written for Hitchcock in the thirties, and later the classic British horror film Night of the Demon. The opening sequence of Ivy's visit to the director, who tells a nasty fortune by the magnificent Una O'Connor (the witcher of James Whale Kirti), is a tour de force, and the film increases the interest of many evil machinations. I hope the film is going to be one day on DVD, but it is a frustrating continuity that seems to be an undoubtedly cryptic picture. Fortunately I had to look at AMC some seven or eight years ago, but have not seen since. If you like it then catch it!
