Our late boom boomers come to us in the scene to congratulate James Dean At. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do, <br /> It's not Casablanca, it's not great literature, but it's a serious film about cars, rebels, and Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> This is what it is, and Martin will appreciate it for what it turns out to be. I love this movie as a teen in the 70s, and you also love it.
