American playwright Howard W. Campbell, junior (starring with Nick Nolte's Nick Nolte) is happily living with her natal wife, Hell (Sheryl Lee), before her second half in Germany. At the maximum level of his life, Howard was created by an American agent (John Goodman), which became a spy on Allies; In advance of job losses, Howard loses everything, but offers an offer irresistible. After his wife's death and war is over, Campbell finds himself absent from a lonely life in New York City, which further impairs her morass. The source of the film and Kurt Wonneenth is the central question of the novel (in fact, many critics are bored question), "Campbell is a hero or a traitor?" Director Keith Gordon and screenwriter Robert B. Weed give us evidence, but no answer, and this ambition? Do not know this? "Mother Knight" keeps everything fresh and interesting. At the beginning of the film, Nolte Campbell was painted brilliant and confident; In the end, he was scared and uncertain or afraid, and his role in the war was absolutely humane to his role / role. Gordon covers a certain snowy brightness for the films of the first half of the film, which complements its pictures in the Nazi Bourgeois film and binds the dramatic side of the Vonnegate. In the flip side, Campbell is the only writer who produces humor and his dramatic tension, as the only Nazi band discovered on his solitary New York apartment (which he calls "pure") is called "maternity night" prizes to general clarity Does not serve, and for a degree, is it unclear? In the black-and-white scenes of Thumbel, a role that we can not understand about Campbell's minds is a character that Israel is unaware of before us, a war that will change him, returns to the United States, and meet with the Nazis in New York to extend the facade of his "action" Him b Been going, he envisioned himself as a picture on a wall, suppresses anti-Semitic bile. This is probably the best response we could hope for.
