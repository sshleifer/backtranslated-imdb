When Jean Rodenberry first introduced Star Trek to NBC, the original pilot episode The Cage was denied "very cerebral". While giving the series another chance, Rodden Berry felt that the episode was rejected as a canon, and the managing director of Kirk and his crew visited Christopher Pike (Sean Kenny), the former commander, who has a distinction of what to do next, Is in accident, Ip Udu terrible awkwardness and was paralyzed. Pike meets her dear friend in the starry, where an unpleasant surprise takes place: Spock used to serve under the pike hijacked the ship and set the course for Talus IV, which is off-limits (Punishment's Death), Pike and Spock's last visit, 13 years ago . Naturally, being a logical creature, Spock changes himself and establishes a court martial, thus defending his actions. <br /> <br /> Apart from playing the rest of the stories, Part 2. What's really impressive is how Roddenberry creates a connection between a case and the rest of the Star Trek universe, with a certain type of past (more will be more to say) Allowing the screen to be off the screen and off, the original project can not be removed by NBC. In particular, Kirk is happy to see more than Captain picker and Jeffrey Hunter (unable to return to Manm√©eree), and Nimay's early days as Spike have not yet completed, and its personality has not yet been completed. <br /> <br /> Small, just a great "mystery" episode, but there is a treat for those who do not care to track Cage. Original form (which is available as part of Season 3 box set).
