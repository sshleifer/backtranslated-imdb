I would not be surprised if Soderbergh pressed forward to prevent the revolution from being corrupt as Cuba. It's just a few statistics that are not made with younger audiences. Nevertheless, almost a part of the forest shot in the area, which holds the sense of the area, especially when running Cuba mountain ranges. I liked Del Toro's commentary on Che Guevara's personality. Castro, who plays the role of Bichir, has done a great job against all odds. It is obvious that Soderbergh does not appear on these individuals, but he has since explicitly stated that he did not investigate his case to remove 'Unquis'. The most important historical things are contrary to what I read. Castro did not hand over the Soviet Union to my knowledge, until the attempts to get approval from the United States. But on other issues he was particularly concerned with the expropriation of expatriates when the island went to other rebellious control. The country's treasury is empty.
