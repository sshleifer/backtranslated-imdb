<br /> <br /> There are a few comments on the film, which is a bad and silly one and the amazing actor like Pierre Fresne does not agree to act in it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film has a very controversial view about the sanctity of wine in cabaret. <br /> <br /> For the person who does not believe the priest? Even a defrocked one? It can change it in the blood of Christ, the scene is probably disgusting. But it is very emotional to the person who grew up in the Catholic framework. <br /> <br /> The youngest priest's death scene is amazingly surprising. But very well acted. Pierre Fresney turns into a crazy act that killed something meaningful inside his character's secular madness, who violently defrocked Morand who, in this terrible way, who comes back to his destiny.
