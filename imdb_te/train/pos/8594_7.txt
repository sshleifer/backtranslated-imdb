Sentinel was a good movie and the boy was hoping that I was right. First of all is a great story from a novel and I thought this was the original story but I guess it was not and it was a very smart story. Michael Douglas is very good and Keiter Sutherland is great, but it is very difficult to hear his character in the role of Jack Bauer in 24 but in the end you and he is very different in Sentinel than 24 seconds. Another person tried to break their TV role but failed. This is Longer. She is not good in this movie and the whole back is in the back seat. After watching the film I have dreams about Sentinel and sleep. The whole sentinel is a good picture and I would recommend it.
