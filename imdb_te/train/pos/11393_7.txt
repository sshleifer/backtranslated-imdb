Uggh! I'm not really impressed in this film, but I have to admit that I've done technically well. It gets a 7 for higher output values, but for entertainment values, it is very small. In fact, I consider this one of the 50's most overrated movies. It won the Oscar for Best Picture, but the film was very daring and daring at dancing and dancing at times. This is because almost all songs and dance, unlike some of the songs that have a strong story and songs along with acting songs (ME ME in ST Lewis). In fact, if you are not in this film's long history and dance number and you do not have it, then the movie is as fast as you like it. Give me more story! As a result, with the more bloomed product numbers and the weak story, the film is a stable diet of Mereni - which is not satisfied in the long run. <br /> <br /> "A Street Nomad Desire" and "A Place in the Sun" for the Best Picture, "The African Queen" and "Ace in the Hole" are not even nominated in this regard! I was very impressed with "Ace in the Hole" for the film's best writing and screenplay - although "An American in Paris" was not talking to any story and was driven mostly by dance and song.
