Good Times is a sensational comedy about the first nuclear black family living in Chicago projects. Whether you live in the inner cities, pipelines, suburbs or rural rural areas, this exhibition is still a treasure to look and see a family, rather than a family, rather than a performance of a poor black family. But they do not live on it. They find humor and have strong family values ​​and ethics. Despite the story behind the scenes, this program is worth keeping on air unless I do not like killing off the father which has agreed with Esther Rolle who fought hard to keep the family together. But despite all the fights behind scenes, Good Times is a show about a family. We all are JJ's dynamite and his pranks. We saw Janet Jackson's penny grow slightly. The show created sensation to show frustration with drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without preachy, the Evans always tried to do something to get out of the ghetto rather than to do the right thing.
