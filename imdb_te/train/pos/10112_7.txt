I was caught in the film again in a week at a movie theater in 1996. <br /> <br /> The documentary covering his life and movies about the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr. People who worked with him were interviewed or knew him. These include: Wampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews can be combined with clips or some unsightly clips. It's interesting (somewhat) but is it really necessary? I saw all the pictures of Wood and they are terrible. Wood has goals but it is not a little bit of talent to bring them. I'm not always the worst director but he's down there. Does the producers of the original film really need us? They do not try to make some kind of saint. Some of the interviewed (especially Lugosi junior) hated a lot of people and it comes out loud and clear. In the 1960s and 70s, they completely ignored his films in the adult film industry. If you're a Wood fan it will be interesting. Best Interviews with Vampire (Wood Wear Tear) and Dolor's Fuller (Longtime Girlfriend).
