I loved this masterpiece and very frankly I thought of Mary Papins (though I love Julie Andrews and Dick Wandeyck) folly and sacred. Angela Lansbury plays the role of perfection and does not know why the film is distorted. It's magical and it's very fun watching. If you know the characters well, each scene has a certain appeal. Even though you are young and confused, the two learn together each other's relationship. Characters grew well, especially when I thought Charles was in "The Age of Believe". Mary Papins is more popular and may be of great interest to others, but I always love and save this little gem.
