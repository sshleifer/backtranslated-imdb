Eddie Murphy really made me laugh at my HBO stand-up comedy show. I love his views on Mr. T, Ed Norton and "Honeymooners", Elvis Presley, and even Michael Jackson's Ralph Cramden. Ice Cream Man, Gony Goo Go is also a great fun day. When I came in 1984, I saw the first time. I laughed too much, and I almost dropped my chair. I think it's still very funny. Eddie Murphy was one of the best figures from "Saturday Night Live" when I was on "Saturday Night Live", and I was very laughing, "Eddie Murphy Delirus" <br /> <br /> "Eddie Murphy Delias" 2 thumbs and 10/10 Give the stars.
