(There is not much in the way of spoilers, since there is not a plot to reveal, but still, I guess I explain some of what is happening ...) It is. I have not seen so much of an involuntary film. Though the "bizarre" "ridiculous" and "ego travel" is pretty close, there are just no words to describe the film. There are early half an hour or really really luckily music videos, without any story or continuity, MJ comes into some of the previous ones. MJ refuses to introduce a half-aceband bond and cut off sections from Yellow Submarine (the beloved Lord can not do) <br /> <br /> Then, one hour In addition to the "movie", our "hero" watched him and chasing him (with very creepy) an autograph. Fortunately, because he looks at the star that he is falling over, I can not do this again, and I'm going to be a claymaking hunt, he uses this fraudulent disguise to spare and express it, but for reasons I am Now I can not remember, they see it (Oh <br /> <br /> A short time after the chasing, MJ will bring him a rabbit to life, he is a policeman (child desert) <br /> <br / The rest of the film, including the male gym cleans the tune of the soft criminal, killing only one person, but also to burn his shadow into the wall, including b La atomic weapons. Another good moment when MJ saw, Big (Joe "What happened to his career at this time?" Pesha) kidnapped him and created a Tommy gun and once again torture randomly turns this picture off, which opens fire at everything moving. I was the last moment when MJ, Big and his private army was around. Seriously, this guy has dozens of dozens working for him, and they are more than what I expected, rather than commando units, rather than commando units. How does he get out? Why, he turns into a robot, full of weapons and shield. <br /> <br /> The film is very difficult, the plot is very low on the way, and almost does not continue.
