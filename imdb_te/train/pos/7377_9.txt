This image can not be explained. Alternative title "Do not Look Up" is very detailed. Like most Japanese cinema, this story is not like American. The story revolves around a director, who is depicting a story about a ww2 deskter. This set is haunted by an actress who died (?) At the time of filming a TV show in the 60s. The director is the only person who saw this presentation. If you see the ring (as well as Director of the Hito), and you like it, you love the devil actress. I loved the cast actress more than Root. A really scary and disturbing image. A 10!
