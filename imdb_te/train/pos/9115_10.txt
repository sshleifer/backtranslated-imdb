The idea is very small picture with much information. Interestingly, the entertainer and more viewer leaves the viewer. The producer made a small picture of the highest quality compared to any other short film I had seen. I rated this movie in the highest rating. I also recommend that I show off to office managers and businessmen in any office. People with thoughts never heard, their voice never heard. This is a lesson to be taught by any office that wants to go forward. I hope that the product produces the second part of this 'idea'. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequence. Once again, congratulations to the Halak media in building a high quality and quality image with a lesson in mind.
