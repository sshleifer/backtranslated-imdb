Perhaps the last film you'd get from Vittorio de Sica and Cesar Jawtini (the novel based on the film). This is a neurologist fantasy, really a type of antagonism. An older woman finds a baby in her cabbage patch and increases her as her son. A few years later, the baby is a little boy (that is completely) and the foster mother dies. He goes to an orphanage and finally goes when he is 18. He soon learns that he is not home. Thoroughly, though positive, and anything do not let him down. A man steals his value, instead of getting angry, becomes his friend and goes and is a little peace with him. Toto takes some initiative and many homeless living in the area and they build a good shantytown. Soon, the landlord tries to sell this land of land, and Shantinown citizens must defend themselves. After several attempts, the employer turns the police force to get rid of homeless people. At this time, the film becomes a full-fledged fantasy (which has a more humorous / dramatic play in the style of Charlie Chaplin before). This thing is very strange and surprising, others are better off to see it. It is very exciting, and very funny. There are some objections you can say about the Miracle Platform of Milan. Fellini and Visconti were subjected to criticism when they started to distance from neurolisz. I think it's widely criticized during my release. At this time, however, it was very enjoyable - I loved it so much. It may be my favorite of Vittorio di Chica, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves are very close and close. 10/10.
