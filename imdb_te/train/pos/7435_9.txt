I first saw this video 15 years ago. I thought it was wonderful then and I would still do it. I am a lover of English (high school and college) and English romantic poetry, so Coleridge made me very well. You can not get my vote to remove the beauty of the poem or the power of the story. In this case, everything works well for the viewer, especially the high school students. This story is well illustrated for the generation that grew up on television. In addition, the voice of Michael Redgrave attaches a sense of authenticity and power. Okay, so there is no big budget for the project. So it is not Star Wars and it does not have CGI. But who can remove Gustave Door Illustration as part of the show? The above comment, which only four lines remove the video as the worst piece, which is vast and objectionable. I am a friend of the producer, but this is not my reason for this comment. Besides, I am defending the work of artistry which I think is worth all levels. This brings the students' poetry's poem and awakens their appreciation and awakens their sympathy for the lesson of the ancient sailor.
