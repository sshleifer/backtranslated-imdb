Certainly the best comedy come from rocks in independent films. You have to have a sense of humor that you fully enjoy this one. For some reason the film was not due to its credit. First, start the story line everyone loves a good treasure hunt. When a dead father advised a secret fund to leave behind the backs, it would not bring together two families but a tornado adventure begins. A Polish translator, a comatross mother, turret syndrome, clumsy homosexual hypnotist, and a drag-and-head split head, make money round the world, but the family turns into enemies. My favorite character in this film is sister / crack slave with Tort's syndrome, she breaks out suddenly, you'll be crying and imitating a week.
