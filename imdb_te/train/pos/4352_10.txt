I saw a film that did not promote the movie lists in my area in Yahoo!. I looked closer and saw that Peter Faulk and Paul Riser were in it. After watching "Mad Me", I was not a fan of Paul Reiser. However, I'm a big fan of Peter Faulk. So husband and I took a chance. We have both fallen in this story. Beautiful scenery, heartfelt acting and families and moral values ​​are rarely featured in motion pictures and world days. Unworthy waste is not real life conditions from people in real life. I am also Paul Ricer, but I still do not see "Mad about you". I do not know this movie has gone. I've put in a limited release. It should share the world. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. M.
