"Crazy Crazy" is a great rock comedy all the time without doubt. It is incorrect as compared to "spinal top is", it has nothing to do with it. "Spinal Tap" is a satirical (and, quite frankly, very good one, although it is "outing" in many rock clich√©s). Unlike "Tap", "Still Crazy" has gained popularity with great actors, great songs and great human situations. Be careful about people in "Still Crazy". All of those items. Oh, yes, the music's pretty damn good, too, written by Mick Jones of Chris Depod's of the alien and squeeze. American audiences are already familiar with Stephen Ray (The Crying Game), but later acquainted with Bill Nyighy (Underworld, Underworld, Pirates of the Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (The Harry Potter films).
