Indian Summer! It's very exciting for me. I was funny, hearty, and totally loved it! Anyone who went to a small child and had a short time could go back to "good ole" days, for a while this really needs to look! It starts 20 years later, and the old camps team returns for a "reunion". I'll have to look at you anymore. The actors are great, and it has all the cast. It played a wonderful role in everyone. Part of the movie you're looking at is really you feel. Alan Arkin is good in his role as Uncle Lou. He plays the kind of person they wish everyone in their life wishes. This is a very good family image. I mentioned this to anyone in my heart! Highly recommended!
