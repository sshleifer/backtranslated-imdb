Actually I have a lot of comments about this movie. I saw part of the Slavic Film Festival at a major American university. But no one in the USA heard it, it's a real shame! Dynamics among people is what makes both funny and sad. They are stuck together in a long bus trip - there's a lot of us to someplace !! But I never had one like this !! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene was their stopping for fun. Then the woman and the woman penetrate into the forest for some lovemaking, but everyone will follow them to see them without knowing them! She is raising her skirt and as he enters her all the way - using hacking begins & they discover everyone is watching !! Talk about the surprise! But ... even if it's ridiculously funny, they really feel! When you see the end they are contrary to what they enjoyed themselves enjoyed! Serb Comedy It's the best!
