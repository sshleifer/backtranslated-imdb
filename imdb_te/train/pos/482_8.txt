A poem in this film is beautifully presented with beautiful artwork. It captures the atmosphere of time and climate. (Italy's lake district in the twenties.) It is a love story with a twist. Characters are unique and trustworthy. The settings are deliciously exotic. Some of the scenes - the funeral boat in the fog --- the high long shot of the chess table in the middle of the tile floor intact --- beautiful pictures. And more than mandatory, this story is a bitter sweetness. <br /> <br /> If the image is an art, it is close to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
