This is my favorite Jackie Chan film and in an interview, Jackie says it's his favorite as well. It has some unbelievable stunts and jaw dropping fight sequences as well as some very funny scenes. The film was a favorite of Brandon Lee, who used the Rapid Fire Parts, and was also lifted in Tango and Cash, which used some early scenes. <br /> <br /> Jockey in Hong Kong plays a police role. This story will immediately jump into a fairy chase through a garbage town and jacky will slip down a hill and continue as jumps in a moving bus to catch the evil cook (one of the greatest villains in the Jackie Chan movie.) You can expect some of the jockey chick as his police officer with his girlfriend There are very funny scenes when trying to balance his fate. His job is to protect the Secretary of Defense and have enough information to take him, but it can cause many problems. Jackie is here to stay perfect. My favorite fighting scene for anyone who's the last fight scene at the mall - is the period. When it finds jockey tasks and climax, it's the most serious fight I've seen on a pole in between the lights. Moreover, one of the greatest conflicts he has done, has removed the skin from his hands. <br /> <br /> He was not electrocuted as a responsible stunt who used high voltage instead of low voltage. <br /> <br /> The whole Chan is classic and definitely one of his great films. By the end of the film, he certainly did not do anything back and his stunt was not done. Most of the film does not hurt his stuntmen, no one can insure them - Jackie is responsible. There are no gimmicks, wires or stand-ins - a true real life action, which is a treat to watch. This is a kind of action, this is a phenomenon that he is saying and a picture that surprises people from 100 years. If you do not see this movie and are usually a fan of Jackie Chan or action, give yourself a treat and watch this movie. It's really sensational.
