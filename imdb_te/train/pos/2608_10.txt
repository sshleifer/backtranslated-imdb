Rosenne's last season Crazy roller coaster ride. The last episode is that a previous commentary tells us that we know the unknown letters we do not know. Rosenne returns in the season, and tells us that the show has played her role in her life. In the final episode she will see the events and the people correct. Scott was not really with Leon, but he was in existence. Marc and David married a real life wives, and Don died when she was alive. Events in her life were made, she changed them in her work. Do not ask everyone what we want to do. What we do not have for a moment at all times is that we want to use an eraser and change it to our taste. What did she do with the whole piece. And another comment is that I do not feel cheated, the family is real in my mind, she just changed the way that events took place in their lives. A + show end A +!
