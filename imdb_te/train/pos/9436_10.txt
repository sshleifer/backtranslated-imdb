"Is this you, Ed?" "Now you come to play the game." On the opening day of Sinarama Dome in Hollywood, my father saw this movie with his new girlfriend on the day he left his mother. I am fourteen years old. <br /> Today, after thirty six years, it gives me quick queries. <br /> <br /> My father is a big Burt Reynolds fan and hence the reason for standing up for an hour to watch an action action movie. "Grand Prix" and "The Song of Norway." In the previous dome I saw two images. Well this is not exactly Mario Andretti or Brody Bunch. <br /> <br /> In the tender age, I congratulate the artistry ... after seeing it again today, it is enough to say that this is a painful experience to kiss his first girlfriend at the age of fourteen. <br /> As an adult, I'm still very upset and yet I'm still impressed with the quality of film making. <br /> <br /> Billy Reddon, Invibard guitar, all the principles of insurance salesman frightened Ronnie Cox ... Burt Reynolds is a perfect wonder ... everyone does a fantastic job. No sound quality to both, from the chirping birds to the confusing clock. Photography, cinematography ... First of all technical aspects of this particular picture are rated. <br /> <br /> After killing sexual molesters, killing a human being is deep on the day when this sensational film is released. Classic scenes that attempted to live in the forest after dealing with such unexpected brutality led to life changes. These four men, city men, suddenly faced the predictable situation and escalated the horrors from action. <br /> This is definitely an authentic. And on Saturday afternoon, the word "creeping a beautiful mouth" has been cited for the blue-cooled off-cuff remarks from Saturday Night Live, the film has a large part of our social pop culture ... <br> /> <br /> What would you do if you found that your friends were sexually harassed by your sex drive from mountaineering? In the city, cozy bed, wife and children? And if you take actions done by Burt Reynolds (and I will do it) will you bury the body underneath the lake or have to attend the trial? Bottom line: Deliverance Delivers. You can take it to the bank. <br /> If you have already seen, please rent it again and ask the above query. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film remains the same: Failed to kill Matt Deer ... Changing. Life and it can change a person to an unpredictable situation. And what I like about this film is all about Zone Voight, especially Ed, gives the best performance here. He is one of the most talented actors from Midnight Cowboy in Hollywood history, Franklin D. in Pearl Harbor. For Roosevelt's extremely low-esteemed performance, his performance will bring this picture to another level. It is necessary to believe that rocking up at the time of dusk is terrified and decided to do the right thing. I assure you that your heart rate increases to new levels. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Times have changed, but our choices have no human beings. <br /> <br /> Ten of ten stars are ten.
