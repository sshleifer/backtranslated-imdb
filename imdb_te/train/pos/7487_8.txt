I am very interested in the American movie because this film is really enjoyable ... Antebellum years and especially civil war. I recently purchased it from the rock of previously-watched videos sold in the supermarket, and I enjoyed adding it to my History Video Collection. A civil war broke out between the cadets at the West Point in California's Civil War films such as "Glory" or "Gettysburg." <br /> <br /> It was gray uniform, youth, or military discipline, but I was impressed by the edge of the Corps of Cadets' story around 1830. <br /> <br /> In fact, I guess I needed to learn lessons against the two classes and sit in a classroom with other young people. He graduated in 1861: one in May, one in June. Henry A. and George Caustar, the first graduate of the film, is the final stage of the June class. The cause of the two classes was not about the war, but a few years after the experiments with a five year course (five years after the study turned out) was attended for five years, the other four. While photographing the film, cadets were like brothers and often have nicknames for each other ... George "funny" or "auto" custress; Alonso "Loan" Cushing; James "Beauty" Stewart (1854 class for JEB Stuart), etc. <br /> <br /> This movie is a 1901 film, enjoyable, because I really have fudges this movie "Santa Fe Trail" history. Cadets of many different classes graduated together. JEB Stuart and Jorge Caster friends were well documented and were left side-by-side to stop John Brown's 1859 revolt in Harper's Ferry. In fact, Stuart and Custard's friends are always enemies during the war. <br /> <br /> In 1863, Gatesburg was one of them (for the first time, I feel) (at Stuart Harper's ferry ride, whereas the custody is still a cadet at the time). <br /> <br /> "Funny" Castor plays a role in "Class of 61", although his classmate, Dave O'Neill and Shelley Payton are fictional. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I really appreciate any film that gives a window in the movie or mid-19th century. America.
