I remember this film when I was a child in Disney's fantastic world. The film has been in my memory for more than 30 years and I am looking for it. I want to say that all kids have gone out of the movies, it's harder than anyone and after a while I thought I'd like to see it again. The story and images of this film are burned to my memory. Today, in the 70s I never saw that day, in fact, I never remembered the title until the internet searches today. I enjoyed it and wanted to see my children.Did you know where I will be?
