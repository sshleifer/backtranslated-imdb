The rest of the Blackbeststars and Movies in the summer is full, and I can not tell you about the disappointment of those returns, and I find a movie that I can enjoy and enjoy. <br /> If you do not want to read down the page, there are no spoilers, I'll sum it here: Ella Enchanted is more mature parts, death is plenty, and with little blood shots, not just little kids), but it's overly muted or its boundaries No transition. Think of a bit more intense, bit more magical Princess Bride, and you'll be close to it. <br /> ------------------------------------------ ---- --------------- <br /> <br /> I'm probably not an amazing movie like the others ... maybe one or twice a month, if I'm active. I'm also a huge sized-fi / fantasy fan. <br /> <br /> Last here (August), I am disappearing in the film. With tired expectations from big hits, I found Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust. <br /> <br /> There are my hopes to be completely naked by my Transformers for my fi drug drugs, while the stardust's previews seem attractive, but I have absolutely caution. <br /> <br /> Many others here are totally surprised by me. I went to look at breakfast from another typical fantasy film cliché. Do not be fooled, it's definitely a fairy tale, and it does not actually have witches, magic, and totally disqualification of disbelief ... but the most refreshing thing I found <br /> (Unlike 90% of other drawings, If you look back like a thorns, Hollywood ideas are running out? This year I was able to read a book and in two years the film "Epic Farm Sea story, LotR and the rest of the likes. "So NYT and so on. <br /> <br /> Stardust did not bolt my seat due to the jam-packed action at every turn, because of the plot-hook I was bullets Apart from dramatic tension and echo across the theater in a loud boom, which sounds to grab my attention on what's going on the screen   ి యొక్క అపారమైన పేలుళ్లను కూడా ఉపయోగించలేదు (ట్రాన్స్ఫార్మర్స్, నేను మీరు చూస్తున్నాను). ఇది తాజా CGI పద్ధతులను చూపించటానికి ప్రయత్నిస్తున్నది కాదు, లేదా 3 వ గ్రేడ్ (నేను ఆ ద్వేషాన్ని నేను ద్వేషించాను) లో కనుగొన్నాను, ఇది సాధారణమైనదిగా ఉన్న చిన్న డైలాగ్లు మరియు కథ పంక్తులతో నా గూఢచారాన్ని నేరం చేయలేదు. <br /> I see. Seeing, and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline to unfold before my eyes. Sure, I might know what is happening throughout the movie too, but you will forget that. <br /> <br /> It has moved my heart to some part of my part, but the most important thing I see is that I went into the theater. It was like a cool sweet cup tea to minimize the work done by other people trying to get out of them after having spent much of this summer with very few recollections and movies that had fallen to my expectations. <br /> <br /> It may not be for everyone, but Be good to you. If you enjoy fantasy movies to stand alone time (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, Dark Crystal, etc.) then you really need to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> This little diamond goes into the moment of hitting the stores in my DVD collection, you can trust me. <br /> Just amazing.
