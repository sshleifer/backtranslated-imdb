<br /> <br /> Some of these other people did not see any movie than I saw, but they saw "Joseph Smith: The Prophet of Restoration". Well done and inspiring. I'm sure it's worth watching. It is evident that the film has taken very serious care at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of portraying Joseph Smith as a man and a prophet. <br /> <br /> Joseph's spiritual experiences were painted with taste and respect. <br /> <br /> I would definitely see this movie.
