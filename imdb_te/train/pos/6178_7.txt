Michelle Leesen is the fifth feature of the director, and his earlier films show his diversity through a music direction. He played a guest role as a character. <br /> <br /> You are the code before this and it did not do anything similar in the US (like 30+ years). As the spectators see what they are portrayed in musical numbers - from any widescreen shots or Alba Baskie above. <br /> <br /> Leeds is unlikely as others have said, and Jack Okee and Victor McLaughlin play their normal movie people. <br /> <br /> Musical numbers are very interesting and some are good (especially RAPC's rape comedy) but the play is incredible and fake - three murders have a lower emotional effect on more characters. The film was very good.
