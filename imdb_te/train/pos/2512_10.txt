Since Japanese singers are a favorite of the gaat and hiad fans, I'm very curious when they realize they've done a movie together and that's my goal in life to see it. I'm not disappointed. In fact, this film has exceeded my expectations. Unlike singers, Gutk and Hyde acted, I was ready to do it, and not really performances, but I was delighted to say that I was attracted to both and trusted in the story that continued. The moon's child has the right amount of humor, action, romance and extreme, heart-pain movements. I can not say that I have ever shouted in the movie and these smooth movements are a couple, in my opinion, definitely prove their skills as actors. Combat sequences are absolutely fantastic and with some uncertainty, it's quick to get you into the film and start bonding with the characters. I specially recommend this film to the film, especially the fans of Gate and Hyde.
