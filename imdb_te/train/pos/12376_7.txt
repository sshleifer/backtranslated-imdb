All star cast is awesome to look like the "Mad Mad Mad World" of horror films, "The Sentinel" (1977) is an efficient cinematic picture on the relatively unknown actress Christina Ryans. This one, she plays a fashion model, Alison Parker, moves into a Brooklyn Heights Brown Stone (and I do not think I'm giving too much in this end of the Hell Gateway). And as a tenant in this building, she is facing much worse than the leaky plumbing and the occasional water bug to keep it soft! Really, the scene where Alison meets her sound upstairs is really terrifying, and certainly sends down the audience's spinal ice down. Despite many critically acclaimed complaints about Rhaynes's performance, she likes her with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The film can potentially lead to a strange conclusion, and although some of the plots are not prescribed, I have enjoyed more than satisfied. The book "DVD Delirium", "Better de Angelo and Sylvia Miles, no movie in the Leads do not be as bad as Lesbians!" One side note, yesterday I went to Sentinel House and walked to Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights 10. Yes, this is still there, and if Ivy lacks a blind priest / son at the shorn and top floor window of its heavy coat, it looks the same as in this film. If this house really sat at the hell entrance, I think it's a hell ... Brooklyn Queen's Express. But for some time we learned New Yorkers!
