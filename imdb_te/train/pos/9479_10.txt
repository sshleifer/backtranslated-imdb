Tian's remake is not good. I clicked on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei, some words for the original actress staff in the classic 1948 film. We will meet Wei Wei on Sunday (28/3/2010) after showing Jiao Cheong Zhu Chun in the Hong Kong Film Archive. Wei Wei is at silver at the age of 90, and her guest role in Hong Kong is surprising to her fans. This year at the Hong Kong Film Festival, a special event dedicated to Fay Mu, the film director and Wei Wei's film still filmed in Hong Kong. My son, who turns 21 this year, is shocked Wei Wei then beautiful.
