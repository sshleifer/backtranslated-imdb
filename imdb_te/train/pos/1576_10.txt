This is an amazing picture. These women tried to save their husbands. I thought the performances of the actors were great. I had to think about the film for a long time. Every student wants to see this film so that I can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked this film because I told you how much love it was. I want to be strong as a woman. It really liked me because it told me about relationships and I wanted to see a picture. I can compare the movie with Der Utergaon, the pianist. If you combine these three pictures, you will see a great scene of what happened during the war. We must remember forever.
