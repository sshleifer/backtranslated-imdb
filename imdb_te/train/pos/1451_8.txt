I saw this film 6 times. And every time I see it, I'm more impressed by the story and acting. It's like putting the rail debris in motion. Its method is its subtle but very effective in its goal. <br /> <br /> Spellers-> Very good dichotomy in the middle of the story. On the one hand, we are worried about the old Major, Eddie Calhoun (Cusack) on the old boys network that is the heart of New York's Administration, and on the other hand we are intentionally required by the monitor boss Japathy. <br /> <br /> The film ends in the end, when Japathy himself kills himself and attempts to do the same with him and Calhoun Pappas while performing the orders of Alcello. <br /> <br /> In this movie you will not know the whole thing - a new thing in this world you do not know history A great image that deserves a rating.
