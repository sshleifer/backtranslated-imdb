<br /> <br /> A young Jimmy Stewart drama in Hungary is a qualified bachelor "Craecech", a mysterious admirer of the innocent "Clara" of Margaret Salvann. Crawl is secretly transformed into Clara's pen-friend, and working together in the work of Clara about Clara's (Crawley's) letters. Apparently is besotted with Kralik Klara - but he will not be able to know his feelings while competing with "pen-friend". Confused? <br /> <br /> This story has a sweet, almost sugar ending - but we know that we have enough end. Other characters mentioned include Frank Morgan's typical role, the owner of the store "Hugo Mathescheck", Felix Brescert "Pirovich", the credulum's conviction. <br /> <br /> Finally, William Tracey did not trust him. It's not true that Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan had recently rendered "You've Got Mail" - but I suspect young audiences. If you're in the area, you need to pour a good glass wine, put a log on the fire and have a box with the Cleansex hand.
