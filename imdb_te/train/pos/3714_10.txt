<br /> <br /> Someone has brought back a cult type of movie and it is currently applied, and something is lost in translation. </ P> <p> Case is not here. The movie starts on the right track. This is part of the familiar territory but manages to take it on top as well. Anyone with a croclosse scene? It has to look, and just try and keep a straight face. The film is an old and sophisticated cult movie classics and has managed to combine smoothly as a modern product. It's good to see someone in this market filling the need. <br /> <br />
