In Lizzie Boden's "Love Crimes" (1992), Sean Young is a rainbow D.A. Atlanta. <br /> <br /> She is a lone lover who deals with women, compromises them, and then abandons them (Patrick Bergne) as a celebrity fashion photographer. <br /> Obviously, this tough loner decides to enter Fanny Shuttlebug's life by hitting him by deceiving animals. They meet, they love, then the next thing she knows, she is on her lap, shed on the buttocks. (Note: The scene of this buttock is only in the "unforgivable" version of the film, the R-rated version ignores it and other scenes.) Female nudity and disturbing images in this mental thriller <br /> <br /> Sean Young is a thriller when she plays her cat, "Love Crimes" is fine. Mummy game with Bergin, trying to catch him in an indictment. It's unfortunate that the movie is out and it will stop. That's true. Director Lizzy Bourne might have just started telling the story, but after 92 minutes go to the credits, and we say "what just happened?" <br /> <br /> Young's plan sinks in style, but lacks a coherent end to some audiences. <br /> Dawn (Dandorado @ yahoo.com)
