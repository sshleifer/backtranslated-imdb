The original Demille film was made in 1938 with Frederick Mark. Very good movie. Hollywood love of reconstruction brings us a very interesting picture featuring Yul Brauner. He is always wise as he always seems to see all his movies. The stroke of Charlton Heston intellect as Andrew Jackson. However, movies are getting smaller places. It does not move at the speed of 1938 version. Still, it's a fun movie to be seen at least once.
