This is one of the best episodes from MOH second season, I think he has a problem with Mick Garris women ... he kills all of them, they are often victims (screwy solution, Pro-Life, Valerie on the steps, I do not remember Urgont's episode Season 1) . I think he will get women to burn, violence, mutilated and see what I do not know. At least the "right to die" is the best, good twists and graphic scenes and suspense (especially with photos from the cell scene). Acting is much like the whole series, as I'm "pro-life" or "we scream for ice cream". Moreover, I feel the plot of a movie and that can only be done for the episode. The concept of the series is terrible, killing and abandoning women, mutilating animals and ... the first season "Cigarette Burns" (best of all), "Homecoming" is the most funny), "Imprint" (really shocking).
