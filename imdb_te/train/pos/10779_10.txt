A classic cartoon, always enjoyable and funny. It completes an interesting plot with fun characters. Road Rovers is a valuable display, it's a small 13 episodes, and if you can handle a chance to see anytime, you must be. Unfortunately, this is very difficult. I want to release DVD with Warner Bros. Studios 13 episodes. If they do, I will surely buy it, and if they do, you should buy it. If you have children who love dogs, they love road rovers! Road Rovers attracted much attention when it was broadcast, it was an original and very special event.
