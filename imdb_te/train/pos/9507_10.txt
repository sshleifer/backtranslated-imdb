The government he has to fight to recognize his credibility with promise and much needed pension. Ripstein's songwriting Colonel strengthens herself by rejecting ways to live with respect for her citizens and to benefit her citizens, making good sweet smell for all those who are suffering from a dull and hardened society. Apart from the unhappiness to wait for God, Colonel's waiting for his pension arrival gives his otherwise painful life hope and significance. Colonel, who played the role of Fernando Lujan, has two things in the film; His military pension arrives one day and his son Agustin dies for a great cause, a knowledge that excludes anesthetic discomfort in a solid cocktail. The former could not realize, and the world was forced to prove the latter, Colonel set about fighting his son's fighting self-confidence, he can only do. Confident is now a warrior and loyal to Colonel and his Assamese wife, but his fighting ring is the killer of his former owner Agustin. In the conflict between Colonel and Nogales, his son murderer, the equivalent of the full pension of Nogales Colonel, the government agent paid to Colonel. But it is blood money. Those in power had fought for their political ideals, and because the warlord Colonel's son had been killed by the abandoned and writings of underground paper, he belonged to workers' rights, unions and ordinary man. With maximum honor, Colonel Nogales denies the proposal, chooses his fighting rooster and walks with his old legs carrying him. While in the house, Donna Lola, his uncle's wife, wanted to know why Colonel rejected when they were hungry. In response to her persistent question, "From November (when the cockfire season begins) we're going to have what we eat," Colonel responded, "shit." Eating all of their lives poor and helpless, and wanting to eat dignified, knowing that the extermination colonel never sells him for evermore. Colonel is the only man of honor and valor in the world without the doctrines.
