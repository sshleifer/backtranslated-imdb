I do not know why I chose this movie to see, it has a strange title and it's like something different from the description. Every time you try a little different from Hollywood heroine / thriller films. This image is absolutely different. The film was initially astonishing at me, but I can not recognize that the movie is over, because when I realized that the movie was so great it was so great. I thought acting was awesome and we hope that character development can really care about them and in the end make them good stuff. I feel that everyone who sees the film will be involved in the characters in some way and it makes for great views and good laughs at the pure simplicity of the cast. <br /> <br /> "I have a wider appeal and should give me an opportunity." .
