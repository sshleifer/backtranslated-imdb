This is the best documentary I have seen !! I saw the Lords of DotTown and I wanted to know more about Stacy Paralta, and was surprised and knowing that it was one of his movies. Great job stacy! I bore back at work last week, bored O * & ^% less and got this film. As I grew up in Orange County in the 80s, I sat down on the local beaches and my father did when he was a young man. I grew up at the beach, and my parents took every weekend, I surf body, and there's a boogieboard from there. This film has attracted me. It was a way before my time but it was awesome to see what this guys went through! This image is a collector's topic.
