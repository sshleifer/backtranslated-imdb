I caught this last dish this night. I liked the movie. I traveled to Russia for 3 different times (receiving our 2 children). I can not put my finger on exactly why I liked this movie than seeing the "bad" and "good" and "good" turn "semi bad". I saw Ben Chaplin through the whole movie. It's good for me (or it works) whether this is good or bad "Great end 7/10, rent it or hold it on the dish as I did.
