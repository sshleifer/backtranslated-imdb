Looking at Midnight Cowboy acting / directing / cinematography / compilation / writing is a master class taking. I was at a very young age when it was first released, and I saw it for the first time a few years ago, but it stopped my time test and I saw it very often. <br /> <br /> Everything about the film is from the Vote and the sharp performances from the Hoffmans. (Even though I know this movie well, I see his innocence in his illness and ominous way of Hoffman coughs that appears to be his innocence everywhere) with amazing cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences. <br /> <br /> It is shameful that our contemporary filmmakers are willing to risk making films that are more visually and interesting. Midnight cowboy needs to be seen in all movie schools. <br /> <br />
