<br /> <br /> I am one of the best producers of sopranos, which is a mixture of reality and fiction, which is hard to find. This is the same feature in the Thapa Theme! James Gandolfini fits at the paper as a glove! I can never finish sopranos forever. It's perfect! It should be a thing in school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a child, but I was so small to stay waked until the episode ends, so now I bought all the parts in the DVD format and I'm looking at all the episodes in the home before I dine with the Prison Break and arrived. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best series for television. Both of these arguments are fantastic and the actors are perfect. Congratulations for such work. <br /> Sorry about my English. Thank you for reading.
