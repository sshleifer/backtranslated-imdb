After reading a lot of negative opinions for the film, I'm not sure if I should pay some rent. However, this is a pleasant surprise. If I did not see the original film, but it was much better then I was in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise gives a strong performance like David, who is unmistakably inconsistent, smile on the legs (the only other in his career - other examples are Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July). Penelope Cruz is slightly lightweight but fills demands for his role as Diaz. Kurt Russell, who was just disappointed. But in this movie, this is not really impressive acting - its filmmaking. <br /> Cameron Crowe plays a role in the role of the director, giving himself a simple change of pace from his simple stick. The film's incredible insanity is executed by Crowe (a short sequence that runs through a vacant time square is very effective). The soundtrack (a special feature of a Crow image) is also amazing. <br /> You look and watch quietly and challenged. The plot seemed slightly contrived, but the explored issues behind it were endlessly debated. The film is not accurate, but it is a welcome change for those who have grown up on cruise and croww and Hollywood explanations.
