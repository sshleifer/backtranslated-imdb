Tarzan and his companion (1934) is the only Tarzan I have ever seen when I was a child. It sound boring. Now I see that. I saw a monkey man (1932) about a hundred times and put a copy in my drive. This is a fantastic picture. It's almost flawless. Tarzan and his colleague (1934), falters. It is not harmony and its parts live. Parts are often very good and action sequences are great. The big budget is expensive. Tarzan himself co-starring. Jane is prevalent. I forget about criticism and instead sing her appreciation so she has grown sexy and has become a wild girl. Well. She stole a kiss from her and told her to lay a mound that had killed an elephant. She takes a bracelet from her father and holds Tarzan. Forever. The matter breaks into pieces for the moment he went about his businesses in the Jungle. Stupid? Then someone found in the river. Well it is supposed to prove Tarzan dead. Some less play. In a dead Tarzan persuaded that a crazy rabbit Jane was gone. She wants to give their words and stay away from England. Stupid Jane knows how tough Tarzan forgot how hard he was to kill. Caravan leaves and Jane goes along. Again a pit. She wants to be a few hours or more hours, picking up some things and making it easier for her to tell the forest and her dead husband. She might be smart. She can dive when they find floating bracelet, check the banks for traces. She can fire in 15 seconds and can swing in liana. Choosing traces can not be too difficult for Jane Jane. She can talk on her apples, and so on. If she does not get to work in England without her work, she will be disturbed. Jane's smart but cheap drama brings her down. And why her kissing rapist on the ground is able to get away with "I blame you so much". Perhaps the punishment for Wein? Nonsense. Struggle, hard slap and Tarzan are worthwhile. Still. The film is round and too deep but not too bad. Just lean back and have fun. This is Tarzan and Jane for God.
