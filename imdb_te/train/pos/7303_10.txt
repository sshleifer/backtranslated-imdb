I was able to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Almost 30 years ago, I made my horrors very much. Boy I'm wrong. There are some great moments falling down my spine. Even acting was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was amazing and Donald Pleasance was fantastic. <br /> <br /> The difficulty is to slow down but it will go once. This makes all the capacitors, e.g. Nightmare on Elm Street, see Scream's most intuitive. I can not really say that Carpenter is the best thing because I do not see so many people, I'm the only person who can remember him, Starman (I think he did make it). The victory of the crown of Halloween horror style.
