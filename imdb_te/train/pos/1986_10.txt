A trip error! The kid who plays Oliver is a bit toooooo sweet! Great cinematography, color, costume and most glamorous performances starts with this must watch the movie. I have seen several simulations of this great novel, but it will have to do all of these and its music! It's a wonderful fantan, never left his character to make a song. If you do not like him, you do not really know the same feeling I've got in the book. In other forms you hates him from start to finish. Bill Cykes .... When you read the book he gave a meaning, so he is in the film. Oliver Reed is Master. His wife prescribed this masterpiece. I went and made his final film, Gladiator not looking at the titles, based on his many fine shows. Music times and mood fits. Who will buy this beautiful movie? You must!
