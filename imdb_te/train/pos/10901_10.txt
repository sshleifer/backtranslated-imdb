It's probably the best documentary I've seen in a long time. Johnny Kennedy and still a pathetic cute inspiration. He was not a survivor of the most painful diseases, but used his beauty to show the world that he was alive after death and that the world should not reach out and spread his love. Watching the closing hearts of minutes of the long struggle of his life. It is a pleasure to hear his smart donkey comments and see his adorable gestures. It is impossible to describe him smile. I feel like this small giant touched me. Please if you have the opportunity to watch this movie anytime - consider yourself fortunate to meet Johnny Kennedy.
