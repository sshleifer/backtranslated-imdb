Perhaps one of the funniest films in the world. Oscar material. Tray Parker and Matt Stone are happy and I suggest you look at one of the funniest cartoons created by "South Park" before you see this. Buy it, every time you see it, you laugh. Pure stroke of intellectual. If you do not think it's funny, then you do not have any humor. 10 to 10.
