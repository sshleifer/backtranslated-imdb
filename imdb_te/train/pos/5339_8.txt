<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> We are together with two neighboring couples - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Cruise and Eric Carrington), and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafsson). Vivian appears as a homemaker, James serves as a lawyer, lawyer Lilian in real estate, and Gabe's successful plastic surgeon. Have all Now, let's get it. <br /> <br /> Entering Abby, Porn star starred Chelsea Blue. She hires a house on the street from Fennes and lives with her all. At the beginning of the film, James looked at her window, and Abby was busy with her girlfriend, Gigi (played by the fruitful Alexander Alexander) and wondered how to stay secretly with her. The next day, Abby introduces her four men, and appears to be a good woman who lives an alternative lifestyle. She makes a pass in Vivian, as he feels as afraid, and says to her, "Oh ... I'm not that." <br /> <br /> She looks nude at Abby Geeb's office, asking Gibb to get a boob job. <br /> <br /> "Let me tell you about Gabe." "What do you want to know?" "Gaby happily married?" "I'm getting married." "There are difficulties ... I guess, your wife will stay at home and you do everything I ask but she is a good girl." "Yes." "Is not she a bad girl?" <br /> <br /> In the Abi test room gets the gap there. After that, James puts her in a small concert in the window, and she does not get sexually abused with her. James is unaware that the teddy bear on flashing red-eye piano is really a camera tap to all the festive (it's clear anyway). Abby then has sex with Gabe, and Giga meets in three ways at this time. Now Abby is both in two, requests 100,000 dollars from each other to buy her silence. <br /> <br /> Gabe and James were "experimenting" with women at Abby College while battling their guilt. It was long ago, but you did not know that she was working with the baby - she looked like an old pro. <br /> <br /> While Gigi goes along with this plan, sex has her girlfriend. "It's just a business," Abby says. There is some vicious information on the true identity of Abby - it appears to be doing the same for different people in many places. <br /> <br /> This information is used to fight against Gabe and James Abby's Blackmail. <br /> Now, sex. Sexual scenes are pretty good, and Julia Cruise has a long romantic background taking into consideration all the participants of the film, and I do not imagine anything less. Nicole Sheridan's four scenes are the best in the film and the second is the third one. Monique Alexander only came nude, but she was a very small character. Julia Cruise is a major character and naked in the same number. <br /> She had a great storyline, "Gate of Sexual Doors" to close, the whole grade image. <br /> <br /> Women's: A- (Nicole Sheridan is good in the film - Fred Olen Ray's comedy is the best thing she ever gave, at least she could do some of her drama. Chelsea's blue scene was not that bad as she was an adversary Julia Cruise who wants to give her her self-I Monique Alexander, however, needs more face time for this film. <br /> <br /> Sex: B , Very strong sex scenes Nicole Sheridan's performances have almost all of the hardcore quality, and Chelsea Blue also looks good in her scenes.The two female babies are scorching but they do not have the screenplay. <br /> <br /> Story: B + (I dialogue and lead The storyline is good for Chelsea Blue's acting style, and I am impressed with Nicole Sheridan's turn of play I am. <br /> Overall: B (which is a nice soft image, and I'm glad, I was pleasantly astonished saw that, further to the Chelsea Blue, E., Which also goes for Nicole Sheridan - while she's fine, even though the comedy. I do not care for hardcore girls who do soft images.)
