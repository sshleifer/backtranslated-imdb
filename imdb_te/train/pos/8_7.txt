While a very good drama, the audience seemed to have some empty areas to fill the action. I can imagine life as a person who I read or write. The film is just worn by the real world: suddenly the only assistant, live-in relatives and their quarrels, demolishes the kid and then, usually falling in school, Jacques's husband nest egg and buy beer. 2 thumbs.
