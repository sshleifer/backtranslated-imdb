When you start looking at this animation-masterpiece, you'll notice that this is a European product. Although Europeaners (sin) combine some of the combinations you will find generally in this American product. One of these is the high nasty that can only vanquish our (very short and very unlikely) leaders. Another of the group is for money only, will be greedy, flew up when heated, but something in his good nature. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a TV series that ended four years ago. Unlike the movie, the TV series is not a cartoon and a computer animation. First I thought I would kill the charm and character of the computer plot, but I'm confident very quickly: who animates the one who knows his or her! Though the characters are clearly fiction (they are not actually visible on the stills), they appear to be alive and sensitive as audiences following their exploration. Roles that are considered to be deformed by "normal" criteria (which can never bring the living bodies to life), alive and more than "highlight"! The creation of the world is another masterpiece. It's not because of its inventiveness, because of its inventiveness. Our heroes of the world are not as solid as our own in the world but are made up of several pieces that vary in size and shape that seem to float in the middle. When a person steps to the smallest part of the soil, it is slightly more active than the weight of the fur. In some cases up and down does not apply anymore but our heroes still manage to get a base somewhere. <br /> <br /> "The looks of the world are not as breathless as this is true, in my mind, the quality of the world, the characters and the details Emotions are clearly read as Seen Connery or Dustin Hoffmann's face, although the characters' faces are relatively few features.The characters around the world are amazingly colorful and two sets The background is always moving and the world always makes it more alive.You can be surprised if you stop the movie and look in the background. <br /> <br /> Hector's presence actually puts the cherry on top. A furry little "thing" which is very funny (may be equal to a dog in our world) <br /> <br /> If this film is so great, why do not I give 10 stars? Well, the plot is rather narrower than the plot itself. Two hunters were sent to save the world from a really bad dragon who wants to swallow the world, not really original. It's not a problem too. I have missing background information. What kind of a dragon is and why it looks like that? <br /> <br /> I love the legendary stories but they seem to have written after completing a weak effort to give the entire film some depth. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I did not like is Joy. Though little girl like she is considered adorable, she has some pain in this film. She has proved to be pretty resistant to all the reality about reality, some from the story narratives dreamed of the heroes, mainly slowing others. She was ok if her image was slightly higher and slightly improved earlier - or had a girly low to start. <br /> <br /> I know this girl there to twist a little lag behind the writer. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for all age groups.
