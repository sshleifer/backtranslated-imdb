The horror film of a good 70s about the Hell Gate in NYC is the old brownstone here. It seems like there is lots of gates of hell around, but of course this happens without the knowledge that the model decides she needs some space from her boyfriend / fiance and so she has to choose a one, which disguises a nice and reasonable price apartment. She meets many strange neighbors, and also attends a birthday party for a cat. When she met with the relayer, she heard strange sounds from noon afternoon, and she realizes that she and an old priest are only tenants. Oops! Who is this Weirdus then? Her boyfriend begins to round off (a slimy lawyer played by Chris Sarandon) and finds they can not be seen by a long shot, not what they are. These are some good creepy scenes and she's "sometimes" thinking about an irregular older people who are more difficult than neighbors. A decent bit and a simple parody of the folks in the eventual end up with a parade made this a good watch, and the uncutable DVD version is much better, of course, though I saw this many times on TV. A bad little horror movie may be a good companion to "Burnt Offers". 10 to 8.
