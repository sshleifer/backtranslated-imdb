I enjoyed the film when it was released, and yet I would do it because the storyline is usually a hope for life, and people ... Laurence Cassadon is one of the things I like about films. In addition to positive vibes from the film, there are other reasons like the Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has an outstanding cast ... for example Kevin Klein and Danny Glover. In my opinion, the film is very similar to the crash, the most acclaimed film to win an Oscar for Best Picture. The difference Grand Canyon leaves you feeling positive. The crash has a negative effect on me; It's too dark. I will choose the Grand Canyon on a crash any day.
