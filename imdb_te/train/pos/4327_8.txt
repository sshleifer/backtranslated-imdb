I love this show - I read the Bleak House and I know it's very hard to perform the whole book, and some people like Little Doroth - have done a very good show with Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diana Rig and I can see the pain of Lady Deadlock, it's also the Lord's expected pride. I'm sorry, I think she is the best lady deadlock ... I do not know who I can make good judes, but I'm with Mr. Elliot. It is not easy to present these long Dickens books - Oliver Twist is easy - it's long, and if you do not care for all legal situations, it may be daunting or boring. I feel this performance is fun enough not to be boring. I liked Mr. Small Weed - it's fun. <br /> <br /> If you could read this book again, as I usually saw, after watching the movie, At this point - I think that's a good performance.
