"The movie is dead, the movie is long!" Last year's Romanian Film Festival, Antonumul, one of the most new and productive contemporary directors, Peter Greenaway, is available for the third edition and takes place at the Danube Delta. This year's prize was awarded to Zafar Panahi's "Offside". I came to see this evening at Bucharest in the revival of the festival. Still dead is still very fun. Panahi's picture tells us how comprehensive the Iranian community looks. As a digital film, a real-life event inspired story of "Offside" Panahi's daughter: Trouble and danger took place when deciding to attend a football match. In Iran, we are not getting information. There is no way that Panahi performs with some methods, but perhaps, many people have intellectual and intellectual models that have a wide variety of work, intelligence and humor cultural designs. The absurdity of the laws becomes ridiculous. The film is very happy with the Iran team going to the World Cup. The idea behind the film is a lot of sense. I'm very interested to see other pictures of Panahi, which is banned in Iran. I guess he can be considered as an activist.
