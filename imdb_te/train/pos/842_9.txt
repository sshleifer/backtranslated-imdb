Matador is a rainbow, dark humorous and breathtaking play, two very appealing and serious performances from Pierce Brosnan who has never never been better than here, and has never played his best role here from where he plays Jack Nicholson's gay geeier in Good As It's Gets as Credible Greg Kinnear . A big plus goes to the writing as well. Clever and occasionally distributed with pleasure through a very nasty dialogue Brasnan and this slowly building friendship between the two different individuals is completely convincingly all the way. The story takes some unexpected turns and the director continues to guess when searching constantly. <br /> <br /> Nice from the music director is a sensitive tone for artistic touch, good editing and somewhat extraordinary cinematography and you do not know how to label this movie for a long time. But it keeps the viewer on the edge of my seat (anyway), thanks to a well written script.
