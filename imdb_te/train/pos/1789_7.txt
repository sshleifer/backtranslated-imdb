During her death, On Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) repeats the name "Harris" and she is an anticipated singer at age 50 and her wealthy friend Leah Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer) on Grant (Claire Danes) from New York is alcoholic and negligent of Lisa Brother Buddi (Huw Dancy) welcomed the Vittinbaran cottage at the beach and his sister was friendly And the servant Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), who graduated in battle and medicine. Later, Yan agrees with his true feelings about the bride-to-hah Harris. However, when she encounters Ann Harris, she has a love for him and having a little overnight, a tragedy happens with a buddy. <br /> <br /> An uncredited and unstable Nina Mars (Tony Critte) and a happy wife and mother Constance Hawford (Natasha Richardson) are one of the best female voices I've seen in a movie with their amazing moments, fearing their mother. Amazing Mamie Gammer's comparison with her mother, Meril Streep, is amazing and she respects her mother's name. Places, textiles, set decor, cinematography and soundtrack are also awesome. Unfortunately the plot is confused and I do not understand this picture clearly. Why is motherhood so important in the story? Who has participated in Ann Constance Ann and Harris's night stand and he will be her father? In their occasional encounter in New York, Guy really really loves her, why is Anne and Harris not together? What problems did Anna solve after the Leila Ross tour? Did Buddy Wittenborn love his brotherhood with bisexual or Harris? Why did Nina Mars change her ideas about motherhood eventually? It seems that the screenplay writers or director fail because it does not make sense for a delicate love story and fails to fulfill it. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Aio Entordecor" (in "The Excluded")
