I wanted to see this film for a long time, and I should say I was disappointed. Dominic Monaghan's performance is just amazing. As a part of insomnia me, I relate to how I develop the story. I did not have any sort of experience but some awake the moment of sleeping and it is scary. It is a great image worth every penny. I hope one day I can work with Tes, it is an honor and beyond. I would recommend to everyone. Perhaps not small children, they can be afraid. But if you have insomnia like me, you will understand the world, mysteries and fear. You like it. <br />
