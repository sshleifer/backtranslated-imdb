For the first time, it is difficult to see that the film is very hard to watch. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Cain in the role of Bob is terrific. Lexa Dog's character was confusing to understand, initially, she attempted to capture Bob, but she felt her love even though she broke her heart. Dean Cain's performance is a wonderful spectacle. He is well in every film he does. My only question at the end of the movie is what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It has been excluded to determine the viewer
