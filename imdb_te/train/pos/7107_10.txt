<br /> <br /> This story takes you through the life of a person looking to get back the person who lost your life. <br /> <br /> I am really surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. Although this is not usually a concern for me, the characters quickly became a nicer one, and I wanted to know what they were and what they were going to do. <br /> <br /> Like many French films in English, we will be able to learn more about the character and affect their person's surroundings. This movie is driven by the character and does not disappoint!
