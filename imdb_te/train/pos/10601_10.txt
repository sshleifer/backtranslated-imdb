A section of London to declare independently from the UK and its laws, taxes & postwar restrictions in this case shows what's happening in this very funny British comedy. <br /> <br /> The explosion of a bomb bomb that leads to the discovery of ancient documents, shows that the Duchy of Burgundy had captured Pimlico centuries ago. But for new Burgundians, they do not expect any interference from Whitehall, unlikely to live in a way they like. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway is suddenly a small city politician, the smallest in the world. Dame Margaret Rutherford was delighted to be a professor of history with Pimliko. The stand-out cast included Hermione Badlyley, Paul Duplis, Nathan Wayne, Basil Radford & Sir Michael Harder. <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
