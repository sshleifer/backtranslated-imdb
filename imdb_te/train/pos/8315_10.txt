It increases the story of some high points to the standard level. Number One, Lonetti McKee as an actor, a wonderful star. It is beyond me that she has never been so big. Unfortunately, she is a supporting role and we are forced to focus on Irena Carter's bland character, the spark, and its growth fame is easy, boring, and unbelievable. However, when the girl is going to the stage, the film comes back to life. Karis Mayfield's original music should be appreciated. The very old VHS tape I had seen was copy. The picture quality is pretty low, and I'm guessing the product values. All in all, its a Gangar value.
