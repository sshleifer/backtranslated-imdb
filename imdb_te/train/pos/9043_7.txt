I accidentally dropped the movie on TV one day. It was aired on the day of the popular channel that was well-known to broadcast good movies. <br /> <br /> October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickcom, a boy who is inspired by Sputnik experimentation to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends begin to build rockets. His father would not be happy about his newly found hobby and saw him see himself as a coal mines or going to college in a football-scholarship, such as his brother. <br /> <br /> This story is well written. There may be a bit too speculative, but there is not much focus on those parts of the story. This is an important part, but it's obvious to the internal operation, focusing on the action between the characters. The story is good. It has some clicks, but it's okay. This is based on the actual event and you can not remove this type of style. The characters are really good. Characters in the depths of the story lose the role and are managed to maintain the quality and quality of the film. You will discover these characters and you will be sympathetic to them. They are well written and believable. <br /> This is a good movie. The sets and 50's style are thorough and the images are well composed and well lit. The mood of this movie is great. <br /> Acting is very good. Jake Gyllenhaal is a great performer with a good role as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper as John Hickam. The rest of the cast is very good. <br /> <br /> This makes for a pretty strong cast of everything. This was the first time I learned that it was based on real events. When I see it, it's probably more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting picture. I believe everyone can enjoy it. It's a good feeling. Not so bad!
