From the writer "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane" and "Hush, Sweet Charlotte," this tail-end of the sixties horror cycle is some strange and campy fun. Michael McIlroyoire makes a Victor Bunoowo-bit bit, but most often the film tethers are at risk of a bad music ... there is a terrible child recital about half. Debbie taps, tanggos and lax harlot up tricks, Winters' religious superstition has a lesbian edge. Agnes Moorhead is checked as an evangelist. We do not know what - and Gigolo to dance with Debbie.
