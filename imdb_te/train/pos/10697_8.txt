<br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin are both very good performances. <br /> <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman is going to do a good job in mimicking a Russian voice. Ben Chaplin is also shy, subtle clerk. Men (and some women): Miss Kidman looks great and is very sympathetic. I forgot a beautiful woman. It is not hard to imagine that John would fall in love with him. Some unexpected turns in the story are good for suspense. Although I had hoped for a happy ending, I was very surprised at the last part of the film. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: good image. <br /> <br /> Les Pace-stay: huit points.
