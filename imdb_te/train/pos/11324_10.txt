<br /> <br /> When I saw a few moments ago, when I heard some music from this anime, I felt the animation, the characters and when I saw it, and it made me cry (such a happy and sad feeling). <br /> <br /> "I love you, I have to do some research after the end (see a few more times) and I will answer my questions And I have found so much more in total.I love how this is shaped by historical epicures that fit into anime, it's amazing and just made me do a lot of research. (I always like this anime The relationship is very interesting in some historical figures) I think I'd be a long series but if it worked all of it would be better pulled. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic story, well-made characters (some mysterious) and fantasy action We recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with a bit. <br /> <br /> It does not have anything to do with it And I really like it (I am not in a state of uncertainty, in most cases I like it)
