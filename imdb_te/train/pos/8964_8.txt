The same year some happy coincidence was made by Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak Alfred Hitchcock's haunted masterpiece "Vertigo", which made this comedy. Perhaps Hitchcock's film had two actors in fear. However, this is a great companion for "Vertigo", which is looking for a very unpopular but powerful romance. Actually the film can be seen as a flip side of "Vertigo", which is a happy ending. Here again Novak becomes a transformation, in Vertigo she plays two women in particular and here she transforms 'massage' from the witch. Stewart was never a vacuum, and he had suffered for some time with his love. Unlike Vertigo, both "Bell Book and Candle", a perfect antidote to the hitcock film. Again observed the fate of love and attraction but in completely different vein. The cast is amazing. Classic's performance as an unpleasant delightful souvenir like Novak's single brother and Elsa Lancaster. Ernie Kovacs is the alcoholic cult writer and of course the Hermione Ginkgold as Novak's competitor. The scene with Stewart drinking the potion is the best comedy. Anyone who has seen the Vertiko, even if you have not seen this memorable light comedy.
