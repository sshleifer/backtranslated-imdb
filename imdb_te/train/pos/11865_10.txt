I heard a few friends one day "Scarface sucks ... some idiot tried to set another godfather in the early 80s." Now, I usually hear idiots / CNN so I decided to stay away from it. Then my colleague gave me a DVD and said, "It's # 1 with Pelican", I'm confused. This is the best film. It's more realistic than this trash about stolen cars racing that is too expensive for anyone in that area (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) but there's some humor ... ie pelicans and light 80s music. And what's better than Al Pacino? M203? Vice City: Give this ***** of the right, **** for al or GTA fans.
