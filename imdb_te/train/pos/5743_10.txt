I loved this movie! I can not break my tears while looking at it, but it's very exciting. I dismissed Ray Leota's performance, but Tom Hales's talent was played by Ray's twin brother, psychologically slow and mentally slow due to the mentally slow and terrible childhood incident. But Tom's character, even though heartbeat, does not know self-pity and is full of hope and life. This great movie, do not miss it !!
