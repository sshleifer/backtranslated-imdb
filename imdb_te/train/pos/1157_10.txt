This is the best comedy! Soap This simulation script is good and you can see why cast, well cast names and that's great. If you're a Kevin Klein fan, he (as always) performs a fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr is perfect. If you do not laugh at this film, you do not have any funny feelings.
