I read TomReynolds2004's comments and I feel jumping up here. I understand he does not like the film, but his reasons are not clear. My feeling about this film is not afraid to travel the dark roads of loneliness, failure, despair and sorrow. There are plenty of reasons for each of these two people to be tortured, angry and angry, and find sensitivity and comfort in each other. Only great acting can do this without an emotional crackdown, sentiment and sappy. I have really been interested in these people because of their great humanity with such strong performances. She has a reason to dislik Jane Fonda for the Vietnam era action, but in personal feelings, she is amazing in this role. Robert Dinero's intellect and goodness began to fail in a world that differed from its ability. This is the first I've seen using DeNiro a tactic rather than tough to sell and I really like it. This is a big surprise when I first look at it and I look forward to seeing again.
