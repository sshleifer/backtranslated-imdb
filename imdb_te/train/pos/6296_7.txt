Parker (Jonathan Schck) is an amateur writer looking for his big break. At this time, he serves as a telephone consultant to Manhattan's mental hotline. One day, most unfortunately, his apartment building burns. Parker and his cat are made alive, but now they are tough to find affordable homes in Big Apple. Word tells a girl that Samarda (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate, but the gay man only accepts. Parker is straight but the price is right, he pretends to be gay. Samantha liked him from the very beginning and welcomed him as his new colleague. But, poor parker. Sam is lovely, ingenious and vital. How can his true nature be in control? In addition, Sam does not have a successful businessman-boyfriend anyway? It is sweet, fond and comic with two glamorous stars in Eastwood and Schachch. Obviously, this plot is a string of how she might misuse this parlor for a shampoo for a shampoo. Furthermore, Parker is in need of his own "fake" homosexual companion, Boris, to emphasize that he is fixing him with the man he knows. Hopefully, homosexuals can not find these very dangerous situations because this viewer felt that many problems were sensitive and sensitive. For small image, wear, sets and camera work is great too, too. So if you love those funny stories of love, get it soon. You love what you see, I know.
