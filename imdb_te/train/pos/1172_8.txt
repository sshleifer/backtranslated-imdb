Yet another run of South Park ended. It's not as strong as episode as I expected, but Night of the Living Homeless is a strong Stanlis Cup, Trist, Bloody Mary, or Ernie's Day. It can still not hold the candle to Woodland Critter Christmas and Gobbox, but some episodes can be done. <br /> <br /> Living Night of Living is a satire of zombie genre, off. <br /> While this time on the roof, they are locked up in Randy and other residents community center, scene survey. <br /> Meanwhile, four guys have gone to solve this problem. The entire story in the possession of the homeless tries to deliver a message, but it is deeply enthusiastic. This is a lot of times when South Park is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Matt and Trey have played safe this week, and the issue of homelessness is not really critical, it's just disappointing. <br /> <br /> The shock moment of the episode, a scientist to avoid homelessness. Suicide in South Park is the first thing wrong and the poor man attempts to shoot several times when he dies, losing his brain. Another inspired South Park moment. <br /> <br /> The whole, episode is funny, but has been kept great by retaining any real commentary with the zombie powers of the homeless and honest. <br /> Now we have to wait for the next batch of episodes until October. It is very long, but should be praised by South Park for the run run. This performance seemed to be running out of steam last season, but now it's in full form.
