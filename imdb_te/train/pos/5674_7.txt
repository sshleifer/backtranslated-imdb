At this time, Blackdard is no longer royal (or close to such a thing) ... Instead, the role of Hugh Lorry (but replaced Tim McInterny, ... When he is a man and perfect moron, we can not help him but can not replace him, which is his husband Not true) Daft (he apparently, according to the trivia page), did not speak out loudly and completely frightening. Eurmund is now able to do what he likes and does. Why is he frustrated and angry (honestly, which is at times discouraging)? Yes, his owner is a buffoon, they are always there. He does not seem to have money, or he has no accident. In the second line, the Queen is unfortunate and kid, and someone cuts on the head - marrying them - in a finesse. There is no need to be controversial and interesting. There is still commentary and a slight irony. Very often, it seems like if they felt history was funny enough on its own, so they just do not bother to turn the facts into jokes or gags, it returns. And I'm literally more than a minute, and I can not tell you how many times I've found them before. It's generally not positive when you know the punchline before delivery. Baldick has not changed since last season ... he still has a remorse and stupid, "crazy" comedy. Frankly, the entire roof passes through. Do not get me started on the macro-out issue. Though satirical and verbal intelligence is still great, it is less than that. I'm funny and clear about half the half of the half, and the other three are not really taken into me. I was disappointed in the plot and developments were able to imagine some of the ... I can see many of the mile away from such an upcoming mile. Some materials are very funny and very hard to try to wind up coming across. This will continue with the "II" tradition of starting plans to work occasionally. The theme is the least creative of the bunch's worst, credits ranges. All in all, this, so far, is my least favorite of my four. I would recommend franchise fans and generally British comedy. 7/10
