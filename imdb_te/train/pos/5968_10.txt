When you come across the gem of this film, why the great decade of '80s to live through. Rock music has ruled, as well as movies ... especially horror films. The filmmakers know how to get used to it, and the "trick or treat" is obvious. Rocker Sammy Carr, W.A.S.P later wrote many. The singer Blackie Kounles dies in a hotel fire, his # 1 fan Eddie tragedy. He goes to support friend and local DJ Nook (Jean Simmons). Nook gave a fake of the final recording of Summit; This is the only copy available. It was given to a radio station playing a live Halloween night. When Eddie plays it, it will bring back some of the Sammy. He helps Eddie with bullies at school, but then goes to control. This is definitely a great image. The bad thing is that this film is not printing. I paid $ 25.00 and finally got eBay. You have to be too much ... $ $ well spent!
