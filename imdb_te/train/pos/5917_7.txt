Street Fight (Aka Consckin) is a special film directed by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. This is the movie's disability, and is very valuable. The live action that animated with animation, influenced by Disney's traditional Song of the South, is a response to the film. Philip Michael Thomas became subsequent to Don Johnson's sidekick and Skunkman Crotter on the Miami Vice, where he became known for his role in Kubrick's The Shining, escape from prison. Charles Gordon and Barry White (Yes, Barry White) Thomas is friends and a plan to help him get out of jail. They get trapped in Police Roadblock and tell Thomas a story about a black rabbit, a bear and a fox story to find a more peaceful presence from the south of Harlem. The story is animated, and offers a lot of fairy things to see. Like all of Bakshi's films, most people are irritating and irritating. True animation girlfriend will forgive its clunkiness and fall in love with its inventiveness. The film is very violent, very sexy, and it is more about wars between races. For a long time, I wanted to see something very important, but after a while, when I finished watching it, it looks like a run-of-the-mill block bloating flick along the super-line's path. It's very sloppy and really does not say anything. Besides, Bakshi is not white? Whatever the answer to that, the Konkinkin / Street Fight is still very popular for animated fans, as well as for watching Cinema Movie Fans. 7/10.
