I saw the film recovering from major surgery. I know, it's a "B" movie, a western place, and I liked it. It is not a play of high dollar productions, it does not have my imagination and great escape. Sadly our society is very accessible, reduction is very easy with little efforts. In the same way I can also enjoy a grade school performance of Shakespeare, I can appreciate having achieved many levels for art. I was a policeman and found a connection with a retired LAPD. Besides protecting my life, I can not save another's life (or my own) during the crisis. I'll have a very happy romance with a romantic ending when it comes to Fernworth's bad guy (speculation). My world is really cynical.
