A bit bit of British movie! It's about time. <br /> <br /> The road movie will prove to anyone who is free to take their freedom from their youth. <br /> <br /> It is "I and I" and "Easy Rider". The film runs at a very fast pace and does not let you move away for a long time ... Sometimes there are reflective movements, but they are well-justified and I think for the roles of actors. I was initially a little concerned with the role of Phil Daniels but fortunately won over half way through one of the funniest scenes of the entire movie! I found myself laughing through some killing film around me. <br /> I would totally recommend it. It becomes a cult British comedy. Well worth the visit.
