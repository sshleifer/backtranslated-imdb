Hitchcock demonstrated his already advanced understanding for visuals in this early silent film. The plot of the film with two boxers struggling against a girl is a very forward-drama without being recommended. Hitchcock's talent, however, was discovered in his amazing use of images. Nearly every shot is filled with visual icons. Especially the boxer remembers the boxer who specializes in a boxer before she gets married to her other boxer. He clearly shears her arm in a sexual way and shows all the things we need to know with a simple movement. Boxing scenes are well maintained with some interesting point-off scenes to prove how long Hitchcock is before. The film also gives insight into the treatment of his next women. The boxer's desire is not a reason or love, due to money or luxury. Other women in the film are just beautiful party girls, who have sex or older sons open public offers to help them destroy happiness. In all, the ring is essential for those who are interested in Hitchcock's initial work and for his development as a visual storyteller.
