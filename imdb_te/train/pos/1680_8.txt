This thriller is good and stylish to finally understand, but instead of all gigless fans, it's good to get interested in the genre than the Argentine entries. <br /> <br /> These thrillers for the crazed Italian fans, they will appreciate George Hilton and will take his character and change what he's put through. The camera work is graphic torture and odd dashes fresh, but not the appropriate options and the better the overblown music score. <br /> <br /> To keep this from Gilsa, directed by a great Sergio Martino, put it on the extra sexual or psychological, or two element in the story. <br /> <br /> The latest DVD (2005) release is a beautiful and perfect way to release. To see the film, this is the exception of the art house exhibitions which never disappear in the art.
