The comments are quite positive but I do not think viewers should focus on sets. The set designer used a lot of beautiful Art Deco treatments along beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so forth. It is worth paying attention. The film is driven by a very richer character and vengeance. All gangster stars cast - it's like seeing old friends and it's a treat. The dialogue was fun at times, but it was at times steady and I wanted to be that way. This movie is a movie buff. It is made for people who like medium. Do not miss this one.
