Remember that I'm a fan of the genre but recently recently seen this movie. It's a surprise to me how I missed this time. This is a very good movie for me after "High Noon". It is a great Western with great performances and great story. The DVD is pretty black and white with the best cinematography. If you like Western or James Stewart, this movie should not be missed.
