Great entertainment from beginning to end. Excellent shows by Balushi, Beach, Dalton & Rails. Some turns and many action sequences. This image is made for me! Good lines on the screenplay, good music. Dalton played the hardest sheriff and "red neck-villain" as Railsback. I recommend this movie every action-adventure fan! 10/10
