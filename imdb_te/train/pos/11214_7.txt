This is the first "Walking Tall" film I have ever seen, I think in the Hollywood Blvd $ 2 movie theater. , I did not give any suggestion for the first installment of Joe Don Baker. I was amazed at the brutality of McNeary County's corrupt system and the "Red Neck Gangs". I was surprised that a man decided that he would not be fulfilled and that he went out to do something about it. Courageous? <br /> <br /> I would like to make this film a great story about American courage and do something about a system that offers its own interests. I think it's one of the best film of the hero / anti-hero genre, which has pretty recently blown away about it, and this may still laugh but there are recent movies like "Punisher", but more so it's true because of the story. <br /> <br /> The recent remake of "Rock" does not justify the real fire in the story of Butford Pazzer. <br /> In the future again "
