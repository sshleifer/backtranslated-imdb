Another film on the beach, along with helpless air soyent green. These two films created the consequences of races and the catastrophes from the human planet. <br /> <br /> There may be some expectations because we did not reach the worlds described in the movies as of 2007 and we have to do it now. New York City, as described in Soyland Green, is still not a million million to Millions of millionaires. Environmentalists have shown the film as a result of the evolution of global warming. For me it also shows the right to life ethic run amac. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is NYPD Detective. He lived with colleague Edward G. Robinson in the room. Joel Kutten is an executive with Soyland Corporation, a multi-national concern, food products, and a variety of layers to feed the world's people. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston gets his man in the trial, but it will lead to some horror facts about the future of the sailent corporation and the future of mankind. Haystone shouts at the end, Soyland made green people, we became a cannibal species, the horror thing is no alternative. <br /> <br /> Although this was different from Edward G. Robinson's farewell appearance and Heston Robinson's moving political views. After a few weeks of his screen death Robinson's death, he was euthanasia, he died in real life. Not many, but Heston knows Robinson's funeral, among them not the final death scene between the two. <br /> <br /> Even though the timetable is off, Soylent Green does not pass the expected pass. Hopefully we will not only have intelligence, but the sense of responsibility to continue what's going on.
