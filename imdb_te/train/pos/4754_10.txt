One of my favorite twilight zone episodes. The next day we were in the supermarket at Hollywood Blvd. And La Bray, my dad and I, and guess who's coming towards us in the aisle! <br /> <br /> We asked about his third eye, as he said we were at home. <br /> <br /> On that day, everyone who met him asked about it. <br /> Friendly person. <br /> <br /> BTW, I was a teenager and took a long time to get "three hands" over other aliens. <br /> <br /> Hollywood local and residency from 1947 to 1963.
