I totally liked this soap. This is my favorite one. Are highly recommended :) ... I love Brazilian soaps, they deal with events in real life. I'm really sad that the soap is out but I'm sure it will be able to find it somewhere. For those of you who have not seen it, please see. I loved the letters, the plot and the end for how the villains ended. The only thing I changed was the end of love for Jicoka and her long life. I can not wait to see it again and I highly recommend it. Xica is by far the best soap I have ever seen. Forget all else :) XICA GO .. hope everything you like.
