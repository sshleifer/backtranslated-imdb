The film was nominated for Best Picture but lost to Casablanca but Paul Lucas defeated Humphrey Bogart for Best Actor. I can not see why Lucille Watson nominated him for the Best Supporting Actor, and I do not think she did a very good job. Betty Davis and Paul Lucas and their three children leave Mexico and come to the United States in the first scene. They are going by train to Davis's relatives' home. Davis and Lucas are underground to stop the Nazis, so they need very tired and resting. But when they come home, one of them has a Nazi nation, not about them. It's only about Nazi counts about money and is willing to sign up with Lucas. Their plot is high, but you will find it for yourself.
