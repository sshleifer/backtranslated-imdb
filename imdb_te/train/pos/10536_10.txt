Yeah ... I'm going with this 1-0 and why am here. Over the past few years, I have seen a lot of humor and some lightweight laughs and twin video rentals are left with late fees, because the films are easy to forget. Then I made mistakes on "Nothing". Interestingly, many people did not expect. I made a mistake. This is one of the funniest movies I have had a chance to see. Dave and Andrew is a great funny pair and is impressive enough to remember the humor, but the joke is not point critical. I do not want to say the original sequences, because I think it's a movie. The more meaningless feelings into movies (such as the "latest" rebuilding of killer military jets and "old" classics) make you happy to laugh in the movie "Nothing".
