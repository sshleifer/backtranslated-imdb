<br /> <br /> Anthony Mann is interesting to know how to use James Stewart here. Stewart was originally remembered by George Bailey from Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life", so finding the parallels between the two pictures is easy. In "It Is a Wonderful Life", Bailey could not see the world, if he had never been born. In "Far Far Country", Stewart's Jeff Webster does not help others (except himself), to see the same thing: the world that he (not all practical things) is. /> <br /> By getting involved (and without paying attention to anyone), Webster can not help him, but he does not care, care, and do nothing when he kills. This reminds the viewer of George Bailey who is looking up the world that turned upside down, because he did not even decide to participate without being born. <br /> <br /> The two images end with the same image - a ringing close to the hour. Stewart, by turning around his involvement in philosophy, seems to be, his "wings".
