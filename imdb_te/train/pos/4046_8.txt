Roger returns to his historical dramas in a realistic story of Grace Eliot, who lived in France during the supreme time of the French Revolution. Romer has always been suspected of being conservative, but he knows who is a red-blooded reaction. If you give Racher's negligent protection monarchy (and it's not easy, for example, French is portrayed as less bizarre stories here), it is truly an elegant, intelligent and polished movie. Eighteen-year-old France's big cinema without money for entertainment, instead of rohammer, the actors play with clearly painted cardboard. This is a blatant artificial feeling, but it works. And newly Lucie Russell should not be sympathetic.
