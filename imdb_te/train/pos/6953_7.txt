It is one of these films that make better trailers than full-length films. The concept is really cool and different, humor is unique, I thought I had lost the chances to put "punch" into this movie. Many lines and gags left hanging for a long time, with the exact end and really did not leave me laughing. Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman are the greatest. Wanda Sikes is less used in the film and more characters need a response and more opportunities are needed to make her character appear more screen-time. I have more than 10 to 7 DVD rental. Moreover, in these films, I have seen a feel-good music video in returning credits for La mary about Mary and my parents, a little cheat of the fact that slightly better music and Panchar Punch lines can be a better film. It seemed like a rushhead in theaters.
