I'm happy to be happy for a lovely movie, and enough to fit the camera moves and angles to adapt the drama. Although not the length of Gozo, although there are some of the greatest cinematography I've ever seen since MUSA in Korea. However, Gozo offers much more than just beautiful pictures (as MUSA does ... does not mean it) - this is a lovely story with the second great power, excellent performance, and very dark philosophy. Finally, I have to admit that I'm not sure about what's going on in the end, but it definitely will lead to some ideas. Vague, but sure thoughts: p> <br /> The film was good, this was action. The film has a tremendous amount of blood pieces, but this action is portrayed with hyperichetic scenes, and often obfuscated with the material in the foreground. It creates very intense and impressive visuals, but it's nice to see more realistic movements, the villains simply used to waste everything for everyone. <Br /> Furthermore, the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films. Recommended!
