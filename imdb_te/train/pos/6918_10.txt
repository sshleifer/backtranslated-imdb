A very enjoyable image featuring characters who can let bad things and anger and a desire for the vengeance bubble. The cast is very nice, there are so many actions, and Stewart will eventually get the girl and his revenge (with the twist). I have seen this movie many times, always see when it's AMC or cable. Highly recommended ...
