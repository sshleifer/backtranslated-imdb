I have read many negative reviews of this movie and eventually got a chance to watch on DVD. To be honest I do not really know what the problem is. <br /> <br /> It is a murderous mystery thriller, which is shown from a variety of perspectives, including the last romantic king John Holmes. Read the plot summary for the exact details of the cinema plot - I would like to contribute more to the review than the summary. <br /> <br /> Many critics have gone so far to give their lowest rating due to violence. I can not really see it. Most modern films are even worse - the private Ryan, who saves more than the film, has played a more violent role, which is more than genuine brutal slaals (the murders shot in the film, then the main pipes, then). I was caught in two parts of the film - the first holding John Holmes on the side of a seemingly cash-hungry drug addict and the second as a small conspirator in the supernatural vascular. Dylan McDemorant has excellent acting, even though his biker-esque personality and goatee'ed bad boy looks more than a bit in personality. The soundtrack is also excellent - the B-side rock and blurred pop of an incredible mix of 70s All the right places alo boogie extended over a couple of hours in the knights.
