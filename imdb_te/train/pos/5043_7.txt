Bill Paxton has a very good direction. A very dark thriller / who really recommends Stephen King. This is a strong, well-thought horror story about a devotion to Texas, Thurman, who was murdered after receiving orders from God to eliminate demons trying to control humanity. The plot twins and a strange end will make your money worth. <br /> <br /> Most of the violence you have not really seen, but it is enough to double your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays a distorted person called The Hand of God Killer. Matthew McConaughey was evenly impressed by the end of telling the story to Dulles FBI Agent (Powers Boothe) as Dallard Man's big son. Boutique, as always, is great and blameless. Suspicious white hooker! Highly recommended.
