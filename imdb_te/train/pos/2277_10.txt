The film is a long time and it's worth it. Gordon directs in a style that reminiscent of the Vonneguts writing styles. Relentless, diligent, ridiculous, aggressive, and dark, this is a movie that will last for you for a short time for answers to questions. Nolte, Goodman, and Arkin Annie are excellent. Sheryl Lee plays a wonderful role in the role of Laura / Mardini's days reminding Lynch fans. Do not miss this one!
