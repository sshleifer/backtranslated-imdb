It was selected on DVD and looked at it again. I love the bright colors versus the dark imagery. Not a big beat fan, but it's a fantastic popcorn movie. Pacino was disappointed, as always, the film Madonna was considered to be her complete sexist. I got upset with a "breathe" look. Charlie Corrsmo's first major character, "What About Bob?" The decorative effects are cutting edge and holding up to the most part. Beautiful scenery and mood you are transported directly into the comic strip environment. Not to mention the lighting of cars, wardrobe, buildings, and even streetlights and great tone, although many scenes in the red can get annoying a lot on the red, as it will wrap a little. Beatty wants to have a chance to make a sequel. All in all, a pleasant few hours.
