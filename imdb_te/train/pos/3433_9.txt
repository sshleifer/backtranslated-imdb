I saw the first time in a foreign film festival. This beautifully nail-binter on a plot of relief to the Estonian Treasury under gold or even more billions. It was portrayed in a sunny grunge style that Hollywood rarely uses - but the newly enslaved baltic state of the city was beautifully decorated (note: when I was there), I was very less terrified in 2003). <br /> <br /> There are so many humor and some romance. I'm confused and do not want to spoil logical surprises, so I'm starting with this heliographic great script and directed and the shows are top notch. While TALLIN is the fastest and most noddy-racking example of its style --- I want to put it against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and although (intentionally) though (deliberately) glossy, Miles is ahead of the new OCEAN'S 11.
