For those who are interested in the business and the corporate world, this presentation is just the best. One of the show's former contestants wrote in his blog about this innovative presentation: The business finally came to the audience. The whole idea is perfect; Contesting with one of the business associations with a team of businessmen, it is set up in the best places in the world, New York City. Donald Trump is the owner, although his ego is larger than infinite times is infinite. <br /> <br /> Season 1: The Great Season Total, "normal" is the best season for them. This season is very much about real business skills. The marketing related tasks were later produced in this series. Troy: The whole, great and interesting contenders with the most favored character in this series. <br /> <br /> Season 2: A great season as well. The tasks are still pretty much ok, and it has the most interesting competitors. Zen M is terrible and should never be finalized to IMO. <br/> Season 3: Terrible. Actually, I liked the concept of book smarts vs street smarts, but the cast was totally terrible (the whole trump cast also hated) the whole season's total disaster. <br /> <br /> Season 4: The second episode (Motel Reconstruction) is the best when Brian is dismissed in a fantastic season, due to its interesting and fun time. Contestants this season (especially Randall, Alla, Marcus and the total disaster whose name is Torrel). "Show Out the Board Room to Episode" episode One of the perfect classics of this show, which ends with a well-remembered fourth removal. Sadly, I was robbed of Randall vs. Allaah Final. <br /> Season 5: It's not really something special for the boring season. Brent is just an embarrassment and apparently not only to create drama. The tasks are all terrible (what business has Jingle created with anyone?). <br /> <br /> Season 6: I see why you wanted to try LA as a new site for the show, but what you see is a mistake. New York will always be this place. Most new things have been added this season, most of which are terrible (such as losing a sleeping team outside the Tent, the PM continues to be prime minister, for example). The tasks were terrible and Trump chose the wrong winner as well. <br /> Season 7: Celebrity edition. The best season. Totally different rules (like the use of rolodexes), but all the fun and fun. The big problem is that many of the competitors are not real celebrities, especially women except Otta, although it is totally disgraceful for everything she participates, as it appears to be Genie Simone Season, but after Kodak's foul he completely threw himself from the shadow of another man: Pierce Morgan. Nobody ever dominated one season. He has cracked his opponents and has some humorous feelings (although some Indians (all Americans, in fact, do not make me wrong) unfortunately did not have the social skills to understand it). <br /> <br /> For these fans, I would recommend a UK version featuring Sir Alan Sugar Owner. In fact, the British version of the way is good, and something from the American (and original) is really a great program. One thing about the UK version is that competitors generally behave as good human beings at the meeting, unlike the stereotyped and strict behavior that is taking place in the US version.
