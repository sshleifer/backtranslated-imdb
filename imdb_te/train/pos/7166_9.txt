In the novels, novel and education course, I have been forced into. I did not think I would like a child's novel; Plus, the other couple of books are really bad forcing me to read the book. But, to my surprise, I certainly liked the holes. This is truly one of the most complete written novels I have ever read. I think having teens, teenagers, and rare quality that will appeal to adults before. I think everybody who reads is better guided. I can not say much to this film and I'm glad to say they are very good. I do not think the viewers of the movie are going well, but they are absolutely entertaining without the stupid being when they sit. This is a brilliant story, and it is well said. I think a tad stir up very quickly. The novel characters take time to develop. And the last registers will come out quickly and quickly so that there is not much time to enter. Earlier romantic romance feels more cliche and unusual than in the novel. And the end, it seems all the loose threads together, too ridiculous. This is exactly the same in the novel, but the concept of impossibility is not in the movie too. It works very well. I do not like the group of pop songs too. Disney thinks that such a need to sell soundtracks. The cast is wonderful from the youth to the old pros. Jon Woyt is particularly great. We are not sure why we need catwoman and fancy. 9/10.
