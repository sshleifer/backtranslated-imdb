Foley's Nair quality in this saturated and intense pulp film is seemingly "perfectly" fit together. Shot through the shot, edit by the edit, the image also unfolds around a disturbed boxer who finds its own purpose (or lack thereof). Other comments suggest the lack of interest in the Pulp, but I personally think this is a piece of cinematic put together a magically!
