Warner Bros. is one of the most well-known films in their style of 40s. Photography is undoubtedly his greatest achievement by Sol Polo - beautiful compositions and lighting with a delicate shade. Max Steiner is one of his most complicated and beautiful scores - the essence of his traditional leit motif method. The music plot adds great emotion and excitement and is delicate and memorable. It is interesting to note that the same productive band that made the film the same year went "right now, Voyager" - a decent film that won the honors and awards for Betty Davis, fell into a historic fan. In my opinion, "Guy Sisters" is an enhanced image - better made in all sections, and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. It is the most extraordinary film to attract their own modern creative touch or their modern and demanding standards of hyper-critical completeness. Every thing has its own time forecast and it has to be judged for what it is trying to achieve its own terms. Many of the reviews I read in these reviews are very much a child and the point is totally absent. If you are hungry for the perfect file migrane, go to the bakery counter and do not start fishing and complaining about the starch. The art of film criticism is really lost in a large section of the population. Sorry folks - if this movie has a rolling stones and a hundred toughest and soul search subplots score, you'd all gleefully be happy. I'll take an old film without the advanced intellectual statements of the week!
