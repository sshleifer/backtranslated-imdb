Actually my vote 7.5. Anyway, the movie is nice and there are those funny parts that I deserve to see, do not misunderstand me, it's not a funniest movie in the world, and this is not the original, because it's an idea we've seen before in other movies, but this one has its own taste, my friend A friend told me that this film was ... I think exactly who cares but who cares? There's another movie that also shows us the same thing, Chris Rock it looks, where Down to Earth, men, one of its very funny movie, you see both of you and I know you are willing to rock it with his cinema. Ashton Kutcher's main character is given a male role, but the film is good.
