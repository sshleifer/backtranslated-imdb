This one minute film is undoubtedly the first film made. But the Lumiere brothers developed those devices that are magically advanced to the front - like Edison's motion picture of a sneeze - the other previously invented acts of other creators. At that time, their 'cinematograph' should confiscate their subordinates, including their subjects. In this first case, the brother recorded the employees who left their factory to understand some of them to hide their understanding of the career. Lumieres tries to make the film more entertaining by introducing animals and bicycles, but La Lagetie des Ussen Lumi√®re does not match the ingenuity of their later films. The most interesting feature of this documentary is the choice of a labor tradition known by the brother about their subject. Their choice is a quality that is the basic evidence for their curiosity about all the people of the world and their experiment is very appreciative and beautiful. <br /> <br />
