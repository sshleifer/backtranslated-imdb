Before Tuscan ski, I saw in Large Large of a film at Diane Lane's tender show. The camps are invited to their youth camp and enjoy the elders. Back that everyone seems to be looking for something they're losing, which makes it very realistic. Perhaps you really have to be a camper to get it, but that her characters are daring in the words of a character noticing that "it's camp!" Practicing jokes and friends, a horror meal lady and an hour early morning ... it's amp. The exciting activities now look worldly. An excellent ensemble cast will make one of the two-dimensional characters better and more reliable. Bill Paxston, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (when she first fell down!) Beautiful scenery, bright colors, funny music (including variations of hello muddy) and director Sam Raimi turn out to be a funny acting film to remove an old friend to see an old friend.
