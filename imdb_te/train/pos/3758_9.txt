This film is awesome. If you take too seriously, you hate it; However, the size of "Dudes" and "Right Ones" brings laughing and thick memories 15 years ago. I find it very difficult for me to see the obvious jokes and illnesses and its precursor, "Bill and Ted's Extinct Adventure" (1989). If you're looking for multifocal jokes, and a mature matrix movie, you do not see it; However, if you want a humorous and silly, yet intelligent and engaging film, you enjoy it. I really wish this sort of movie was shown in more of today's theaters. And hey, it's acting is the ridiculous kein reeves ... right than right ...
