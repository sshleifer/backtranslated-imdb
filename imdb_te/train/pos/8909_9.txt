It's very pretty and I'm not so deep. Two teens who have learned about Goo's Slim Allebblob coming to Earth through the basic story. This sludge ball burns through the meat like acid-like acid. It also increases the human body too. No one is teens (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and they finally believe it seems that Blob is not stopped. It's really well aged and the other 50's flicks are quite pretty pace pretty fast. This story is very unique and must be seen for a fan of old science fiction and monster movies. Check out the remake from '88 if you drink 80th horror's goose gore.
