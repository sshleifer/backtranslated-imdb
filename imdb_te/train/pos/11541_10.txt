Mathew and Lemann are the best of the film - the greatest of all in the film. The dialogue is fantastic and very, very witty - and the scene that Lemmon character tries to clear out his sinus in a restaurant I'm rolling over the laughter floor every time. Anyone who has seen such a great sequel should not be away from the original. I would recommend this amazing picture to everyone - I love it. Jack Lemmon is going straight forward with straightening his role, in my opinion is ridiculous. These two great guys made a string of movies together, but this one is the best - no doubt.
