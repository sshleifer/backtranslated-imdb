At Amazon 6 or 7 years ago I first reviewed the picture and destroyed it. I call it "wretched" and "turkey". Well, well, many standards, it's still a turkey. It has no product values, no smaller plot makes little sense, and acting is on the third-level play level. It's really kind of camping classic that has really increased me in years. In fact, all of the images of the director tad sheets have this effect. <br /> <br /> They are almost like Ed Wood in that case: Look over and pick flourbed lines, continuity errors (same zombie, two different positions!), and other flaws Sheets are a good person, and this, one of his first productions, is not great, he has gotten better. I am a really good actor / actress in this movie, Casi Rauch, when I went to school with her, I showed bias.
