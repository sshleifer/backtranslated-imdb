This picture is beautiful. It is full of memorable movie, good acting and touching stuff. It's very easy to write as much sentiment, but there is the feeling of trying to achieve this kind of film. I'm totally involved in the unfolding and presentation of the story. There are some cheesy shots, but this is anticipated in a religious campaign. The only complaint I have is not a ton of complaint. Nevertheless, the film was not created to describe every aspect of Joseph Smith's life, ministry, achievements, disputes, failures. It is designed to be the quickest compilation of some of the most outstanding American and historical religious figures.
