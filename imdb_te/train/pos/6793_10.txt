I'll kill this game. Since I was 9 years old (I'm now 15). Do not forget the great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, extra, and ultimately awesome dragon forms! I'm still waiting for a remake, prequel or sequel to this wonderful video game. <br /> <br /> You play Dart, a young knife who is very young hero. On this adventure you will encounter amazing creatures and boss fights. You will also face some friends who have their own unique element. Fire, Darkness, Water / Eyes, Thunder / Lightning, Earth, Light, and Wind. There are also elements known as Dragon Souls, which allow you to transform magical creatures of myth. Dragons, wizards, creatures known as winglies and evil creatures you will face this adventure of action-packed thrills and enthusiasm. My all-time favorite games, The Legend of the Dragon!
