This is one to see a few times. Wonderful writing has come to know someone because they lived this story or they woke up. Freebird My Mysent youth made me relive and laugh. This title is a great choice. Great movie, story, story, soundtrack and characters. This is a biker flick but the pigeon hole is the same. Funny to the bone like Trailer Park Boys in U.K, if you have never seen the TPB, do this one if you want a picture. You say thank you. I would like to see these characters in other films too. Sequel? Can. The whole world I want to see through their eyes is very high.
