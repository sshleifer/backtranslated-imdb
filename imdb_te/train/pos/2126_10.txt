<br /> <br /> Ernest Lubitz made another silence to his credit with this lovely image. He has created a truly memorable movie from glorious conversations (courtesy of his long-time co-worker Samson Raffleson) and outstanding performances from the cast of talented performers. <br /> <br /> The belief that playing his audience's intelligence and belief in the gleeful sympathy on the slapstick has always painted a thin film restast with an elusive, troublesome quality, called director Lubitch Touch. This story is set in Budapest (which has no confusion of players in the players), and this is no consequence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart & Margaret Sullivan is a love-loving clerk, and will be very happy with each other. Other - without knowing it. Their conversation - so profoundly seemed to appear naturally - was totally frustrated when their demons were demanding their chaos and silence. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan of the Church has a more intense role than usual, when his temporary significance in his small world is a puke when he sees himself. A close scene is Steer, who allows him to avoid emotion. Moreover, Morgan is delighted with some of his most joyful moments - at the end - a new employee in his shop, the worst youth, and a memorable Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> <br /> Joseph Schilde Crt adds another vivid image to the list of on-screen images, at this point he is eligible for the complete punitive punishment of Sinfafictic Lothorio. Jetti Felix Brissart played a good role with his family, who did not participate in the store conspiracy, and was a steady friend to Stewart. <br /> <br /> Sarah Hadan plays a small role in the sales clerk. <br /> <br /> In small roles, Charles Holton plays a nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous. William Tracy Doctor. Miss Sullivan grandmother & mother in single scenes - Mary Carr and Mabel Colcard - Movie Mavens are not recognized.
