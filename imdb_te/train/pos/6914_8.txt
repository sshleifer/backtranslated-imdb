It is believed that Richard Dreyfus's greatest performances in this film is an actor who plays a dictatorial role and does not recognize his mother cheat. Also, this film is funny, yet there is a serious side as well. The film is particularly intriguing about the character Madonna, the mistress of the dictator, but ultimately the nation's leader. Madonna's evolution from Mistress added to the politician the quality of the story and the value of film entertainment. And the main character who is a struggling actor and somewhat a buffoon at the beginning of the film, through the end of respect for much of the evolution and image orders. I liked this movie.
