I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see it again soon. The cast is amazing, plot pathetic and entertaining, and it's just an overall enjoyable movie! This is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen! It's especially beautiful in girls, especially Denis Richards. She has a lot of charm across the film and her character has some ops!
