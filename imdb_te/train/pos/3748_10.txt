I've seen so many times and I'll buy the full feature. I love the comedy of Jason Steel. It is very different and unique and very enjoyable. I love the indie movies and this one is great. The plot is strange but very funny. This documentary is about spoken dialect Edward. The events are a bit upset in order, making this movie very interesting to watch. Initially you see Edward fighting with the Spoons, but in advance of his life. It's a silly movie, but of course, it's still great. I will watch this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. That's great fun. Humor is not enough for everybody's taste but can be seen anyway. It only takes about 16 minutes of your time and it's free. Watch the spatula madness!
