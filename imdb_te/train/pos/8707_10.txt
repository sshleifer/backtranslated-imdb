"McConnets" is one of the most beautiful romantic films I have ever seen. The name of the film is translated as "knife-bearer" in English. The main hero (Sasha) is born with an extraordinary ability: he protects himself with a very sharp knife falling into the skin in his hand. On the first hand he may seem another silly superhero from the innocent movie about the dubious events and feelings. But it's not about maconates. He is rarely called anti-hero. I feel that there is only one who has lost faith in his life, good faith, justice and love. He understood in his life and did not meet the man who loved him (except his mother). Every step is tied to his blood; He will take revenge on everyone for his gift, which is his loss. And suddenly she meets. She does not need inefficient negotiations and explanations. She loves him for what he does. She did not care what she did. He is more important than anything else beside her. But soon finds his secret: He kills two men (her former boyfriend and his bodyguard) to save her before her eyes. Then she could not avoid her feelings. They try to run but have heart to hide. Ultimately they were in serious car crash. He was caged; She is in a mental hospital. They do not know about each other, but she believes that she should save herself. He overcomes many obstacles but finally finds her. They walked again but they were not invulnerable. She is injured, she needs a rest, but the police do not catch them. They do not know what to do, they reach a corner, and then his sword begins to cut the trees around them, the helicopter begins to cut, but she needs to die already on her hands, because it does not need him again the whole world.
