When you look at Gabriel Byrne, I'll see this film as Tom's in common suspicions like Millers Crossing or Keaton. Even if you're not a fan of Gabriel Byrne, all the actors in this movie really give great performances. If you told me about eleven bucks (which is close to nine quids) I would order online or rent your favorite rental space. You are usually guaranteed to make you laugh whether you like gangster type movies. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy, you are one of the most unforgettable movies ever, and find yourself looking over and over. You talk about it, your friends will be bugged to borrow it.
