This is one of Samo's great early comedy films. This was not a parody of the dragon, but the main character (Sammo) was engaged to Bruce Lee and specifically molded him to his size. The story of the nominal story about his loved ones in his struggle - then fighting. Oh, fight. <br /> <br /> The film's funnier bit is completely coincidental, with high-impact good, fastest scenes (a white person who plays boxer really suffers by Samo's kicks). A Jim Kelly looking guy (one of three experts to bring Sammohan), but he is a Chinese person in blackface with an apro wig. Which of the real blacks did they have in Hong Kong in 1978? <br /> <br /> In older American films, I have seen a very white duplicate-hell "Chinese". <br /> <br /> This is only Sammy or Bruce Lee fans.
