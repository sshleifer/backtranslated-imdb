I waited for this film to come out of Canada for a while, and I finally enjoyed seeing it. I really enjoyed it. In fact, in the beginning, it's a very sad movie (and the New Year's Day - it's hard work) - however, it sticks to you. The next day I was thinking about it again, even though it turned out to be somewhat emotionally dry, it's a few days later that you find that beautiful story. Many people can see a person, but sometimes you can blind a lot of things. And how does Diane Keaton's character type save just the rest of them by being there? And they also saved her in the process as well. This is a fantastic movie, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) provides a perfect comic relief. It is definitely an image that needs tissue box, but really will stay with you for a long time.
