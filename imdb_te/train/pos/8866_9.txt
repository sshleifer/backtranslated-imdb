"COSBY," in my opinion, a must see CBS hit! I'm not sure every episode has ever been seen, but I still enjoy it. It's hard to tell which one is my favorite one. Also, I really loved the theme song. If you ask me, it's good if Madeline Kahn dies in the run of the show, even if everyone wants it. Since that time, I've always wondered what I'd been doing. While everyone has always given a good performance, the product design is excellent, the clothes have been well designed, and the writing is always very strong. At the end, even though it can now be seen on TBS, I recommend you to hold it firmly in case it's going to turn off for good air
