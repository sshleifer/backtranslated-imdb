When I appeared I saw a lady with a red hair, and it was not worth it. The truth is, in its true story of the protagonist, its screenplay is silly and unreliable. Cast the original merit of the image. Some of the best assistant players of the 30s and 40s have always been underestimated for the delicate and brilliant work of Miriam Hopkins, and generally, Claude Rains's magnificent, spectacular appearance, toy. No actor! He did not win the Oscar, but he was in a good company with Chaplin, Garo and Hitchcock. Maybe lady with red hair will have his best work in movies. <br /> Look at it and enjoy him. <br /> <br />
