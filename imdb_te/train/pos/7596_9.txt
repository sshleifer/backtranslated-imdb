The first episode immediately gave a good impression from the series! The mysteries are solved and a lot of good play! I will publicly reveal stories in the order of letters! Just enough to explain the excitement! Of course there are some errors in this presentation! In the first two series, for some reason do not appear in the third season! Many characters have sent good but some of them are not! Like Rose and her husband! Where are they hell? What happened to them Maybe they can come back to the next episodes! But it's a bit different! "Lost" is said to be thrilling every episode (especially the first two seasons)! That's a difficult task! Note that I am developing the attention of the show's mystery aspects in the third season! This is not a bad thing! It will save some parts to get boring! The strength of this presentation is one of the best things to consider! Do you love these characters? Good moody! But in the end I'll have to solve some mysteries and close it! The "last" risk of being canceled due to declining ratings is near! And it is devastating!
