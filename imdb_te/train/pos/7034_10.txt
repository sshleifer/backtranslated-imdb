When you add all the items from the cinema --- dance, singing, acting --- Best of the cast Vanessa Williams ... She is the perfect character for her to dedicate her dedication, energy and timeless beauty Rossi. I've never seen anyone play a role with such a splendor! Vanessa's singing talent looks beautiful with all the songs she plays and her performing skills surprised me! Her dance is amazing when she says that some choreography is bad --- her dance skills are always better than ever! Although Vanessa's performance is very sensitive, I can not recognize Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast, because I would recommend this version 63 in Philips' exclusion ... what do they think of when they're acting like her? <br /> All this Recommend to see this version Anu!
