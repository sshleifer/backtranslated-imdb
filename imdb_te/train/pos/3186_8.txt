This film is very enjoyable. The plot can be flexible and easy to digest, and the story of humor light and pure and errors is very common because I look forward to seeing how the film meets the film. Very nice. Women's predominance is good; Her character is so lovely as an innocent, innocent girl trying to create some white lies to David's sophisticated character. I also did Vera Dancing very, very well. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy the film completely for those who have all the movies that have previously been filled with pornography.
