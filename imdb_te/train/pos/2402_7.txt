The main reason for watching this film is Warrix William, who is in the top form as a head coach. He finds ways to defeat the rival party in the midst of electricity, constantly cheating people and the biggest disasters. William is a great actor - he thinks he never got his due. Betty Davis also shines in an under-written role as his girlfriend. Personally, I found Guy Kebbi quite right as a lame-brain candidate who is trying to foist over others and others. He looked like a blank canvas than a person. I'd rather be a real character than a non-character. The story is unclear, crazy and cliched. But Warren William and Betty Davis are well worth looking.
