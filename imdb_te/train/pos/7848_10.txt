This is one of the best animated films I have ever seen in my life. It's not just an entertaining movie, or a well-designed movie. This is a milestone in the animation art and if not, the technical expertise that makes it is the place in the history of animation. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz a Beatles is a stop motion picture about the secret life. <br /> <br /> In this film he tells fun and takes revenge. He also imagines small things like job, houses, nightclubs, cinema houses, posters, bicycles and paintings. Mr. Beatle has a relationship with Dancing Dragonfly, much of the overdose of the grasshopper; But he decides to shoot a cameraman and fling. Mr. Beetle returns home and finds Ms. Beetle with his wife. Mr. Beetle chases the boyfriend but forgives his wife. Both make up and go out of the movies. And the picture they see is Mr. Beetle and Dragonfly. In this way it describes it as simple, but once seen it becomes a grip of the movie. In addition to Emily Kohl and Jiri Terta, Wladyslaw Starewicz has invented everything that animated most of the future in their work. So he should not forget.
