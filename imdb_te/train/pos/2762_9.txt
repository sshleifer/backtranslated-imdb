This film is my favorite piece of celluloid. I really do not need or want to say here. On your own eighth day, you may be "enjoying the amazing work of Daniel and Pascal" by the story of this sweet, funny and heartwarming story about 'your eighth day' <br /> When I saw this film on my eighth day = I thought seriously about how to live my life! We hope that some of us will waste time. It will delight a career or pleasant TV-shows and ballgames. What we lose is the satisfaction of something to another person - a variation. Looking for room and time to stay instantly and live - now! (On the eighth day) ... came from at least on the eighth day.
