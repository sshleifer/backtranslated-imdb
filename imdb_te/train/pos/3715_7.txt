Exactly this is a very small number but I can not think of what I've seen before. I remind myself of the "Another Poetier" VPA film "The Other Dates of the Ruby RAE" also included in the implementation of "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Rat Cotture" and Lynne Ramsey. It's not that they're not tasteless ... they feel very modern and very fashionable ... I feel like I'm working on this way (in style and storyline) <br /> <br /> Cinematography is just as good as my liking is. Most of the coral filtration (or coal) at my discretion ... made a very sloping 12mm. So the whole impression is a little too long for me - beware of the art, it's very quick! French (they are a traditional group) have also bought a jury ... but I wonder if what happened in the past few years, the Cannes Short Film Select is traditionally conservative compared to its feature selection.
