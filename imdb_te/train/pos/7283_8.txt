I buy those cheap and lousse DVDs from Alpha Video. One day, I bought this one. It's the perfect silly science fiction film of 50, all sexed up. For those who appreciate this kind of stuff, it's an enjoyable movie, filled with the absurd everything, the shortest Claude girls and plenty of play. And if you can 'suspend your disloyalty', you can actually get out of the way - not just by the mental head or the beating of the thing in the room, and finally 'perfect body'. It is so. . . . What is another term for magic?
