In 1986, I saw his film in Dallas, Texas. I remember giving them gifts to watch the movie. I can see why after watching the movie. The movie is not bad, or it is great. Problem with this film tried to tell the story one side. They created a new story, new characters and tried to roll around the masters saga. My biggest complaint is about the second wave of robot masters who attacked the plot. They used the same scenes from the master saga but with different conversations. As a kid, I liked the movie. But unfortunately I did not see it as an adult and can not give a better review. I'm reluctant to look back, but I'd love to see the film and re-evaluate my attitude on it. Is it possible to release this film to judge all over the world? I love robot and can not wait for shadows chronicles.
