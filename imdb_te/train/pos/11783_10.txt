Rock Star: INXS is the best music TV series I have ever seen! It is one of the greatest rock and roll songs performed by 15 great talented singers / performers. Reality TV is a very hearty feeling, feeling, and surprising conclusions are in my opinion. It really shed me the tears of joy for the winner! For 13 weeks of this broadcasting contest, all viewers have been attracted to audiences familiar to all known people. Some contenders after a few episodes compete with some strangers in the reality TV show. And the INXS is true, and still, one of the great rock n 'roll bands that added emotional tensions created by this great reality series. If you do not record the series, ROCK STAR: INXS DVD is a great alternative.
