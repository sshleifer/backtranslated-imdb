************** Possible Spoilers ********** One reason why I have seen this movie and because I have a huge crush with Richard Belzer. (I do not know much about humor) Barbie and Ken spoof and there are some parts that are funny like dealers and president Skitt. Sometimes it's rare (courage, I'm cruded?) It's fun at times, but it's fine. If they spend time with humor and more time, the film will be ridiculous. Some skits make you gag, and terrible, others skits make you laugh and think odd enough. Sadly dated this movie. If you have a mad crush on Richard Beller (worth it) it is worth checking and checking Chevy Chasing.
