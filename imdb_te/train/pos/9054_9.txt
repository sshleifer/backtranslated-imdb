"October Sky" stolen your heart, fill your mind with mysterious images, and lift your soul. The story of Homer Hickmum and his dream of creating a rocket is quite simple at the beginning, especially when the film is set in a mining town, with a clear cut of coal blocks in the future. But Homer can not follow his father's footsteps. <br /> <br /> Homer tries to convince his eyes that Miss Riley, a friendly teacher, and his father's crew and his friends encourage them. There are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston reduces us to coal mines, where we see the chilling crash of minors committed to rock's roof. With lit helmets and bent postures, they appear to be more alien insects than humans in the dark. Minor hacking and blackened faces are a constant reminder to the danger faced by their work. <br /> <br /> The spacious loading of mine shafts contrasts Homer's pictures and his friend rocket launches. Under the sky blue bowl, rackets are placed on a pad and entering the stratosphere ... Never see Homer Sputnik for the first time. <br /> <br> Relationships between attractive characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man ... but he also has a soft side. We see that he loves his son because of their arguments. Miss Riley's love and support is clear. The best, picture is inconvenient. It does not tie up with a nice bow everything. It tears you, you get up. It is actually a reality of a breeze, which is important in a movie. <br /> <br /> This film is considered to be full work. Initially, I was disappointed that the film did not continue in Homer's life. I did not want to finish it. Then I realized ... what a good movie does to a person. If it's done, you do not want it to end. And "October Sky" just fulfills that.
