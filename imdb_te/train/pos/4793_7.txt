I feel after watching this movie I know a little more about USA. David Lynch is fortunately synonymous with Shock's value and dysfunction, in fact these elements are missing from The Straight Story. But I was in a light that I did not witness from the lynch earlier. We begin with a normal family spending a quiet life but ends with a range of deeply insulting interesting characters in their lives that are not clear from their introduction. The bar scenes in particular with the two WWII veterans have influenced the events that took place fifty years ago and their current lives and emotions. If you're looking for wild at Hart or Doon, do not see here. If you see real people with realistic stories, it's a picture for you.
