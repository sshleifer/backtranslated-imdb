This is my happiest movie that is my wife, daughter, and over-the-top so I found it irresistible. The plot is just crazy but "real rings" to the world of soap operas in all outrageous impossibility and impossibility. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the performances of Kevin Klein and Sally Field. I'm not good at anyone than Klein while playing Tick Head. Really disappointing for the attention and verification of the field's role - and in her mood almost two bipolar swings - the well-known (infamous) theme of the field featuring "You Love You!" Oscar exclamation People who can take a large grain like salt can be very rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think that I'm the only film I do not seem to be impatient with Hoop Goldberg's characters. I think she was "spot" in every detail. Robert Downey Jr., Terry Hatcher, Katy Morier, and Elizabeth Shoes are also the first-rate. Just a great image if you are in the mood to go along with the ride and smile!
