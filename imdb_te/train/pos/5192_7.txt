I'm a kung fu fan, but not a woo fan. I'm not interested in over-the-top gun-drama gangster films. Now, martial arts; * It's beautiful! John Wow surprised me by producing the most entertaining Kung Fu movie that had almost all of the same things if possible! <br /> <br /> Many fighting scenes are very good (and some of them are few), and the main characters are fun and loved. The bad guys are a bit too unbelievably bad, but nothing less fun. You should look at the sleeping wizard !! <br /> When recurring scenes come, lastly, many of the combat scenes for Hurray get much boring and long-haul, in fact not that good. Therefore, I will only "rate" it from 7 to 7. But it really is almost "8". <br /> <br /> All of the good Kung Fu movies are the main part of the Kung Fu movie in the heart. All the good kung fu movies are from the mid-late 1970s, the last 60ies and the early 70s with some significant exceptions (and the early 80ies, affordable).
