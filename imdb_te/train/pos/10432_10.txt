Initially, I am disappointed about watching this film. I thought this stupid, small, romantic movie to meet with a man about a French woman and ask him to visit me. I'm not really enchanted about this kind of script because I believe it's just a movie. Still, I saw it! And I was amazed ... "Before Sunrise" One of the few movies that dared to speak in a rather philosophical way, in our birth moment, we were sentenced to death, or that it should be together for a couple eternity, or we, human beings, sometimes in fairy-tales Telling you to live. <br /> Hopefully, we hope to be hopeful (we do not know whether we will see again in six hours, in six months, at the Vienna station). Actors acted in a very good manner, so I believe I can live a love story too.
