First I have a word for this film: 'less'. This is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever touched, from the story of the performances of sophisticated Lion and Sophia Lorenz, played by Marcelo Maestroani. It was very fascinating in the very last role because he brought the character deeper because it was a difficult character. Even though both of them were pairing, from the beginning to the end, I was amazed, so a friendship with love affirmed in the film that was developing throughout the day. The stories take a while, because the introduction of characters is too long, but ultimately replaced with an amazing story about love and humanity. If you have the opportunity, look at it, because it's a picture that should stay in your mind a lot of time. Just amazing - 9/10.
