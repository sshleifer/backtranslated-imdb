This showtable film really deserves the best viewer rating of 4.5; I gave up on 10 stories and acting on the basis of acting. After reading the audience comments, I was surprised by how much the film was doing as a comedy. Yes, I see that IMDB lists it under Gerrell as a Cons / Drama. Is it misleading? Fortunately, I saw the movie before pulling on this website, so I do not have that ambition. In fact, based on the essence of what I heard, I thought I was totally dramatic. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am surprised if the film is disappointing by very few votes. <br /> <br /> Another factor in the low votes is that the film is very 'alphabetically'. 'Miss Daisy Driving' is an example for another character-based movie. Some previous comments made a complaint about boring inquiry. Tom's (Danny Glover) work scenes have attracted attention from the real plot of the film. That is, he means social ascending engineering of his family - or his personal forces, if you want. However, they worked to go to the 'top' of the world to establish the right and loyalty and justification for Greenwich. <br /> <br /> Tom's siege was a force. He proved that he would stop nothing to blend into the White neighbor. Another black man is not due to the color of the skin when he goes next door. This is because the 'interlapper' represents; Everything left behind Tom. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of the film have the most powerful writing, directing and acting (by VP Goldberg) I have always had the pleasure of witnessing. I realized that the climax of the film was not a clear incident that occurred next to me (I do not want to give it away). Climax Verbal and Woopie provides it. She said that she was not yet clear if she had a conversation, which would go to college Tom-Too, or when she was released, waking up in the middle of the night and Tom. However, this decline is great. <br /> <br /> My favorite kind of role-based film: People problems, some pain, dances, they grow, change, and life is going on. As a viewer, I can learn something or get inspired.
