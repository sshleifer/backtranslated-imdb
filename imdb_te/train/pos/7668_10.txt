I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs it is absolutely amazing. The modern wizard plays the fist. (And is definitely adorable.) 2) The film helped to induce a role-playing game I fully enjoy, Mage: Awakening. I have shown a different LARP after the parties, which is always a big hit. <br /> <br /> With D & D love and Jeff-Schiffing, this is not exactly a masterpiece, but it works well and is totally enjoyable. The plot is fast-moving and sink with its simplicity, with special effects that have a low budget and a good script, which is not bad, and is cheaper in all the right places. Good way to spend the evening.
