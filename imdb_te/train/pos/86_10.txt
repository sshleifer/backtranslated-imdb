I remember seeing this in a Salem Movie Theater (where I used to attend "Every Saturday of Kiddie Matinie") in Dayton, Ohio when I was a young boy and never forgotten it. It surprised me and my friends. There are some ways I can see again! I did not find a compilation of some shorts or were unable to take any advantage. I recently realized that it was a Costa Rouge film and my mind overwhelmed my mind. He hecks my understanding of how he has achieved. If I remember correctly, this fish is at one stage of Cat's Warts! I'd be very grateful if someone could help me to see it again!
