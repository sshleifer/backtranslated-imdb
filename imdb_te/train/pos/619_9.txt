I guess this film is good and possibly clich√©, but I totally wrong! Charlie Cox (I have never heard of him so far) played a very good figure; I thought he was with me and my friend completely fell in love with him. <br /> I love her in Claire Danes, Romeo and Juliet, whom I previously liked, and I enjoy her. Her acting was fantastic, I did not even mention that she was American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox is very good, casting is very perfect. <br /> <br /> Robert Dinero and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well cast; Dinero as the gay pirate ... is invaluable and precious. In a sequence on the Septimus ship I laughed too hard ... oh my god, wow. Pfeiffer played a good villain, I liked it as a snippy mother in her Hairspray. But she has drama and snooping comments throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In whole, it's funny (but not at all!), romantic, special effects are not full, but they're great when they are; The roles that came from Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also in good standing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] I kept the entire time of my interest and when it comes out I will buy the DVD!
