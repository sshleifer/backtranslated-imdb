After waiting for many years, Anne Rivers Sidons' 1979 book "The House Next Door" was finally filmed. As a result, especially in the first story of the trilogy, if it was a disgrace like a TV movie, it was absolutely liked and actually very good, not as great as the book, one of Stephen King's likes and seams. <br /> <br /> There is more time and limited limits in a theatrical release, exploring all the greatness in the original three-part story of the ominous ultra-house. <br /> <br /> However, the whole cast in this contemplative narrative works. There are some unnecessary cheap shocks, but the growing climate has improved. In fact, one of the most disturbing scenes is the house's abstract painting, the next door enthusiast-artist neighbor trying to portray corruption on canvas. <br /> Make sure you read the great novel.
