I found just Married mesmerizing and joyful looking at the culture and tradition of Marig's Westerns. The idea of ​​getting married to a stranger through parental interaction is difficult, especially in this modern age. However, this is a Hindi movie. With humor and fresh perspective, we will get to know about Abbey and Remix once in their traditional five-day honeymoon. As said, this cell phone is hard to believe in old age, such an ancient tradition is still a marriage. When this young couple come together on their first night, and they do not know each other, we will see how they try to copy a bond. The different views of marriage and commitment, as well as other couples, have also been married to others for not knowing yet about forty years, as well as on holidays. Song, witty dialogue, sharp movements, new ways and comparison and comparison of tradition. Looking at the movie with subtitles loses some of the story's honesty of course, yet it is a pleasure to see. The plot is a bit simplistic and the bus incident is a bit drawn and made; But the whole movie is worth watching.
