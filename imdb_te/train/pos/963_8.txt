Takashi Miyik is one of my favorite directors and I watch him out of movies because I hate to see him depart from his movies: Visitor Q, Goji, Ezo, Echi Killer and the Black Society Trio. Recently he seems exploring new territory and I think he is the success. Yet I saw the first of his paintings in that direction, so I was nervous. Of coarse I purchased without seeing and I was happy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this game, The whole movie reminds me of all the films I like: Neverending Story, Labyrinth, Oz to Return, etc. . There are dark underlying trends, but it is also a cinematic movie of any movie. I personally do not care about CGI and prosthetics. <br /> <br /> If you're a die hard takashi mike fan, you may not like it. But, I suggest to give a shot. It proves that Miike is different and talented as he suspects me. <br /> <br /> I have suggested to those who are new to Takashi mike, people who are heartfelt or dramatic, like this. Other Miyake: 'Gerbron' 'The Happiness of the Cactus' 'Sabu' and 'The Bird People in China'. <br /> <br /> The good job is Takashi Mike! 8/10 stars.
