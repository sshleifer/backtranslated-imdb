I do not know what is excluded, so I think I'm not too much except that much. My fault is not its bad little image. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new director and writer. So she deserves the most spectacle for this film. You can say that she loves her. Acting (Dominic Outside) is a great cheesy and the quality of the film is not great either but its really good for a really low budget movie. The story line shines and there are episodes that are shot there, but I think it is not greatly imprisoned for the ability to understand the film. If you like Dominic Monaghan, I'm going for it. Gag Reel is fun, I can not spoil it but you can see and see a special scene that can buy a valuable DVD. If you like the image then look at the picture made by Pink Mirror, the juggled edge. I know Dominic fans will enjoy this little piece of paradise.
