I love this movie. Nail Imagery with Mike Hammer, a spyless character of Spillen, works great to create a mental state and is rarely seen in the early Fifty-low budget detective films. It may not be 'the Maltese Falcon', but the film does its own great collaboration. Spillane is often criticized for allegedly excessive etc, but his 'daemes' are cunning and intriguing as their male counterparts are above. Baff Old Mike Hammer, who plays Beef Eliot, is anxious when he sees the death of a soldier's friend and is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist. Penny was finally a picture of his face falling down. It is good to see that 50's censorship did not force the filmmakers to remove the last line. A good budget low budget classic.
