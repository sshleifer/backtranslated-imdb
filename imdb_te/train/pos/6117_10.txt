I can tell you about the necromonic / schizophrenic 2 series ... If you are also remote "PC" or if you are not seriously confused, then you can not get it. The movie is ill and disgusting, it is not really a comedy and "horror" film. If anybody can congratulate anyone who pushes good taste and political boundaries for the limited limitations, it will not be as funny, then you will see it to be trusted. The film does not touch a large film studio with a 10 foot pole (eventually with a condom). In my opinion, the best, most serious pieces came from the underground. <br /> <br /> "The waste of a perfectly good VHS tape or DVD-R. I've been able to get a million dollars full of big names from the big studio studios." I have also seen stink bombs stocks.One of the two from Ron Atkins / John Ginskoppop comes out of a BUDGET film and all the other "Shock" films are completely out of the water, you're all in the whole Indian movie scene <br /> <br /> After seeing this, you can see how much Indian filmmakers can have their own work. <br /> <br /> Other people who have seen this movie are "the fact that they laughed all the way okay. I do not think it's possible if someone bored looking at both of these. So you can see the psoriasis capture puppet, which has been snapped so badly, and can not make a misanthropic grin if you do not take everything you've seen in the media basically. You will be able to see it alone, it is traditional. Both Schizophrenhenic / Schizophrenicic 2 are my favorite for 1000 DVDs.
