I have seen this movie aired over a lifetime TV network a few years ago and I thought it was an interesting story. A few years later I will see again and play the role of love with this film. The story behind the movie and it's lovely. The cast will just make it more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely on top of the game. She also mentions the modes, voice, and even of Mrs. Chamberlain. Lyndi suffers pain, pain, surprise and anger she shows up, and it's hard to remember that in the process it is not lindy. In my opinion, Meryl's performance was better than her Oscar winning turn in "Sophie Choice", and she received her third Oscar. Sam Neal is similar to Michael Chamberlin, and for some surprising reasons academy has not been recognized with at least one nomination. In all, the film received the ONE Oscar Appraisal (for Streep's Best Actress.), Although it received numerous Australian Oscars and nominations. <br /> Definitely an outstanding-rate picture: Get great performances from the whole cast.
