Anyone who thinks of anime will be silenced forever after seeing this film with sex and violence. It tells Tetsuro's exploration to avenge his mother's death, but it increases in this process. The journey of the train refers to Tatesuro's journey from childhood to humanity. The music's music and visual styles are slightly different (you can tell it is 70 images) and the animation is much better than your average "Star Blazers" episode. But the story and the characters are very strong, it really does not matter. Must see for any animation fan!
