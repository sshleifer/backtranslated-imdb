Excellent film, contemporary Finland realistic picture, touching and deep. This is one of the best Finnish movies. In the small town of Central Finland, people's desires and weaknesses, joys and sorrows are gripping everyday life. This great test of people in a welfare society with a bright early fall sunburn creates a cool atmosphere. Lampels are actually one of the most good Finnish filmmakers. He shows that it is possible to create gorgeous images without machine guns and bloodshed. His next film Aila is also valuable, yet cleaning up women struggling for their jobs is not attractive around the world with the intention of jokes.
