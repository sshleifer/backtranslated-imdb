This film is not the US type of film. Why people rented foreign images. This is a great story, if a person, even if he is retarded, can make a person feel in a blank life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It's mentally disturbing the challenges of life and shows them in a very realistic way (I think). This film is a sweet bitter finish as its classic in foreign films, but it makes a good movie.
