Jim Curry can do anything. I'm going to have some dumb childhood movie, and it's not entirely. It's great for everyone, for adults and children. I once was the reason why it came to almost all of the theaters, and now it's finally coming out on DVD on this tuning day and I'm excited to see you. <br /> You must see if you are before, it's great! <br /> <br /> Liz
