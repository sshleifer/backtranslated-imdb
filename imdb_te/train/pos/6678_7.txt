I really did not expect much from this movie, but it was not bad; It's actually pretty good. In this movie, I have the funniest bits I've ever seen from the movie. Now it's not saying it's one of the ridiculous movies of all time, but I've laughed pretty hard in some areas. "Police say suicide rule of my father has dropped an elevator shaft as some bullets". Now the movie is not for everyone, its stupid humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; So if you hate these movies, I'd like to run it clearly. Finally, this is a joyful movie about a superhero Varnas group that stands as real heroes. It's a widespread overrated comedy that many people probably have not seen yet, like it's before it's completely rubbish. After watching this film, the film was directed by Ben Stilller, William H. I mean why the kid's superstar star can be constructed from Mackie, Hank Azri and Good Burger. It is because the Mystery Match has completed a fantastic comic strip period from 7 to 10. Very big surprise.
