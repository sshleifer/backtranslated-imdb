I do not need to tell you the story. It is said of years and years. I share my feelings. I saw Cinderella at the age of five. Since then I have a Disney Child in a good way. Animation now looks childish and old fashioned, but it is part of its appeal. Now, at the age of high school musical and computer-generated films, people seem to have forgotten the intellect and magic of early Disney movies. Thankfully I was born before this classic introduction. And no matter how old I am, I turn it into the VHS and turn it into five years back. It's the true magic of Disney.
