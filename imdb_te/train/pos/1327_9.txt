How tasty my Little French substitute tells a story of sad, scary and life-affirming. <br /> <br /> It's true, this is the great strength of the movie: It plays with a sense of emotion, with your emotions and expectations, then you drops a bomb. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the '90s I saw a movie theory at the USC in class. It's not easy, but it certainly is hunting for value.
