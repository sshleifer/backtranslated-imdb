The film, which has a lot of interest in the Philadelphia suburbs and local history, provides Philadelphia's spectacular vintage look in 1940. Downtown scenes, no longer a train station, 30th Street Station - still exist, as well as scenes from the northeast part of the city. The good shots of the old row homes they found. The film gets a little "chatty" at some times - loses the viewer in a little bit of interest ... But the whole storyline is solid and very moving. In addition to local footage of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA, the film also attempts to see the film "Bright Victory" - scenes from downtown Phoenixville. After the army hospital the college campus became. These films are not in any format and I can not imagine why. I have two from VHS from home recording as shown in TCM in recent years. I highly recommend them to other historians from my area!
