<br /> As I have said, I am not from the South, really care for indigenous music and never worn a cowboy hat. (I love the dead body in my trunk, but I love "goodfellas") It's just a great movie. A 2.35 aspect ratio was filmed and beautifully transmitted to the DVD. (VHS 1.33 fullscreen). And yes, a solid 5.1 mix for your viewing pleasure. <br /> It's a great love / hate story with great performances in Texas. Travolta is wonderful. Next to "Pulp Fiction", the best thing he has done. It's in my first 5 years in 25 years! <br /> Check it out! It's a 10 !!!!
