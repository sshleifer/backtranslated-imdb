This is a really nice and sweet picture that can enjoy the whole family. It's not the two dogs and the cat who have been taken away to live with someone else for a cat, but the animals do not understand and they will escape and find their own family. The cat is named Sassy and she lives in her name. The possibility is to know a lot about life inside the pound called the young dog. Shadow is an old and learning dog. Put together those three on an adventure and make it full of joyful and pleasant time. It's not cheesy since no mouth has any special effects. The best spoken animal image I have ever seen. This is a good movie for families.
