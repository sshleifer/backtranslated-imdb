Convolt, angry and impossibly impossible to sit through Fay Grim, but Parker Posey is really the only actress who can really take this story and run with it. She is so touching, funny, fraudulent. <br /> I did not even try to tell the plot. It seeks the story of characters and international espionage from Henry's Fool of Heart. <br /> <br / If you read this movie works well. In a sense, totally ridiculous. It's more ridiculous as you plod along. (Twice the temptation to turn off the DVD). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And finally, this explains the explanation.
