This film has everything. This is a spectacular picture of the events surrounding thousands of Cuban refugees immigrants. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pacino), is one of only a thousand to get a chance to choose his job in America. The film of Miami's Drug Empire is still very accurate. Brian Dappla performs an excellent job of directing the film, with many viewers in each cast of the cast including the hero. Steven Bauer (Manny, Tony Best Friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastononeo (Gina, Tony's Number), Robert Logia (Frank, Tony Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (wife of Elvira, Frank), with Tony character's behavior very believable and strong. Every minute I watch this movie, I have enjoyed it and watch it in a week. This year, the 20th anniversary of this classic crime movie, another 20 years old people still look at this movie in surprise numbers for I am a true believer. With other crime films being dramatic, the film is a shock to the system.
