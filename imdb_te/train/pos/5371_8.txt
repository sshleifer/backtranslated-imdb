I first commented on this film almost five years ago. Then, the ideas presented in the picture still seem to be more fiction, in fact they always change at times. Nothing. <br /> <br /> The politics, society, and media in the running man are actually close to home. <br /> <br /> 1987 (Running Man Out of the Year) <br /> <br /> Richard Dawson's character, Damon Kilian, says "traditional morality." <br /> Fun in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort as part of the competition. <br /> Cameras everywhere. <br /> <br /> It is limited to traveling to civilians controlled by a centralized computer system that is complete with barcode passports and granted in accordance with national security. <br /> In the borders of government and media, increase the borders. <br /> <br /> The computer-generated graphics advanced enough to monitor real movie footage (such as the "Digital Matte" of Ben Richards' Image on Stunt Double). <br /> <br /> Jailing opposers or enemies of the current administration. <br /> <br /> Expansion of the Gulf between wealthy and not-so-poor wealth increases the economy; Increasing numbers of marginalized groups responding to the sharpness of the big government; Rioting of under-surface or ill-filled riots in almost every major public event, regardless of its origin or intent. <br /> Again, this is a movie based on Stephen King's novel. But to be safe, I'm going to Switzerland.
