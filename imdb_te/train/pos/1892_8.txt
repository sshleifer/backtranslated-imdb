After seeing Arthur many times on TV, I laughed Dudley Moore's character as Arthur. John Gielgood, his servant / father, is equal to his hobby. I purchased the DVD two weeks ago and have been happy for about 27 years, and it's still fun, and Liza Minnely's character is always happy to be in love between the two. <br /> <p> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a corrupt Millionaire, who has no desire to raise a bar bill that he reads as a national debt, and enjoying acting like children. His activities overseen his powder English Butler Hobson (Geelgood), but Arthur does not really care about Arthur, but Arthur's father (Barbour) does not marry Susan Johnson (Auckberry) when he does not marry the terrible blonde However, Arthur meets a waitress and a young man working with Linda Marlo (Minnelly) He falls in love with the thieves, now he faces a difficult decision marriage or love for money. When Hobson dies, Arthur finally grows up and breaks up with Susan before the wedding, leaving him with both money and his true love. <br /> <br /> Arthur is truly a lovely romantic comedy film for everyone
