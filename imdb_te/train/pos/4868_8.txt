I gave 10 to 8 people in this movie, e.g. 10 Reservations for 10, recently for Amadeus and Slumdog Millionaire 9. The film is close to Slumdog, but the Balkans have a difficult time without understanding life, mentality and a soul. You really need to be one in the Balkans to understand this. This fantastic movie is much better and more contemporary of his previous films, which is bored at this time, and I think I'm going to go ahead with Katrina. I like humor (balcony humor), photography is an art, each scene is artistic to the limit. Plot is probably a fairy tale, do not remember it now, but remember that my daughter is going to sleep-same story.
