<br /> <br /> I would like to accept bad movies. I love them and I see them all. Especially horror. My friends and I all have to collect after a hard week at school and work, rent some crazy tapes, a pizza order and an explosion. One of the things we came to the Hollywood video, it's a zombie blood bath. <br /> <br /> The story is about a housing project built with a bulldozed bulldozer and the other underground layers are just covered. While some children come to a hole in a cave, the neighboring residents find the capped comfort. It woke up some zombies. <br /> In this case, it is part-city. <br /> <br /> Okay, this is not a great art, but it's our favorite to have a joke dialogue and over-the-top giant stuff. Evening. Actually, one of the best "party tapes" I have ever had the pleasure of watching. And it can be said that it does not make money on the foolish people. There are hundreds of zombies, and director Brendan Fraser (he's in a guest role) and it's just a wild tour.
