The film is a fantasy. The storyline is narrow but some wonderful songs are sung and beautifully sung. (I can not yet believe that such a beautiful and attractive people can sing this song.) Some of the dialogue is awesome. <br /> <br /> Since 1942, I looked at the hot haute couture fashion show. <br /> <br /> The movies are designed for a variety of purposes. This is designed to be entertaining and it definitely does. If I had a negative comment it would be that the Nelson Eddie beautiful dashing count was a little old. Some moments made me uncomfortable. But he still can sing and sing greatly. Anyway, Jeanette MacDonald has been dazzling from time to time. <br /> <br /> This genre is well before my time, I'm new to Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddie movies and related dialogue. The music is beautiful in this movie. I love the classic rock music that fills the most modern films, and I have no question in mind that this music is just as clear, memorable, more joyful, and well-built. The stars in the film today are much more skilled than the stars I see in the movie theaters. Without the purpose of the plastic surgery of Benerlie Hills, Jeanette MacDonald is more beautiful than the stars that I see today. I am not clear why so many other posters are apologizing to the film and more generally the likes of these movies. They say what they say and try to explain why this is so. And those who do not like it is not very good but what to say compared to what? I feel that this film will be undoubtedly when most of the people forget it again. The film is very high in every way, because it should not be remembered and enjoyed. I would recommend this film without reservation for anyone who would appreciate great talent, great beauty and great music.
