With mixed reviews I did not expect this much, and was pleasantly surprised. It's a very entertaining little crime movie with interesting characters, striking images, breeze without a jab, and writing good pace. It's pretty cool in a funky way. Apparently people like this movie or just hate it, and I'm the one who liked it.
