I am Hindi cinema since I was 4 years old but I have always seen a moving and influential film in my life, especially as a Hindi film. Over the past few years, I stopped watching contemporary Hindi movies and stopped watching Classic (Teesri Kassam, Mere Huzur, Madhumati, Mother India, Shola etc.). This is one of the best films I've ever seen. I'm moving but I am very educated for a woman of the first generation in America. This has helped me to understand my own family history, which is always very fitting for me. However, it feels "I'll see", feel it and help me to generate generations before me and the struggle faced by the Indian people. The film helped me to keep a number of things in my perspective, especially taking into consideration the current world events. I never thought I would ever change a film like this before ... it did. The plot is amazing, the acting is amazing and the direction is malleable. Two thumbs up!
