I love this movie !!! Purple Rain It was my heart since the year I was born and I remember it. Prince is very tight in this film. I went to a special exhibition of purple rain last night and I'm glad to see some true fans the movie is so low, it really is one of the greatest movies of all time. Music is untouchable. The movie "The Kid", which was portrayed by Prince, his family did not work, his band was the hottest act in town and he had his eyes on Apollonia, an amateur singer. My favorite color of purple is the question of why I can thank "kid" why. So if you do not see it, you should make an appointment soon. It's a classic - 4ever!
