I thought this movie - throughout. I was impressed by Russell Crowe's talent in developing his relationship with Lyell, the Aussie blend of such a soft soft approach, a bit self-deprecating and more persistent. Really like cinematography and direction. The pace was perfect and almost all the characters were impressed. <br /> <br /> Gosh shines Russell's talent in 1993 too! .. and I still see the gladiator.
