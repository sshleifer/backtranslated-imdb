This movie is very happy for my 3rd year French classes. In many cultural, inter-city high school, the film provided many aspects of the discussion (class in French, but there was much discussion in English after class). <br /> <br /> Compared to the similarities between protein and France, it is very clear that the relationship between protey and millet. <br /> <br /> In this movie, "sexiest" I've seen so far. One year, a 17-year-old African American shouted, "Yes!" He found the scene: A protey helped Aime to wear her evening, but both were looking into other mirrors in the mirror. Directors use "mirror technique" to focus on internal controversy in one or more characters in a scene: a perfect example of technology, and this is "sexy". <Br Many understand the end of the film at the end of the students. One aspect of the film suggests that "Africanism", and how much African or African love can not become African (as the driver attempts): one must be African.
