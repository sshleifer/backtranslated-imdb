Imagine turning out lights in your remote farmhouse on a cool night, and then going to bed. Do not touch the doors. Winding is only wind through trees. Outside the lights outside the vehicles after midnight. <br /> <br /> This is a very scary movie, a remote farmhouse ... at night. Based on the Truman Capote's best-selling book and the best 1940's Nair films, "Cold Blood" is a particularly horrific story with comparable B & W lighting, especially in that first act, the plot mostly night and rain-fed roads. It's the elements of nightmares. But this is not a dream. <br /> These events really happened in 1959. <br /> <br /> The two men with illusive heads were killed by the entire Kansas family, and director Richard Brooks used the original locations of real events, as well as the farmhouse ... and its interior! <br /> <br /> The main actors are close to real life killers. Robert Blake dreamed to find Perry Smith, a small and bum-legged man, who drank to find the treasure he had buried in Cortez. <br /> <br /> Dick Hickok, a soft spoken con artist with Scott Wilson American-American Smile, is almost as beautiful as he is. <br /> <br /> The duo headed to Mexico after their murder case. Things are curled there, so they are U.S. , Steals cars, hitchhiking, and they usually lose from place to place. But it's a fool life, and two bandits immediately regret their actions. <br /> <br /> The last twenty minutes of the film are mesmerizing, when the rain is over, the cord closes, and the hitting of all the soft hearts we hear. <br /> <br /> A little bit of a mundane interpretation is a real-life story inspired by the "cold blood" still half a century later, hypnotized. This setting does that. Do you keep people in rural Kansas open their doors?
