<br /> <br /> I did not pay much attention to the first pinjar. Because I felt that the film was a subject of controversy, it was another Indian and partisan towards Pakistan. I'm totally wrong. Pinzar is a heart, emotional and intellectual image. I saw it but I chased it. It lasted in my mind for a long time; <br /> <br /> It is a fairy tale that rarely appears in Bollywood today. It does not contain biases or partisans and divides the human story. Here, no one is depicted in good or bad living. Bad Indians, bad Pakistani and good Indians and Pakistanis. Cinematography is good and music is harmonious, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar Sahib) and haunting. Everything about the film is fantastic ... and acting just took my breath away. All the perfect cast. <br /> If you have an interest in watching an intellectual and genuine fantastic picture ... see more. This film gives everything. I will recommend my heart. Amazing does not explain how amazing it is.
