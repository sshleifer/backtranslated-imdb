I'm 53 years old college professor. I went with my wife to a 12-year-old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is original, witty, fast and beautiful. The plot is as easy as the age of 10, but there are enough twists to keep the adults interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a fantastic job and I thought the rest of the cast was just fine. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets are not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing stood up. On the other hand, makeup, clothing, lighting, cinematography, editing and direction are excellent. Overall, I thought it was an enjoyable experience. Professional critics (almost all adult men) have been discouraged that this film is very badly attacked. Apparently, they have something against images that portray strong, intelligent and independent women. More about their wonderful works about this wonderful family picture revealed their own sexist nature. I strongly recommend every child and every parent.
