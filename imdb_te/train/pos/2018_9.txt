I liked it a lot of DVD and novel at the same time. <br /> Although it uses a bit more screen time for Friedrich Lawrence (played by James Pure Faye), chemistry between actors (including short Arthur). And Gilbert Mark's movie "From That" is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntingdon who surprised me by astonishing shock and awe and wonders. I adore him in the Forreste Saga, and I see him, but he overcame himself as Arthur. In my wildest dreams I could not play a mental movie like Arthur Huntingdon. But he's going to. I loved it. I love him.
