I saw the original English version in the video. The choice of Disney's voice actors is very good. I can not believe what I say. The story tells about a little boy, who meets a man in his history. Both animated films were thrown out as one of the most fun and secret storylines. The quality of the animation is amazing! If you see Disney's job of Kiki's Delivery Service you can see the quality of their product. It almost sells them to steal the white lion's Kimba story. (But not much!) Finally Miyazaki movies are being released correctly! I can not see the English version of Nasissia's uncature!
