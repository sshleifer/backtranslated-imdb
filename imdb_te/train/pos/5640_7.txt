I really think this movie is great, personally. But, in each image is downer. Now, some of you will not be able to see Hilary Duff's 'grow your voice', but if you think about it, those two shows are very similar, I understand what. In 'Brave New Girl', it is very bad to come into the Holy Heavy's Conservator. In 'Voice Your Voice', Terry L.A. Wants to go to a conservator (do not remember the name of the conservator here). They are both in the music industry, and they both have to sing at the end of the semester. These two films are the same. I am personally better than 'Brave New Girl', though 'increase your voice' though.
