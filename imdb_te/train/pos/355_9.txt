I, like many horror fans, have been given the same common big budget Hollywood reconstructions as well as the MTV High School Slasher Trip Fed over the past 20 years. Here, finally, the actual horror style film that ticks all the right boxes. <br /> <br /> You need a hot lead actress, you need vampires, you need cool arms, you need cooler ones and you need blood. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Combat Choreography and Stephanie Beach from Hammer Horror Queen A supporting role from Ram, this is truly amazing. <br /> If it's a low budget, it is 35 mm. By using stock and adding quality CG effects to the mix, director James Eve created what he thought was too big. <br /> <br /> Playing for fans of old school horror.
