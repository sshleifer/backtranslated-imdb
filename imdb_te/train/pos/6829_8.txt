Gena Rowlands plays an actress who lost her grip on reality when she saw her as a fan of death. She is largely deceived from reality and, as a result, her emotional crisis penetrates with her work as an actress. She also meets audiences in the sense of breaking and improving all the rules of her acting, making her audiences a parody of cassette's own struggles (if it is a bit self-importance) filmmaker. There are many ideas out there, and as a result it makes a bit muddled (I'm still thinking of the relationship between the dead fan and the Rondlands among many other things), but it makes it a way of providing them in their rawest form as a consistently interesting and thought-provoking image. <br /> <br /> Mulholland Drive is great on a double bill. <br /> <br />
