Richard Linkelter's third film "Before Love, Love, or Love is Still Dedicated to Everybody Dreams" Sweet and lovely, find and expect it. It is equally interesting for young people, their parents, grandparents, one of the most rare films. This is a very simple picture with amazing visual effects, car, or long and stable sex scenes. Two young men and two college students in their early 20s (a French student, Julian Delpy, who traveled to Paris to attend classes at the American tourist Ethan Hawk and Saberan returning to Europe after summer) meet on a train. As soon as they start talking, they are instantly attracted to each other, they stop the train in Vienna, where they spend the whole night around the city. They speak and fall in love. That's it, the movie. It may be boring and silly, but instead, it's a lovely, incredible, intellectual, and moving romance that only views every view (at least for this viewer). High praise and my heartfelt gratitude are both beautiful characters, excellent writing, interesting and witty dialogues, two fantastic performances, and the atmosphere of magic falling in love. Julie Delpy, who looks like a pottselli angel, is great in portraying a smart, independent and very attractive young girl.
