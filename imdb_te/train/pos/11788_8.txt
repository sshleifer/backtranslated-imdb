I think that is really taking the wrong approach at this one. First of all, this small-film is very entertaining and interesting. I'll take it for what. I feel that they are intelligent in their spirit of suspense and mystery concert. Another thing that fascinates my fancy is that although there is no clear story, the viewer is attracted, just suggestions and pazs and emotions are all of your characters, the kind of story is going on. No one is better than Lynch. It's the best of lacinism. Sure, I begin to look at this with the desire to entertain without any really imaginative work from the viewer's side, agree with anyone who will get disappointed. And good right. Lynch is not about it. Linch is not at least on this side. The Last Highway / Mulholland Doctor has a full curve here and people are looking to see something as entertaining, nothing about it. My view, the dark chamber with your animal-center, your natural self, you naturally respond (the image, sound, situation) to your difficulties. It's not about any kind of pleasure, it's about getting the reaction you want. And, my friend, pure art.
