My observations: The ultimate vampire outfit is ravishing and stunning, exotic and amazing. Jinat is well dressed and comes with innocent Nelson. The boat that demolishes into his balcony is right for him. His female mafia's costume costumes are made surprisingly well by today's standards. The 1942 textile designer did a great job. <br /> Warning to negative posters: 1942 WW II time; Pearl Harbor was the year before. U.S. Survived the Great Depression; Singing, dancing, and yes, the hard-earned money on the diversion of fantastic fantasy is needed to spend and spend. Fascist dictators are trying to wipe out liberties in the RL. It is good for people to attend this fantastic plot line. In the frustrating period of the film, a great tradition. When you become negative posters, actors or film stars, you have room to talk and criticize. <br /> <br /> Wonderful angel wings on the true angel. The RL wings are not too hot at the dress party, but the SL will be examined at the Zionate. <br /> <br /> Beautiful singing by Jeanette and Nelson, as always. <br /> <br /> Jeanette is a pure joy to dance. <br /> <br />
