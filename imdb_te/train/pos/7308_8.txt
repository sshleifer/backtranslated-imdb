With a simple story and an attractive heroine, this is a horror movie that started all over. John Carpenter Larry Strood (Jamie Lee Curtis in his early career, as in the role of a career) and her naughty friends quickly plan a night of fun, with a relentless mental illness from hell. <br /> <br /> Michael Myers kills his sister just a few years ago. He was sleeping in his hometown of Hudsonfield, Illinois. After putting his eyes on the lorry after leaving a package in the house where he lived, he began to branch out and scared her, fearing her that she was afraid to get anyone in her path. /> <br /> Beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this mood horror movie scary ... with long gloomy shots that constantly feels constantly if you're constantly stalked by maniacal serial killer. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is definitely outdated, but it is not sparse. The idea alone is the motivation of the bump, and this small shocker is one of the most famous and memorable horror films ever made so far ... It has seven sequels and eventually Rob Robie's equally scary remake, and it is still a new standard for horror.
