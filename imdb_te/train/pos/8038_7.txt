Two snipers travel deeper in search of their targets; <br /> <br /> The mediator-winning sniper is the most inspiring thriller to build a bruding atmosphere, which features his characters and their plight and climax in some good action scenes. Director Luisa is not succeeding, and some have tightened the story. There are some detours here too. <br /> <br /> <br /> Billy Jane is surprisingly well played with a very tiresome, experienced sniper, the famous Berenger. Berenger has proved to be his last good budget Hollywood venture. He can do this kind of sleep in his sleep and he persuades here and plays a direct role twice to the DVD sequels.
