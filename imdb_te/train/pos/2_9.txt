Bromwell is not the brightest little brightest. This searing simulation of students and teachers at a South London Public School leaves you laughing literally laughing, writing and perfectly distributing. It's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. The characters are a brilliant classic cross section of British society (or more accurate of any society). Following the faults of Kyushu, Latina and Natala, the appearance of the three "main characters" is a good word, the show will ridicule every predictable subject. The political correctness leaves the window in each episode. If you enjoy the performances that are not afraid to hurt the fun of each ban implicitly, then Bromwell does not disappoint the High!
