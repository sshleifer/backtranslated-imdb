Wow, this band is another good spin of the original American pie rather than a good camp, but definitely a good naked mile. Dwight and Eric Stiffler led this comedy, but I really liked this conversation to the nude mile. The script is very good and the comedy has come more smoothly, but comedy comes from a lot of sex, but that's because we see these movies anyway? <br /> <br /> Midget Rock also had a really good Cameo, taking into consideration the serious work he had given him in the nude mile, the stifler was fantastic in his scene and laughing my ass when I saw it. /> <br /> There is a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the nude mile in this movie, if you like any pre-American Pie images, if you want a beta home, you have American pine money.
