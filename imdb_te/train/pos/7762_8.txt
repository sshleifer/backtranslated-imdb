In her autobiography, Lauren Bacall Bougie told her that she should not do such a bad thing in this way or similar. At that time, Douglas Cirk called the "cry of women", when actually filmed in the film "Written in the Air", Cirk only made three films: "Deadly Angels", "Love to Time and Time to Time", his Master, IMHO, "Simulation of life" (1960) .Then there is silence. The original Bakal and Hudson characters do not like Sirk. They are very simple, very polite. Dorothy Malone - a substitute for his former German star Zara Leander and her brother Robert Stock Plat's main interest. Uninterruptedly constructed, this is a very long flashback. The unstableness of many brother and sister belongs to the family of Rich Texan oil owners, Gary garments, and landscape ratial cars traveling at top speed in a drix. The transformation of Malone at the end of the film is amazing: Suite and Chignan, killing a small Derrick: she is ready for her life, is to ride a rebellion. Now she is alone, because Hudson lost (but no, he is not in love with her) .A bit reaction to the end, but the play is the best reproduction; Three years later, in the "simulation of life", Sarah-Jane (Susan Kohnner) is blamed because she does not know the place.
