David Zucker is the only non-spoof about this kind of first. The ridiculous movie of Rocksbury's 98 in Rocksbury is exactly lopsided, but I have something about Marie that he does not count except Frank and Beans. Critics, especially Roger Ebert, did not know that he would just watch his reviews of solid entertainment.
