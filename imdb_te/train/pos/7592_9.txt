<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do. <br /> <br /> First, to get things straight, this movie is a rather funny action film. It is revolutionary in the film industry and does not get critical acclaim or consider it one. If you really want to enjoy this movie, I'm suggesting you to ignore your intellect and your desire for a good plot because you can not find it here. <br /> <br /> For this film I have very few expectations because this is a strong plot (yes, cinematographer, I also underestimated the film), and I wanted to enjoy this film very much. I also enjoyed this feeling more than Stephen Chow Flix (I recognized Kung Fu Hustle as his best try and it was rated as a 9). Action is very tight and epic when action is inserted into appropriate places. <br /> <br /> Spoiler warning, I think the action will be unreal, but what would you like to watch a serious basketball movie? Many other sports movies (drama) have already done well, why should another be created? <br /> I do not know why you are reading. Go ahead and see it. <br /> <br /> They created artworks such as Pulp Fiction or The Godfather films, and sometimes even when they were created, are better films in the dump pile. <br /> <br /> I'm saying Kung Fu Dunk deserves recognition as having previous examples, then if we talk about Stephen Chow-Ish comedy, it's ten to ten. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Love: <br /> <br /> The cast of Kung Fu Dunk gives you 9/10. ^ _ ^
