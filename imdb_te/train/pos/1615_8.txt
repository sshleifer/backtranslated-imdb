An amazing romantic comedy about an Italian widow (cher) who planned to marry a comfortable man (Danny Iol) until she fell for her head, angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The script is plenty sharp with great lines, acting is amazing, the tones (I've mentioned) the letter is perfect and cinematography is beautiful. New York never looked good on the screen. One must watch for Cher and Olympia Dukakis, mainly - they have received excellent and rich qualifications for the Oscars. A beautiful, funny picture. Must see!
