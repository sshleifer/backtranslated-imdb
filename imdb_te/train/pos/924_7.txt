Father's pride is a pleasant surprise: it's funny, witty and some great voice acting. This program is about the Lion's family featuring the attraction of Siegfried & Rai performances. In fact all of them are stereotypes but what makes them so funny. FOTP is not kiddi-cartoon, but it has a few mock humor but can be very light. It's full of pop culture references and prominent camos and most of them are executed. I will say that I give the performance ten to 7 because it is not good but it is not very original, and I've seen those stereotypes many times in that particular order!
