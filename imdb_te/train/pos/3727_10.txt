Tigerland is one of the best films I've ever seen, and in my opinion it's a metal metal jacket complete, outdoes a picture of a similar nature. Bozz by Farrell is played unusually well, and a character in your mind after the movie ends. The ending was cut by the amazing Schumacher - singing the harmonious harmony and leaving the forces slowly fractured. What a movie.
