Ten years ago I first saw this movie and thought it was really funny. It is not as bad that some critics are doing it. The fact that generally written by John Hughes is based is that you can at least expect a funny conversation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> All the basic colors, reds, etc in this picture - make it very unique. The cast is very good. Prudish Bunny Packard and Devil-have a stand out of Delores Saal. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely a little dated but I personally prefer all other 'Lampoon' series.
