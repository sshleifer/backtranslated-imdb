This is certainly not an intellectual film with deep mission, I do not really think there is much to understand in case you can not check. <br /> It's just comedy. Humor is easy, pretty funny and sometimes, perhaps, less morbid. Some actors and characters are similar to (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimir Loulie), so there are authors. But it does not matter, the genre is very different and these two pictures should not be compared with this. <br /> <br /> JDN Ruca Netlekka does not try to give you a lesson, it tries to laugh at you and it's possible to succeed. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, it's not intelligent. Some scenes are really valuable.
