Absolutely happy. He is very rich in seeing John Waters tribute to people who love most (ballimorians), laugh at and watch. This is like a loose turn in the kitsch museum! From serial mom I did not laughed in the theater too. Waters had seen Dreamland days before the camera, old friends from Sharon Nisp and Susan Loew. The cast is simply amazing (especially Edward Frolung and Martha Plimpton). The past uses plenty of watersheds (especially low polyester) and new surprises. In a wonderful way, I was sick. Thank you, John!
