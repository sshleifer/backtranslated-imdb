After reading the original drama, I thought it would be harder to adapt to the screen than it turned out. Donald McCann is a public gary, a great show for publicly publicly publicly publicly-publicly-publicly-public (publicly visible) public Emon Kelly also plays a wonderful "screwballs" that fit his wonderful feelings and the ability to communicate his feelings. <br /> If you can find it, be sure to rent. (Probably not available outside of Ireland & UK)
