I'm a friend of a homosexual friend, my wife and a friend of her friends. I have views from all directions. Mainly, the movie laughs at me, the sexual tension is not really and the only notable actors are Tudor Chirala and Maria Pope. Yes, I think that if the script is not correct, she would like her role better. There are good Romanian actors around, they are not just complicated characters. I entered the film's business venture. <br /> <br /> Wife has loved the movie, but I feel like there are trunks. I did not play and I had no ear. If the film attempts to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in present-day Romania, it has failed miserably. There are no consequences. <br /> <br /> Imagine that the girls are actually the boy and the girl, the same story becomes a boring, unpleasant plot. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the BAFTA awards are available. In my book, it should have earned the "Better Luck Next Time" award. (Bafta = Good luck in Romanian).
