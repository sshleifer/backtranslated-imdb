Hal Hart's influence in Adrianine Shelley's "I Will Take You There" is not public but is clearly related to her work (starring in Shelley Hartley's two films). Her feature film shows a very strong explanation, but the hyper-stylized and intense characters make the human emotions stupid in real light. The film is not contradictory to all (thanks to God), the small and delicate narrow pieces of pepper pointed to bitter facts in love and losses. From the beautiful cinematography and the seventh straight soundtrack, "I see you're there" is a great indie film that does not adhere to the subtlety when dealing with difficulties of love and human emotional reality. <Br /> <br /> The film begins with the life of the bill. He sold his beautiful friend Ray to a beautiful country house, but his wife Rose left him to join Ray in a recession. Until his sister Lucy (who portrays director Adrian Shelley), he brings all kinds of surprises: his self help book and the "date" to her responsible brother. <br /> The unwanted Bill tries to dismiss, but Bernice's sudden appearance at his door has not been selected. No doubt Bernstein's subtle attitude and ridiculous hairstyle at the beginning of her removes her "re-emergence" from her ability. Nevertheless, she finds her fake-hippie attributes for the first time. And Bernice has been forced into herself by attaching herself to her by her abusive comments. Until what end, we do not know ... unless she's mentally. <br /> <br /> Bill is unlikely to see Ross, Bernice offers his car, but he is in a position to take her somewhere forward. On the way, she grabbed the prisoner with her own gun (pinketone detective, not less). Bill and Bernice have found themselves on their way to Ray's and Rouse's home, leading to anxiety, resentment, liberation, hobbies and violence ... In the course, some routes will stop.
