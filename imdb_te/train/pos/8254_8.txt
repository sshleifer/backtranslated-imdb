In a middle class neighborhood in Villarard in the 1950s, this dark comedy is such an American unhappiness with gun mania and violence, materialism and janes, the fear of others, slavery, golf, and the dead. Yes, it's a bit heavy, but trust me, it's pretty light. <br /> <br /> You are famous for the role of zombies. The key questions arise, such as: a zombie (90% villard who choose this final route, but only 10% prefer the traditional funeral)? How many people do they have to flag their auctions like robots (who mark the social status)? And what is the range of possible relationships that can survive between living and rebirth and dead? <br /> <br /> Andrew Curi, co-author of the live-screen screenplay (with Robert Chomme and Dennis Heaton), puts this inconsequential material for an hour and a half, good laughter. A super-cast helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Kernney, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett lead young men with good young grownups with the help of young Kisun Ray, Timmy. (I do not know Mrs. Moss is such good comedian chops) <br /> <br /> Product design and music is a tea, probably not for everyone, it is definitely my annual Bizarro award There's a hard movie to dodge for, but intelligent comics that start to be funny since the beginning is the hardest hit in film making Alu achievements. For me, anyway, "Fido" is an egg! My classes: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (01/30/07 of the saw)
