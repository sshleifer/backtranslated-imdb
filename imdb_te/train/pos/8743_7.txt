A good movie with strong performances (especially two leads). The American girl is holding a 6 kilometer heroine at an airport in Thelia. They both thrown in jail and one of them suggests a confession. Bill Pullman plays a lawyer trying to get them. They want to make one of the two of the two girls nick parked in drugs. So far the original story (which has a lot of comparisons with a good return to heaven). <br /> <br /> The film is valuable to see the beautiful and beautiful photographs of Newton Thomas Sigel. 10 to 7.
