<br /> <br /> The voting average is very low, although the clerk in the video store feels that this is "correct", I do not have much estimates when renting the movie. <br /> <br /> On top, I enjoyed it very much. This is a lovely picture. It does not need to grow up on me, I enjoyed it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks gives a great performance in the lead role, and I feel quite different from his usual personality in his movie. <br /> <br /> Nockout jokes or something like that, but there are some rather hilarious scenes, and overall this is very pleasant and very easy to watch the movie. <br /> Very recommend.
