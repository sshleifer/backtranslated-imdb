Last night I saw only captivity and I liked what I saw. This is a very fun movie. Dulph bike looks great on his own, compared to his other recent films. He is in a very good shape. This story is good and other actors are serious. <br /> <br /> I am the best I will call you. <br /> <br /> But there are issues in it. Even though the first bullet was flying everywhere and they were eliminated at empty values, they missed the goal. Children would have to show that the bullets were a good way to escape. The other problem I have is the way to get students to swear. I know what school they can standardize in their school in advance and in class. The third issue is that the number of bad guys is very small. There must be more bad guys. The final issue looked cheesy to set the perfect set, but it was due to the small budget. Overall this film is a good movie. I enjoyed it. I would recommend to see others. PS Now I'm a DEAD beat cop. (Some one-liners are also cold) <br /> <br />
