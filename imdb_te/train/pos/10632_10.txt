This is a movie for fun; I did not think it was social commentary from a small picture of the world. I personally find this movie funny, adventurous, and memorable. It's a fantasy that is not a spoiled girl when it becomes a princess. I have included in the film that best experimented with the film about a sexy 70 years old. This film is not a homosexual or not, it's about love, it's all weird forms. The film is shown as a homosexual in the 70s in Hollywood or California. Pretty boys are being looked at not very pretty men. Women who are deeply locked in the emotional room or at risk of not being employed. Bathrooms are a part of gay community. <br /> Fantasy begins! Can we mix a lesbian one lesbian and add some alcohol and what are we doing? This film is better than the tedious Reado, "The Next Big Thing". <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in 70 years and it now brings a smile to my lips. I advise anyone who wants a funny, tender image - cut off with some popcorn and have some fun. Some people should come easily !!! <br /> <br /> You should do this with the film! <br /> <br />
