Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Clock have played their roles in such confidence, and I cried. The role of Glen Close as Ruth, she wants to deal with the situation, but she is dominated by her husband. Robert Duvall character Joe, strongly said "Let's think about what he does,". The story is characterized by an accidental death by a brother in a rural family called "The Stone Boy", which means he is very distressed and struggles to do what he has done, mentally paralyzed. Finally, Jason Presess's character, Arnold, left all of it for a stranger, and really thought about some of the terrifying things that I had in my life. I personally and with his character. Frederick Forres and Gail Young's characters did not add much to the film. Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's anti-feminist brother Andy, did nothing to help. His wife, Lou, played the role of Gail Youngs, was disappointed with his own problems with his own problems and was a silly-woman killing who blamed him for his problems. I can not really feel sorry for these two. Although Lou tried to continue her marriage, she did not succeed. Both did not solve their problems effectively. They really did nothing for the movie and were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Bramilly's little role as grandfather, is the only character he has shown to Arnold. I thought his character was elaborated. Players are doing just enough and fit what is fit. Ωστόσο, I really liked the end of the very end, so I actually smiled and cried the tears of joy. I am fine. Hilmarans are again a family. I really wanted to be a part of this family. They're very realistic.
