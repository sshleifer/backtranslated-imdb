Excellent film with great performances from Jack & Lochley. Most of their displeasure arrived at Garibaldi station (mine). (For Jerry Daley but in Seasons 4 & 5 I lost sympathy for this role.) It was not a long time to start criticizing Jack (I love all of the show) and take charge. I'm sure Jake has admitted. Especially when Jack believes in you in heaven, the Soulhunter plot is fascinating. Humor is good enough for it. 10/10
