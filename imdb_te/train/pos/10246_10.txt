This film should be my favorite of all time. It does not have to be a plot, because its manufacturers want people (Charlie Sheen, I think), I believe it is a real smile movie. It is an exercise in visual effects, and does not exist when acting like every other movie. Nowadays there are all about the sound effects of films, and the visuals produced by computers make it easier to deal with CGI blood. Still, there are still no film producers who do not have fake blood. There is no rape scene in this film. Hills have 2 eyes? Rape scenery is funny rather than stunned. While I'm sure there are some GONZO porn movie makers who tried romantic marriage with horror. But they make films and they probably will not be able to remove it. <br /> <br /> "Baiis Mai" has a vulgar rape scene, because actresses are actually sexually appealing and they all show up even though the film is full of sucks. It's all about the money, especially when talking about an AO or NC-17 rating. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make her hostel image range much better, but he has reduced it to get a very R rating ... or I hope his films are absorbed by these limits. <br /> You see Death or more than smashed pumpkins if you want any frills real footage (risk & crime scenes / footage). Do not forget that the film was built in 1985. It is true that the film is still standing against the worst. 8bit Super Mario Brothers will be someone who talks suck because the PS3 has good graphics.
