I went looking for this movie in the general fan-siege. I wanted to check it out. I do not think so many. After all, is a musician, an actor and a screenplay writer? It is impossible for a person to live in a single person. Right ?? <br /> <br /> Observer aside, it has become one of my favorites! The storyline and characters are hyped by Hollywood special effects. This story loses your emotions and pulls you along. Go through the credits and find out that you are suddenly wiping out to the end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, acting is quite a bit above. I believe, however, that it is appropriate to the comic intent and the role. Otherwise, I can not imagine the level of acting I have seen. <br /> It is worth watching more than once. <br /> <br /> "I would recommend this movie, feel free to leave with your doubts, I'm sure you will find a place on the shelf.
