I really enjoyed this movie. Acting by adult actors was great, but I found the main kid a little bit harder. But he brought him well for a new talent. Humor is very amazing and not in your face as much as the Hollywood comedy junk. I.E. The Nutty Professor. If you have little attention and are used in simple Hollywood topics, you can not like this because it's a bit slower. I chose it on the Blu-ray and I should say the image quality is top notch. Perhaps one of the blue-rays I've seen so far is one. Extras are very good. They have been removed quite a bit, but this is good because most of the deleted scenes are not really added.
