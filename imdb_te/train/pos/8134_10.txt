. . . It's just as good. Kundif's remarkable ear for music and dialogue achieved a great deal of greatness. The hip-hop has distorted the self-important self-confidence of the posiors. The group "Nigzaz with Tots" (NWH) is every rap group you have ever heard and completely self-parodied. Wardrobe is unbelievable. Buy OOP soundtrack if you can.
