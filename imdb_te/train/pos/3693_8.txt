It's not easy to make the story with 18 stories easier. While 18 different international directors have taken this challenge, not all of them are good, some of them are boring. But in his organization, "Paris, G Tome" is breathtaking, as "Love Aschacham", especially in Love, "Love is All". <br /> <br /> 18 swaps - a frustrating initial array type, not really unique about it. One person finds a parking space, many odd couples looking through walking, thinking about why he could not find a girl. <br /> <br /> Quyes de Sain - Another dull scene, three teenage boys, while searching for some 'donkey', suddenly the girls are going to get help from one of the boys in their front. In fact, the basic, but with a sweet heart. <br /> <br /> Les marais - this is very disappointing! A love story between two boys with a garden background may be of interest to the great Van Sant. Finally, everything that comes after Monolazi is good by Ulill, which is just annoying before. <br /> <br /> Tulares - Cohen Brothers is an entertaining sequel. Basemi - without a word - mesmerizing and the whole scene is just happy. <br /> <br /> Laine do 16IEME - Although the death penalty is poor, the heart is there. . This is the story of a Hispanic woman who removes her baby early in the morning to take care of another suburb child. <br /> <br /> Porte de Chios - This segment is tight and weird from the whole movie. Shampoo sells some sort of vendor in Paris to Chinatown-Lookule. I understand that, the story is about interior beauty, but I'm wrong. <br /> Bottle - really amazing sequence. A man meets with his wife to meet with his wife, so he can flee with his mistress. But the wife has some devastating news. Pretty basic, but really sad and beautiful! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - A sad order as well. Juliet Binohe as a mourning mother. One night, she listened to her dead child. When she arrived at the site, a cowboy told her last time that she would pay her last. One of the best sections! <br /> <br /> "The original and great scene, one of the best of the film! A little girl and an elderly to their future and one person Quereier DES ENFANTS ROUGES - An American actress (Gyllenhall) falls in love with her drug dealer again with a beautiful segment again, with a very sad ending with PLACE DES FEES - Hello homeless man comes up, he begins to speak of her romance ... because she is the love of her life. <br /> <br /> A boring order between Piglet - Order and Hoskins, who are looking for new thrills in their relationship ... < br> <br /> <br /> <br /> Quetter de la Madelineine - bringing some variation in the movie, QdlM relief, a young man (Wood) find a vampire who killed a victim Do not fall in love ... Dark, scary and weird romance, Madeleine brilliant. <br /> <br /> Pare-lachy - Another Let-Down Segment, directed by Ways Craven and stars like Mortimer and Sewell It may be great, but the Pare-Lauchy is not original, the original is not original. <br /> <br /> FAUBOURG St-Denis-Rumors TRUE, Twyker's short film is beautiful, wonderful and well done. A blind man swears the phone and breaks her from her girlfriend (Portman - really amazing). <br /> <br /> Quartet Latin - Although this section is co-directed by DPDD, this segment has been largely excessive despite having stars such as Rowlands, Gazzar and DPD. <br /> 14th ARRONDISSEMENT - The last scene is hilarious and sad at the same time. An American tells of his trip to Paris in his French class. She finds French is really terrible, but at the end of the segment, Paris finds much more than the eye. <br /> <br /> In the background, "Paris, Jay Toom" ends in a sweet tone, not all of me drop me out, although some sections get frustrated from hell, the part of the film is great! The real cinematic experience for young and old. Paris, Jay Totem Dress Up!
