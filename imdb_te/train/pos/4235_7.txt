.... after 16 years Tim Burton finally disappointed me !!!! What happened to the old Burton reading "The Dark Knight Returns" for Frank Miller's research to direct Batman in 1983-89? Burton does not investigate the Book of Buckton or the reason for the film is that he has got everything wrong! This movie sucks! It is not original, it does not act as the original thing. If you want a good monkey image is real. <br /> <br /> From the stars ****
