William Powell starred in "The Ex-Smriti Bradford" and co-starred with former wife Wife, Jean Arthur, Eric Blow and James Gleason. It is revealed that Powell met with chemistry and was aware of what team he was in. Although he and Merna Lai are a perfect screen couple, the actor has a good effect with other "thin man" type films, with Ginger Rogers and Arthur. <br /> <br /> A witty, Debnoyear professional and Poor as "The X-Smita Bradford" is not exhausted, no exception. Former mrs. B Mr. B worked again with a subman for the residence and then goes back to helping him solve a mystery that dragged her down. And this is not the first time she made her! It was originally intended for a "Bradford" feature film or the first in the series - although Mr B was the author of his secret-writer who was constantly bringing him in the cases. During this time, a favorite horse race horse riding a horse drops secretly from the horse and dies before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The solution to this case is tremendous but the point is beside the point. Point is the banter between the couple and the former Mrs' interference. B. Jean Arthur is very cute and very funny in his role. However, with the act of the brain as Arthur, humor is intentional rather than conscious. I suspect Carole Lombard's absurd side - say, the author has something in mind. When Arthur heard that police came, she said, "Oh, I'm looking forward to catching the police on my death," says Ross. It still works well, and it shows how to make a good part of the episode. <br /> <br /> William Powell and Jean Arthur have always been greatly appreciated.
