Warning: Light spoilers. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith's story stands as an amazing move in American history and world history. The film portrays the events of life in the life of Joseph Smith, Mormons as a prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on earth. <br /> <br /> Joseph first appeared in the Smiths Brothers trilogy (Alvin, Haram & Joseph), a very young age that requires an operation. Operation made without our advanced facilities, bloody and difficult. This scene helped Smith bond between bonds and brothers and the bond between Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> Joseph's religious chaos and the first prayer of Mormons are the first prayer, called the first prayer. Jesus' face has never been shown, but you will see the clear nail marks in his hands. The rejection of religious leaders and many of his young New York community were emotionally reduced by Joseph's marriage. <br /> <br /> The film does not clearly identify the history of the history of the Mormon Church, but only the scene. It's not a criticism - just a note about style. <br /> <br /> The film is simultaneously portraying the joy and growth of Mormonism as a baby church, At the same time, there is an ever-increasing opposition to local governments. <br /> <br /> The film shows several scenes in the life of Joseph, in which some of the beautiful moves with Emma have her. Joseph is attempting to show a deep and complexity, including his wife, his intellect, dirty and dangerous opposition, his religious feelings, and his courage in the face of his compassion, to show the depth and complexity of his life. <br /> <br /> Joseph and Hrrey Karthagage, all the characters from the film, come back home to return home alive, help them strengthen them <br /> In the end, Joseph and Harram's martyrdom Filmmakers have been shot to see the events that they have seen. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie, but I thought I would introduce Joseph Smith to church members. I do not think the film is done. Yet I hope the film can do that. As Insider, the film is a celebration of Joseph and I have greatly supported the good things already known about him. <br /> <br /> Let's see how many people look out for the movie - do they see a campaigner, an epic story of American clerics or something else? <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully portrayed, family friendly, moving and, hopefully, good for everyone. In fact, these events in the United States are interesting to read in the light of the many facets of our culture - religious expression and respect for religion (commonly) - we have granted modernity.
