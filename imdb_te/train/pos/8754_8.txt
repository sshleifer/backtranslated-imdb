I saw this movie 11 years ago with my best friend friend. <br /> <br /> I have removed my verdant teeth because I do not feel so good. <br /> I love big time. This is a tough watch if you take into consideration that friendship, unwanted betrayal, power, money, drug traffic, and serious difficulties in a foreign prison. <br /> Acting is at its core level. I'm laughing at two women very quickly and that's a good thing. Claire Danes is always beautiful and lovely while Kate Beckinsale offers a very hot and good show. Bill Pullman is also the greatest and performs his journalistic qualities. <br /> <br /> There are many stories of twists to dig out of it and to gain an interesting visual feel. It shows the hardest time in Thailand. <br /> This is an unexpected movie. There are not many films like this in recent history. It should make you reflex about so many things ...
