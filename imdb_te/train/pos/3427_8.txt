This film illustrates the most terrible part of the existence and memories. Many soldiers, men and women returned home, and the real issues could be the start. I remember about my father and his brothers coming back from World War II. My uncles were never for a battle. He disclosed the D-Day invasion, saving Private Ryan's first 20 minutes. He remembered him but he was tortured. Many of my cousins ​​and his sons were also alcoholic. In a different battle in a different country, the soldiers go over the age of 60, and the soldiers will have the result. When I look at it at the KC FilmFest, I remind you that there are some people who have never ever been killed. Emotional abuse is not what happened in Iraq, especially if you are against the war, the soldiers are more compassionate, where they try to do what is right or wrong. <br /> <br /> The tag line from the Vietnam War film Platoon says. "The First Custardity of War Innocence."
