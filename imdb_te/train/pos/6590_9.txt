"Invisible Man" is a fictional art direction of "Furscape" and sometimes the melodramatic script with an obscure, cynical plot and modern noire dialogues, and in 2000 the "intensified man" in the general lineup of Science-Pie. The program sat on the meter of "Law and Order" and "Doctor Who", but did not deny the fact that the "i-man" characters had gone beyond the sarcasm. The characters also retire from formulaic in the speculative as Keeper, Official, and Ebert. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Vendresca created a chemistry, which became pretty and was made even more brilliant by the writer and the rotating door team. The plot is never allowed to kill the plot, and science is sometimes not completely reliable. The show's low points are still entertaining, and I've never seen such tat pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Science Fiction have to surrender, and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD edition of the show. Every time I meet in a marathon of "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" in Science Fiction, the sadness and opportunity of science fiction television, my eyes and sighing, "invisible person" and its reflection represent.
