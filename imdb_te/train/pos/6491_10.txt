World War I was perhaps the greatest documentary of all time. Historical research is almost flawed. Even after a quarter century, it is the most accurate and accurate documentary about WW2. Precious historic work with interviews with the most important and attractive people in the battlefield. I would recommend that I enjoy a good practice.
