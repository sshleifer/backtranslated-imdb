This was always my favorite since it was first seen as a 12-year-old child in 1962 when I was shown on the Los Angeles Television Station's "Last Performance". The character of Mose Hart, the playwright / producer / director wrote this story and the first presented on the New York stage in WWII - its presentation The reason for rejection is that much after more than 50 years Clearly it will be). I have not seen the film for more than 30 years if anybody who is a major actor in the film could get me a "illegal" copy of VHS (poor quality video quality, but good audio). That's my memory right: it is still attractive and attractive image to see. Major stars, or at least well known and fully employed actors (eg Judy Holiday, Bon Nelson, Dan Taylor, Carl Malden, Peter Lindh Hes, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cab, Kevin McCarthy, and Gary Merrill). The scenes with B-24 librators are excellent, especially close-up shots, heavily (at times) 4-engine bombers (then 18,000+ were made and are now almost extinct). A good insight at various levels of training (a course of gender-biased in daily life: just as MEN pilots, just women support their roles - is rarely acceptable in today's world) in the course of a pilot-cadet bombers trainings. I hope it will release in the video to enjoy a new generation.
