I have seen this film for a while, after which I ordered my friend, a big Dominic Mogaghan Fan. The film is very interesting, though it has its positive content, which I do with Donny Darco kind of "wtf?" <br /> <br /> However, negative points also come with positive results. To me, the little girl in the film is very good, and Dominic Monaghan has done a good job. Unfortunately, I do not have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played the role of Loney. It's only me, I do not claim to be a serious critic, I am unable to adequately master, but he was not convinced as an actor. <br /> While I am not a critic, it attracts my attention. It's interesting, confusing, and you should see it.
