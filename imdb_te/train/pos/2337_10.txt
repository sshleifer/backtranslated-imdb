The show received complimentary critiques and praised the "pushing daisies" style and those who perceive no similarities were stolen. (Yes, I've seen "Amelie" "pushing daisies" somewhat similar but still enough to be original). However, there are very few shows on TV that have this kind of agility attraction. The great similarity is "Dead Like Me", but "P.D" is honestly similar to this: Bryan Fuller created two shows. <br /> <br /> The two shows have a "dead" young man, for example). This performance has never been so funny and lovely, and it is always odd and consistent humanity. <br /> Meetings of the ongoing storyline. Some people complained that there was no moral center in this show because the first (and several subsequent) episodes were causing Chuck's father's death without any consequences. First, it should be a new definition without "any consequences", since Ned was a boy and he realized that he was responsible for the death of Chuck's father, and he realized he was guilty of what he did. In addition, about a dozen episodes in the series, Ned admitted his father's death to his death. Now, there is no police to charge people who die from people by bringing back the rest of their lives, so there is no question of redemption and limitations without social responsibility. In other words, anytime between Ned and Chucks to postpone Ned. <br /> This refers to a problem with continuous stories in network dramas. I recall that David Kuroso's role in "NYPD Blue" made some mistake and it was the whole year - he was caught and resigned from the job and left the show. The point is that viewers can now learn and do not think that one episode in one simple role will do something and that does not feel that he is caught in that episode. Next week and maybe next year too.
