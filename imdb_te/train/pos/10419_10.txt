I agree with MR. Karuso Jr Lanza, s only one of the American Caruso had to offer the best voice god if he found the courage to go on holiday Hollywood and head for opera everyone told him that he could have been but in no case it has excellent access to the art form and thus its gonna is. Mr Lanza still look at the picture you'll see why my house is also debating. Someone Pavarotti claims to be the MARIO LANZA.As for this movie, it should be on DVD and they should be restored and VHS is not good, but it should be the only Lanza movie featured in DVDs, boring.
