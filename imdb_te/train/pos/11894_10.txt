At twists, astonished and terrified by giblets, wrestles with mattresses, a really adorable heroine that runs full into closed doors ... 'My Naked Truth' are some of mysterious moments in my memory. I was impressed with this presentation: Happy Daft Plots and some good supporting characters set for the diamond of the show - Tea Leoni, 'Nora Wild'; Beautiful, clown, and amazingly hazardous bandwidth - How the clown refreshed to see an actress - no wonder Hollywood did not know how to cast her. But where are the oh-WHERE DVD releases? All they are releasing (sleep), it is my belief that this little gem is going to burial. (If someone makes a mistake, please correct me.)
