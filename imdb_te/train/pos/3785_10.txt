This image is too small. It is highly fictional, creative and intelligent. It's just plain fun and tops the top one of this movie in my opinion. When this came first, the film forgot and did not care much after years passed. "Bill & Teds Bogus Journey" also made bomb attacks at the box office, the first one was pretty good hit and very popular. <br /> <br /> The film was released just a couple of years late. In 1991, Bill and Ted was already "80s". Though 80 years were only two years old at that time, the scene of children's music and style became stronger with gangsta rap, hip hop, pearl jam, nirvana, grunge and seattle sound. Their 'Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N Roses had gone missing with Bill and Ted's' 80s style and was outdated in the 91st, and the film was a big reason for boxing at the box office. No one but surfers are still "amazing!" And "bogus!" Started in 1991. "Gremlins 2 at the beginning of the 90s" faced a similar act as a good film bombing at the box office because it was associated with the 80s. The transition from the '90s to the 90s and' 400s has changed very rapidly now. Although not in 1991, 1988 or 1989, it looks like 2002, and last year in 2001 and 1995 or 1996. <br /> <br /> "Excellent adventure" created in 1988, instead of 1989, and "Bogus Journey" quickly and released in 1989, which was probably the first seriously.
