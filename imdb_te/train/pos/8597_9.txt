I enjoyed this movie. A Secret Service Agent was badly and involved in a murder - I thought it was an amazing political thriller about something I had never done before. Unfortunately, for the role of Michael Douglas, "Pete Garrison," he was a mole but he was not. <br /> He is just a morally flawed agent dealing with the First Lady! As he does so, he suspects a number one when he realizes that he has not been able to produce an acceptable polygamy test and a plot to kill the president. <br /> <br /> "Garyson" lam but at the same time he still protects the president trying to do the right thing. Douglas works in this role. I do not care for people he's playing but he is a wonderful actor. Kiefer Sutherland ("David Bricenzed") is equally good (at least here) convinced by the fact that he is a fellow SS boss who hunts Douglas. When he finds them, and finally working together, if that could be done, stop it. Crooks are also very interesting. Also, I never - and never will, unfortunately - look a first lady that looks good like Kim Bezinger <br /> <br /> This is just a slick action movie that entertains the end from the beginning. Are there holes? Of course; Maybe many of them, and one reason you see the most complex comments. However, it is unfair here. It's not just clever enough for intellectuals here on this website. My advice: Cool, just go along with the ride and enjoy all the action and conspiracy. Yes, Rambo-Ish gets a little late but will receive more marks for entertainment ... that means everything is in the movies.
