Personally I really loved this movie, and this was mainly moved to me. The two main actors gave us great shows, and ultimately the heart beat to find out what happened to their characters finally. <br /> <br /> The alchemy between Barbra Streisand and Chris Christopher is awesome, and the song is just a great way. <br /> <br /> When I realized that I won 5 Golden Globe Awards (the most prestigious Golden Globes), Oscar and Grammy were not surprised. This film deserves to be seen as anyone who has a classic. Often criticized is a great movie (perhaps, "co-director", if the stream was killed to take part in it). Her artistry is too big, and it will surely meet you!
