Unusual image from Ringo Lam and praises to a little less. Fantasy Kung-Fu mixture driven by a more realistic description of swords and spears, especially in the first ten minutes. A horse rider is cut in two, and his waist and legs ride the horse. Many horses are crumbled. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers were arrested in a red lotus temple holding a crescent maniac general. In the apocalypse Now, Kurtz has a similarity to the Kurtz, who hears the betrayed philosophy and makes frightening images of human blood. <br /> <br /> The product looks great and the setting is very tragic. Blood is everywhere. This action is very good and is more intact than most HK Action scenes from time to time. Sometimes the film is experiencing absurdity or effects, but it's never bad to destroy the movie. <br /> <br /> Find it, this is one of the best HK Kung Fu films from the early nineties. Remember that it is not child friendly.
