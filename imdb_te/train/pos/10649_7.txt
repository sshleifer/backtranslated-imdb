What can I say about it? This is another Hollywood horror film with a very high budget ($ 80 million). It's scary and gives us some thrills and really creepy sequences. Special effects and nothing more. Catein Zeta-Jones is as beautiful as ever, Lily Taylor is also a good actress. The structure of the Hill House is awesome, all the memorials, statues, furniture ... delicious! I do not like it but it's too sweet because it's out. Check it out and make your own impression on it.I give this picture from 10 to 10.
