This is still the best performance ever after having spent 14 years on this show. The writing is the 1st class and the product is none second. This exhibition will never be made today and this is an insult. I hope if you're thinking about watching this show. <br /> That day I left high school. That is my favorite TV program x files. AG The better method is with good writing but has one reason? Another example is that it's not only a single event to get in only one season but it's another example (spin off x files) that it has a good line up and it's good writing and funny but also just a season. This is not correct! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br 10 me.
