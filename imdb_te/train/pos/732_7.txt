I finally got into the Rock 'n' Roll High School nearly 30 years after the midnight movie sensation in 1979 (I'm Latecomer, I'll probably see a new documentary this summer: "Dream of Life" for a while around 2040!) No, the movie does feel a bit dating, and yes, worth the wait It's great power comedy, it's loads of great music and These are surprising moments of the story of Riff Randall, formerly starred by PJ Souls and her and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi against their new oppression principal, Miss Togar ("Cult Mews" is certainly more accurate in his book "Cult Movies" Wornov's performance was described as "evil eve-odden"). A typical teens versus establishment store Here's a few dubious humor (that explosive mice, mouse, hansel and Gretel hall monitors) and some really exciting tunes.Riff, in fact, is the # 1 fan of the original punk band The Ramones, and five of its musical explosions, A baker dozen band recipes of great songs. In fact, the unhappy dancing to "Teenage Lobotomy" at Blowte could be the film's funniest moment. Joey, Johnny, Dee and Marke were originally seen in their Ramonesmobile, and then the street songs "I Just Wanna Have Something to Do" was a pleasure to do. The film ends with an explosion of confrontation, and I imagine every high school kid's wet dream. Really fun things. On one hand note, Ramones is one of the longest bands I've ever seen in the concert, so it's great to note that the DVD for this movie comes with optional English subtitles for weakness. There's no need for aging punks this subtitles found, I wonder ....
