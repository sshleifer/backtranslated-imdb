In 1988, I saw "The Rony and Nancy Show" for the first time (in Austrian television). At that time, I was already the biggest fan of Spitting Image (after the bronze defeat of the Montreux Film Festival in 1986). Of course I recorded and recorded every episode of the tape - especially "Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember the scene when Ronnie was standing before a painting of Abraham Lincoln (thinking it was a mirror) and said, "I need to shave." <br /> <br /> It's one of the TV-shows that has always been exciting and highly intelligent - such as the shame that the spitting image will fall into Oblivion, but all too amusing, the ball with his dog. This is absolutely the best when compared to other satirical broadcasts. <br /> <br /> Around 20 years have passed since then and I'll see the show again. Can anyone buy it ... somewhere?
