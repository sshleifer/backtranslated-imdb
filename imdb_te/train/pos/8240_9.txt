I'm also for the premiere in Toronto. This film gave me a comfort when I thought I could not do my first choice. Well, I completely blown away. By the time I came to the theater, I was able to remember the main plot in the film (yes, actually I also forgot) from the whole cast to the smallest of enthusiastic performances. Kari-Anne Mose is the greatest departure from her days when excavated. For Billy Connolly, I think the Chaplin actor played so brightly without lines. Children are also great. <br /> And, by the way, I had to look at my first option - and this was a good way.
