<br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and have seen the other night for the first time. I've been a fan of Tolkien's fans for about 4 years now, from High School. In this film I did not grow ... perhaps my mother kept me away. It's not perfect for children. It's not bad in a graphic sense, but if the themes go over the age of 10 years. Overall, the animation was excellent in 1978/1979. I thought this story was well read in loose sense. But I'm not worried that Bash has talked about another 40 minutes or the King's returns on the Return. That's the final film. I'm not bothered by its sudden end, then I hear the Return of the King inhaling, I'm not bothered yet. This is not a great animated film. This may have been a high vote from me. I'll give it 7. I only hope that Peter Jackson will do justice to the new Live Action LOTR.
