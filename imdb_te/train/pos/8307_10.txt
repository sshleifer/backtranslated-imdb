Tessa's vocal performance is amazing !! Tessa played the role of female singer while in Richard Club. When she first entered the stage, Riff and Stuff started her stuff, which shook my soul. Her voice platinum. She should make a CD. She has more fans, then she learns. I liked her performance retention in five heart beat, which she co-starred with Leon when she was younger. How can a little girl make a voice too big. She is really amazing. Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Voice Invoice Voice Invoice Wonderful Voice Excellent voice, back shaking, crying tear, up lifting up, days will take you back in voice. If you read this commitment, take my advice and start recording a CD. Just love singing, but not for your fans only. I hope you can really do this. This is one of the other single studio singers hit look, lol.
