Seven pounds actors Ben Thomas Smith Will, Will IRS Collection Agent, have a cryptic intention to meet the backward people of their tax payments. Thomas is talking to his phone and the death of seven people who are driving in the film, for which his attempt, for which he tries to forgive him, is not a forgiven crime. <br /> <br /> The story line is a greenhouse window with a brick. You are sure what you're looking for - the titanic ending is surprising compared to seven pounds. <br /> In general, I'm in full Bad Boys mode like Wil Smith. When he was driving in Ford's GT while trying to deal with it, he was the best when he was playing a gun that was trying to get him to Oscar, for he was disappointed. This is probably because the film is not anticipated, where he is very poor. There are comics flashes but they are nonsensical, in fact the performance of Will Smith, which I have ever seen so far, is remarkable and alone for that reason he should be nominated for an outstanding and ridiculous main prize. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is all grand - Rosario Dawson overall picture and all other bit players of Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper are fine. <br /> <br /> Overall it does not give you any other choice of crying but throw all the regular cliches and sentimental violin that cry. There are times when my hard heart broke too. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to find one of the situations that do not relate to your own life. <br /> I'll give you 8/10. Will Smith moves in dramas without all the despair of Happiness Pursuit and it all comes out better.
