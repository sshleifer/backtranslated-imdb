One of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history began. At the end of the seventies and early 80s, members of the Summer of Love culture in Love Studio ultimately achieved old love for love beads and night parties, and this meant the rise of mainstream life. For those who are unable to develop their youth and sometimes irrational development, their Wonderland culture. The idea of ​​love and right of drugs along with an unhappiness for power, values ​​and "establishment" captures the film world. <br /> <br /> The sixties were the time of revolution and violent changes. After the war ended, we had to face after all the carnage. The characters in the Wonderland home are the symbols of the Seventies' Misfits; Part biker, part hippie, part crook, all happened. There is no ideology for expressing discontent with each and everyone who is not loyal. Ron, Billy and David prefer themselves to a kind of Robin Hoods Dope. They talk about love and behave violently; They were misleading people from the rich. They stole it from everybody. <br /> <br /> Labs and the company are the final result of the weird technique of bizarre collisions in matters such as sex and drugs and rock and roll. <br /> <br /> The film is directed and directed and binds the frenetic world of drug fans in their elements. The fact that Holmes is a romantic actor is irrelevant. The story is told in "Boogie Nights". This is a transitional and unforgettable story.
