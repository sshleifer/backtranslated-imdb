This is one of the few films that I think is an improvement in the original film. The story is clear, accessible, amusing and interesting and musical numbers are without exception. I'm the 'old home guard' and the beautiful 'Portobello Road', the great combination of animation + realistic technicians with the wheel. <br /> <br /> It is not neglected when the background of World War II has been working well and is a feature film, often in 'evacuee' stories. <br /> <br /> The most frequently underestimated picture is the pleasure of people of all ages. The performances of the cast were exceptionally well done and the entire lesson was well crafted and well designed. Guaranteed to keep smile on your face!
