I never saw it on TV but I immediately rented the DVD via Netflix as it was available. I have high expectations, and do not despair. It's funny, and the animation is amazing. Quality level I only imagined from feature films, so I'm just wondering about bad comments on it. Maybe DVD release animation has been improved? A bonus for DVD, it is fun to see two versions of the pilot. I'm an adult, it really appreciates the older ones. It's not just kids who love beautiful animated characters. It's not somewhere close to some sued, but I can not want some parents to see their children. I was disappointed that this was canceled. I will produce more episodes. Or maybe an image.
