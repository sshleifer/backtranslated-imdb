These 9 years after the last episode broadcast, I am still writing, the effect of wildlife still exists. <br /> <br /> Many other police plays have been lost and have been successful. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to say We are losing this series, instead we are stupid. <br /> <br /> Wildlife has retained the specialty of Sydney and I am really indebted to this wonderful series. <br /> <br /> This amazing piece of their television history Streliya ones, so to be released on DVD in the full range of ABC, I ask, is not the first three. Give this series deserves.
