This is a difficult thing for the audience of the RTC Lischt audience. They try to write this sort of lynch's meaningless, dirty, side-by-side work. Crossing the gas between real pieces of Lynch film art. <br /> It may be a fart, but you are one of those witty farts that are confused with it and you are embarrassed to agree to enjoy it. What do you do with the things in modern life, but smile at it. If you take it hard you will go nuts. Feel the hook, smell, taste, enjoyed feelings, and its inaccurate intelligence, and then express it in any medium you choose. Art is art, and art is not dumb. But it's Dumbland.
