<br /> <br /> Your second favorite is Kim Novak, the third film with picnic. <br /> <br /> They are the best of all, Vertigo, great. <br /> <br /> They came to Pixicic for a movie in Kansas, Prairie, near me at Salina, Kansas. <br /> <br /> The musical score of Bell, Book and Candle is one of Alex North's. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak, this comedy made fun of how to dramatically contradict. <br /> You are Kim Novak. Greta Garbo in my youth.
