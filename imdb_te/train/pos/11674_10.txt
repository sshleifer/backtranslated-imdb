Plan parts are a bit dull, but it is very fun to see when they reach the desert. The reason I call it a very realistic reality show is that, quite surprisingly, Charlie has fallen out of the race relatively. When his hands were sore, I guess I had normal stress and a miracle fix, but instead he really left the race. There is a time when there is a lot of concern in this event when it's caught up in the Max Desert without water or food! The ending is great and is very happy to see at least one of the band. Overall, the long way is not as great as the round, but the most interesting watch is a peak for the most challenging race in the world.
