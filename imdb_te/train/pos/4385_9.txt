What about a blacksmith, a very nihilist, and an occasionally superhuman image? I can not say 'sympathetic' .. I am the 'glamorous' villains in cinematic history, and the best knife fight Flynn and Fairbanks are in their worries? This is epic about a stubborn, sometimes crazy, fight for freedom against the brawl and outrage of a very courageous and sincere person. I liked it. John Hurt and Tim Roth are great villains. Jessica Lange is a very moving, soft, and sensual.
