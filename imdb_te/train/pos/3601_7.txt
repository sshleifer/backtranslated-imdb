Michel Rodriguez is an actress who defines herself as a charging force for looking for other actresses. She has the courage to keep herself in the tough-gall character of her career (and pulls it out), which is a significant feature. <br /> <br /> Although her characters portrayed her role in the Pogonhole Hole, the film is designed for her tough story. <br /> <br /> Her character is a romantic student / fighter / lover, slightly overdone in the film ... but by a girl. <br /> <br /> The factor of the film is not very original, but the story turns into this deep deeper, hot girlfriends dealing with this girl, who comes to a toilet, and an actress who plays the filmmaker in a movie, and I'm glad that I am getting the original twist in Hollywood. 7 people came from me because of the average story of Gotto youth, but this is a great actress who plays a rare role in a low budget film. Great work.
