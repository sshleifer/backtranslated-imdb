What a powerful and attractive general quality image is possible. This film tells the story of the scenes every day, in which the hidden tragedy is hidden. It is true that Hollywood has mentioned this in special effects, extreme emotions and outstanding weather conclusions and the fact that others have forgotten that the essence of any realistic story has been forgotten by the usual reality. Most of these characters do not represent much of the word, rather than the word dialogue. In contrast to two brothers, I am very happy about the film, both as a child and as an expressive expression, but both have been able to induce deep emotions. The older brother needs to say as little as he says, it's in his mask face! Beautiful cinematography, excellent acting, great direction! Tappipokudadu!
