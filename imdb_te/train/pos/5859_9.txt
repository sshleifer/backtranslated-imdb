This cool Marvel Superhero game gives proper attention to being true to comics. In all the marvel superhero games that are weaker with graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improves in both fields. <br /> <br /> Spider-Man is the voice of Stan Lee as you would expect Spider-Man. He does more than spin wheels. In fact, he uses them as weapons and defense. Although he does not use the web in the fight, he is also punches and kicks. Spidy completes his hands, some named Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Dr. Octopus. <br /> <br /> Many levels are challenging, but some of them need patience. The only complaint about this game is that it's too short and completed in less than three hours. If you're a true Marvel superhero fan, do not expect this game to be for you but long gameplay. Better Luck "Spiderman 2." My guess: 10 to 9.
