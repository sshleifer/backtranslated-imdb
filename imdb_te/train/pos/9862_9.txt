Finally I came to see the infamous "Ice Age". Apart from seeing the amazing teaser I'm not as dead as funny as I'd expect a bad word to say about it. Definitely, it is not as attractive as a Disney product (additionally, it is Fox's 1st attempt at the full length CG movie) but it's a huge heart and in some cases (we saw him in the eyes of Manfred) But when they reunite that child with his father I can no longer hold them. A narrative of a fine line and cliche that has no difficulties on the stripe and is more than just the best of it; The end result is one of the most touching animated creations I have ever seen. Great funny looking characters that make you grow (and great voice talent as well) will make the film more than enough reason to give it a go, especially with very funny memorable scenes on behalf of Scrat. <br /> <br /> I can not get it honestly, but for some reason CG animation looks like it's taking the top in the future. . But if it just means there will be more movies like this (and who forget the pixar creations) then I do not mind, at least now. 9/10
