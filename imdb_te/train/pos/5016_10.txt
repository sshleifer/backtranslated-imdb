This film is one of my favorites. Why is it difficult to explain. Perhaps it was his innocence of the innocence of Corin Nemak and the crazy polo's boldness, but it was definitely a soundtrack. Moreover, some of the characters have smaller grooves or moves or movements and are fun in them. Finally, the story is always one of the tugs in my heart, and the last scene is so bittersweet. Overall, I love this film; It's perfect for a goo, sentiment beauty jar.
