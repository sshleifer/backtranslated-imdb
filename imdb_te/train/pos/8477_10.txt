<br /> <br /> The movie is one of my favorites of childhood, and I recently remembered and wanted to see it. Many details are not clear in my mind, I have spent a lot of years feeling the whole picture given to me. <br /> <br /> The children are adults and sometimes violent themes, and I highly recommend this film. It taught me a lot about life and death, and brought me a lot of emotion. To date, this is one of my favorite films.
