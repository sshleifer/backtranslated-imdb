The best of seven Sam Fuller movies I saw (Park Row, Arrow's Run, Verbitten!, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and The Picture), The Pickup Best Picture on South Street Noirs. Fuller refers to it at its most controlled. I love him when he's not in control, but almost everything in the pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark steals some microfilms, intended to go to Communist spy. Jean Peters is playing a woman for her boyfriend portrayed by Richard Kiley. Peters need to find the vidMark and get it back. She finds him through a feather pigeon played by Thelma Ritter. Wider and Peters are attracted to each other, and Peters believes (and the fact that she is working for Communists, the Cold War is very interesting). The love story is made to be a little quicker and completely unreliable, but it does not harm the film (Fuller's previous movie Park Park). Richard Widmark is great. It should be one of his best roles, but I'm not very familiar with his career, I can definitely say. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional echo, and her final scene from the movie sinks to find out what's going on in the movie. I will never forget. 10/10.
