Peter Falk's Oscar-Caliber appearance in the Oscar-carrier-written role. I have loved a long and balanced quest for a long time - how often do the movies end up when the boy & girl usually comes along? This is a picture for adults, a complex view through the eyes of all parties - husband, wife, son - how to meet each other in the past and grow during the story. On top of that, this gave me about 10 big bald laughs, and one of the most commonly anonymous users when I was smiling the rest of the audience. This is one of the few really funny movies I've ever seen. Great, original jokes.
