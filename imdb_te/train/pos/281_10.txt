This game is really great and very challenging. It has a great, horror story line and the graphics are also very good. I would recommend this game to all fans of horror and there is a lot of grip from the beginning to finish. <br /> <br /> The only problem with this game is that I only like more weapons and just me. <br /> <br /> Really great game for fans of RPG and Shoot'em'up.
