I was treated to watch the cracker bag last night before preview screening of Disney's Holes. I do not know what I decided to show it but I am very happy. Australia's snapshot is an absolute gem at the beginning of the 80s by the cracker bag full of children. "Dialogues" between Eddie and her brother are very happy and with the rest of the movie, they are very real to life. It reminded me of my own childhood when each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia (the director would be a little helpful at the same age) and increased the concept of audio. I only hope to see the cracker bag again a few days later.
