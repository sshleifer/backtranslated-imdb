"California" is a great movie to look at. The great cast for the film, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, A River Runs Through It and The Legends of the Fall) is the first Grace, David Duchovini (The X Files)), Carrie Laughlin, Brian's girlfriend and Juliet Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Brian Cassler, Michael Forbes (Star Trek: The Next Generation, The Next Gene), such as Fear and What's Eating Gilbert Grape Brian Kessler is a liberal writer who is ready to write a book about serial killers .Breen and his girlfriend, Carrie, are in California, so Brian does not advertise a statement in college that wants to go to California. <br /> <br /> Early Grace is a former can and patron in the soloist, a mirror factory in town Iii is in, the landlord owes money undievarli parole officer's job is about to stop to visit him. Lease and sees the ad, he adeleku away to California, says his garlphrendku. At the Early and Adele bus stop, Brian and Carrie met out of town. Brian and Carrie did not know that he was his killer <br /> <br /> Brian and Carrie were initially different from Adele and some knew, but when they became friends and became friends, Carrie and Adele became good friends. <br /> <br /> Learning a lot of their journey. Though the brain and the carrier were unprecedented, a killer was killed in the film earlier. Bryan made the film about the difference between the killers and that's a very good question for us. <br /> <br /> The film is a great movie, I provide 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs. Especially in the movie I love songs, The End of the Film, song "Look Up to the Sky" The Indians.
