<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ <br /> <br /> This film is awesome !!!!!! Olivia Hussey has everything in her looks amazing! Many people now remember her from Romeo and Juliet, but she's wonderful! <br /> <br /> This storyline can be used very often, but it is a unique movie and I will fight if I do not accept it! I enjoyed this movie until I had any other Olivia Hussey film. <br /> I saw the first time on Saturday (4/14/07) and fell in love with it. It's not just an Olivia film, because it's a unique story line and is in excellent direction.
