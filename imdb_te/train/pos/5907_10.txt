This is one of the best movie I have ever seen. My parents come from rural India and for some I saw the lives of villagers. People are really weak and have economic and social problems. <br /> <br /> This image just reflects the same. Full credit to the director and actor. They have done an amazing job. I am surprised that I can not go to Dakhi without films like Lagan and Paheli. The standards chosen are not understandable to me. This difference or the bigger names have a difference in money. <br /> <br /> We hope to see similar movies in the future.
