It is good to see the movie with real people with honest feelings. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek is convinced that Robert Frontsworth is a simple, yet cool and daughter, and finally shows how good he is in his last role. It is hard to believe that David Lynch is a film. It's slow and even, sweet and moving. If you do not follow the car, sex scenes and violence are the best.
