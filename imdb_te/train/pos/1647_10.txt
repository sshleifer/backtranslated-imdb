Excellent. The pioneer Ranch is the integrity and true character of life, focusing on the female role and place of the Western plains. A moving picture, made love, and based on real people and their real experiences. Low budget, independent image; No money has been made. Not sure is the fictional, unrealistic Hollywood version of pioneer life.
