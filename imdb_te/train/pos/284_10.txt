One and just the season here airing in Australia and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I loved it! All the stories are very good! More realistic attitude about teen and family life today. And it still sticks together strong family values ​​and being there for each other. Their problems are real, and it really drew you into the show. The program is 'Days' and is mainly about this family called their lives. The family includes Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (father), Natalie Day (Sporty's daughter), Cooper Dee (outer Son), and Nathan Day (son of the boy's genius). Every part of their life is one day, with the view of the coopers on the subjects. The brother who is great at the program loves his insight. He is my favorite character too. It ended so many things that have continued, I'm sad I did not really do another season. This is a great show I want to miss.
