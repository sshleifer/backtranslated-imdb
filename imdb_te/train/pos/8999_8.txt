The film does not do any acting to hide its true genre - a campus B movie. It will tell you at the beginning of the concept of flat-out campy. It should also contain the peculiar meaning of cheese. But both of them are in the ways you work together, "Wow ... it's stupid!" And then you laugh. For example, there is a scene in "16th Century Japan", which shows a couple samurai walking in the front of a temple. In the backdrop of the temple, many tourists are looking out from a distance in sandals and shorts. Hmm ... hahaha! I can not be laughing. And since acting is good, it is bearable to my God, but it makes it funny. You'll see some good actors and then see others really terrible. I saw Stephanie Sanchez, because I'm confused in many plays, she's awesome. Her time in the film is beautiful. I also saw Bryan Yamasaki in many of the theaters during my visits, and it is better in the theater than in the film. Anyway, it's an entertaining film, if you do nothing to make a weekday evening.
