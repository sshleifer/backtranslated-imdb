Where to start dear God This bar is not the best movie I have ever seen. The camera angles are very good but in my opinion acting is better. Why the script writers for this movie do not write big budget movies I will never understand. Another cast. That's great. This is definitely the best Ted raimi film out there. I know some of you, maybe he's not "very good" but it's not your fault. The work of Raptor Island art. I hope I got the best film of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a group of no names and no raptors. I believe this movie is really amazing thing.
