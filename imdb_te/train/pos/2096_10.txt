The film with many celebrities will be rewarded by IMDb, giving all the cross-referencing. So why is not this movie on DVD? Did the producers not understand that the Internet Movie Database is a marketing prize for such a film? And 'The Return of the Soldier' ​​is a gem waiting for a gem. Get people with it.
