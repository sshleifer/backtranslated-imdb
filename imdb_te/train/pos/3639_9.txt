This film is about me, family. Jimmy Morris was not only his dream, but only for his family. I could not tell how my little girl told me that my father was going to Kansas City to cover the Priest Holmes and Kansas City Chiefs. I think she's a good thing as Morris's son. Living dreams with family is what this is about. I can truly appreciate what Jimmy Morris did to his father, who had a close relationship with his family.
