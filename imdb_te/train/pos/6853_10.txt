Kill to Kul (1980) is a secret horror film from Brian De Palma and it really works. The weather is perfect. The atmosphere you are scared. It's not what the horror film is to do.All the actors are in the right places. Michael Caine is the perfect figure of Dr. Robert Eliot. Angelly Dickinson as Kate Miller, a sexy woman with a sexually upset woman. Keith Gordon is her son Peter. Nancy Allen Liz Blake Call Girl is amazing. Dennis Franz will play the role of his typical detective. His Detective Marinino is one of the most colorful in the film. The film has a lot of creepy scenes. Elevator scene is one of them. There are similarities between this and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). There are some similarities between these two images. Some of these films may cause sleepy nights.
