A great British indie film! Fantastic chemistry made for 3 main characters for some cheerful medicinal fuel set pieces of cheek and chong proud. Great to see Phil Daniels back on the big screen (even when he switched sides from Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for ladies! Finally, I know what happened to Arthur Brown, who set fire on top pops! ... he was not acting ... he was really bonified British hippie !!! You have to be a biker to enjoy this and it's straight into my Friday night post pub repeat view collection. <br /> <br /> Let me go and play this movie.
