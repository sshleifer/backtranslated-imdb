The movie is to be put on DVD. It's very funny and I like it. Really, really beautiful and funny. Not realistic, but suppose. The only thing I do not like about it is that most of the guy guy relying on. It refers to the way of time duration while thinking. I'm trying to get this film for a long time and it's not only available in the UK format in the UK and will not play in US DVD players. It looked a classic movie of sin! It is not believed or not, but this film is easily become a cult favorite, for all ages. Too bad, do not legalize small countries or some things that really make our own. Lindy is unsinkable, positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons. She is funny and lovely. She stole the show!
