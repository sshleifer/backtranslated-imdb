This is really a strange picture - and it's not a bad thing. This is a neo-realistic picture of the homeless and a fairy tale. I'm sure some of these film sounds a bit odd, but I liked it. Once again, the director gets together with the wonderful actors (not actors) of everyday people and gets a great collective-type performance. Although Umberto D is not sad, the two films have a similar point - it makes it quite absurd. Ignore the special effects of cheesy - after all, it was not at all in the early 1950s and special effects (or at least they should not be in the movies) anyway. Instead, just sit and enjoy a very strange and crazy ride. <br /> <br /> When I first reviewed this film, I saw another movie directed by Dyssey. Children are watching the US Miracle in Milan is not a fantasy or light with confidence, but a great image.
