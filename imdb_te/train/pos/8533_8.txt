The movie is very long, especially comes from Funimatum. Other bad dub, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is comic (all lupine based on the 3rd issue). Lupine is trying to get a huge treasure. Fujiko is using Lupine's weakness for women who try to get something out of it. <br /> <br /> Many Cooper words of other Lupine movies are later in family with Lupine. What a good Lupine fan is surprising (I know after hearing a lot of bad things about this movie). It might be a bit better without a little animations rolling during credits (they made little mushy) but overall, it's not a bad image. It's good to be one of the lopin III movies I want to see again.
