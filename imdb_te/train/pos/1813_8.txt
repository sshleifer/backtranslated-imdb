I looked at myself because I saw more than I thought. I mean, it's one of the few animated films I've thought about, even after I've finished. It's like a punch in your face that you talk about death, vengeance and hell, even when the scene of the film's midpoint reaches to suffer. The film makes it very nice: The special ability in the Don Bluth (Director) plays with people's feelings and makes them love or hate at any time. That, and the fact that Charlie and Marie have very good roles like, sad but happy at the end you have to say "something in my eye" to hide others. I said only a few good points of the film. For leisure, you should see them in a very good picture. Don Bluth, thank you.
