Writer / director Henry Brommel made a great job from his film "Panic, 2000", in which he featured: William H. Mackie, Tracy Ulman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland, Barbara Bain, David Darfman. Brommel played Ulyman and Ritter in the decisive un-funny characters, and offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see. <br /> <br /> "Panic" Hitman, Alex (Macy) Who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He applies his real career by mail-order work; All shows, he and his wife (Ulman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a common suburban family. Disappointed in his life, Alex psychiatrist (ritter) wants to help, only to tell his mother (bain). In the waiting room he meets a young man (Campbell), who is immediately impressed, which makes him more difficult. His mother breaks her promise and tells her father about a psychiatrist. <br /> When Alex gets his next appointment he learns that he is trying to kill his psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> It's a delicate, good man's great story, knowledge of his father's murderer, knowledge, kill his father but can not stand up and leave him. In his anger he was seated so deeply that he missed the emotional attachment to everything and everyone except his son - and this was his son who finally woke up from his lifelong repression of his life. <br /> <br /> When the "panic" moves, it makes it quicker. <br /> <br /> "Frightened" is not as frightening. In fact, it moves very slowly. But slowly moves due to poorly-slowed intentions, with Alex's own mind slowly coming out of the fog. About Sarah, about the character of Camber, and his psychiatrist, his own psychiatrist, as a living creature, as a human being, Alex what he's doing and what he's and how he's jive. <br /> <br /> William Macy is a wonderful father, a distant husband, and a cool killer, two children's child, another brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> "In a movie theater, it's very young, very small, very subtle, with a lot of journalists and a lot good.
