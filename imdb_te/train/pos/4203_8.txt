It was another sandy and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fastest director is an exceptional thing in his previous films - a cast of some stars. <br /> <br /> In this film, Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in the film about the Communist agents. Peters were viewed by federal agents in the subway car. They know that they have a link in a long spy chain. The unknown is the wild card in the equation - a short-time pickpocket is also on the train and he steals the secrets of Peters carrying. Widmark thinks he's just another purse - then does not realize the severity of what he stole. Now his own scholar - hot with the Kim's and FBI on his pavement. <br /> <br /> The wizard and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish. Although she does not get the top billing, special mention is made with Thelma Ritter. This assistant actress has probably had her lifetime performance as a surrogate pigeon. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, I loved Widmark and Peters interacting with us Some times you see a woman's square piece in the mouth! Now it's hard, and they are wonderfully close, they are amazingly close - relentlessly close.But still, with a very great play and such an effective Nair film, See this movie.
