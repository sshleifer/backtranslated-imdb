Lion King saw more and more times that my friends met each other. Have a baby sister .. you know how to do it. Now I remember both the plot and the lines. Leon King 2 came out and I was fine ... the second was very weak ... then I saw a statement for the lion king 1 and 1/2 ... I was there again and again. After watching 1 1/2 I was like WOW. My expectations (for repetition) are split. A really lovely and original plot keeps your seat glued for you all the time. <br /> <br /> I see the cartoon.
