OK, it's not a perfect image by any means but I disagree with the overall IMDb opinion that I was really really bad. I saw a lot of Hong Flogs in the 1990s and the Eugene was very dear. I did not see the 'Black Mask' at the time and the last time I saw only last week. Apart from the awkward poor dubbing, the film has a handful of Hong Kong images that have raw power and boldness. When I come to take action, I'll have to achieve any Bourne Supremacy, Casino Royale or Miss Impossible (I do not fall out of these movies - I consider they are not free of this and feel very control) element of magic on screen regardless of these guys, their budget. What is this It was not afraid to portray some scars to learn lessons for some time, and they were experimenting with filmmakers who painted and corrected. For me, watching these movies is more fun and dangerous.
