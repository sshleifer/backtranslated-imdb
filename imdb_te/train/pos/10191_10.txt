What's the first rate show on this disc by the first disc band? This disc is not for the faint of heart ... the music is very intense, and very cool. Whenever you watch this movie, you will learn to be as big as ever. Their records are good, but their performances are over the pile. When the concert was filmed in 1969, the bapers in adolescence shattered the jelly beans thrown in Beatles, and the bands (and audiences) settled for spectacular performances of long and frequent musical mathematics - continue to have music compelled by Britney and Cristina by some intellectual enthusiasts. What you need to learn here is that when prominent artists are encouraged to promote amazing artists. Try the concert, it's really amazing.
