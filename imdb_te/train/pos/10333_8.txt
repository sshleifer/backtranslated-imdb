This is a fantastic little American film that is the most creative and open-minded talk of Nazi atrocities before the death camps are fully revealed. In late 1944 and in 1945, they showed how bad and terrible they were, not just like other Hollywood films, but the most ruthless honest movie I had ever seen about Nazi atrocities. The film will begin in court in the future - after the end of the war (the film took place in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In the fictional world court, the Nazi leader is attempting war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm was not totally unacceptable and in the last row of one by one witness who revealed Grimm's life from 1919. At first, the film seems to be sympathetic or explained how Grimm was called to join the Nazis. However, shortly afterwards, it is clear that Grimm is just a tyrant. These epics are excellent and are definitely of your interest and a part of this film campaign is a legitimate drama. <br /> All in all, second-rate actors. There are many compelling scenes and performances - the ultimate fame of the Jewish defenseless sight can not be brought to the tears. It's interesting how there are some super creative scenes that can be used to cross the way around the same point in the movie you might not notice at first. <br /> <br /> Fay - Not for the critique of the film, but Hitler "the paper hanger". This is a reference to myth that Hitler once put money into a wallpaper. It is not true - in the past he was a "hungry artist", a homeless man and worked well in the German army in the WWI. A terrible man, yes, but never a paper hanger!
