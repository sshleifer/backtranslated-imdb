I was surprised at this picture. Even if their budjet is not clear you will still be impressed that this film took 7 years and still turned out to be good. Acting was pretty impressive and the story really impressed me. My only complaint is that the conclusion is really very abrupt for my taste. <br /> <br /> I would really recommend to see someone in Hollywood that Antonella Rios. Bad novel on acting). Antonella Rios is truly a star on growth.
