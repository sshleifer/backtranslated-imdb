If you love deep cover, you may like this movie. Fishburn refers to many poetical interactions from the lyrical script of "Once in the Life" on the screen of a play by Fifburn. If you like lorry, the lorry is hot and everything is hot. Actually the gun game and the use of illicit commodity, it's all kind of gangster movie, but the script is beautiful and the story is a little too short on the chic flick. Amazing movie ... dark, frightening, sexy, and exciting. If you ever get out of the night or hang in the clubhouse, you will get the right effect of narrow sets (echoing in life). Complete intelligent prehistory and complex relationships, this film is tough. Each sentiment reflects the set session and camera shots. Good work!
