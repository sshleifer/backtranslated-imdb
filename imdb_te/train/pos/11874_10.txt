Arkieby Al Pacino's best role. He has become a great and powerful criminal lord in Tony Montana, a short time hood from Cuba, and he has only two things in his world and his word in this world, and he 'em for no one. A large-time Cuban Dealer, who starts doing jobs for Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and goes with his longtime friend Manny (Steven Bauer) quickly goes through the company's ladder. Soon he had an eye for Bass's sexy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). Frank sees his position from Frank Tony, who tries to kill Tony, but without luck. Tony is disappointed and can not stop him now. F. Murray is a proud gangster in the film, another famous face is Horus Eulyn Tony's younger sister trying to marry Elizabeth Mastrotonio. Credits to the Outstanding Screenplay by Oliver Stone You can see Brian Deeplema's bright points in his long and career careers, this guy is very talented. The film has an amazing view. Also pay attention to two memorable scenes: one at the fancy restaurant ("Good to be bad guy"). The other is in the final shootout and still learns that Tony can kill and kill more than 20 killers who attacked her home. This is definitely one of the most impressive conclusions in the movie I have not seen. This is a must see for fans of Al Pacino and crime films. This is highly recommended for you for the rest of you. 10/10
