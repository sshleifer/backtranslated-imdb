One of the more satisfying Western all'italiana, Janeyu Yuma has the latest version of WAI made during the hymns of the genre and is highly recommended for genre or offbeat, intelligent cinematic fans. <br /> <br /> Johnny Yuma is not a terrible reality, but it is actually not counted against. The success of a genre depends on how good it is for audience expectations and that it delivers surprising variations on the predictions. Previously, cheerful experiences have been restored but with a subtle (or major) twist that provides continuous interest. The quality of execution is also clear. <br /> <br /> In terms of these standards, Johnny Yuma has succeeded. There are many repetitions from previous movies. Arrangement, cruel, twisted semi feudal Twilight World, the best "gothic family" of 1964-1968 in Western countries, such as the Tempo di Massacre (1966). The plot is a combination of the basic fiddleful of dollars (1964) storyline and Ringo films, which is not surprising both of the protagonist Fendiando di Leo. De Leo was one of the best film writers in the famous films from Cinecitta in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work has helped to provide much backdated continuity and collaboration (actors, directors and screen writers alongside other people in some different categories). In the FOD plot, the heroine arrives in the town, facing a deadly situation, then dies with death, and then resurrected (some of the films like Quellella Sparka Storia Nell West (1968) are quite literally a crucifixion). Catholics of narrative and symbolism are keen, especially the filmmakers and their films are impartial democrat / clear socialist instruments. Ringo's storyline was further developed by the protagonist Ernesto Gastaldi, which featured an affair with a member of a community of a community member who played Glyanoo Gemma in a series of films in the film (a healthy dash maneuver <br /> <br /> Caradine and Johnny The relationship between Manco / Mortima clearly from the Fiscalful of Dollar (1965) (1967), an old and young man (as Dynamic as a central focal point for the plot), is based on a series of two sequences of a gun belt exchange, a brilliant dialogue and awareness. Father / son, old / younger brother, Anglo adviser / adversary and farmer revolution).  ు దుర్మార్గం, చిట్టడవులు మరియు అద్దాలపై దృష్టి కేంద్రీకరిస్తుంది, ఇది ఉత్తమ ప్రారంభ WAI అంతటా పునరావృతమవుతుంది. కేమెన్స్ మరియు అల్గారియా యొక్క ప్యూబ్లోస్ సాహిత్య చిట్టడవులుగా మారుతాయి, దీని ద్వారా పాత్ర మరియు మౌస్ యొక్క ఆటలను బదిలీ చేస్తూ ప్రవక్త మరియు విరోధి నాటకాలు మారుతాయి. <br /> <br /> The use of the visual / psychological space of Johnny Yumani, director Romoluy Kuyi in other waves, is accompanied by the script's clever mechanisms. The dialogue is not always very important for WAI and is often absurdly ignorant (such as Django (1966) or cynical commentaries on Fasciya a Fesia (1967). <br /> <br /> The psychological depth of the character is almost entirely through iacon images, Description of the images, and a description of the description of the whole article.When looking at the deadly Samantha presence, from the roof or How to look from the background of Raya? The focus of their safety and their power and Pedro's Samantha and Pedro finally look for information on their Ranch, hotel, bedroom (a theme from this, again, a FOD) It was eventually adopted from the FOD on the basis of the hard-boiled mystery novel Red Harvest. It was through random contacts, posters, Wall conversations, gaze out of the windows, <br /> <br /> The hero and heroine of the waves generated by the acts of absurd Reality Pedro and Samantha were mistaken identities and misleading movements. Violence is considered as an exception. However, many of these films are more violent than those of American Westerners. What is different is the psychological intensity of violence and the reasons that it attributed to the fact that it is not torture, but it has changed. <br /> <br /> Johnny Yuma is typical and interesting in its use and violence role, and another interesting feature of the film. <br /> <br /> I have personally recognized the most interesting of this genre, and these repetitive descriptions have some significance and interest in unnamed spectators in Italy and Spain. Do not have a masterpiece and internal value? Some flint, dirty pots shirt from prehistoric site, or a molarizing piece of leather and rusted metal? But it refers to some unnamed existence, as life is important because they exist. While Johnny Yuma has an internal value, I am very interested in it from this connection and mystery. <br /> <br /> List of western spaghetti westerns http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> <br /> Average SWs http://imdb.com/mymovies/list? l = 21849889 <br /> <br /> For fans only (under the barrel) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list? l = 21849890
