I am also in this movie, but I do not know if they actually put this scene. When we returned from a school tour (in 2005) we stopped at a station station at the same time as we were doing this movie, and we asked (all of us) and shout! Freebird! We're about 10 years old, and if the film is made in the movie, I tell anyone who's watching the movie, it's great to know! I thought this film was never released, because it was two and a half years before the release. I do not think your comments are better than all, so this is a very successful film, I can buy it, but first I'd like to know where I am! Thanks for: D
