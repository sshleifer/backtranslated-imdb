Mador Hitman Movie Movie Light ... About the Hitman Movie Violence has never really been shown but is often introduced. For the first time I was scared that I was in the mid 90s for another retreat of gangster Hitman-Hipster-Dark comedy, but I was surprised when I realized it was just a sweet and funny story about friendship. There is nothing terribly exciting in this movie but every bit keeps me smiling. The three films have the best screen in recent years with the big screen, and the film seems to have a great time together. Sometimes this concept is sharper, as it is from a theatrical drama due to a set dialogue scenes. It's a good movie I do not remember too long but it's full fun at the time. Good picture.
