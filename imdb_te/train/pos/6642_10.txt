In 1894, Lumiere-family men [Father: Antoine (1840-1911), sons: Auguste and Louise] acquired and managed a photographic plate and a factory made of paper. Not a small company; The pension and social security benefits factory has more than 200 employees - newcomers at the time. It is located at Mapplissizer in the outskirts of Lyon, France. In 1894, Louis Lumière opened up for speculation as he was interested in building a moviemagazine. <br /> <br /> At the end of 1894, Edison provided the company's kinitoscope (pip-show machine) as a catalyst. <br /> W.K.L. Dixon, from Edison's crew, found a film camera on a steep piano-size patent in February 1893. (The Eastman company) has crossed a lens at about 40 frames-second (fps). "Black Maria" (especially the first film studio) It was the most consistent item in the Kinetescope Machines performances <br /> <br /> In 1894, Louis Lumière He has applied himself to the work of the dilemma-film camera, which allows him to gain a general move of 16 fps celluloid film, the persistence of the human eye / brain. His camera calls the cinematograph, the size of the larger shoe box and the lid To store enough image for a <br /> <br /> Camera size and Nti weight (which can be converted to a printer or projector. The light source), a program (record enough sunlight is available) is portable enough to carry any place to record. In the spring of 1895, Lewis shot: some of the trick-riding cavalry forces; Fire-filled house with fire-fighting forces, a building filled with water; And there are other scenes in Lyon and around. Using a moldini bulb he turned the camera into a projector and provided his images to the scientists who met in the Reven Generation des Science reception room. Images on the screen are at least five meters from the lens. The screen was expanded on the door between the two rooms. In the same year, at the Professional Photographers' Conference, Louise photographed the upcoming delegates and showed the arrivals of their arrival the same evening. <br /> With praise from the scientific and photographic communities, Louis made his inaugural public appearance at the end of the year. Because his pictures are every minute, a good presentation requires at least a dozen movies. One of these films set up his camera at the entrance to his factory, leaving the withdrawal of jobs. <br /> <br /> The open stage venue chosen by Anthony is for "Fair Ground Barker" Cinematograph - Grand Café's Salon India on the Boulevard des Capucins in Paris. It was a vintage on Saturday, December 28, 1895. When the first audience was sitting, they gave an opinion regarding the outside of the Lumière factory (with the closed doors). Some people are just a slide lumiere slideshow show. But the camera / projector turned on the crank and the movement began. Louis has an underlying feeling to take up the film. Start this movie, middle and end. In the beginning, the doors are open and the people leave their office; In the middle, people are trying to ignore the camera, and the cameraman will leave the labor day behind them and people will come out as happy. In the end, the gates are closed to the factory. <br /> <br /> This is the first film for the general public entertainment.
