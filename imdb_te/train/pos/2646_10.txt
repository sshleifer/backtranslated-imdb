I feel that the majority of the people have not come up with the right idea, at least in my opinion. I'm not sure about a film about drug abuse; Apart from that it is a picture about the thinking of those genius brothers, drugs side effects, something marginal. Again, if you are not a commercial film that you see every day and I think that many people are one of many drug related movies, he certainly failed, if the writer wanted. I think, however, is something of a case. In many films depicting different cultures, viewers generally understand the films depicting their own culture, that is, they are well grown and well known. The film is that "the intellectual" people are what they often think and what they are experiencing. They are bored from their minds, because they are responsible for such action. They accept simple things and accept those objects if they open space ships on a daily basis. They work very hard and at any time excel. I feel - I have gone to work, did nothing, but look around and look around twice as many people around me, what should I do with my free time? And what's more boring? You can not start to evaluate behavior because you are psychologist, but because you have seen this model in the past. So, for them, from one side it is also very boring is a non-challenging job, and from another they begin to recognize the behavior of people. This is a recipe for big boredom. And the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state. They are certainly right on the fact that the guy is their biggest problem in the past, they are trying to figure life in terms of logic (explains logic), although life is not really a logical thing.
