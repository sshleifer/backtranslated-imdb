The film that's fun is very good and is just as good as Jimmy Stewart Chip Hardeste, with Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton with great supporting films. But the film, directed by Mervyn Leroy, was directed by Mervyn Leroy and was carefully examined and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover, dressed up in every aspect of the film, along with scripting approval. J. Edgar Hoover does not need to be proud of. From 1924 until his death, the bureau's administration has summed up the world's best research services. By 1959, however, Hoover had already been forced to go out and had already started collecting documents on powerful individuals to preserve and protect his small empire. And he decided to make sure that no film about the bureau did not show a single bump. The only successes on these failures occurred, and the witch hunt was part of the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but in the cheek with the tongue.
