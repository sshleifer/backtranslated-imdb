"Evans at the Doors". Ohhhhh, I miss the show badly but now it's a fortune to "invasion". Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, it all had. If I had to choose one thing I liked best about the show, it should be its "predictable plot lines". Favorite actor Lucas Black .. I adore the southern slang. I bought a DVD, and my kids are also fans. There are some hot envy scenes. Some devil people too. So, if looking at kiddos you may want to edit (Fast / skip). It is humorous, at a Jos√© Wheedon level, which lacks many performances. Adult wit and adult situation, which are performed with finis. The DVD has some extra, but I wish I had too much. If you are thrilled and want to enjoy a great show, watch the "American Gothic" come!
