Ken Franklin is the perfect brilliance of the Jack Cassidy. Cassidy combines his pride, courage, charm and intellect - all with a stupid and evil nature on his face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is the best assassin (three times) in the Colombo series. This special (and first) show, my favorite Colombo episode - hands down. The newly faced Steven Spielberg performed excellent camera work (yes, sometimes the camera has shadows in the stars) to capture nuances and jokes at different and intriguing angles between Colombo and Franklin. <br /> <br /> The shots and scenes at Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin Cabin Home) are great. <br /> If you do not see this episode yet, it's a real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy is a very talented actor and singer. His attractive personality is the most epidemic. His death in 1976 was very tragic and very sad at the age of 49 - he was perfectly in his best years. Rest in peace jack, you will live for eternity by your great work.
