George Lopez is also a funny person without sitcom. The first episodes I saw were often jokes with the cost of his mother. I saw it more and more different. No one in this cast is now really safe from his intellect. <br /> <br /> This season, George's father is progressing with a comic father's character. At first he was not, but he was getting more & more into a groove. This makes him both up and the shows are gradual ridiculous. George added a few characters to play this year too. <br /> His mother is still there, but is not the center of past seasons. With the feeling of George's comic timing, and absence of ABC's good sitcoms, I think it's a good chance to be in the ABC for a long time after George Lopez George W. Bush.
