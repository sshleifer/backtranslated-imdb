I saw in a preview picture and I really liked it. The cast is amazing and the plot is sometimes completely hilarious. Another highlight of the film is exactly music, which will hopefully be released soon. I recommend it to everyone who loves British humor and most importantly all musicians. Go and see. It's great.
