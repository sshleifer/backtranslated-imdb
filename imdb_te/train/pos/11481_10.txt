High school friends Andrei Kreghmann and Call Gabriel announced war on their companions and planned a horrific attack on their high school. When they opened their daytime action, they started a video diary to explain their feelings and explain their mission. </ P> <p> Another such image is also called "Elephant". Why will I take this Of course compare two images. Although I like "Elephant", this is a very good movie. What's the difference, you ask? Well, for starters, this was filmed separately on the lines of "Cloverfield," "Blair Witch Project", and "Diary of the Dead". <br /> <br /> The film is much more effective for the film. <br /> <br /> How the film is ready to show "another side of the story" in the movie. Unlike "Elephant", you will learn about these two shooters. I really cared about one of the shooters and did not understand their actions and why they did. This film actually feels like you are sympathetic to the people and this is always a good thing because it's not always black and white. <br /> <br /> I'm almost weeping in this film to be honest. The characters are real humans, logic and reasons behind their actions. You need to understand them. They do not want to kill people for attention. Overall, this film is emotionally gripping and very haunting and "Elephant."
