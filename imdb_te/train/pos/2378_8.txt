The film is much better than the refugee version of the war in the world. Trips are very good but their walking and death are good. Action sequences are really cool. Walking ... Walking ... Walking ... Walking !!! Oh my god walking walking or I'm going to kill. The thunderous child scene is important in my favorite order because one ship hit a bunch of tripledodes. I've read this book for good readers. <br /> <br /> Music is great and directors cut is pretty cool. <br /> Pros. Good soundtrack is good for 99% book Cool Violence Tripads and Handling Machines <br /> <br /> Some bad acting is seen in London
