In my opinion it should be one of Barbara Stanwick's best performances. Who can tell the same form of the entire page of the conversation, and then only some actors. Extra 4 minutes of additional footage, I am very fortunate to see the original and uncensored movie. Very bad movie is too small. Lily did not meet a young woman to work with her father in her illegitimate speech. The only attachment she had was her good friend, Chiro, Theresa Harris. Chika African American (and the content of the film is controversial as it is a good friend with a black man in 30 years) and not lilly, they have a special bond. And it's not sexual. Only 2 women are stuck into the situation beyond their control, or shoved. After Lily's father died, she did not know what she would do, and she went out and told her what she needed. Yes, it is immoral, but this is the whole point of the film. Then they "go" last few minutes and want to be destroyed. So, until the last minutes of the film, it is a fantastic picture and worth watching. The "lesson" of this image is still valid, and now I'm sure from 100 years. Ladies, it's awful what makes Lily get what she wants, but it works. But, note.
