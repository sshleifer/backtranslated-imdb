Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra were killed during the film and in the following years. Brando asked Sinatra to sing a few lessons, but Sinatra wanted to be a star singer in production of Sky Masterson (he already hated the fact that Nathan had acted in Detroit), and no one was more pleased than he was. He said he would lose Brodon, and Marlon was thrown into the diner to get him back home to eat, eat and eat. In subsequent years, Sinatra gave Brando a nickname "Mumbles" or "Mimballes" as he spoke.
