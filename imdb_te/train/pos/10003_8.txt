It's not a simple Mel Brooks movie. It is a slapstick than his movies and actually has a plot. Leslie Ann Warren produced the film, she is an amazing, low-profile actress. A few moments were a bit shorter, some scenes were able to cut the room, but renting and watching the price for everything. Good acting is good, Brooks did a good job without talking to his audience directly to the audience. Again, Warren is the best actor in the film, but the "fume" and "sailor" both have played their roles well.
