This film is primarily human interaction and interaction between them. The main character is an old woman who starts a journey of her past, doing an analysis of how she lived her life in the twilight of her life. The journey was due to the financial crisis of the sons and his intentions to place her in her nursing home. It is plenty of second thoughts to discuss in this film as we have a very honest look at some of the things we will ask at some point in life, and family film, true love, marriage or destiny. Although this type of melodrama is not new, it is useful to discuss some ideas with family members. Actors play a good role and the characters are incredibly believable, but at some point in time some characters become fully developed. I recommend this film on Saturday afternoon.
