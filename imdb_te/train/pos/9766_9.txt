Rogy Ann and Raggie Andy is related to dolls when the movie is not around humans. In this adventure they will save Babett, a kidnapped French picture from the pirates captain. Deep Dark Woods, Tope Pitt, and Looney Land are traveling on their journey. Want to make a camel help their new friend with slippery knees to soften them with his friends? How will they escape the king and his followers? What does she tell their owner Marcel when she looks at her 7th birthday with other dolls? Two adventurous waiters are waiting. <br /> All scores belong to ten: Story: 8 - Very beautiful. Toys come to life when the owner is not around. And they go to many different places, but they're in the world that they imagine anything. When it comes to new characters, it's great to go to different places to find new friends. Do all of these characters work well and do not love the pirates? Acting: 8 - Each character fits well with their voice. Especially Marlon Brando Tuffy Pit enemy, The Greed. The French Doll is a very high-profile French voice that plays the role of the evil Hitler-Esquire king Cook (the hair similar to Simpson's Sides show Bob), and the camel's black man's voice for the camel works perfectly. Why is older dubbing animation much better than new ones? Music: 10 - is not the smallest of perfection. The songs are in my head for years, and looking back almost 20 years later, I can still remember each one of them and now be able to know exactly what came from these tunes. Joe Rapposo of the "Sesame Street" fame worked great on these songs and everyone really sang. <br /> Editing: 6 - Hey, it's confusing. How well did I do the walk of the ragga? <br /> <div> <div> </ div> <br /> <p> </ div> <div> <div> </ p> <p> How hard should I try. Mainly scary parts. I've probably mentioned how old movies can crease a lot more than the animation today but maybe take the cake in this scary factor. <br /> <br /> There are no animated music outside the South Park film and some Disney films, or its distinctive features are unique. VAT is certainly worth a good copy, but VHS copies are probably all extended by now. The DVD version is selling Ebay all the time and you will definitely have something you'll see more than once. <br /> <br /> Total score (average): Excellent timeless musical performances in the late 8th - 70s can still be enjoyed today. Its characters are all unique and songs are great. You are great, you can find them hamming time and time. Give your favorite stuffed animal today embrace! Reviewer's insight (including bias): It is not like a Ragga Un-On TV series a decade later. This path is more dark and real world. These effects include a number of other acid-trip cartoons from the 70s, most notably, yellow submarine. Still, I can never forget its memories, and today's things affect. It's not easy to find, but it still has a treasure to keep my DVD and video collection in place.
