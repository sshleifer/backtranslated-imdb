The film is good for the following reasons: 1) It has great backgrounds and sets. 2) It has shown the imbalance of the war-torn atmosphere lying next to a technology. 3) John Cusack's performance is amazing. He was very passionate. 4) It showed the dangers of everybody in the face of war. 5) It tells us what can happen in the future in many ways. I'm also impressed with acting. Hilary's performance I found very reasonable. In the war-torn situation, moral values ​​and values ​​for everyone are strong. Liberal journalist and traditional businessman have the ability to do anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable. Great thing. PSP
