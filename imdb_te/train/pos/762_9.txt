I enjoyed watching the best scenes of this film, especially the breakdowns, who are carrying a disco club called "Roxy". <br /> When it is Christmas, it will appear as a "MC Santa Claus". <br /> Although it was an old film, even though video tape from the TV, Finn State Movie Archive made it to their own big screen in the summer of 2004, to check it out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a great pleasure to have a bigger screen than a ticket. <br /> <br /> I see a large number of people looking at the big screen to waste money for the ticket cost, I paid my ticket, which is on the big screen, especially in the front of the movie, sitting in an unforgettable experience and much better than video By looking at the value of money.
