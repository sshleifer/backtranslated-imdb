I'm a fan of a very young age and then an animated series ever since (Heidi, Barapapa, Il's Eight) 'home ... I loved a lot). <br /> <br /> I found that other Japanese cartoons of this type were not comparable to Magignar Z, and I began to rarely repeat. <br /> <br /> The very thing, strange, features of Mazinger Z. Another good point is its inventiveness, with the most extravagant monsters, strange devices and bizarre characters; In fact, we showed interest to see every new installment awaiting a new explosion or bad machine!
