The story of a boy who feels wrong as a young child in a child. His elder sister gets his problems with his sister, who murders at the beginning of the film. This is the start of the coming things from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasant plays Myers, a doctor who studies the years. He knows something is different about him, something secretly bad. <br /> <br /> After escaping from an organization, Myers tracked his younger sister. If he kills herself, the guilt of this guilt will end. But it seems that he is facing problems in completing his sister, while other people enter this way. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of horror movies of young people hacked into pieces by the masked or fierce killer for young people. But this sort of started. If you think about it, we all remind them of horror movies Most Freddy Kruger or Jason Half are nude chasing girls around them. <br /> <br /> The Halloween director, John Carpenter, came from many of the 50 horror films, although it was not for Halloween, the characters dreamed of our dreams. And in the late '70s, he was known to be a scary film from a hell of a lot of people. These films strengthened him as a director and started the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who played a masked killer girl. <br /> <br /> This image may seem clichy today, but there is not much interest there. It was copied and ripped from it, but Halloween is always a young horror film of philosophy. It still gives you chills listening to Carpenter's thrilling music while watching another victim trapped that shadow Michaels.
