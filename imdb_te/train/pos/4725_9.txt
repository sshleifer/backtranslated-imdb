Although there is no logic in the story, Kill Shot is a delightful movie. Through a moving performance Kasper Van Dien brilliantly portrayes the emotional split between a hard work wealthy father and his misguided son. Each member of the supporting cast calls to a great performance, highlighted by the bright acting of a young Asian man whose name I can not remember. A shocking ending can be confusing some younger audiences, but the whole Kill Shot really provides a death blow.
