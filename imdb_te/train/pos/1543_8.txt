As I saw in the past years ago, I think BBC2. I want to see again - who knows how to get a copy? As I remember, this is a particularly powerful film, especially in horses wearing scene and gas masks. Apart I really do not remember much about the story - which is why I want to see again! Although I was trapped on the web, I did not find a copy, it was exceptional in my experience - there was no DVD or VHS of this movie on the market. Anybody will be able to appreciate me. Thank you very much for your help. Best Relationships, Albany234@googlemail.com
