These eleven directors are prominent from the promotion of eleven films. That is, the number one thing for people like Bush, Blair and Company is that it is not for many other people and the general public. ఇరాన్ గురువు ఆమె చిన్న విద్యార్థులపై ఆకట్టుకోవడానికి ప్రయత్నిస్తున్న ప్రారంభ దృశ్యం నుండి జరిగిన చాలా ముఖ్యమైన విషయం ఏమిటంటే, ఫలితంగా పిల్లల ఆకట్టుకోలేదని, అలాంటి ఒక పొరుగువారి మరణం మరియు అలాంటి విషయాలు స్పష్టంగా వాటిని ప్రభావితం చేస్తాయి అమెరికాలోని న్యూయార్క్లో జరిగే ఏదైనా కంటే, దాదాపుగా ఎక్కడైనా డాక్యుమెంటరీ శైలిలోని ముక్కలు ఈ శ్రేణిని అన్ని ప్రపంచ దేశాలు అంద  Whereas not equivalent. <br /> <br /> The attack on WTC comes with a view of any kind of yardstick that can be seen as a dostler event, and out of all elements both in politicians and TV cameramen. These pieces. Had the attack on Lagos, Say, or Jakarta, Sa, or Rio de Janeiro had an international response? I think rather. Newspapers report that things are distorted on what happens: In Italy, the earthquake is given more time, Outer is said to be ten times more devastating in Mongolia. Larger distances disaster size is shrinking. <br /> <br /> Eleven pieces of this series will help you do things in good perspective - I have told you to make each other his own story, or make some pieces, with full freedom. The perspective may not be able to confirm all merits, but one for each eleven minute division. <br /> <br /> It should not be assumed that this is an anti-American film: different messages that are expressed through sections are read very easily. However, it is not a pro-American. Eleven departments have diverse attitudes and simple link - if one - has to look at the disaster of the WTC attack on a different view-point perspective. Only then will people like George Bush begin to comprehend the planet he lives in. <br /> One section clearly states that I have spent my trust in two years: America did not learn the lesson. And the lesson USA is to share this planet with the rest of humanity - ruthless financial inspires or plain power it does not dominate. Instead, everyone in the USA and everywhere, its political leaders, Blair (and Aznar), and thus more serious and more intolerable, is not good for anyone in Afghanistan or Iraq, but only in many places. The White House mentality is totally rejected: the US and the UK attacked Iraq, causing all the chaos and thereby clearing the mess that they have created - aided by the United Nations and other countries not to be exploited and therefore easily out of chaos. <br /> <br /> The Radical Stalin adopted by the US (or Israel also) can only be met by radical views from the Islamic people, and for years they have their own macho homeless, ie kill women or cover their heads from slopes . <br /> <br /> The world is scared of the greed of some great nations that appear to be neither seen nor perceived from the worldly polygamous views. The eleven different pieces of the film will accurately illustrate this tedious and mute posture.
