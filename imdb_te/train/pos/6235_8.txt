It is one of the best Fred Astier-Ginger Rogers movies, or at least one of my favorite. Most of the A-R movies are great dancing but sorry romance stories. <br /> <br /> The film features great dance, favorite characters and good songs. Music is good here adding a soap solo to the center and Rogers. She is a super dancer, but a very pretty woman and a bizarre guy. <br /> <br /> She is also dancing with her dance floor. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s Television "Ozzy & Harriet" increased. For the first time I saw such a young Harriet Hilard. Surprise more than Ozzy has fallen for this beauty. Though she was that short early 30th hairstyle, I immediately recognized her voice. The film appears to be quick by Betty Grebel and Lucille Ball, but I have to admit that I have taken the ball out yet. I can not find her, but I know she's here. astrair <br /> <br />, the image of the first third of the gum-chewing, except for some bad, there is a lot of fun to watch and Randolph Scott - /> <br /> astir and Rogers's great talent <br asvadincalante It's just nice to feel a and good for the image.
