I'm not a big fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is really something. Since the Gundam Wing is only double digits for the number of jokes made over 17 hours, you do not have all of the stereotypical play that you might think about anime, the Gundle Wing business comes down right down. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is an action thriller. Larger episodes focus only on diplomatic affairs of war, not just wars. Combat animation is not only bad in cases but it is just a pain to animate, with individual twists between the sides of the cuffs almost artistic pieces taking into consideration the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements. <br /> <br /> For my cleverness, the 49 episode Plus One film was picked up by Cartoon Network in 2000, and was later called professionally. The dubbing is simply ill. Not every word does not match, but the voices really use the characters to make it more believable. Many people believe that it is best to see anime with subject, but I do not have a decision to do it. <br /> <br /> The accents are not only good but the scores used on the series are very impressive. I was not able to find a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The storyline of this series really hooks the viewers and does not hook you just like some of the main time drama like Lost. This storyline leads to a lot of spoilers because many characters do not even have names ranging to many parts of the series. The hardest idea of ​​this sequence is that the land and its independent colonies make it difficult for peace management. Thus a war began, which leads to military coups and extensive diplomatic conditions. I think the plot begins to give information on any of the key features. <br /> <br /> "It's a serious tone.
