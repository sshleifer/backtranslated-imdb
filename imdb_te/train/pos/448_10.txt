I think the film is absolutely beautiful. And I'm not just referring to the breathtaking scenery. It is not unlikely that English Housewives decide to hire an Italian fort to take their home home from their most happy home. Finally, all four women rented the entire area, and there were various reasons for different people and there. In this amazingly beautiful place they all come from peace reflections and resolutions that they seek for peace and are interesting, without further. I am also very impressed with the relationships that develop compassion and understanding. Acting is a pleasure to see himself. I especially love Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
