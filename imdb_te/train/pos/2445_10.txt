This show really like it. I was disappointed that I recently learned that George Lopez was a racist and he removed Masielia Lasha from the show because she was not an aliens but an immigrant from Albania. I learned from the public on this program. She is really one of the best parts of this show, so you're gentle to racism, they can hate anyone and they're actually born in the country where they are born, really disappointed.
