The 1st season was awesome, and the whole idea, which was adjusted on the island, was explored (and was just) unusual; Filled with suspense, tons of cliff hangers, and amazing plots. I mean, I love the whole idea of ​​seeing them on the island. And seeing the smoke monster in the first part of the first really drew my attention. From then on, I had a hecked second season exactly in the first season, a little better. I definitely liked the idea of ​​the hood and the Drama Initiative. Season 2 The whole storyline and sequences are mysterious, creepy and exciting. I was surrounded by others on the island of suspense, but the story of DHARMA really made Season 2 amazing. <br /> <br /> Season 3 is not as good as 1 and 2 ... yet, great. I looked at the stories behind others, looked at their camp and saw some researchers. ("Trisha Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season is not good, is still breathtaking and fun, but all exciting! Now, the 4th season. I have hopes for this season, and the 1st pair of episodes we're good, but it really started to get boring and monotonous. I mean, I really hate the new "rescuers" like Miles and Daniel. The story is old after the first couple episodes ... and most of all ... Something that has lost a perfect series of Season 4 has been omitted: Mystery, Suspense, Comedy (Charlie's gone) and overall enthusiasm. Also, I leave some of my favorite characters.
