After watching "Guinea Pig", two questions are in mind ('Am I really looking at mentally?'): 'Is it boring?' No answer; Although it is a close thing for a naked movie I have seen. And then: 'Where did they find that girl?' Without any reasons given by her (really, there is nothing in this film!) '45 minutes will get torture: fingers, hands, feet, mugouts, lost accessories ... last scene (I'm not sure how to do it yet). This is because the 'Japonies is underground scene' because it did not get much money. <br /> <br /> When I saw in subtitles without japanes, it was not a problem (real conversations, boys just insulted her in some scenes). I have not seen all the serials yet, but the first "guinea pig" is not the best one. Furthermore, if people benefit from believing this one's nuisance, there is a lot of problem 8 (Charlie Sheen, ask the actor) is very good. <br /> <br /> Another movie that I hid from my parents. <br /> <br />
