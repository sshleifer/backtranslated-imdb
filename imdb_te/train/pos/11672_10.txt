Exciting pirate entertainment! It has all the good ingredients to keep a look - a fiery story, a fiery Lady Pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who has attracted Irresistible Mr. Hawk (Errol Flynn) who is an absorbing story, out on a secret mission. <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is an average, bad pirate to divide and conquer his villainous web. <br /> <br /> I have seen a well-known face of Mysgrego, an assistant savior of Mildred Natwick's young patriot (Alice Kelly). <br /> <br /> Beautiful scenery of sea shores, ships and bay. I once heard Maureen O'Hara's interview from sword fires, ship battles, the ship wars on the board of Robin Hood board, she boasted about the bulldog's great command and overwhelmed Flynn in those days, but this does not require the test <br /> Very fun movie.
