This is a great movie that has never been so far. It is almost impossible to understand with many repetitive views in an attempt to find out what's going to happen correctly. The film was almost completely developed and random music numbers, commercials, competitions were entered by mail and had a host of other innovations. Also, what are the other films of Martin Luther King, Jr.? To distinguish this, the film hits the director's book I Vicious Curious. It all becomes clear. It's a great and bold experiment with sophisticated repetitive filmmaking. A victory. Now if someone else has a version with the subtitles in color * other * than white ... white subtitle wash and disappear.
