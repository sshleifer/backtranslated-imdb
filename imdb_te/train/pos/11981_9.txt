"The Complete House," in my opinion, is a perfect ABC classic! I'm not sure every episode has ever been seen, but I still enjoy it. Jesse (John Stromos) and Rebecca (Lori Laughlin) is one of my favorite divorces. If you want to know how funny it is, you'll have to see it for yourself. It's a two-parter, so you should have seen both parts. Jesse, Stephanie (Jody Switin) and Michelle (Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen) are one of my favorite departments locked up at a gas station at Michelle's birthday. If you want to know how and why it happened, you have to see it for yourself. I have many other things I like. While everyone has always given a good performance, the product design is excellent, the clothes have been well designed, and the writing is always very strong. At the end, even though it can now be seen in syndication, I strongly recommend it to catch it in case it goes off the air for good.
