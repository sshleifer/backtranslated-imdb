After reading Malton's review and reading the 1 1/2 star rating, I would also like to see this movie. I have seen this on my son's advice anyway and found it better than I expected. I give 2 1/2 stars in a 4-star system. You only need to watch the movie once to understand it. If you do not know much about religion, you will miss a lot. I graduated from high school in the year of the film, so I can say good. Yes, some people in this movie are naked and it is somewhat strange, but it's about 70th. I can see why people do not like the movie. However, I do not mean to say it's boring. The picture is boring though. You hate it or love it. If you find it boring, you are probably dead in the brain.
