IMDb listed it for a number of reasons in 1972, but other sources I've seen including amazing program notes have been identified as '68. In the case of Star Gate Sequence in 2001, this abstract collage of the film and video (which works to merge one of the first art) has released the same year, except that it is very interesting to watch. Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I'm pretty compelling and beautiful with these little flowers and super-saturated colors and flowers, this psychedelic, Rorschach spots, birds, etc. In the 70s, many have helped to guide many other modern artists, and a well-known character.
