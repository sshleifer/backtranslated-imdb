Well, there's plenty of ways to spoil a political thriller. They are usually derivative or very prestigious, often having a completely paranoid and unbelievable conspiracy. But the City Hall has not stated above. The plot's intelligently built story is reliable. As long as the characters go, I will say that this film is a solid average. There is no role space and Al Pacino is always brilliant. Attractive NYC mayor is his role and it shows that Al Pacino is now the top of American actors.
