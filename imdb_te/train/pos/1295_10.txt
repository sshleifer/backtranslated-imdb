The book based on the film is amazing; It took some time to catch up with Hylelebeck's unusual style, but I fully understood the rage behind writing, completely regretting the author's world. In fact, no other book has affected me. This is not necessarily a good thing - it clearly explained my own personal struggle and made me stronger to accept my own struggle. Harrel seized the insights of Hayelbeek, and the apathy and indifference and neglect of the hero to the world that denounced him was accurately filmed. It is a picture which reveals today's society for a deeply male in all the horrors. Hopefully, things will change in the future but for the present we accept the rat race as shown in this picture. This probably does not create the work of intellectual like Harlell or Howellellk. It's enough for a man.
