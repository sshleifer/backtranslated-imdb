I liked this movie. You have the honor of the midgets dressed as small Martians. Sure that stories can sometimes be thin, but you can not stay away from what happened. When I was 8 years old, I had to look again and again with some of the great quotes. Blanche's "Home on the Range" composition is awesome. <br /> If you ask me 10, 8, you will do well.
