For all the people who review this movie, perhaps most professional film reviewers, can not get it. The film is made up of Matt Sequences and Art techniques like the great Czech filmmaker Karell Seaman's works. If you want to know what I'm talking about, do you know about Jamine movies like Jabals Wern, Baron Manchausen, Journey to the Beginning of Time or On the Comet. If you can not recognize an image, then read AMG reviews. They describe the processes they use. If Zaman's work is tried and tried to compare it with other science / fiction fantasy films, the audience probably can not earn it. Comparing the days of the filmmakers to standard technologies is unfair, because both Jamen and Hines do not "compute". They have a unique style for them and are determined only for their creativity. If you want that he deliberately tried to create a collage collage with live perspective, you can easily come to the conclusion that if you look at the picture from a perspective, he has done a fantastic job. It is not easy to group a computer catoute flow. I also thought that the creatures were good too. Hines has taken a great gambling, and I think his film will not be judged in the coming years. Some cinematographers who promote the film can not see what they see in the audience, but the general CG. Go blind to the theater that wants to work. About the actress, I took Hines a page from Zemen's book, that many Zemen's actors were somewhat expressive at first, but the film and action became more attractive. This is completely refreshing to have this movie in my library. I see it in the coming years, it's three great bells.
