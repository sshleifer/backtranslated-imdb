First of all, any game on "living dead" stimulates Mr. Romero and creates a high standard that does not want many movies immediately. And secondly, the companion looking into my film suspects that any urban horror film hood could be overcome by seminal leprechaun. Skeptical, we settled to see. <br /> We are rewarded with a surprisingly heartfelt and good hearted zombie image. Oh, there is definitely budget low, and actually casting friends with friends' enthusiasts, but the hood of Living Dead loves zombie cinema. Cheap? Yes.

Zombies have pulses, in the absence of proof of actual death. And these zombies are pretty cool jaguar-grown sounds. <br /> <br /> An unsatisfying zombie image in the joke: Romero is a hire.
