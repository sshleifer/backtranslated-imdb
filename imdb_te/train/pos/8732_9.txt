Recently I have seen some of Tom Hanks movies and old chaplin films and some of Rowan Atkinson's first bean shows, and everything else has their own unique charm, with the audience of all ages, making you feel better. A Bugs Life has the same appeal, which has a connection to real life, which they can easily accept to insects to ban and talk to infidelity, as they speak, they still love real bugs. <br /> <br /> As with this film, imagine that the film has brought us into the mind of a child and thinks about us, to make mistakes and make the young mind. <br /> <br /> Honey, I'm Shark Animation is very breathtaking and story-telling this style is just a lot of people because when I was young I was one of my favorite movies, and for me, a Bugs Life is more like a realistic version of that movie. Narrative opportunities. I'm not good at being a Toy Story (like Toy Story) because I try not to compare it to the Toy Story (the best computer animated film I have ever done). The important thing is that it is still amazing fun. <br /> <br /> This article is a difficult task related to the colony of bugs, which not only increases food but also increases the vast majority of strength, strength and general menus, and hopefully still left enough for the bugs to make it through the winter. We treat some visits from grasshoppers, who say that if the bugs provide satisfactory food, the consequences are terrible. And incidentally, the similarities between these useless levels of food are similar to the weakness of the food from the Mao Seng-Tong's own peoples during "Great Leap Forward". <br /> <br /> Flik begins with entertainment and excitement, when the main character is set off on a quest to find a gang of suitable warriors bugs to come back and help protect the colony against the grasshoppers. If you look, he reads all the food he collects and puts everyone in great danger, so he feels responsible, but he accidentally hires a wrestling group of worms circus performers. It's great for audiences, not so great for the safety of the clans. <br /> <br /> The film was released in the late 90s, Armageddon and Deep Impact, Independence Day and Arrival, A Bug's Life and Anz etc. A Bug's Life is a very high quality movie, even though the comparisons between A Bug's Life and Antz And it does not lead Woody Allen to play the lead role. This great family is fun!
