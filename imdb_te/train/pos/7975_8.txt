I love Malay's documentaries. They are very effortless and simple but still very attractive. I do not know why this documentary works. It's about Glenco, Minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing is happening, really. But still Malle manages to make it lovely and interesting. Love for humanity, racist or homosexual people can not help you, but it is also rare to fall in love with them. <br /> <br /> Malley was filmed in much of 1979. He returned after 6 years to see what had changed. It was a good film without 6 years later, but this little addition makes it great. It's not actually what it's like when Malley is just doing what's up in the series up. Up to the series people. The significance of Jasmine is not about what happened to everyone, but most people did not say what happened to this community. And the change was great. 1985 Reagan era and farmers suffer. Once a proud community, now no one sees much in the future and parents hope that their children will do something more than self-education and agriculture for them. <br /> This documentary is very relevant today. Our financial crises have started with what is happening today. <br /> <br /> "I'm fine for this country, because now we can classify my mind as a siege of greed in our minds. A species that did not live long with that invasion and most importantly a democracy ... good - good - the best in the country <br /> Unfortunately, it took more than 20 years and a hell Hell of a headache was before.
