Gong Ho is one of those movies that I'm never tired of watching. Michael Keaton has always been a favorite of mine, and he is absolutely cheerful in the film. Step for him step by step. Two of them work wonderfully. Although the film is comedy, I also like how Hunt (Keaton) & Kazihiro (Vatanbe) show their roles in their roles. They both try very hard to keep peace, and then they eventually get into a fight (it's crazy to see). First, they are on the two floors. Then hunt jumps over a chair. Kazihiro jumps over the desk. Hunt jumps on the desk with him. This fight goes into the factory from that office. After I left the workers, I knew they both were bad for both of them to come out with hands. Moreover, there is a scene where you can see the impact of Hazit Kazihiro. He's in his home & his employer from Japan wants to visit tomorrow's factory: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sagamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: Factory locked & we can not find the key. <br /> Tell me how can you say something like that Michael Keaton? <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. It shows how people can not learn from each other only because they are actually funny, but also radically different Friends become.
