Dragon Hunters world has challenged a 3D gravitational world. Planet Aids, bits of buildings and strange flat plants float around in the atmosphere, while the characters do not appear to be facing much. This brings us to the world of the Neverending Story, the world does not have anything to eat away. <br /> <br /> Here's enough villain, world gobler, villain. At this time it is a huge skeleton dragon with blazing eyes. Leaders are an annoying and greedy sidekick with a bigger yet taciturn warrior, duo and the founding side of a strange useless animal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The voices and sounds are top notch. The story is probably anticipated, they are going to stop the world goblar, they will soon be able to beat him, the end, the true character develops or the story turns. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: It's a beautiful thing to watch, kids probably enjoy, but It's about it (Pun intended).
