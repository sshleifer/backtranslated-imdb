I really liked the bat: Dead End, I thought I had a theater concept and thought that Collora gave me a good image. This trailer did not give me the same impression. The story, or the storytelling series, is great, but acting and special effects have made me feel like a good TV movie or television show. <br /> <br /> First, Michael Ohn is not that good Superman. I actually thought he made a good Clark Kent, in his brief appearance. Sorry, I do not think I'm a superman. The Kate Kent made her size mask. Batman may have a body builder's body but not Superman. Supes is no doubt but not big. However, I did not care for Superman for his behavior and his transformation from Kent. Now this is not just O'Hern's fault, but it has to take some credits for poor scripting and direction. <br /> <br /> Second, conscious effects of flying are flying. Superman will fly in the sky. It is clear that this superman was close to the ground and telephone cables and buildings were visible above him. I do not think Superman has full body shots flying. <br /> <br /> The saddle and rigging supporting O'Hern must be on his lower torso. <br /> <br /> The best trailer for all. I have always paid to watch a movie, if ever, and it will be sure to grab on television. The storyline, defeat Superman by Superman, Superman Lewis, Lucy and Toosface between the industries, defeats Superman and join forces between Batman & Superman. I'm sure with a big budget and approval for the full picture of Collora and Company, O'Hern can also provide a good picture. Hollywood's late comic-based rubbish is better than most.
