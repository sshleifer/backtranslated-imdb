This is one of my favorite sentiments, rather than the weak 'Elvira's HuntTest Hills' ... Anyway I like this film a Goth / cam 'Wizard of Oz' <br /> <br /> Elvira is a Good Witch (Erriss Aunt Morgana ) A Goat Dorothy trapped in an unknown city after death. She is very strong and receives a "ruby" ring, requested by Bad Warlake (her uncle). .. She unexpectedly plays four roles, both of whom grow throughout the film. Elvira learns that she has a show with her uncle (wicked witch of the West), who has her inner strength and ends up defeating him. <br /> In the end she was sent by towns after winning their hearts and eventually reaching Las Vegas (home of Dorothy in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references to the wizard's wizard ... The coat lines related to her parallel characters with her and her uncle. Elvira: "You must be an elder, and you must be uncle ... There is no place for the house, there is no place like a house!" <br /> <br /> But next to one of the scenes, she said that she was a " Peeled, um ... I mean FlashDance inspired "pure genius ... and if you do not roll around to laugh around her, she's in the late Las Vegas performance at the end of the 80's Tulamari twirling a camp in your body, then you have not got to the bone ... This film is a cult / camp classic
