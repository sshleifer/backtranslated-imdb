This is a very entertaining film. Some reviews that I have read in this forum have written the people who feel that the film is painted in a serious drama. It's not a thing ... it's a very happy movie, it's displayed in the tongue in cheek manner. All of the actors are fun and apparently fun for us. Combat sequences are alive, active, and unthankful. Used in one case, called "Green Death", I read in a review and not "gruesome". At the end of the film, critics of the martial arts struggle between Doc and Seis were critiqued by critics. Hey, illuminate ... again, I remember one and remember that all this is a fun movie. Each stage of this "fight" has titles, which is added to the fun factor. Actors did not try to emulate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not one of these martial arts films. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and is the right choice to play Doc. Another nice touch is the "bad guy" (seas) in the unique manner in which the ultimate duty is dealt. If the film does not try to take it seriously and let's see for entertainment value, you spend 100 minutes in a very fun way.
