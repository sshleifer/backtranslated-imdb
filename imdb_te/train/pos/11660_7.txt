The ancient fame is a beautiful piece of children's images buried in the world of the world. <br /> <br /> It is believed that monks from the small island of Inana located on the west coast of Scotland and set up a story around the famous Book of Kells. <br /> <br /> In the wild in search of chrome-crook telling the story of a young boys apprentice, the fierce headless horse of pagan mythology. <br /> <br /> The true beauty of the movies is in its' animation. In the bright and exciting style of deep complexity the cell fades, resulting in less lubrication. Using the most striking cartoon network series 'samurai jack' for the intellectual use of marking and background depth, the Secret of Kills creates a stable, influential Celtic world living in the shadow of the Viking invasion. <br /> <p> History is not seriously wrong and the ways of life have played a role that is not realistic, but these facts are totally irrelevant in the motion picture fantasy and Celtic-Revolvist spiritual world. As a wonderful addition to the jungle girl and in my opinion she glides to the branch from the branch, what makes it a picture. <br /> <br /> A mysterious nymph with Alice and Wonderland looks like the legendary Cheshire Cat and looks and disappears. <br /> <br /> The Secret of Kells is a perfect dish. <br /> <br /> The lovely part of family cinema for all types of sex, all ages. <br /> Do not be afraid, but rather impressive!
