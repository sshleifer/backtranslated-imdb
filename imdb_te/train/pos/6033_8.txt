I want this to be biased because I'm a producer in the film. <br /> <br /> Film star Oscar Owis gave a star like Jeff Grindlernin, a nebush highchurchdirect that spends more time in living. He really grabbed a part of his mind to meet the audience with him, often with his mind and harsh feelings. His mother, played by Christine Heber, without a steady support beam, will leave him on. His friends also hand a hand in Jeff's life, often choosing him rather than being able to use the free will ... he often ignores. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to be in a hurry, And the sound can also be used to boost, but the performances will shine small details, which is also supported by a beautiful soundtrack with local talent and an extraordinary composer. <br /> At all, this is a treat, rare gem among rare gems.
