"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of these 80s dubi-boper films directed by John Hughes. Everybody is in a bubble-gum color world, there are some lightly resolved contradictions that occasionally get away from the happiest activities, and the vast amount of plot is summarized with montages set for bouncy pop tunes. But this is nothing wrong. "Bend It Like Beckham" is a perfect dish from beginning to end. My wife and I have won through Cornbull cheese while we're totally happy, in the end, we have to accept this way, and we have been appreciated (and in our living room, not in a theater). Watch this movie and have fun. <br /> Grade: B +
