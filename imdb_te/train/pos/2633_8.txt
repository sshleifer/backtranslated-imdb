I have to be honest, I look forward to a bad failure because it really sounds like trying to share the original movie to earn money. But this is not a pretty funny (sometimes odd) movie. I told them the story of Timon and Pumbaa, the story with Simba and I was funny when he was sleeping. Jacuzzi bubble, and when the pumba leaves, stop the bubbles. It's good for all harmless fun, kids and some adults. I think this film will last a long time, because it's good for a video and DVD movie. At the end of the movie, the little odd and kind of stars appear, and it works. 10 to 8
