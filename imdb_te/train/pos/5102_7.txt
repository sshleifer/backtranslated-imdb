<br /> <br /> Still, Debra Winger is always interesting and this is her first time when she is in the role of her, Cassie, girl from the wrong. <br /> <br /> In the previous review of Scott Glen, I agree with him that he is a bett trail (Travolta) Lived in the trailer. Used only for the plot, thrown to the mix to create suspense; <br /> <br /> Although I am from the East, many of us do not like "Saturday Night Fever", whose moments and permanent templates are beyond criticism. This point. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing for Debra Winger; She is still very fond of, and Hollywood personality has been subject to us by many actresses. 7/10
