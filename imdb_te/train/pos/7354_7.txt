I first saw this movie 25 years ago on British TV and I only caught it in a DVD copy purchased by Ebina last week. I remembered the musical sequences, the color and the beautiful fashion plate poses and the clothes but plain in front of the Anna Neagle / Michael Viking movie Spring in the Park Park Lane and MayaTime does not stand up well until years pass. But Michael Walding is a pleasure in the film, lovely, funny, debonair, having great fun and looks on his form. It is worth looking at him alone. Anna Nehal puts him next to him, and was too old for her part, but by the end of the 1940s, their film partnership was established with an open-minded film. Spring in Park Lane was a big hit in 1947 and was a big money maker. In his autobiography, Wilding Herbert Wilcox wrote about his great respect for the director and the London publisher.
