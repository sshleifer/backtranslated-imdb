Following her Oscar nomination in "Secrets & Lies", Brenda Blethin starred in the equally great "Save Grace". <br /> <br /> When her husband commits suicide, Grace Trevatine (Brenda Blethin) finds her unworthy financial decisions left her. Huge debt. Fortunately, she finds a way to meet her ways: marijuana. It's true, Grace starts doing it. <br /> <br /> Every item of this film has a great effect; There is not a frustrating moment anywhere. And certainly did not get that end scene! But anyway, you have to watch this movie. You may feel more than just a little festive after seeing. If there is nothing else, it would be a good lesson about knowing one's finance. But in fact, there is more than that!
