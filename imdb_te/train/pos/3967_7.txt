It's not in Jimmy Stewart's best films - I agree. However, when some people are in compliance with his film's pure campaign, I'm thinking of such a mistake. Yes, obviously, the TV show is like the FBI, doing some PR job to try to get the bureau support drum. But, as fun going on, doing a good job. Plus, at that moment it is surprisingly enough, spying on the film and focuses more on crime than "Commies". Instead, it is fictional to one of the earliest agents and his chosen career. Now that this agent is played by Jimmy Stewart, acting and writing are good - this is a movie with a studio that does not waste Star in a real budget and third-party film. So overall, it's worth seeing but not particularly great.
