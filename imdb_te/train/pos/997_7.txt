I agree with many other posts. Not comedy A drama? I was very low on comedy. I was a great movie without a comedy and it could be awful. Jamie is running in Julie and what is his name. In New York you are running down to someone you know in the downtown Cleveland. How does Robert Pastorell eat Yankee Stadium to hide gold? Again, comedy or drama? But it's still Sunday morning fun. I enjoyed the performance of Kimberly Elise, she is definitely a beautiful actress and seriously taking her art seriously. She is a young actress.
