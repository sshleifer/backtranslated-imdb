The film is a great cast and is very enjoyable with James Eve's superb direction. The film is fun with Stephanie Beecham's very captivating performance and everyone is perfectly cast. James Eaves has a good eye for casting and takes action as a conductor, falls to the fall, climax and rises to the climax. He has plenty of turns, thrills and blood, with an element of humor. It will reload the old bloodthirsty picture, gore, blood and screws. The picture works with great speed and the characters will take you on an incredible adventure, but it does work that the film does not take too much of the tongue in cheek action. Great!
