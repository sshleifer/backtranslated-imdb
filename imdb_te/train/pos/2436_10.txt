Generally something light and easy I like, so this film should not appeal to me. But it holds me from the beginning. The story and the challenges of a family's story seems obvious, but it rises to the question: "Is this my choice of my family?" When I was doing, I cried and laughed because I really felt what people did. It's hard to see places, but it's hard to stay away. The truth is true, and life is sometimes hard to see! It shows what filmmakers can do without sex, violence or special effects: a good story is a good story. The best and most unpredictable stories are real. As in real life, why do not you really know what is going on, or why do people do what they do?
