I finished watching 139 min version (wide screen) with some friends and we ran away. I repeat what others have said. The concept of filmmakers is unexpected and fun. Heavy battle tired. Then we were surprised to learn that we had left for about 30 minutes, but it was totally absorbed and we were not without fun. <br /> It's almost ruined and horror music / songs. Blues, country / folklore and rock ballads are not here and they are everywhere we break with laughter. It's bizarre. You are alerted but you will keep story and story grounded. <br /> <br /> There are many wonderful moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. Slow movement along with silence is also used in photography. <br /> <br /> "It's fun, it's different and takes you to unexpected places and is very refreshing.
