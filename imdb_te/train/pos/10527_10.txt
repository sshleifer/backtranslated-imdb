This is one of the best movies I have seen over the years! I'm not Gwyneth Paltrow's fan, but she's wonderful as Emma Woodhouse. Allen Cummings is known as Riverland Elton and is a lover of Emma Thompson's sister, Sophie, Miss Bates. And check out the gorgeous Jeremy North as Mr. Knightley; What a gentleman! In a film that Emma has ever seen, she says that she needs sexual and violence. <br /> If you are looking for an entire family or looking for a romance for a romance, do not see it anymore. Emma is the picture. A beautiful setting, amazing costume, and extraordinary cast (Did I mention the gorgeous Jeremy Normam?), Emma is the perfect ten!
