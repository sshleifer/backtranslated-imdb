I love this show. <br /> <br /> Two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bains) and Wall (Jenny Garth) york. Holly lives with their father when their father is transferred to Japan. Val has a perfect life, she is a lover and a perfect apartment of the Upper East Side. <br /> The show basically shows all the problems go well and through Holly. The main problem is the boys but also about responsibility and other life choices. <br /> <br /> Holy 16 and total value is total anti-soul when total value is opposite. <br /> <br /> Other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
