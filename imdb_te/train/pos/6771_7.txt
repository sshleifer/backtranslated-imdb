So it is very nostalgic looking at the 1st episode because it's an episode that I definitely remember. I enjoy watching the first season and we are now lame in this show that the action pack shows are yes compared. But apparently I was the "less violent" episode of the show and the story line is now substantial than the new ones. I thought Beliezer's AirWolf and Jagg have a similar theme - the main actor (hawk and harm) are looking for MIA kin (brother, father). <br /> <br /> Question - For anyone who has hacked cabin images. I love that cabin (like a cabin of mine) and I remember about airwheel.
