My wife is a teacher and she knows very well the story she read in her stories. It's not that much interesting to me, but it's bought a DVD, which is really a film that is not my thinner. <br /> <br /> The first half of this film was very much setup and I found myself thinking that it was right. It starts a bit slow and I have to admit that I'm a bit bored - but it's interesting enough to stay with it. Boy, I'm glad this is because I'm a very happy and rewarding movie. <br /> <br /> "When I read the book, I can not make sure a definite promise, but I must say John Voit is really happy. <br /> <br /> I would like to see how these pictures are liked, especially in the beginning, sometimes There urbharamaina. All the masses are disorganized (Although essential to the story.) After starting to come together at the end of the story, I think you have to pay it back during your patience. <br /> <br /> All that, when finished, I think it is a very good film
