It was the first film to be co-produced by Jon Crawford and Clarke Gable. The youngest wealthman who broke the father in the Crawford Stock Market crash, left nothing for her and her brother. They worked in front and brother gets a job with William Backwell Gabb, who thinks he is a gangster and a backbone is an easy task but gets pretty quickly on his head. Crawford becomes a reporter in a newspaper, but wants to work in big stories but does not work that can not work. Most of these were killed by the men of the gaab and Crawford was the source of the whole thing. It's a good movie but it's not one of their best.
