When I found this movie on my local video store, I thought it was another cheesy American Vampire movie in the same vein of "The Last Boys" (1987) .My surprisingly "die for" is a good movie. Bit corny times, but still have beautiful set-pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts. It is the perfect blend of romance and horror and is surprisingly cryptic at times.
