I enjoyed the first part of this two pearl, The Impossible Planet, and the second part was a little worried that the second part was not quite as good as the two episodes of the past two parts. But I'm so thankful that I enjoyed this episode before, so my fears lie. Anyway we started with the surviving members from Odd, who became the Devil's Band. There is also a part of the episode that I have enjoyed in philosophy as part of the doctor. It's a good solid doctor who does not need to tell the story. <br /> My grade: b +
