It saw it on SBS TV in Australia the other week, where "Laputa: Castle in the sky". I have subtitles enabled, and as always, I think SBS is a very good quality for them. <br /> <br /> The floating island of this story was taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel "Gulliver's Travels", which was initially published in the mid 1700s. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is an attractive Japanese fairytale in English. Speaking voice voice It's ideal for small children, I think, but it's only about two hours long, so not for adults like me, it's too long for some people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not only children looking for this island. They also find pirates, army and spies looking for an island and a boy who is voiced by James Van der Beck, a girl voiced by Anna Pacquin and Pazu, <br /> <br /> Graphics are awesome ... at times photo-realistic , Especially torch-light, or bright, sunny days, <br /> Recommended.
