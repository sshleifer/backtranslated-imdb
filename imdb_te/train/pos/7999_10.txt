It's the best thing I've seen for a very long time. Despite having enough actions to satisfy the fan, the plot is very good. <br /> <br /> The film is included in Blood and Gore, but has brought realistic nature of what is going on before the film and has also been tears. <br /> It should be seen by anyone. Many of the movies that look at a lot of reviews, kill the movie, but be fair and get bad reviews are some of the best. This once again proves. <br /> Let's rent this movie, buy this movie, go out and watch this movie. Do not be disappointed.
