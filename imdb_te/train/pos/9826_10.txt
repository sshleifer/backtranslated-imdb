This low budget sex thriller, which has some good points, but one of the very bad. The story revolves around a woman attorney trying to clear her girlfriend who is accused of murdering her wife. Being a soft-core film, she goes secretly in the strip club and has sex with suspicious people. The plot belongs to this type, not bad. The script is okay, and anyone in this story is adequately understood 2 AM It does not notice much of the plots holes. But the rest of the movie will look cheap. The main actors are not that bad, but pretty much all support them unbelievably bad (she seems like a girl like drunk and / or high). Cinematography is radically lit, everything is grainy and ugly looking. The sound is terrible and you can not hear what people are saying. The worst thing in this movie is the reason you are looking for - sex. The hot shoe scenes featuring really hot girls in the red shoe diary situations are the reason why they watch these things. Sex sequences are not profane, they are filmed in the porno style, where everything is a master shot of two people. They look like a refuge like refugees from a romantic shoot. I'm not rude or understand here, but they all have those breast implants and a gray / gray look. Even the title, "Deviant Obsession", sounds like a hardcore movie. I do not have anything against pornography - in fact I love it. But I want my soft core and my hard-core separation. What happens to actresses like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lowell, Shannon Wirey and Kim Dawson? Women who can take action and you will fully raise? And B Sexual Thrillers such as Body Chemistry, Nighties and Stripped to Kill. Sure, these artworks were not there, but at least they felt like movies. Plus, they go beyond the reluctant prude attitude of Hollywood, sex, sexual abuse and perversions pushing the envelope. Now they make hard core films without hard sex sex.
