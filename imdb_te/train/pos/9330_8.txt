"Dangerous Offender" is the story of the seemingly anti-social girl, and how she came that way. It's based on a true story, and I'm always frustrated by a note description, ie the role of the title, and dedicated to her lawyer's hard-to-believe, I'm compelled to mimic that life art <br /> <br /> The film is long Although the character's character is soft, she will gradually sympathize with her. <br /> <br /> It shows what she has done in her current state of the film - it's self-destructive rather than anti-social. <br /> <br /> This is a really moving picture, but I am proud of the Canadian (despite the fact that it is very difficult to see, sometimes due to body functions and suicide attempts).
