I have seen this movie many times and it's only Gerald Fitzgerald because I saw it (in TCM). She is a very low-profile actress and I have seen her for the first time (perhaps 40 or more years ago in "Worthing Heights") I have to admit that I love her. However, the real star Paul Lucas in this movie, he's got all the praise deserves. He defines the ultimate meaning, whether he likes it or not. Nazism had to be stopped, and it's good for anything that helped. He can not be bad for his children, and they should not be bad, but as the elders say, he will not repeat this kind of content. <br /> <br /> Lucas has given a wonderful role to the person trapped in this situation and made it clear that what he did was difficult. <br /> <br /> Some people think that his victim is a Nazi, but I think so - I think he is only after money. His Nazi colleagues learned this, so they were not very useful for him. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting factor in the film and German also by Maller (Lucas). The WWI anti-German hysteria did not repeat in World War II, but some Germans were opposed to what was happening in California with the Germans of Germany. At this time it was Helen's courage to write drama about the Germans (who signed the Nazi-Soviet Treaty!). After all, the US and British Air Force were bombarded in German cities and did not hesitate to kill innocent civilians. <br /> <br /> After the release of "Watch on the Rain" Dresden Bombing and Storm, <br /> "Watch" from West, Germany. In fact, watch am Rhein used the German Army marching song - WWII, but the Nazis also used their own March song. But MÃ¼ller was a German and he was engaged in his own "Watch Am Reign". <br /> All other actors have done an amazing job here; Bodo has many children like him. I was shocked that he did not give away his father's secret. In real life, he did very well.
