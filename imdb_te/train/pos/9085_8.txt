I'm seeing a lot of negative posts by people who wrote in August, but this film is not released in the US, at least until mid-September. Perhaps the happiest immigrants in South Korea. I'm in America, I see it today. I thought it was amazing, better than the special effects trailer. The story is not non-Western, but I think we use it from many other movies. It's not all hard to follow. Casting through leads is weak, but other people are very good. There is humor throughout. I see it better, because this is what I left.
