<br /> Why? This is because bloodshed is well known. The show is overlapping stories especially when there are many other shows involving toys / games. This is before the time, as others have said here. <br /> <br /> "They released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes in the series so far, I hope I can come out. <br /> <br /> It's enough to see it after 20 years of the first time. I do not know if I'm still inclined to have a clinical animation, and it's only IMHO. <br /> <br /> I also hoped to have more DVDs or set of all episodes in the correct order. Good luck But I do not think stories are in their correct order, but this performance has taken place.
