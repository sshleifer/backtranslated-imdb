In the first official Gribble films, Laupta is quite similar to its predecessor Nausia, although Nausica is an SF epic, it is much more common in action comedy-adventure with the SF camp. <br /> <br /> The first half hour of the film I thought I was going to love. Once again you have the ability to think of the imaginary details of Miyazaki, and in the perfect, beautiful perfection of an imaginary world. <br /> <br /> Animation is not in Nazia, nor is it in the next Ghibby drawing league. <br /> <br /> In Nazia's review I am a character 'Lupinez' anime style. Here are a whole bunch: Pirates. They offer a comic element in the movie, but I'm not sure if it's not a comic element. There is nothing funny about Nazia, I think it's good for it. Still. Dal√≠, the pirate leader, was the most memorable character in the film (she was primarily a woman long John Silver, but do not be surprised if you sometimes remember the 'Treasure Planet') in the American Dob called Cloris Lechmann. <br /> <br /> The English voice purifies themselves most. However, by half mark, I went to the pear shape about this film. The best way I can describe is to keep the characters swirling through the vast range of stories. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to admire about the lupus, and for most people it is absolutely love, I've paid about 10 people, and the word 'worship' is here. <br /> <br /> The most important thing for me is this: I realized that I did not take much attention to any of the characters. . Take care to develop Disney characters and make them really bad, and you can leave relatively two-dimensional pieces in the picture in the fantastic vista. It would have been reasonable if there was some hard SF for the story, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princess and Magic crystals. Laputa I'm concerned, and it's back from 10 to 10 probabilities. <br /> <br /> In 1986, when Miyazaki was generally considered to be their most terrific 'Great Mouse Detective' the same year, Missyaki had to agree that the leagues were generally more than Disney in 1986. <br /> <br /> A wonderful picture in some ways is a wonderful picture, and you definitely need to watch it, but I do not feel like over-rated. <br /> If you can see them in chronological order, look from popping briefly from navocia to popping.
