This is a good movie and I definitely recommend everyone. But there are 2 minus points: - The level of stories is a big spectrum. Some scenes are great and some are boring. - The stories are very self-contained (if you compare coffee and cigarettes, every story is a point, a message, a punchline or where you are called to do it) but well, most stories are really good, some are great and the whole it definitely is one of the best movies of this year ! <br /> I have to fill in at least 10 lines, annoying, I got more to say and I <br /> <br /> Well, I think!
