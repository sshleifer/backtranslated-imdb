Typically, "kids" films have some annoying quality which makes it more difficult for anyone than 13 and makes it ineffective. But then again, before the holes hit the scene. Sure, it's often the same moments to give a child's image its above mentioned quality, but this film does a good job of staying away from such meetings. The performance is good, and Stanley's other uncomfortable dynamics with cameras are more realistic than most films are trying to portray. About this film is the fact that I especially liked this film does not break your heart or try to make you cry. Emotional power is a bit more natural than expected, in many ways, such as The Shawshank Redemption (similar to the Holes, the end of the ransom). Only down to the side? Hockey looking lizards. Overall, though, an 8/10.
