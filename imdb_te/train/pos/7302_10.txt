This work is close to John Carpenter's 'Halloween' 30th anniversary. It has been around 7 sequels, remake, simulations and around Halloween every year since it has been the 'Top 10 horrible movies' lists ever since. It was a magnificent film with a budget of nearly $ 300,000 and presented a completely unknown cast and young talent. I have gone there, but the big question is here: How is the film caught today? And all I can say is fantastic! <br /> <br /> Pros: A simple, but horror opening credit sequence that creates mood. An unforgettable and goosebump-inspiring score by director / co-writer John Carpenter and Alan Howard. Great cinematography. Stellar direction, with a suspense-high carpenter, receives some great shots, and be careful not to show his villain more. Good shows from unknown characters ever since. Good sense of humor. Michael Myers is a terrible, bad guy. There are a lot of strange moments staying with you. The pace is slow, but steady and never drags. <br /> <br /> Unlike most other slasher films, this is more about suspense and terror than blood and large body count. <br /> <br /> Cons: Perhaps now it's not nearly as scary. Gots are really standing really. <br /> Final Think: I want to start this section by saying that I'm not my favorite movie in the series. I know this is not a popular opinion, but how do I feel? Even though it's really an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs. And it was rebuilt for a new generation because it would not be forgotten. No way, how to do it. <br /> My rating: 5/5
