I saw this movie at about 7 years old. And at that moment he was amazed at me. I saw a violent film before, but I never saw the movie with the realities of violence and reality. This film only shows this, but shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. The movie and the crash failed to be true. Crash attempted to show how bad the racial discrimination was (and the crash actually had built-in anti-Asian bias) and it came from a morally superior position. Grand Canyon ends in a higher ground than actually crash in things that come from such a raw and realistic perspective. Especially when you compare the conclusions. The crash ending is all that is right for everything. The Grand Canyon ends in a silent note where you do not know anything, it changes in the lives of the character, but life goes away, there is no sufficient end. How good it is ... you are bad. One chapter does not end to start another.
