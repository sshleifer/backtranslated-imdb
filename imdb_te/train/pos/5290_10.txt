John Waters (birthday greetings, John!) Made this adaptation of the popular / artistic world as he was generally going from far away to gross goods. Edward Furlong plays the title role, playing a working-class young man in Baltimore. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) realizes his work, he gives his big break, he agrees. <br /> In general, Pecker sees how to lose his friends and his normal life as a celebrity. The exact, definite, but precisely the thing we dreamed was, with Waters directing, there are always some things for us to shock (you'll know them when you find them). I definitely recommend it. Also starring Christina Ricky, Mink Stoll and Patty Hearst.
