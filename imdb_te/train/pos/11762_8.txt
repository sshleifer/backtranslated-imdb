Have you ever been to a sport of activity in your life, tried your best, and then found yourself in a momentous moment, where for a short moment you had a chance to be a hero and a winner. . . Failed? I believe that many of us have that moment in our lives. The mantle of the film, "The Best of Times." In this story, Jack Dundy (Robin Williams), a middle-aged banker, suffers from the misconception of a football mistake, which took years ago, inspired to play back the game. . Again. To achieve this, he has to persuade him to come back to the great football quarterback, Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell). For Reno, who is now very satisfied with his life, does not need to change the last record, he is good at age. The fact that their problem was added to both years has passed and, moreover, both their weddings are quick and back vampire. His father-in-law (Donald Moffatt) habitually is not easy when reminding him of a big fall. Anyway, Dundee is constantly and does anything to try and fix a great flop in his life. Someone wishes again to enjoy their youth. ***
