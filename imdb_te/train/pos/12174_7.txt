I signed with this film is really 2 minutes of really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came up with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie trailer. It's a little slow and slowly pulled up for an exciting maze, from the comments I am expressing in love / hate in the film. <br /> <br /> However, I do not consider the talent of the cast in the film, but it is still pretty good. Julia Stiles is obviously a star, she is tough and reckless to adapt to all, she is just glitter and the whole audience fell in love with Lee. The rest of the cast, Lee's testosterone-filled colleagues, his elegant mother-in-law, his co-friend Jim and his bride-in-all confirmation and boring stands first. <br /> <br /> This is a picture of a painter, Though there are some jokes that do not come out, I'm a clever film, with the themes that are in accordance with the "safe path" and the intelligently arranged on several layers, for example, how he can imagine scenes, How to listen to a radio program on the road, or how everything selma blair and julia stylists' roles are up to the point, or how everyone is compliant, and echoed by the safe choice of one person and the background of one of the hazardous choices. <br /> The other good thing about this film is that it is a screwball comedy Jason Lee By the dumb luck who keep his way lying on his way (eg: the pharmacy person will turn into a good chef) and some part of his wit is far away from it. <br /> <br /> I'm not as funny as it may seem and a little bit of tedious talent, but Overall this is still a good film.
