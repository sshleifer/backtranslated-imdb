The big problem is that the film should come to your attention for two hours and you should not miss a few minutes to get a cocaine because of the risk you are not following. But nice looking good. Bruce Willis must travel into a timemachine to find some antivirus for a virus that ruled the animals around the world in 1996. Thanks to some mistakes he first comes out in the 1990s, then as the First World War and how all messed up, Terry Gilliam comes with what should always be one of the most intelligent scripts. This former Monty Phyton man is cleverly told like SF-stories and knows exactly how his cast choice could not be any better, the silly Brad Pitt (his performance as shelter was memorable) and a wonderful Bruce Willis that he proved to be more than some Schwarzenegger-wanna. It is an image you can see again and again as the script gives you other surprises with every view so strange and complicated (yet you can follow). One of my big favorites.
