Three Stooges are always some of the many actors I love. I love only about each of the stories they made. I love all six novels by Stooges (Curley, Shemp, Mo, Lorry, Joe, and Curley Joe)! All the shorts are very happy and most of them are with great actors and actresses, many of them have a lot of shorts! In my opinion three stooges are always some of the greatest actors and all-time ridiculous comedy team! <br /> <br /> This is a good three stooges short. Fanny and its cast includes Christine McIntyre, Simona Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, ChesterConclin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrell, Haini Cancin and Bas Flowers. Stooges is well displayed in this small! I would recommend this!
