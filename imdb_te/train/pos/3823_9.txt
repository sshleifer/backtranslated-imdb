I saw this film in a worst case. I woke up on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul, and I've already lost 15 minutes. I did not know what I was looking for, but I thought it was all that week, but quickly broke down with the performance of the lead actress who played the role of a young kid kidnapped. Taking the twin to the premise and changing it I did not see coming and the end credits was scrambling by the In-Flight Guide to determine what I just saw. I have been portraying the role of do-yoeyn jione who will play the role of a good actress at Cannes lately. I do not know whether Secret Sunshine is unique in Korean cinema, but I'll learn more about the DVD store.
