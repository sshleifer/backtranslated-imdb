If you put a game on prison walls why not go for top playwright William Shakespeare? And if you're going to choose your cast from long-time criminals for the most vulnerable crimes, you might think that the time for rehearsals is a lot of time. In a Kentucky correctional jail, this was a daring plan with excellent results. It shows how the film is finished ... casting .. rehearsals? Set and costumes and Shakespeare's play "The Tempest" is the last performance. This has not happened before, but there is a similarity between the drama and the correction jail arrangement. The ship-dump characters in play are confined to an island regardless of the outside world. <br /> <br /> With the simplified painted drop of an ambient ocean floor, the characters are reminiscent of their lyrics to an approved audience of characters in the most attractive assortment, with Shakespeare intended but with a good heart and true honesty. <br /> <br /> Each person has lesser roles than him. A Pakistani saw his sins as a lesson in the redemption of another lesson. The men were moving a lot to watch a tear wipe away as they talked to murder, shooting and strangling. They thought that the clock was to go back and reconsider their brutal acts. However, (as somebody else says) has passed past, and is now the beginning of a new future. <br /> <br /> The play has been temporarily relieved from the discouraging thoughts of past events. <br /> <br /> The jail authorities should be praised for allowing drama. Such events can place Kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons may follow their good example. It seems to me that everybody can benefit, but Kent is in jail, but the prisoners find themselves new, courageous and self-respecting and prepare for the day they go out on parole.
