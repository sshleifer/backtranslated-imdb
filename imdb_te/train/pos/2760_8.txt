Every person we meet affects our thinking, changes in our ways, and a little bit of that person's distance to us. "Eighth Day" will take this background (compare "Rainmaker"). The film Harry (Daniel Atleil) is a businessman expert in sales psychology Georges (Pascal Duchenne), who meets Running Syndrome Child. Winning performances from these actors provide the film's main power. When we found out that the eighth day of creation was the eighth day of his theory and ending on the creation of the world, the earliest range was wonderful. There are a few moments in Harry's most disappointing story. For example, Georges who is absolutely forbidden is a pair of expensive shoes and not enough money. This is a scene where you are laughing with your tears. I like the scene, while the Downtown Syndrome Team travels to the Art Gallery for a bus and passes through a gate crash in the Paradis amusement park. Harry and Georges pass a horsemeat float on the highway and look back, where George's driver gives a tough salute to all the trouble is the most ridiculous. But some sensitive scenes, especially the hands-on use of the handset - the sun, the wind and the rain, the arms are met, the arms meet, the hardening of love and friendship. This is the real cinema that touches the heart. George Nathalie has a number of moving scenes proposed for Georges, where Georges penetrated Harry's head, where Georges called his beloved mother, where George taught Harry to laugh. Head, birds song, small insects - all of nature Wonderful creatures. Listen around us (like Harry and Georges) to hear and hear around us ... a beautiful picture.
