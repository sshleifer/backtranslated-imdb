Before looking at this movie, I thought the film was as great as the flash point, as I saw earlier Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong before watching the movie. Most of the sexual scenes were concerned, and I was disappointed that Dreamweist's sex scenes were as great as flashpoint sexual scenes, but I was disappointed. Except for the sex scenario of Asian Carrera, any sexual scene in the film does not feel great for me (what you mean). Great Jenna Jameson does not have that kind of sexual scenes for her ability. <br /> <br /> Felicia and Stephanie Swift have been disappointed by the beautiful girls in regard to sexual scenes. Distinctive adult motion picture standards have increased the quality of adult films in this film. The story, acting, direction, sets, decorations and other technical aspects of the film are good. The actors of the film made good performances and they all worked great. Dreamwest certainly increases the quality of adult movies.
