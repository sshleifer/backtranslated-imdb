Kasparov or Fischer's great games will be a mess for the whole rookie. This is a great movie. There is no special agency involved in the plot. It's a clue! This is a private plot constructed as a PRIVATE company. It is self-destructive and self-organized plot. At the end, the illustration illustrated the perfect professional platform: private, self-managed, self-destructive, and without any basis at the end. Some of the plots are back: a smart "director" with some money. Only by the delegation can be done. "Director" should just be a trigger. If the scenes of the general viewer can not see the essence of the plot in clear scenes, there is less chance of identifying the real plot. All actors' performances are going well, and Jean Hackman and Mickey Rooney have special mention.
