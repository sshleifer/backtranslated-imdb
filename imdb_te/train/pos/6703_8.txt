My children have recently started looking at the show's redevelopments - early episodes in N and then ABC Family - and they liked it. (I did not know that the show continued in the first or second season) I promptly cast all the changes - "I've been greatly advertised" and even half an hour has not revealed any endless comments that are not much better than episodes later than the early episodes. (Personally, I do not quite see the whole difference - the scripts and themes are the same - but they lose some great people) My daughter has placed DVDs on her wish list, perhaps all of the ground specific features and commentary will shed some light. When she quit the whole season or the previous little sister in "Boy Meets World", and when she starred after another actor, when she asked her, they'd have done some self-suggesting comedy about the changes, and she was "upstairs" or the starting lineup Token Geek "Minsk" shows for high school graduation, where he is Asked where he was "and he was there" by the camera, "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" And running off the screen (another character left by Mr Turner) oh well - maybe this or something an E is a real Hollywood story? I'm glad to see the show for the end of Aunt Hilda - she's always one of my favorites - it should not be a reunion of the more engaged actors. (Zelda candle just does not cut it for me)
