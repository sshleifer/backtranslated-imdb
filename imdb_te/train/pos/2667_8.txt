I'm always a big fan of horror films. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audience like big sounds and creepy kids. They usually do not have originality and are plenty of continuous. The only horror film I like is the Ecosystem Stir with Kevin Bacon. It has acted well, and has a great story. <br /> <br /> The film follows an author (Jack Nicholson) and his family agree to find a hotel. It will be closed in winter. There were rumors of hunters and the last resident went crazy and killed his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use quiet to overcome his writer's block. But after months of solitude and silence, Jack is a furor and then violent. Is there anything in a cabins or a mad hotel driving him? <br /> <br /> One of the imposing episodes about the film is a lonely concept of Kubrick. The hotel is very quiet, and the rooms are large and empty. It's also quiet when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barracks. Jack Nicholson's performance was also the best of him, frightened hell out of me and made me want to get me out of it for a moment. <br /> <br /> The shining ring and the Blair have defeated the trash from the trash, and in my opinion have tops for horror films. Witch Project. It may be a very old age, but definitely a good person. 8/10
