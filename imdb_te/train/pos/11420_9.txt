This film is difficult to navigate on topics and many changes to the limits, race relations and cravings. It is true, not everyone is cinema. Which car is followed, buildings are not explosive and murdered. Drama landscapes, low gestures, spatial boundaries, lighting and things remain in the tension - sometimes very clear - unsaid. It belongs to identity, memory, community. Different parts of the film work together to strengthen leitmotifs of self and other, identity, desire, limits and damage. It will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer. A poor, heavy, spicy action is needed. It's a beautifully painted human story. That's all.
