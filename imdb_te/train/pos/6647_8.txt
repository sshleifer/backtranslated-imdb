Gandhi is like watching a book with my father, chapter (your eyes) and you learn about Harilal Gandhi and Kusturba Gandhi through the chapter you read. They do not know much about the two, and the film describes them specifically. The title was misinterpreted, but it was a movie about Harilal and his mother about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son. <br /> <br /> Such films are like Leap Years. <br /> <br /> Gandhi is also my father, an internal struggle, which is more difficult than a freedom struggle that has never happened. <br /> If you like this, you want quality movie.
