The first time I saw it, I did not laugh too much. At that time, I was only fifteen years old and at that time I thought it was too ludicrous to understand. A few months ago I saw a second time. At the same time, it was similar, because Felix stopped suicide attempt at the beginning of the film in the dark film. Some of the things Oscar mentioned in this scene and Felix seemed unnecessary in the film later, and their personality clashes were not fun because they were. Although I'm not already aware of this story, I was worried that some Oscar's criticisms of Felix could hit him on the edge. However, I did not laugh or smile like a television show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. And, of course, is a pretty good movie and it is one of the greatest sitcoms on television. 10 to 7.
