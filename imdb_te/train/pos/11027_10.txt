This is my favorite since seeing this in my first theater. Since then I've seen countless times and I'm never tired. There is a lot to do with setting (Colorado will be jealous I know), but the storyline is original and I liked how the heroes used the small town mountain folk. This film is not comparable. John Lithgow plays a smart villain, but I love how he totally out of his element - what he keeps the tucker around and keeps it interesting. It is an action movie in the best film. <br /> <br /> You do not have to take 50,000 rounds as an action movie. It just needs your deaf, shell-shock does not.
