"Fertility Cat", the 4th of these cartoons, is good. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the film will get mixed reviews. <br /> <br /> Although it has the motions of humor, it is a humorous hero. The atmosphere is darkness and horror. Suspense is another strong element here. <br /> <br /> This little, Tom listens to creepy radio program and it's terrifying because it is something ghosts, because he believes it is horrific. When Tom is afraid of his death, Jerry is looking at everything and can not help but laugh the whole time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him. With the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner he creates a big "ghost". <br /> <br /> Tom also has a terrible experience in his entire life. Though Jerry is not scared of a good reason, the story's approach ends up funny. Plus, there is no violence here again, because it is one of Tom's Jerry's oldest cartoons. <br /> <br /> Tom's nine-year joke is sucked as a vacuum cleaner. <br /> When Tom finally realized that it was Jerry's scheme, Jerry was "caught up in a cookie jar" (he deserved to recognize). However, Tom shows a wonderful tolerance before responding. Jerry sees him angry for about a minute. The funny thing is that Tom invites Tom to laugh with him and takes half a minute to realize that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom does not laugh. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a different, weird and remarkable Tom & Jerry experience.
