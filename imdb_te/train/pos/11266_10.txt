I recently saw it, but when I started I did not know what the concept was, the small thing was ... I do not know what. <br /> <br /> It started a little slowly, but I'm looking at the type of any program because I think so. But it hurts me quickly. The episode I saw was discussed by Robert Wuhl about the reality and fiction in history. Basically we (America's) is not really true to learn the history and how we got learned. He did this to keep the director fully entertained and interested. I have really learned a few things and this is a real indicator of how effective this program is. <br /> <br /> I would love to have a choice for HBO. I believe that in this episode style, "teach" a similar approach, and that's just as much as being fun and effective with different aspects.
