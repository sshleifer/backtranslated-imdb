2006 WWE's last PPV should have been hit by fans, but for a reason, it's just ready to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick against the ladder competition William Regal and Dave Taylor. However, the recent worst PPV was aware that until Dec. December, WWE fans had to do something to talk again, which was useful for combining MNM and The Hardy Boyz and a ladder match as a player in this match. <br /> <br /> <br> One of the best ladder games I've ever seen is brutal, but Joey Mercury's face is the whole mess. Johnny Nitro was not even checking on his partner, but they continued to do nothing, and Taylor and Regal could not do anything in the match, except with some ladder shots. Eventually, the London and Kendrick show defeated the MVP in the Kane Thunderbolt match when he put the stupid dress of the MVP on fire and headed elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeated Chao Guerrero in a good match, and Glenn Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to defend the WWE Cruiser Wait title. <br /> <br /> The main event is cumbersome, joining King Bucker Finley. John Cena will take on Batista. <br /> <br /> Total results: Kane defeated MVP in an inver match. <br /> Paul London and Brian Kendrick wWE <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeated Chao Guerrera in a good match to secure the US title. <br /> <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to defend the Cruiserweight Championship. <br /> <br /> The bogeyman defeated Miz in a mixed match. <br /> <br /> Undertaker defeated Mr. Kennedy in the final career. <br /> <br /> John Cena, Batista King Booker and Finlay in an endless match / <br /> <br /> Overall Grade Grade.
