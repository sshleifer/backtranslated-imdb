The film is a joyous "Christmas story" for Christmas: Halloween: Both relatively low-budget, no-big-name-stars-type pictures ... and both classic and funny films from time to time both classic !!! "Empty Invaders" comes from galloping from the beginning to warmth and humor and a magnificent cast of characters ... all five goofy Martians, Klembecker Realtor, Russell Deputy, "Fuel Distribution Depot" and at most! You have to look at this picture to believe it as "Christmas Story", making each look better and better, and take fun every time! Very definitely a ten !!!
