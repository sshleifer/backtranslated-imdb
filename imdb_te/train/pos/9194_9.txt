Last year when I was in Japan for six months, I first encountered this show. I found on the internet when I was searching for dramas with subtitles to help me with my Japanese. I thought it was my disappearance because my host mother warned me to stay away, but I was happy! Koyuki showed symptoms such as the conflicting character and the soul of Matsujun made my day every time I tuned! <br /> <br /> Although the characters were interesting and well developed, they were disappointed to learn that they did not change much. I'm very pleased with "Hana Yori Dango". Their relationship grew, but they really did not. Still, it has a pleasant time (also for Fukushima).
