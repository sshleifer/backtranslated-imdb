Why are not so many movies (especially the American) metabol machine? <br /> This is my first official online review and I will charge with "Electric Extras" after selecting "Meetball Machine" as my first attempt. This is a review, I try to stick to reflection and gut emotions. <br /> I mean, it is now a fantastic creative work. So is not that original? I have these pictures and though Tetsuo is a strange son of a deceit, the metabol machine is very high and can move without a strong desire to sink into drugs to distinguish film significance. The meat ball machine is widespread in its story because it takes place in its high blood and gore. <br /> <br /> When I saw Nightmare on 7 or more Elm Street, my dreams were taken over by horror visions. In the last weeks, I drew on my dreams coming out of a telephone. At this time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly stimulated. <br /> <br /> The human body in this film is the host of the Aliens to try and fulfill the deteriorating oppression for human flesh and blood. Cyborgs eating humans There are more !!! Fight scenes !! Great music !! Great point off view scenes! The woman acted well by cyborg (she is better than her male counterpart). <br /> Oh, and did not forget to say this is Love Story! Wow, I hate love stories but it takes cake <br /> <br /> I can not have friends to see these images again on their faces. Unfortunately, I took the time to write this review because many friends and family can not understand the Meat Ball Machine. <br /> Lastly, my wife ran when I was looking at the clock striking scene and she was without speech. Generally she said, "Why are you seeing that waste?" This time she did not say anything. I enjoyed it! <br /> This is not a waste of time. This is not just a SPLATTER (great for words to publish). This is my friends art. <br /> Chechi
