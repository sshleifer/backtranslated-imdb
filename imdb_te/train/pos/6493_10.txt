I have seen this picture as a child in the UK, and enchanted by the story and the story of Lawrence Oliver. The next day we will speak in school. I imagine the ratings for the first show are huge. The story was very difficult, but they had to cut the story even though they were the best documentary series. Interestingly, the wars of Britain and North Africa are crucial but Americans have not been recognized. In the series, there were competitions between Mountbatten and the American General Staff, the abuse of German troops in the east, and the abuse of American troops from Japanese war criminals. The images of the Holocaust have always been a culprit for the treatment of Jewish, non-Jewish, Jewish people. I do not know why this is not the number one in the IMDb rankings. Perhaps they show their partisanity towards the documentaries. Spoiler - we win.
