*** Spoilers *** *** Spoilers *** Following two distances ("Magnum Force" and "The Impercer"), Dirty Harry makes her stride a "Sudden Impact," a thriller thriller wisely: Clint Eastwood's Charm, and direction is just a story that spends just enough time and stores its power for larger sights. <br /> Once, the case Harry falls into trouble with his bosses outside his local San Francisco (he again struggles with his bosses for his "shoot upside down, then ask questions"), San Pedro's hammer. There, (warning: probable spoiler) A group of minor inmates were murdered, at one time, they were in the catechony position of a woman who raped a gang and her sister's ever since. /> <br /> Killer Sondra Lackey is portrayed, and she makes an interesting mix character of Jennifer Spencer's compassion and cold-bloodshed. Lock's cold eyes and frosty voices, while trying to take revenge for her sister in a hospital, is very effective in filming a woman's torture, whose sufferings and fury are now beginning to bear the gruesome fruits. The Rapistans are very polite, especially the leader, "Psycho Nutbaza" stamped on his forehead, and despite her disproportionate inability, a lesbian who looks almost to boys. <br /> <br /> Some people dismiss the "sudden impact" trash: a mindless, manipulative revenge tale. On a certain level this is true, but it is well done garbage. The strength of Sondra Locke's performance is what works for cinematography, her complicated role is more visible in her films than in her gestures or dialogue. <br /> We have an action movie here. Harry (soberly speaking, does not speak), with a choice - he needs to sympathize with his motivations, but its behavior has a law that does not tolerate law, that some mistakes must be punished as necessarily as necessary . This story is much more interesting than this dirty harry fare. <br /> <br /> The film's other ransom quality is directed by Eastwood. After all, a dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood character knows better than everyone else. The film was directed to the style and wit, and the action scenes were edited to give larger payments. <br /> <br /> <br /> "Harry's moments" include Harry's best sentences in the whole series: "Go ahead - make my day." <br /> "The Impossible Impact" The courage of its beliefs in displaying a story about the perpetual crime and the following ruthless consequences. It's also a inspired detective story, well made and well said. And it's definitely not dull. On the scales, it was a great success.
