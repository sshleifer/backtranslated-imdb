"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" is a sort of "Harper Valley P.T.A." With supernatural touchscreen. Elvira (Cassandra Pietersen) follows his job as a television horror film host after a fresh station with the new owner's owner. She now relies on running her at the Las Vegas show, but she knows she needs more money to get the show started. She receives a notice of her aunt's death, hoping to raise that money, and then takes Elvisara to Massachusetts to read it. Elvira seems to be facing money for the Las Vegas show, leaving her home with the need for repairs, dogs, and cookbooks. Thousands of young and elderly towns have made things worse by making Elvira more difficult. Only the local hunk (Daniel Green), and a team of teenagers make friends with her. Elvira's Uncle "Winnie" (W. Morgan Sheppard) signed a contract with Elvira for Cookbook, but Elvara soon learned his powerful legacy of Splstocking, and a couple more effective casseroles. Elvira no longer wants to sell Cookbook to his uncle, but decided to get his hands to know his power. Elvira then stole the old charge of the town of Machchcraft, and stakes in Showdown between her and her uncle. The plot is quite simple, but humor and well-developed characters make it moving at great speed. "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" is filled with beautiful, gross, obscene and intellectual humor, many scenes, works, clues, songs, and parodies. This is one of the greatest horror parodies ever touched by the occult film. It's a well-designed movie with all performers excellent performance; Edie McClurg, and Jeff Conway ("Grease.") Are also good special effects. Many people (including me) wondered if the Elvira character had a feature film, and the answer delightfully, yes!
