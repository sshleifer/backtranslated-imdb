Keep the world away. Get it on my shoulder. <br /> Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) are in a pickle, one kidnapped, one baby. No crime, but faced with allegations and demolition of their home, they ended up in nothing, well, nothing. <br /> <br /> It's very weird, but funny too. What do you do if you are alone in the world? Two friends enjoy each other, and they do what they want. <br /> Then they hunt the memory. The sound effects at this time are great. <br /> <br /> Finally, Things got really unusual. The film is a product of a great imagination, and written and directed by Vincenzo Natalie, with the help of two stars. This is just a must see.
