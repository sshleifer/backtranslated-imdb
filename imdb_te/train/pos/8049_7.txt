Overall, I said I liked the movie. Combat sequences are very good. Particularly fighting against Lung Ka-Yan. One point that really hurt me is that they used an Asian to play a black man. I really mean it. Talk about bad taste. In the fight scene, one of the warriors on the floor laughs. Otherwise, Samoan copies are full of Bruce Lee's fighting moves. 5 in 10 stars.
