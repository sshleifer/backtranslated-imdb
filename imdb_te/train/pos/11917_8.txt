Yes, the motto of a simple but inspirational movie. When I see the whole crowd rise up in the stadium and the people increase their hands, I feel cold. It's just clever. Joseph was as lonely and sad as she was someone desperate and desperate for anything in her life. He deals with Danny Glover and magic and he attempts to convince the angels and the angels are funny and happy. A very nice family picture - I admit - a rather corny happy ending. But hey, it does not really matter, the film has good performance and its basic quality through motivational themes.
