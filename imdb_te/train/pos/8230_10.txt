Eglimata (= Crimes) is a story about small crimes that can lead to a complete disaster committed by people everyday in a crazy scenario. One of the ever smartest Greek series! The actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us the wonderful 'guilty' laughing.Every audience has moments that one of the characters seemed to recognize their self evil side or at least on their self one side they wish to have. Each year actors who play in large and small episodes have got bigger places in the hearts of Greek audiences. My personal favorites (apart from the first two) Vasilis Harlambopos, Athinodoros Prousals and Stves Nicholides, but some amazing actors from time to time. The Greek whoever globally knows that this series should be a way to watch this series, even though they have more than 5 years that the TV series (ANT1) has been kept as repeatable as summers or early afternoon zones every series Eglimata or casting staff will never forget .We'll !
