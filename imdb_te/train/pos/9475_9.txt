The relationship between Don (Steve Karel) and Mary (Juliet Bino) is the most satisfying thing about "Dawn in real life", which is quite real. Oscar winner Juliet Binoo's performances are an amazing decision as Dan's lover; She is unusually skillful, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, age appropriate for the episode! If the film was made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another factor about "Dawn in Real Life" is that the "frat pack" is a mature comedy that leaves three pillars of formula: dumb chicks, chauvinist guys, and subtle jokes. "Dawn in Real Life" is witty and fun, intelligent smiling throughout. Other jokes make the audience feel interacting or fully laughing, but jokes are more natural and intelligent, and some are part of the audience from "Don in Real Life". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> My only problem with "Don in Real Life" is rebellion, played by the middle daughter Britney Robertson. It's hard to say that the director is a personal choice on his or her choice. Either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying. <br /> <br /> Previously, this was a minor mistake. Absolutely not out of the story. <br /> <br /> "Dawn in Real Life" is a great movie, from the redundancy of offensive and mute-down comedy. Writing, directing, acting, and (especially) the quality of cinematography is excellent. It's just a beautiful, light humor.
