This is the FBI's amusing "history", but it should be seen as fiction, because that's exactly what it is. J. What could be that when Edgar Hoover is personally approved and has a guest role in production. James Stewart is amazing, as always, and talented Vera Miles, a supportive cast is good. Murray is especially good in the supporting role as Hamilton Stewart's partner and best friend. The film highlights are undoubtedly the FBI's achievements that are all true. <br /> <br /> One of the most insulting episodes in the film is the scene of killing John Dillinger. It has played a very good role, but nothing is mentioned, which led Melvin Purwis, head of the Chicago Bureau Chief Operations. Instead, this operation was shot as the virtual chip was running the hardest. The publication of Purwes after Dillinger's killing has been called envy to Hoover; Purwis later moved to remote outpost and soon left the FBI. There is no doubt why Purwis never mentioned in this film. But if the viewer, at least, treated Purwis this way, he was puzzled by what all the agents had done in the picture. They were completely ignored and replaced with fictional difficulties. <br /> <br /> At the end of World War II, the film is clear about the role played by the FBI. Nevertheless, at that time, we believe that the only threat that America faced is from international communism, which Hoover never believed. Never mind the mafia. Ignore the ongoing lungs in the south. Keep in mind that blacks are facing threats to drive them from voting in the south. <br /> <br /> I do not know whether FbI Martin Luther King started wiretapping by the time it was created, but it was not long after it started. <br /> <br /> Start, this is pretty cool, but it is considered to be positive romanticism.
