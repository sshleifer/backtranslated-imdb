What has helped to create many wonderful Hollywood films in 1939? Well, whatever it is, magic can be seen in the picture of this Columbia. It is a long-forgotten screwball comedy which began to show Turner Classic Movies. In almost every section, Amazing Mr. Williams is an ornament. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Police Detective for the first time, which meant it could not find the time to marry him. As he was going to ring at the wedding bells, he called for a murder scene. The questionable woman should learn the criminals and learn from the police forces. <br /> <br /> Melvin Douglas proved to be some comrades in the comedy. Jon Blondel reached the maximum level of his career and was happy. Edward Breefe and Donald McBrides are all happy. <br /> <br /> The film goes a bit longer, but who cares? Screwball comics are always entertaining, and the film is the best.
