I gave it only 9 out of 10, because I want to see again and keep the fresh perspective in the present mind. I saw my brain and my eyes. Every day I see it every day when it comes back to HBO (probably 1990 or later). <br /> <br /> "I hope to find it in a local video store. <br /> <br />" <br /> If you find it somewhere, I'll try it, it's very interesting.If you enjoy movies such as Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejows, Gammos, or any weird and similar films, try it out.
