<br /> What can I say? This is one of the most accurate films ever made. It's a throwback to the romantic comedies of the 1940s .. but with a modern touch. Cinematography is breathtaking (NYC has never been seen beautifully) and of course the cast of the screenplay, wit, charm, humor and tenderness! Dudley Moore turns to Loveable, Drunken Arthur Bach at his career premiere. He is also serious and real. The best lines of the film are his sharpness, "everybody who is a drink is a poet ... some of us are not drinks because we have some drinks." The great Sir John Gielgood won his amazing performance, such as Hobson, Arthur's servant and caretaker. Although he considered it "to make money and play", he was all talent, experience and expert in the role of a traitor and a sly comedian. This auxiliary cast for Stephen Eliot's Mobbiostic Mafioo from Gerardine Fitzgerald's Sassy Grandma Bach. <br /> <br /> This score is also very memorable and the film will give you the best of thanks. The ill-sequel sequel is raised.
