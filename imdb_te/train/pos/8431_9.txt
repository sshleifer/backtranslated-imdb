] Do not see this movie? Did not hear about this film? It does not surprise me. One of the few truly "independent" films produced in the last ten years, no studio is believed, and it has never been for large distribution. Independent company Kino Films, offered almost limited promotion to BOESMAN and LENA, and did not even review the mainstream film critics. <br /> <br /> Previously a movie, a picture of a category, a set of drama about the apartheid and its impact on the two individuals really never came to be in the market today - This is a loss of intelligent movie lover. <br /> <br /> The record, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover, also qualify as OCSAR nominations (as cinematographer), but the film gained such a little fame, and I can not even blame the academy. It's a challenge that's challenging, thought-provoking, and heart-opening, and in fact it needs to meet the audience on its own words. Considering this, it is certainly not a film for mindless entertainment. Director John Berry cleverly did not try to dress up the game of Athel Fugard. Certainly, we have been given some broken past and some breathtaking beautiful shots, but the film version of BOESMAN and LENA is the story of two people living in total, inhuman conditions. <br /> <br /> There is no one to attack their basic human rights, Bose Man (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) but one with each other. The third character meets them for a while (Willy Jonah, in a very silent role), but the film's focus is never from the characters' characters and what they become. Bassett and Glover are broken broken pairs, performances can not be improved just better. Seriously and worsely stimulating, both intellectual and mentally, BOESMAN and LENA are desirous of re-finding the home video. Hands Down, Best Film 2000 year.
