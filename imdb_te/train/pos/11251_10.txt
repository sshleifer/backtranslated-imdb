As a fan of author John Lee Kear, I am slowly working on my books and their simulations. I discovered Leker Carrey's 1987 follow up in my local library and sat down to see what I was thinking about. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Peter Egan Magnus Pyam gives great performance as the perfect spy of the title, and he is surprised to learn that these trivialities exceeded my expectations. . Pym is also probably the best, while meeting Le Long's long tradition of the main characters. Egon is a man who has been forced to live a life (in fact having several shades of writer Le Carere) to live a life as he becomes a "perfect spy" for lying his whole life and spending time and adulthood. Egan always runs the run for the perfect man, and does not save himself from others. Egan alone can only see six or more hours of these miniseries seen from his performance. <br /> <br /> Egon is a superb assistant cast of sunrise. Ray McConnell (as Le Carry) strongly rely on the author's own father, Pyam's Can Man who gave his best performances as Father Rick. A man who plays in and out of the Memanali Pym's life and is one of Pim's "Pure Spies". If this is not for McAnally's appearance for a year after this in a West British Coupe this would be the best performance of his career a very short career. <br /> <br /> The rest of the support is fantastic as well. Pyom's mother, Roman Howard, was a spy guru for Randy Wingg as Pyam's mother, playing Pine's wife Jane Bucker as an assistant director. A young man who has become a well-known figure by Peter Egan to specifically refer to the three young actors who played the role of the young pim (Jonathan Haley, Nicolas Haley and Benedict Taylor). Small scale production values ​​are also strong. Simulations of Tinker, Tyler, Soldier, Spy and Smiley Peoples have demonstrated that these stories can only be said in small formats. These areas are scattered from English locations, scattered throughout Eastern Europe and the USA, with sets by Chris Edwards. Elmer Cassie's cinematography adds an extra layer of realism to the world of miniseries. Yet the highlight of miniseries is really the script. </ P> <br /> Screenwriter Arthur Hoopcraft has done an amazing job of simulating six hundred or theme novels. The novel was largely echoes the life of John Le Carrie in autobiography of Pyam's early life (at least in its early epics). This thumbnails script is no exception for Magnus Pum's development "perfect spy" from little boy. Miniseries has never been separated with the intention of telling a good human drama in the global context of espionage. This is proof if any spy thriller ever wanted to be confusing and appealing even if it does not have a gun fight, pistol war, or a James Bond style car chassis. Miniseries is not six plus hours long, it does not waste a moment and is better for it. <br /> <br /> For those who do not have much attention here, it must be the longest for some. Better product values ​​and fine literary script A Perfect Spy is one of the best music games from Peter Egan and Ray McConley's performances. This is still a fascinating tour of the Cold War history. This is also a tour called John Le Career "The Secret Path": The path to the spy to survive and satisfy the path of the spy. A spy thriller is not quite a human drama as a perfect spy.
