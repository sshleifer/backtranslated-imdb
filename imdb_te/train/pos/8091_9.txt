Peter Jackson's Reformation (s) Overall good movies from the vision vision. That being said, they are not my favorite screen versions of the Lord of the Rings, and why let me explain. <br /> <br /> First, the cast of characters on the screen is very common and uncomfortable with Jackson's LOTR. The whole cast is in the mill too. "Are you saying that the silly cartoon characters of Ralph Bakshi version are better actors than real people?" Ask. Well, they are not really crazy (afterwards, saved for hobbies) and they definitely pack more personality than Jackson's party - even with a more limited conversation time. And it is due to the high-profile _voice_ performance of Buffy's LOTR. Take Argon for example. In this version his voice is full of deep and attractive full power (the Argon the Lord) and a seasoned skin (aurangan ranger). This was due to John Hurt's excellent voice acting. Compare that with the high pitched sound of Viggo Mortensen with no soul and dual gets quickly disproportionate: Harts Mortensen hit hands. <br /> And then there is Gandalf. Perhaps the most prevalent (and most popular) character in the whole saga. In this Baky version Gandalf (William Squire) is a true wizard. And I would not he shoots the bolts from his fingertips (he was not), but his presence was just attractive. He can easily turn to a horrific man from a spiritual, powerful and sensitive old man. Add to his wallet: the oldest oak, the beard his body, sharp eyes, tantric hook nose and of course, the longest scientific wizard cap. A perfect Gandalf, just like books. On the other hand, Ian McKellen's guilt is just too boring. He appears to be very human, so many people are noisy and very human and has no hat or knife. Yes a knife. In a book edition, Gandhil Scorsese was killed by a knife (he did in books). And that's the stylish slow motion murders. Confusion with Gandalf is not a force. And when I was sad to say this, great Christopher Lee Saraman did not let him live. <br /> <br /> Before going to the visual aspects of the film, there should be a reference to voice acting and simple construction. Orcs Jackson's pretendeous bad guys are also elite. The orcs of the bucket are constantly blaming their enemies (or each other) with screams, chatter and nasty languages. They are incredibly believable as demons and in my opinion the book is confident. Finally, black riders - or nazgul. Those ultimate bad guys are a scary ghosts - not just a few riders wearing black. And they speak with the sound of their victim mesmerizing. My favorite scene in this film is when I walk along Frodo near the Nazgool River. While Peter Jackson can not do anything, while riders are just chasing the party, Bakshi throws some dream of slowly motion scenes and a nightmare with the sky sky. Jackson's, second, only technically, is still good. And is due to some key visuals. The pool you know is covered with a mix of LOTR animated characters (all hobbies and main cast) and real actors painted. There really is no problem using real people in animation in this way, but they may not just fit with the traditional cartoon people. This is especially true with humans (Rohan's riders, tavern people, etc.) Orcs have a variety of things, since they are very distinct from other characters. When humans are played with an animation mix, Orcs is very high for the version of Jackson's. They showed brown-green skin, shiny red eyes, flat face and teeth. <br /> <br /> The screw-up, Harvard and Habits are the most popular visuals of these images. I liked almost every role in Bakshi compared to Jackson, while the other certainly has high hopibilities, in fact they are perfect. With Bakshi you get some frustrating and rather poorly manual Disney bambies. And you have to spend time with them, so be alert. Again, the voice acting is also great, but the actors' mouth can not save the "immersion loss" made by these small visas. Well, I've never really liked that half anyway. <br /> <br /> There are common failures in the Bakshi script. Limit time (with limited budget) and not too many scenes. While the film has almost half the story, it is not widely detailed compared to Jackson's version. <br /> <br /> The whole atmosphere (which is like Middle Earth) - the whole voice acting-music (I actually get the Fantasy score by Kant & Rosenman) - Orgon-Argan (one of John Hurt's best roles) -King Theodon-Orcs-Black Riders-Eileen (he's not some hippie here!) <br /> <br /> Jackson's version is much better: <br /> <br /> The Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi is one of the best animated films of all time, despite the well-known flaws and it is Tolkien The atmosphere of the fictional world is not well-rounded, but well captured. I give 10 to 8Â½ score.
