Artemia last night last. First I did not think I would like it, but I was still sleeping and it did not seem to be any more, I continued watching and young artmicia, a virgin, felt pure and emotional. Old Tassi envoked her sensual recognizable feelings. The film is based on a very romantic level and I am much more interested than normal biography or dress drama, even though not realistic. Great play, great cameras, great music and lessons. I enjoyed it and wanted more! :-)
