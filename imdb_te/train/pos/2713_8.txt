Wilson (Erica Gavin) is caught by Cops and sent to jail in this sensual and amusing example of a robbery of Prime Minister 70 directed by Jonathan Demme. After the teacher and producer of the new world films of the teacher Roger Cormans, Demi gave the opportunity to visit for the first time and provided only an image of nudity and violence and the only dose of delicacy, but it is attractive to the cheek quality of the tongue; <br /> <br /> There is also a leave and crude wadeville style act for prisoners in the standout sequences, and this is the top superintendent McQueen (a powerful dream / fantasy sequence) horror icon Barbara Steel, Excellent turnover). I also enjoyed a caricating scene where the bank theft scene was turbulent and ill. Like other films of this kind, it is also appreciated as a portrait of women's empowerment as pure exploitation. <br /> <br /> Here our attractive actors make all their characters more attractive: juniata brown aggressive maggie, Roberta sensitive threat, Collins like Rainboys Smith, beautiful and cowardly Laurele, Gavin Wide-cut newcomers, and Linda Gold (Anna Christine Sinclair) Such as a participant outside a bright show. When playing our climactic scenes, Deem Belle comes to the end of our heroes' breeding fault "to hit the clock." <br /> <br /> John Kalles' flavorful score, bounced to "Kajed Heat" is a fun and promising time. <br /> <br />
