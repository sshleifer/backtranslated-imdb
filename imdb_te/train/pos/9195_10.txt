I do not give much film or ten shows, but this show touched a nerve in any other performance. I found the entire series in nasozo.com and I looked at the observation so I found the campus interesting. I'm not disappointed in what I see; I moved. The story is tender, the main characters move us through scenes. Kyuki is thinking of human nature, because she wants to keep problems without showing herself. No one really wants to lay their soul before a partner partner. So she played Matsumoto cheese as a human substitute, a pet. This pet is like a pet, we consider it a pets. Difference; He can retaliate in the same way, not all the Momo is a man, not a dog. When he deals with a pet, the dog reacts to the circumstances. She spends time with her new boyfriend, Momo gets jealous. Momo is a dancing prodigy - which is when she realizes that sexual intercourse starts between two of her pet just a pet. Her idea starts slowly when we start to get at a glance at her own ideas. When Matsumoto first looks at a dimensional role, we see him as a dimensional when looking at a dancer, not as an individual, but as a person, as a person. In my opinion, it is worth seeing this story to see this character. Plus Matsumoto plays with MOMO, and with such sensitivity you also want to like someone. What about the future and how their relationship changes, but what is MOMO (the name given to her by her name)? We know we're not able to finish the two. See this presentation with an open mind, it's worth it.
