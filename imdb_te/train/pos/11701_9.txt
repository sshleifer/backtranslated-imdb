It's a great movie for all Generation X'ers. In 1972, America was a different world compared to our mental 21st century. If you went to America in 1972, you could get any sense by watching this movie. I have found that clothes and car styles bring me back memories of a better country than I am now. Just think ... then there are just 4 or 5 TV stations to select from. Aids, Muslim militants, road rage, 911, bird flu, freeway snipers etc. Vietnam War is the only one. Star Wars is 7 years ahead. The personal computer and the Internet are still 29 years away. <br /> <br /> When the film was first, producers had to put the film into the market. So it started touring smaller Protestant churches across the country, which was shown on film projectors (which were originally VCRS days before). To obtain a copy of a pastor's image of a church who is interested in showing a Thief in NIght to his congregation. He then arranges an evening to show up in a church meeting area or in a lounge. Members of the congregation are invited to "unprofitable" friends and family members, and it is a social event in the week. <br /> <br /> If you can look for the limited product values ​​of the image past and its nostalgic value, then I think you will enjoy more movie. In fact I was speaking Zener Jear. <br /> If I had a time machine, I went back to 1972 and told the 21st century to say goodbye.
