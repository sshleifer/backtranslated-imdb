I do not have any expectations; I never heard of Jamie Fox; I know some journalists will act in this movie. I thought it was very entertaining; Fun. This plot is different and unpredictable to have my interest. For me, Fox is a real one. David Morse is wonderful (true, this is not his best character). I helped make the film and fireworks the film and that's fine. I did not expect so much and I was very surprised.
