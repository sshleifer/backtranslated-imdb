You can understand the check, see it in the original language and help understand the chess invasion with 'Professionals', but otherwise 'Zedana Rukha Natlascas' is another great Czech film. It's funny, dark and very enjoyable. The highest rate I can pay is that you never know how to proceed in that second and third view. <br /> <br /> The Czech Republic for a small country is an incredible sum of cinematic and literature of the world class for Menzel, Saverk and many other films from Herald, Husak and Kundara. Czech humor is dark and often unyielding by its nature, but often it is lagging behind the innocent and warm sense. <br /> <br /> The film is impatient and deals with the lovely sides of the low man, but it's a beautiful story with a promise, good intent and optimism below. And other projects involving Trojan and Moussek. Enjoy it, this is just the film that's made for that reason - however, it's close to the fact that chess is really happy ...
