It was the last Dutch language film Paul Verhoven, who made the preparations for "Basic Instinct," "Robocop," and "Total Recall" of major Hollywood films. Before we met Gerard Revve, he set the stage by opening the story with a black widow spinning in his story, a self-centered author who was annoyed by an awkward imagination. Gerard was invited as guest speaker at an hourly conference or a literary community meeting from Amsterdam. Let's see how Gerard's imagination changes the originality. "Asked if the authors were a bit close to reading the newspaper," and 'Boom' I read 'Doom', 'red' when it says 'blood'. "When he tells enough of a story, he begins to believe it," I'm right. "He admits that he is the club treasurer, the owner of the nightly guest of the owner of a beautiful wealthy salon, when she realizes that her husband is dead, she is expecting her 'black widow' This is his mental drama in which his reality twist is more or she is a murderess? And I remember my oldest memories of my memory, I'm my favorite gender, Paul Paul Verhoeven has a lot of work at his body, and he has a master to question our own understanding of reality, which is a good change from the regular Hollywood fare. It's a movie "difficult."
