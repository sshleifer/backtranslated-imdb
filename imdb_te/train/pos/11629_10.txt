Red Eye Freddy Krueger, is a thrilling film by Wes Craven. Wes Craven Regular Hotel Worker describes Lisa's story. After attending her grandmother's funeral, she decides to take her red eye. While waiting, she meets Jack Ripperner, (how fffrreeaakkyy?) And they're sort of friends. Ironically, both sits next to each other on this plane. Then the horror starts. The movie is enthusiastic for the weak and heartless people who do not like thrilling and horror movies, telling them they can be quick in the pants. It's an excellent example of a bone shaking product. Wes Craven has done well with this film. Rachel McAdams, chooses her right actors like a brilliant, sexy girl who knows what she will do and is cautious when she plays in a movie. Silly Murphy, horror and horror actor, his amazing performance in the film can make his amazing performance in the wrong role, and his face can really improve your eyes. Wes Craven has done an awesome job and I hope he will do more movies for this film.
