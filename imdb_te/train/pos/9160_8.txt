In all the comments praising or annoying Dalton's performance, I thought he was wonderful. He does not play Rochester as a dude, but a princess, powerful man. I liked this version, but the shot on the video aspect sometimes caught the eye, and the scenes with Jane and St John were not too confusing. I give this a 8.
