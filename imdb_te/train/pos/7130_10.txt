Well, I'm not sure whether or not I can actually make my cup tea before I saw this film ... how wrong it is I! I have seen for a long time, I thought it was one of the true family classics. The story of young Evaquie and his new 'pet' father, the film exploded all the boxes. I did not read the book (it was a good thing & I enjoyed more movie) but in relation to the story, I can not really think of any bad points, so 10 to 10 (and I rarely ever regard any warranties as the best marks!). By the time Williams 'I ride my bike, Dad!' I'm suppressing my heart (who understand this, I'm sure). Really cheerful, and definitely recommended.
