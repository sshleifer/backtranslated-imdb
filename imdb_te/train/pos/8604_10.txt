I do not like this movie for most people, but I think it's adorable. I can not say much, but the film is a good picture I guess. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful and there are so many fun lines in this film, especially not knowing what to do with Brigitte. If you like music, I'll tell you that you like it!
