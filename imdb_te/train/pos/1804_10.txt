First things first, I was never scared of this infamous gem once upon a kid (on the other hand "Little Mermaid"). My title is one of my favorite childhood films, and I still love the young man. A lovely, sweet bitter movie about a misfit German Shepherd, Charlie (Burt Reynolds is wonderful), his employer / partner murders offense (where heck, hay cares). Charlie is sent directly to heaven because "all dogs go to heaven because people like dogs are naturally good and reliable and kind". Chale is sent back to Earth, where he closes his lifelong clock, where he is further mistreated with his best friend, Itchi and the little orphan girl Anne-Marie. I used to see this kid as a child and I'm still seeing it sometimes. Anyway, it's a pretty sweet bitch picture as I said before it was tears in your eye ...
