You can not say that Freddy Nightmares are cheesy and broken. You do not know better TV when you see it. Episodes are filled with drama and blood. Freddy creativity as he killed people. I love Freddy Nightmares and want to get all 44 episodes on DVD. Best Components: Saturday Night Special, School Days, and Love Sticks. If you want to suck this series you are entitled to your opinion but only remember your opinion and it means nothing. Freddy's Nightmares is always one of the best of the series and you will soon accept that fact. Even if you do not like it, it does not deny brightness.
