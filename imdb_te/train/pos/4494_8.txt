This film is clear to me as a Bolton-like figure. City scenes are fascinating and Bolton has a lot of transformation - there are many scenarios that do not appear to be obvious, but the town works to show rebuilding - and the idea to be older for the new is the heart of the film. The slightly misstated James Mason leads to a story of enjoyment in a story about a move on a herring, which becomes a full-fledged generational conflict, then a pleasingly schmaltzy clarity. There is a moment of Lancashire life in the 60s, although I am a bit too young to remember it: on Friday the cash, piano, Sunday constitution, good neighbors, the courage of the court, the importance of heavy self respect, and the funnel lines of Nutton. There is no doubt that this film should be available on DVD - it's well-made and many shows are well documented.
