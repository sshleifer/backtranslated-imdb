This is exactly what happened anywhere. Street entertainment that attracts the attention of the famous opera star and friendship. Old age entertainment finds a male child to go beyond its art. From there, we challenge them, but follow them through the harsh of free life along the river. While traveling to town to town, he had some degree of recognition. Despite the times and effects, the man is kind and good. <br /> <br /> In total, the first rate of performances, especially the street actress Zhu Zhu. The child (Chinese renewal) is beautiful and apparently strong, and breaks out the public prejudices. Apart from the help of a kind opera singer, Master Liang (an interesting interesting Zhao Zigong), the two main characters have painted a very interesting story of forgiveness, mourning and love. Some mention BA Wang BIE JI's remote similarity (Forward My Can Can); <br /> <br /> My majesty with the masque king ended. It is weak, cliche and subtle like a sledgehammer. The audience is already in the story, what is the unwanted manipulation? No shame. In order to bring out the best film, it is only handing over such emotional (and mourning) techniques. It clearly made this film better, instead classic, it should be. Next, the King of Mask is still well worth your time. I'm glad that Shah Brothers is still producing good pictures. Highly recommended.
