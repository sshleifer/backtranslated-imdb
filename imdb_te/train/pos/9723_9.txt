I really enjoy watching this movie! First, I saw its poster and I thought it was another simple romantic comedy ... but it's more than just! I personally believe (I think that there is definitely a good part of the viewers before seeing this movie) is another important part of the movie (or even its marketing strategy)! What I mean is: these days we are slaves to movies! Logos! I went to the movie to have the wrong impression, the wrong expectations of the film, and finally I thought how satellite! When he asks him to give an autograph, he believes that he is currently thanking the TV for the scandal at the awards ceremony, because he believes that Sydney would buy a plane ticket to go to New York to go to New York and eventually sign him for a ticket. And this is just what I believe, this main theme revolves around the climax. On top of this, I believe that this film, along with the film, has been solved by the film's attitude: You are not too confused about yourself or anyone ... "Even at the beginning of the saints people" ... Sophie once said in the movie. Saints stars of the moment. We call them 'the aura of perfection', eternal happiness, but less than the reality. Saints of any religion also include images, how to behave and how to live your life. Even they are not true ... After they died they became 'for real' and we looked back at them. And that is the catch: We need our saints! Our stars need! We must fight for them, even if not for them. And means to create and capture our strivings of television and all the other media. We desperately need benchmarks to measure. And how come we look at the film to watch this movie first: If we have a benchmark or see if the benchmark is smaller than us. This time is bigger than we expected.
