<br /> <br /> When troubled housewife is brutally killed by a hideous stranger, the victim's son meets a brilliant, beautiful, and compelling thriller from a great modern Brian de Palma! A prostitute who seeks killer. <br /> <br /> The worn to kill put a strong impression on its day audience and for good reason. De Palma creates a fantastic dramatic story that begins with a secret setup and creates a strong suspense mystery. The end and end is particularly 'nightmarish'. It's a really edge to your seat shocker. More impressive though, this film is firmly in the elegant direction of De Palma which gives not only suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own. Dressing to Kill is also a very romantic film, but is basically a fantastically beautiful way. Pino Donagio gives the film a beautiful musical score. <br /> Cast this cast. Michael Cain makes a wonderful turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickson is an unfortunate housewife. The performance of Nancy Allen as a street-walker involved is great. A young Keith Gordon also proved to be the valuable supporter of the investigating son. <br /> <br /> Many have criticized De Palma's paintings for having Hitchcock's element and the film is no exception. But no comparisons between Hitchcocks and De Palmas can be seen as good quality, the film 'Rip-Off' is a fine thriller. <br /> <br /> Out ****
