In voice-over, the Hughie (Billy Connolly), a roadside band of the great 70's Strange Fruit, struck at a rock festival to stop the set of Lightning Strange Fruit, saying there were 70 additional illnesses in God. In fact, it is known for suppressing the age of music, and looking punk as a welcome antidote. I'm a fan of the classic rock or glam rock, which I think is a long, strange reunion of Strange Fruit, and this film, and I like this punk One of the reasons behind these films is the public care behind the scenes. Brian Gibson is a co-writer and behind-the-music-based British TV Show Over the Rainbow, and lyrics Strange with Tina Turner, and directed by Diana Turner (I have problems with the dramatic episodes of the film, the music is well organized), authors Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais Froster played the fisherman's Mick Jones (do not get into the Clash's Mick Jones) Man As a co-writer, it is about meeting people who know what they are talking about. Also, the two actress actors do not know about their own right (Bill Nee I do not know about his own singing while musicians, and while he is certainly another British, Jimmy Nail looks like a lead singer of that era TV program, music-based, I forget the name , And he was in EVITA), and others convinced it. And, as I said, 70 bands like Strange Fruit have behaved badly towards most women, but the film does not make the same mistake (except for the woman below Timothy Spall); Juliet Aubrey as the manager of the reunion is very good and plays a fully rounded role. <br /> <br /> Other actors Stephen Rayya have a special appreciation. There are plots of unplanned plot points, but overall it is very enjoyable. Oh, and the music is very good.
