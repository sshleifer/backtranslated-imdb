> Contrary to many reviews I read, I do not consider this story more specifically after these other rock films ("Spintal Tap", etc.), but many people have been criticizing the "sex, drugs & rock and roll" group. <br /> <br /> As an American, I know some actors - Spall, Connelly & Ria. It is surprising to find "Brian" / Bruce Robinson in the gifted (<sp?) Classic "Romeo & Juliet". <br /> <br /> "Flame Style Burns" - My wife from Mexico did not follow very well with English / British language, some jokes jokes (which I thankfully thanked) but she cried with tears in the concert scene. <br /> <br /> I have Amazon.com soundtrack for $ 30 + USD when I bought a DVD in a bargain bin at WalMart for $ 5.50usd. At the disgrace price, I have seen the late night cable first and have since been dying to find it.
