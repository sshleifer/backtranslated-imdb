I have seen this film a long time ago, although it does not have any special effects, acting is very good. Although technology has changed, it still has the same message today, perhaps the reconstruction of the film, which is of interest to see the remake. I also enjoyed the music of the film, while Larry Norman was a good songwriter at the time, although many Christian music currently praises worship and music. I am interested to know what happened to the Patti after the end of the series. She went to make more movies, did she finally get married and raise a family? I want an update.
