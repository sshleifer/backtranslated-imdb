I used to love watching this. I do not know that I am a part of the big series. I have to be 6 or more at the time of the TV. I thought it was funny and for some reason I had a deep appeal for what was clear that I was the president of the snapdragon doll. My parents tapped this TV when it was first broadcast on NBC. This tape is old as well as some Sanka coffee. I plan to come back home soon and try to record tape on my computer for those who want a copy. If any of you wants to contact me, I think you can do it through the IMDb site. I will update you and you will know when I am in a digital format.
