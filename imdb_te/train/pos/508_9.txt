In 2151, in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, the farmer shoots Clingan Clang with his plasma rifle after a methane store explosion in his farming field and is sent to Klingon Starfight Hospital. Wulkan Ambassador Soval proposed to unplug the life support system and bring the corpse of his warrior empire Klaang to the planet Mars Kronos. However, Captain Jonathan Archer proposed to bring Climbing back to his home planet with his enterprise in his first voyage. Jonathan invited Hosi Sado and Dr. Flax, to treat Clang, to complete his staff, and Valkon sub-commander T'Pol was appointed to take part in the company's dangerous first mission. When the stars of the star ship are shut down, the kidnappings will be kidnapped after the shooting at the hospital. After the Suliban autopsy that was killed in the shooting, Captain Archer informed Dr. Flax that the alien reality is a transformation into a mutant, a sophisticated genetic engineering process. The T'Pol converts to the Sulliban spacecraft to track the Saliban spacecraft. The Klingons leaders have brought out an important message about the Temporal Cold War from Sulaban Sarin, revealing that Klaang is a courier and I do not follow the episodes of "enterprises" on cable television, even though Klingons is a huge fan of Star Trek. I decided to buy the DVD DVD for the first season and this first part surprised me. The adventurous of the first company, Captain Jonathan Archer, the gorgeous T'Pol, Reid, Mavweer, Dr. Flax, Hoshi and Trip is amazing, at least on this pilot. I realized that this episode was originally divided into two parts in the IMDb, but they are just one on DVD, so my review is valid for both. I did not like the music score theme, I found it very annoying, but this exception was in this great event. My vote is nine. <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
