I did not see this movie! At least not in its amounts. I have seen some haunting clips that left me gugging to see everything. Today is a sequence in my memory. An orbit (very attractive) spacecraft in orbit towards the dark of the moon. The pilot will release a flash device to make a photograph of the hidden surface under him. The moon goes to the dark. . . . And it's for a few seconds. Horizontal lines, squares, it will turn light .. then light fades and a short storm ... what happened ... the spacecraft has gone and has the time to come back to Earth. Wonderful. I have seen many other clips but I like to get the whole movie.
