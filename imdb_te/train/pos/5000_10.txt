The ecosystem in the United States is to be released on a different network or to have a full run of episodes. Unfortunately, this is not the case. American audiences (seemingly) have an eye on having comedy that does not have pornographic or have sketological functions (both sound and odds), such programs are very few and far between. One of the major issues is that it is very intelligent but is designed for a rare audience who needs to know what it is, but the audience and boardrooms do not have a clue what they're looking for. What's sad, but not unexpected. Although it was produced for the live broadcast DVD release, I liked at least three seasons in the show. There are riches with potential and mutual subdivision between creatures and other dialogues are only waiting for the surface below. But thanks for a political mistake, such conversations will only take place in my mind.
