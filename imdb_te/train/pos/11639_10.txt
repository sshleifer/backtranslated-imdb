I saw sophisticated screening for the film at night. I totally liked it. This film kept me on the edge of my seat at night. The cillian Murphy is a great deal of villain. Your character is very difficult when you see Batman Begins. He played his part well. Terrible "bad guy," I saw a little while. Rachel McAdams is great. Everyone in the audience laughed, gapped and enjoyed the same time, if we were in queue. Suspense is done by cinema. The end of that wonderful piece is not an anti-climatic. In the end I was disappointed. I felt satisfied. The trailer did not do justice to the film. This trailer is better than a trailer. Do not wait to get this movie on video. Let's see. Nevertheless, I do not have to pay to see this movie, I'm happy to see it 10.75. Have fun!
