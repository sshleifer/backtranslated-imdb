Bugs life is a good image. But for me, it really does not match movies like Toy Story and stuff. Do not make me wrong, I liked this movie, but it's not as good as the Toy Story. The film has visuals, smiles, and others having a Toy story. But the movie does not feel too much ... I do not know, but I still felt a beautiful picture. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have not seen Toy Story in years, but I still remember it. I did not review, but I did. <br /> <br /> I am giving it a thumbs though I can not do the best work. <br /> <br /> A bug is life: *** / ****
