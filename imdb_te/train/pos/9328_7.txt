The Perfect Sun is the two 30 brothers who are "accurate" and primarily a screw-up person, often dead in drug rehab centers. After their father's death, the two together have a long absence and are accompanied by regular sibling rival reconstructions. <br /> <br /> <br /> "The perfect" brother is a surprising statement that he has AIDS, which will allow the unassailable young brother to finally get his life and take some part of his life. <br /> <br /> It's a good job of chronicling the younger brother's "comeback", which may seem a bit remote at times (sometimes drug addiction is never too easy). The film's image is much more easily a treatment of AIDS, which has deteriorated in the last 5-10 years. And the development of almost all sweet relationships between two pre-war brothers is very believable and well done. <br /> <br /> The director and author Leonard Ferrin is a strong first feature, and his own brother dies with Aids. <br /> <br /> End
