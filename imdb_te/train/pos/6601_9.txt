This film is absolutely fantastic. A new blade runner - the future noir it is very awkward. <br /> <br /> Paris's vision is spectacular, splendid vista, grung set sets and futuristic virtual reality both excellent and fantastic. <br /> <br /> The story is very simplistic, some awesome, but I'm concerned about the movie. This is a visual treat. <br /> <br /> Complete in 3D and with black and white (no grace!) color with only one small space, it is less difficult than sound. There are many "arti" camera shots - close-ups and odd viewpoints - but it just adds to the nature of the movie. You will get feedback from a graphic novel in the form of footage. <br /> <br /> The film was initially filmed as a rotoscope, featuring an animation level and a high profile of the character's facial expressions. But not as "scanner darkly" - the definition of the irrelevant character (or actually improved) (note only some of the hair transformation shapes!) - The revival is stable and accurate. <br /> When the character is close, you can see the attached details and texture, but when the mid-shot or even the farther details are deleted, the role is not a loss of definition. <br /> <br /> For me, this is just a project to tell a single piece of the movie in one commentary. <br /> Oh, and the English dub is also great. <br /> I would like to see more of this futuristic film-noir storyline and especially cutting-edge graphic style. <br /> The great image and the most recommended are all.
