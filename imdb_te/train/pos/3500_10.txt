It's quite realistic because this movie works. This story is quite simple and realistic, to capture the joys and anxiety of many adolescents and sexuality that many of us have experienced in our teen years. <br /> <br /> The actors are naturally like dolls in a documentary and as attractive as seasoned performers. The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and thankfully cutesy do not fill up to the edge with pop culture references. Also, cinematography is simultaneously sandy and beautiful, bringing the lowest east side to life in a very important way. <br /> <br /> In this artistic level, I love this film, such as The Bicycle Thief and La Strada. Such films as "films" are rarely considered ... or like a bicycle thief. And the only other movie I've seen is Elia Kazan's gorgeousness in gas that treats teen sexuality on the same level of intensity. Author / director Peter Sollet deserves excellent praise. <br /> <br /> At the personal level, I am always glad to see a picture of love and respect with race members of the United States. As an Italian-American, I hate my own people (racist, female, plot, plot, and criminal offense in the plot) in the film, with my intensity in other counties and their awful silver screen representations. Hispanics and Asians play villains especially in Western and Action films. <br /> <br /> We see some more pictures of gratitude with the influence of indie films and the Miramax effect. The race characters are here and there ... but it is best to cultivate Victor Vargas. I really like my big fat Greek wedding, a refreshing change of Victor Vargas directly with Rising (with the most exaggerated and widespread characters) still being a lot of fun in her own right. Finally! Latino characters to note. <br /> Now, as he made this wonderful film about a family from the Dominican Republic, I'm a picture about the Italians soon! :) - Mark DiPaolo
