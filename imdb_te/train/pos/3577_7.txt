The film probably did not make a glow on the radar screen, but it was quite a bit of quality. It's a very lifestyle, yet you're just a movie. Duval and closure are portrayed by the general public, and they are now unable to recognize them as big-name actors. It seems that it's a little too old to chase Eugene's girlfriend in this story, but I guess possible. It is possible to travel from Kid Montana to Nevada, but I guess possible. You may think that the family problems in the film will never happen in your own family, but I guess it's possible. As I said Glenn Close, "The work you do is the hardest part of your life, but it's not."
