I read a lot of people who are discouraged by this film, which is compared to Part 1. Initially I understood this, but after a bit of thought I think they are wrong. Soderbergh started his life in Part 1, claiming Ke to life. Part 1 tells the story of a revolution that has moved from an endlessly beginnings to a successful conclusion. Part 2 tells the story of a revolution that comes from the beginning of impartiality to a completely unsuccessful decision. Soderbergh's mistake is that these 2 episodes have completely different outcomes in the life of Che. He chooses to tell both on the path to the brave straightforward. The spectator will feel much better from the movie after Part 1 than Part 2 but this is the reality of Che's life and my opinion director is no fault. This image is not accurate. It's probably too long. At least part 1 of the guerrillas wins, we have seen the various aspects of the war. In Part 2 they can not catch a break and we see their number is constantly shrinking by death and extraction. Che's abstraction and death are well maintained. The film was greatly improved by dialogue in Spanish. Benicio del Toro again looks amazing as an attractive Argentine. So if you see Part 1, it's very similar to the very different story in Part 2.
