We watched tonight on ABC in "The Wonderful World of Disney", and I ended up to be more stricter in the "mouse" than usual. <br /> <br /> When the movie was only 74 minutes, they had to publish a 2 hour broadcast television time, and I could not do this, and the business breaks from 6 to 7 minutes were minutes. In these commercial breaks, there was another statement in the guise of the "TV Show" organized by the Oh-So-Offensive Kelly Repa, who announced the marvelous miracles of "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True". <br /> Again, after a break break, Disney took the time from the real picture, trusted viewers, tell us what we needed to get a copy of the sequel. <br /> <br /> In fact, "Cinderella" actually maintains its magic, and "Cinderella" The original film, because commercial commercials are over. The story is still a good one, though we all have seen it countless times. This is a shame that they are all cheaper by marketing for what looks like a slick.
