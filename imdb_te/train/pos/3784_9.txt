One of the shortest films I have long dreamed of, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey was Bill II Preston's second happiest adventure. And Ted Theodore Logan, aka Wold Stallons. There are two ways for this movie: Firstly, you will see a mute conversation, a lot of theme, childish thinking. OR .. You are still brilliantly diminishing the senses that they find themselves in a very large state of mind. This plot will throw a Bruce Willis or an Arnold Schwarzenegger and make it a big blockbuster movie. Bill and Ted went on to the same level of confidence that was Bill and Ted. This is a tricky fence to balance, but when you find a movie that's not a throwaway screwball comedy, but adventure is an adventure that has two boys being a business, it becomes more and more.
