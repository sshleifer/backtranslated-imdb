The next-to-last episode of the original Star Trek series is an interesting, sometimes mournful instrument, which proves that the character still explored the character in the third season; Despite our fault, 'Our Uter Dates' has its moments and a moody, compelling feel. Kirk, Spock and McCoy's beam, due to the explosion in the Sun's hours of the planet, assume that they have reached Nikki to give some warning to some people or to warn them for some time. But it turns out, people know a lot of the fate of the planet there, and using a kind of time travel device, previously escaped. Each person is able to choose the time and places that he or she has lived in a library driven by elderly people called Mr. Atos. Autos is looking forward to these three people in the past and show different times for which they can be viewed by viewers. <br /> <br /> Where did the McCoy-where did he go? Atos - where did they go where they want? <br /> <br /> The misunderstanding is clearer, but not for the purposes of the plot, and soon Kirk was transported back to the 18th century compared to England. Spock and McCoy were sent to the ice age for the past 5000 years of the planet. From here, the main focus is his relationship with Spok and a woman who was expelled as a cruel tutor at this time. Spock begins with increasing emotional acting, and McCoy and Zarob will be angry with a deep love for the woman. He eventually realized that he could return to the ancient emotional state of his ancestors over 5,000 years ago. Kirk first goes back to the library, and finally Mr. Atos is not part of his planet's history. Zarobat will go back to Sparrow and McCoy before returning; As the sun explodes and destroys the Earth, Estherial will jump three up and increase the speed. The interaction between Spock and Jarbath presents the most memorable moments of this episode, but Kirk's adventure in the past is 'English' in the past. All in all, very good next day Star Trek is out.
