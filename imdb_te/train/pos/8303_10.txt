This movie is literally every movie movie clich√© and works for all of them. Gary Bassie Voicecorks, shoots and chicks from Strait Lethal Weapon is not helpful but entertaining and entertaining as such a reckless disregard of the film. Tanks, helicopters, machine gun battles, grenades and ice cream vans, and then do not have good reasons to watch this movie ... then Danny Trejo. And you probably do not like this movie if you do not know who Danny Trejo is.
