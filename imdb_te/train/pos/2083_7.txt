The film was portrayed by Hollywood in the novel by the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some people today seem to be gaining momentum, many of China's leaders are thinking and thinking about it. As I guess, I found that white actors who play Chinese are not so bad, it is not the same black as the Asian. By then there was no Asian actress in the US (George did not act as well) and Rainer had a good job with her. It's not a great show I've ever seen but it's nice to act on the old school's pre-method. <br /> <br /> I am surprised at the time of the release of the Great Depression film release that will transform the film into an authoritative form. Particularly, political upheaval farmers are annoyed and see how to get them all back. <br /> <br /> The film has some parallels like John Ford, but I think the eastern influence is also the same. If it belongs to the western family, eventually the locusts finally won the prize, punishing the farmer for his pride, humor, and gluttony. But here he learns his lesson, then wins.
