It is a great Canadian comedy series. The stars are Jean Paul Tremblay (Julian) and the head of the show and his friends Ricky and Bubbles How to make real life satire in trailer parks and Tracey Hoods. The film will tell you why Rickie and Julian make their more modern exploits into the criminal world. The reasons behind why and everything behind will be a spoiler so I will not give real reasons behind their more intelligent antics. Their friend and often time partner (bubbles) is a brilliant character. The whole program is amazing and does not affect the way you see a bit of sit-com. It's a comedy with a fantastic satire in the Capital Park and small time cruises with the capital C and short-time ideas but the trailer park with big time dreams. If you ever have the opportunity to see - buy - steal this program grab. You will be happy. And to my American friends --- it also makes you break. From 10 to 9. Gorgeous. How to TV TV
