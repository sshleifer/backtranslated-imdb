I can not tell everyone how much I loved this film. I read reviews that say this action is "very confusing" or "swimming in concrete drying." I do not have any imagery for these critics! For anyone who loves fantasy fiction, this picture is for you. If you ever loved playing Dungeons & Dragons ... This movie is for you (when you enter oriental adventure) I'm sorry, I can not see this movie on the big screen. (Just more inspiration to get my own big screen t.v. :-)
