I've given this 10 to 10 points. I love so much. I am 80 and fully son into heavy metal for many years. The reasons I like this movie are very much. Its boy (Judas Priest, Lizzie Borden Raven, Twisted Sister ...) and his vinyl collection (Excisor, Shock Metal Master Impaler and killing by mutants by killing the bad reminiscent of the posters in the bedroom so my business through the cool megadeth). Also the FASTWAY soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and fits the story well. If you are into the metal, then TRICK or treat your friend. Soundtrack and reputation 80 is the story that takes you back because Ozzy or Jean Simmons does not see or watch this movie because they are in the image of seconds, watch it. You're not the same guy later.
