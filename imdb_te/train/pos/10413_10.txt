I grew up with my favorite movie as well. Special effects are great for the era, and have won awards. I will remember the dialog I heard yesterday. It's just great, timeless adventure. Music is by far the best of Micklos Rossa. Sabu Thief. Conrad Wheat Grand villain. I'll have a copy for the next trip in memory of Lane. Oops! Rex Ingram wants from his Genie bottle!
