Guys and Dolls should always be one of my favorite music movies. It's a very fun movie to see and nothing. It was forgotten about people, not to preach or to preach. These days we have great music and good movies featuring rental and chicago, but they are not able to provide solid entertainment with any kind of cord. The only thing that hurt me in this film is Marlon Brando, Guy did not sing! When I did not understand him, it was very painful to hear him sing. I would have given this 10 stars if it was not for Marlon. Guys and Dolls offer old time entertainment, these days are rarely available. Watch to have a good time!
