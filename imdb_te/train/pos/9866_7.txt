Just ICE AGE, has seen a very funny and particularly good looking film. The story is very simplistic but effective, character-loving and simplified, but the digital set design really shines. <br /> <br /> When inspired by traditional animated films than reality, designs are really good looking at the world in an incredible use of color. Sometimes shine through the touch of reality (especially water is very impressive), but this is a fantasy world based on reality. <br /> <br /> Loads of wider landscapes can help reduce rendering costs. <br /> <br /> Pixor images are shining with the technological vibration, effective use of how to use this technology. Technical touch, image entertaining, family-friendly and sometimes just ridiculously funny.
