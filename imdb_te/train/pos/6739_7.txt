"Film Nair" is the most widely used expression in describing movies. Each crime play is a "noir". <br /> <br /> "Andrews' father (Tom Tully) meets, (Tearney), to save Dad from Old Spark, Andrews remaining <br /> <br /> The morally flawed cop is driven by previous motives, and his father was killed trying to get out of jail, but he did not take his actions, He was immediately blocking the phone to report the incident but he was back soon, but he was not already in the hot water and his career, then just at the wrong time, the phone rings say that Andrews partner and Andrews is not at home at home. He hid the body, and then guarded it <br /> <br /> His job is at risk, but now he has committed multiple crimes. At least I think they should have multiple. <br /> I count the oppression of the body without justice, invasion, obstruction, smoothing, first-rate courier, and false testimony against his neighbors. <br /> Finally, the root or not for Andrews. The suspect was not deserving to die, but it was not known that, after an accident, Andrews was a war hero and "had a silver plate on his head". Maybe it's what's blurry, and it's what's other things like distinct lighting. If Nair is black and white photography, there is nothing more than murder, criminals, mystery, and suspicious women, then we have to add all of those Charlie Chan movies. <br /> Andrews is pretty good. He was a bit out of the mark Macpherson (from "Lara"). While sitting in a restaurant table from Gene Ternie, he never laughs and rarely smile, it is possible to say laughter in many men. He does not have any sense of humor. Some of his enlightenments are enough. When he mocks a stool in a cab, "I was cautious, I would almost fall on my head," Andrews Repost said, "It's good that Cobb's insurance." Andrews occasionally appears wood, but it is a sturdy and humorous role, and he maintains it well. His underplaying component is perfect. Little twists or blinks are projected in his ideas and emotional states. I will direct director Otto Pimingsar to bullet "BOO-let" and police "POE-LIE." Never mind my mind about Jean Tirne. She did well in the role of Tom Tolli's daughter, a model, but you can not distinguish the habits taken from the real reality traits like her Marilyn Monroe. Does Tirene actually have an innocent, almost saintly personality? When she answers the phone at home, is she the same singing-along quality on the screen? Poor Tierney went through some bad psychic stuff, before the mediations were no effective for bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> DVD commentary by Peter Muller is unpretentious, informative and sometimes fun. /> <br /> However, this is a good example of good movie and movie noir. The bad guys are all good, but good guys, not all good. Opacity makes it a big picture instead of a popcorn image. For Kiddies, the single shot is removed on the screen and no head burst. Sorry.
