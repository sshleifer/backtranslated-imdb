Well ... Vivah is very good, but the distinctive Suraj Bajataya movie. <br /> <br /> The big plus point of the film is directed, music and Shahid and Amrita acting (which is not very good) especially the final scene). The film starts as an ordinary factor of Indian film - a girl who does not like her stepmother. This story is a bit common, but it's good, it's great to make the movie blockbuster. <br /> <br /> The simple story of the minus point Bollywood movie. Overall, I have to watch the movie twice, if you want to see the general Indian values ​​and courses of love!
