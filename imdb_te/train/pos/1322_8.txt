What a lovely image. Although it does not rely on real life, Forbidden Lies is an attractive film of a con artist in her element. <br /> <br /> Forbidden Love, Norma's writer was cheated in the media, but this action really gave her the chance. <br /> <br /> But she is convinced by the documentary producer by her twists and turns. No patient woman! I liked this movie. I have read the book but have heard good reviews and gone to see it in the boring rainy afternoon. This picture is the journey you are taking intelligent, interesting and completely engrossing.
