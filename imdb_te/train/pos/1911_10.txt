I love new episodes with CJ and Grandad - I liked the storyline with Kate falling for the lead. I want to know what happened to Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the next family. I think CJ is very funny and I love Grandad's scenes. I love James Garner, and credit for his performance that he believes that he can never think of James Garner or Rockford in the film and believes him as Kate's father altogether. This family is real and funny. This is horribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennes dies, but these things happen in real life, and it is written and operated in order to be funny and sad and always very sensitive and affectionate. Usually a very funny show with lots of fun and fun.
