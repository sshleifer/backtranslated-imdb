Perhaps I had to look at my head, but I thought it was a very good movie. CG is not too bad. The look of organisms (and the animals I mean is good and bad snake) is pretty cool. The action scenes involving the songs are great, I thought there were some flaws in the times, and the story never makes sense. But for a creature feature, it's much worse. Other creatures seem to be lifted from other films, so this is not entirely original. The essence of the story is original but it's very much like the likeness of Godzilla (Big Budget American Version) Like this movie, but I still pretty good.i also loved music.all I think 7/10 about Dragon Wars
