I have seen this movie a number of times and in my life, I do not understand why Babe is enough. The film is not about the mysterious life of all animals that can be secretly spoken. Instead, a young girl with a small stroom, about a parrot who learned to talk to her owner, begins to separate her speech from her. Then the great journey begins. <br /> Also, he meets many wonderful people and many evil people. He falls in love with the girl parrot and loses her. <br /> <br /> When a laborer in the lab tells his story, he agrees to help save his life and find his loved ones. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub is shining open-minded and big-hearted jaritor and decides to help little Paulie even though it's dangerous. <br /> There is a little suggestive language but this movie is quite right for children and it is more likely that parents join in. Very fun and watch. It's a witty, clever, epic animal-story story and a love story about Bird and his little girl in the end. <br /> <br /> Marie ends with a very unexpected surprise to the children seeing the wild green parrot species in Larry Angels and Pasadena. This film and meaning birds, especially parrots are not disposable pets. <br /> There is no one here that pets have deep attachments and the love and loyalty of the dog or parrot is a treasured gift. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know what to do,
