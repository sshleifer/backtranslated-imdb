In 1979, I was a young film student when the Soviet filmmakers came to Sofia Bulgaria and presented at Konkovosky's "cybersex". Tarkosvky's "Stalker" and Danelia'a "Autumn Marathon". I was amazed by the cosmopolitan size of art. Only then, I saw "cyberbad" for 4 and 1/2 hours epic and without speech. Bertolecie's "1900" is fine. </ Span> <br /> Hope that hopefully something is going to be negative and "the renewed version of the renewed version of the Directors" will do some day! Of course on DVD! And I fought hard in the film's defense against my colleagues, who had a bad taste of Soviet paintings! The time is on my side.
