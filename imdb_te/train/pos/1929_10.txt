I recently had the pleasure of seeing the Big Bad Swim at the FT. Lauderdale Film Festival and I have to say the movie is the best film I've seen all year and inspired me to write a comment / review. The film is beautifully directed and put together script with realistic dialogues, fantastic acting and exciting message. Ordinary lives have become an unusual in celebration of an adult swimming class and together with the variation of life. This film is clearly illustrated by the image in the first minute of the glamorous image, where we enter the pool and torso of people in different shapes and sizes only into the water pool. The film has been well-directed by actors with visual and imaginative visuals and attractive scenes.
