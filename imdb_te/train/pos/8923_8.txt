Blob is a classic 1950 B-movie science fiction film. See two teens (Steve McQueen & Anata Corsoot) hit a meteorite on the ground, and they look for it, and some weird ... an old man who adds his hand. They take him to the doctor's office and go to find out what happened. From there, the Blob has expanded, eating everyone in its path. The special effects cheesy is fun and fabulous. Like the police who plays a square in the radio, there is a lot of great tactics with police in another district. It's not a masterpiece, but it has a special place in its style. Steve McQueen is good. 8/10.
