This is the image to see someone who is interested in, kills or eating disorder. This is the awesome precise and delicate role of bulimia in teenage girl, its causes and its characteristics. Alison Lohan, playing one of the most intelligent young actresses in the film, is so great in 'Where the Truth Lies'. I recommend that the film be shown in all the schools, because you will never see this topic. Alison Lohmann is absolutely outstanding, and this is a wonder with the ability to express the pain of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder. Barretters tell us air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us emotional stress with the same level of accuracy. Her emotional range is very accurate, and every scene is measured as a microscope for the sequence of trauma at increased levels of epilepsy and desperation to reach intimidating intensity. Mary Winnieham is the best choice to play with her mother, and is better tuned with better sympathy and emotions in the role of Lahman. Together they create sensitive emotional odds that move with each other echo. This film is really a fantastic success, and director Kat Shia should be proud of it. If you are not interested in people, it's only a reason for not seeing it. But if you like nature films, it will be after all animal behavior at the sharp edge. Bulimia is a crazy form of how to destroy his body in a spirit of despair. And if we do not sympathize with people suffering from depression, then we are dead inside.
