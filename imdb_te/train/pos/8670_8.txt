<br /> WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Live from Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> Kane vs. MVP in Inferno match: This is the fourth worst match in WWE, which is Kane vs MVP (why is the first match on the card). When I was kidnapped by Kane MVP's donkey and then walking around the MVP arena, I saw only the endless fire spots. Refeers ultimately eliminated fire flames as it spread out around the MVP entrance ramp. Funny and very entertaining end of sight. <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: It's actually a regular tag team match with William Regal & Dave Taylor vs Brian Kendrick & Paul London (c). However, the GM Teddy Long ring comes and announces that a fatal 4-way tag team will match the ladder. MNM and The Hurdis were thrown out and it was all messy. One word to explain the opener to this eye ?? Wow. Man, I really can not remember how many unhealthy spots in this match and the words really can not do that. Hurdis has a special place where a ladder is seen and Jeff climbs the top rope when catching MNM to kill Matt, then WHAM! While Mercury's apparently painful, his face was bleeding like hell with cannons. He had to remove it and Nitro only continued this competition. Jeff London is another area where power is looming when striking the ladder. There are very high flying breathtaking spots to remember. London finally unveils the belt unbuckles this Rovers show steer-winning. <br /> <br /> <br /> Boogieman vs. The Miz: Two men thrown in and around the ring until the blowing of the sit-out powerbomb for the victory of bogeyman, then the mice will fall on the mouth. <br /> <br /> United States Championship: Chris Benoit (C) faces Chao Guerrero in another unique Guerrero contest. Some good spots have a high cord by Chao and an extraordinarily long chain of German saltles by Benoit. Wick Gyrero Benot arrives in the ring with a belt of belt, but Benoit frightens her and determines whether or not she should be placed in a sharpshooter. This allows Choa to go for a roll-up, but Benoit will once again rolls it up and Chao is locked in the Sheppshooter. The game is over. A good fighting fight even though slow at times. <br/> <br/> WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Gregory Helms (c) versus Jimmy Wang Yang in this moderate moderate-facing match. Are there some good high flying spots in the match? Especially the helms' moves from the top rope ?? But the audience did not appear after seeing this ladder and yang should get more air. Yang wins the match against Hanks Mong and won the match. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs. Mr Kennedy in the Last Ride match: After the two rounds, this is the last ride match, the second and winner of its kind, and must escape his opponent from a rare arena. It's good for both. Kennedy signed a good dealer's dealer and dropped a choxlum to throw a bucket from Armageddon, 15 feet below; And thanks to God for Kennedy, otherwise it's cruel. Kennedy succeeded until Ticker was purged (I liked the camera view inside to hear). Later, Teker Kennedy encircled the steel pipe and broke the window of the sound instead, but later Kennedy opened with a chair, and then placed it on the roof of the sands with Choklem and Tambstone. Kennedy was in unconsciousness and Tecker won him arena. In fact, I would love to give these guys the real sickness shots. <br /> When Santa gets into the ring, I say "What hell?" Like most kids in the audience, and then the word "lingerie contest" gets in my ear. Break time. <br /> <br /> Batista & John Cena vs Finlay & King Booker: Charisma vs. Talk about technology. The match was actually a good team, turning it from one team to the other and retaining a good suspense. Even Finley won his legal good shots at this time against his rivals (hesitated his strength against the champs), and his and booker did not succeed while trying to fraud primarily, except in the context of the bursting of his image in the voice of Buckar Cena. Batista hit the bomb on the bookkeeper for failing and could not see the F-U; The SEN 5 demonstrated the duplicate shuffle at any time and he also made the STFU. It was probably the best technology competition for the night and was unable to make the participants 7.5 / 10 without a ladder. <br /> <br /> As a WWE fan on and off, I agree that there are many eye-catchers across the Armageddon, and the Ladder match eventually devoured half of the show; There are some nerve spots in the last ride match, and the main event has done well for its category. All other matches also lived up to their billing, perhaps Boogieman vs. The Miz bout and the usual underwear competition. Although the whole Armageddon is a very enjoyable pay-per-view and some big setbacks before the PPV timeline, Armageddon wishes this year's farewell greetings. PPV Rating: 8/10.
