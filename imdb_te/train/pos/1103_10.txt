The film features a great humorous dialogue and memorable quotes, built on a film! The plot is somewhat lacking, but happiest criticism is enough to make a difference. It is a timeless picture of all ages. It is quite entertaining as a cinema art form; And with famous stars like Carrie Grant, Marna Loy and Melvin Douglas ... how can you make a mistake? <br /> <br /> Time is like a comic dialogue and time, and it is very difficult to imitate. A good example of the film was in 1986 with Mocofe: The Money Pit, Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent of the stars and the physical comedy, the film received poor reviews and viewer comments. Reaching a real funny dialogue is an art.
