Excellent Arabian adventure. A former king, Ahmad and his best friend, thief Abu (who played the Sabbath of Black Narcissus) explored for Ahmad's love interest, who stole the new king Jaffer (Conrad Weidt). The moment down here is rare. It always invented new adventures for heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess quite a bit boring (Ahmad's starring John Justin why not need to ask why there is a fourth list in credits). Conrad Weidst, always a fun actor, makes a great villain, and Sabu is quite as fun as the prince of robbers, who finds a genie in a bottle at a time. I also love Miles Maleson's beloved Basra's Sultan, the father of the princess. He collects amazing toys around the world. Jaffer bribes with a mechanical flying horse for his daughter's hand. This is probably considered one of the greatest children's movies, but these days special effects are awful. When Abbau and Genie are on the screen together, children strangely suppress the supermodel images. And the scene with a huge spider looks particularly awful. Although the younger generation probably feels that King Kong was bad at this time of time, Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times more than a puppet in a string that does not even look as a spider remotely. 8/10.
