<br /> <br /> I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival in the small 200-seat film on the main building at Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely in this. I love the combination of fantastic scenes that I have done. It has excellent set-design. <br /> This music is very good. <br/> <br/> I would rate this experience 9/10. <br /> <br /> The documentary tells about blues-people, black-and-white old-looking scenes such as guitar and singing to a black man. It's really amazing. But it also combines into new bands and may be something that I do not like in this documentary. These blues songs are the most abundant use of modern connections to modern rock bands. I really did not really appreciate the way they were playing such wonderful blues songs. <br /> <br /> In this early screening of short films, the next day in the documentary The documentary of the film shows Crocyt's beach and everyone to the general tourists. The bad quality of the sand, projection quality and sound is probably the hardest experience for thousands of people sitting in the sand that night.
