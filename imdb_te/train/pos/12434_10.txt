This made the correct balance for the first film in the proposed series. This is done with a style and class that shows the early days of Modesty, which began to be a refugee and criminal in the criminal world. I think her character is a very honest / true character, as I'm intended by the writer Peter O'Donnell. Alexandra Staden Modeste is a beautiful and wonderful option. She works very confidently with the hardest surviving survivors outside the cold / intellectual / innocence. To choose an unknown actress for the character and to complete the Tarantino full marks - creating a new face part of creating more. I look forward to the next film.
