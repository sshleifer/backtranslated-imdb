I do not waste time reading my review. Go out and see this surprisingly good episode, which could be the best of the best ever written! Ruth Gordon perfectly portrayed her son's law murdered by her daughter to retaliate for her murder and a lovely mystery writer. Colombo is his usual rumplade, ridiculous and over-embraced-he is self-conscious, and this special install has an amazing chemistry between Gordon and Faulk. Ironically, the creators it published have not yet been written by Leavinson or Link, but it is still the most dense, highly original and twist-laden Colombo plot. Almost every section is satisfied and filled with dots and witty conversations and ideas. The really unexpected and innovative climax is topped. 10/10 ... Netflix seeks this!
