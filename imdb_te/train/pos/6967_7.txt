Prequel for the Battlestar Galactica series re-imagined from the same creative team Ronald D. Moore and David Ikk and the new series co-creator Remi Abbachan. Capricorn has been in twelve colonies in 58 years before the events of Battlestar Galactica. In addition to its human drama, the new series explains crucial steps to become a species of sylon. <br /> The pilot and series are two families ready to follow; In Gracestone Daniel (Eric Stoltz) is a computer genius and corporate businessman and his equally magnificent but rebellious daughter Joe (Alessandra Torsen), a lawyer in Adama, and her son William Battlestar Galactica's future Admiral. <br /> <br /> In Battlestar Galactica there are some great talented actors like Eric Stolts, Esai Morals and Polly Walker, as well as some very talented new actors, such as Alessandra Torsen and Magda Apanowitz. <br /> <br /> Battlestar Galactica fans have similarities and sequences with that series but this is quite different. Pilot has at least some science fiction items but a small part of the series. Capricorns also have retro feelings when reflecting a more technologically advanced society, which can be achieved by some structures, textiles and the way it is painted. <br /> <br /> Some of the significant differences in ranks are very familiar to some, religion is again the most important here, and the rarity of the rarity rarely touches the BG. Whether we have the existence of a soul and a machine, and even touches terrorism with issues related to crime and government. <br /> <br /> This version will begin in 2010, when the pilot DVD is released live and broadcast before being broadcast on TV. <br /> <br /> Like the Battlestar Galactica, this series is filmed in Vancouver
