<br /> <br /> I recall about the Suu Hark's original Xu Warriors I did 18 years ago. In the rare week of Channel 4 Hong Kong movies in the UK, the Juva Warriors is playing a very young audience and his brother and very memorable, now grown memories <br /> In fact, I was one of the earliest films I saw as the original Juveniles Warrior I think. <br /> When I saw the remake of the Jua Warriors, there was a feeling of fear. <br /> <strong> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> The answer to the well is I can not say. But this is not really a remake. Stories (and styles) are completely different. <br /> <br /> The Legend of Zu tells the story of King Sky, his solo warrior, Don announced his love for her but her life was taken from a monster called Insomnia. Two hundred years later, Insomnia returned, Don Einigma was restored, and returned to destroy Insomnia Ju. <br /> <br /> Try the white eyebrows and red with the help of King Sky to stop the insomnia of the plot. <br /> <br /> This plot is not full of twists and turns, but there are enough details to keep me keen. But you can see whether you love this movie or you hate it. The film is related to very special effects, with most computer-generated surroundings, such as The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two, this film does not overdo the graphics and the whole thing is one tasteful. Nothing looks like move - unlike the hero. Backgrounds are perfect for performance and do not help all scenes. <br /> <br /> In this story there are many characters and the film is intrigued with the combination of many people. It was on the verge of 'cookie', but generally each part of the story is part of the story. <br /> <br /> Eccan Cheng and Louise Co have played very central roles in this film, but some characters in this role seem to be my 'Extended characters', but I can not show their best performances. Cecilia Cheung seems to have gained momentum in his performance, but it is very raw. Kelly Lynne is my new revelation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed this movie with an 'original' experience. The two films are made by legendary Tui Hark, both of which are part of a history of how the film was made up for two decades in Hong Kong. And that's a beauty is the fact that you can not really compare the apples and all the two films that feels like two apples and pears. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are two full enjoyable movies right. <br /> I'm going back to memory by looking at the original again. <br /> <br /> Watching two, but not comparable.
