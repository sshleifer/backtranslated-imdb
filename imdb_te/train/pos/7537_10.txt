In contrast to those who hate Christianity, the 700 club offers real answers as well. It also provides reliable news, logical commentary and a different view than ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS. Unlike other programs that provide social and loyal commentary, those behind the 700 club have provided medical assistance to those suffering from poverty with those who are hungry with Operation Blessing, who have the hope. It's not all hateful. If the 700 club is disturbing you, I suggest you switch to a remote control and change the channel on your TV set. When I get the CNN headline news or when it comes to that thing, I'm doing the same thing as being biased or objectionable. I choose the ABC Family Disclaimer that 700 clubs views in the ABC family do not reflect the image of the ABC family.
