I found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to drown in the middle when I tried to make the head or tail of who and why it was fighting. One of the problems is cultural / language. Here we have Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese issues, we are small and we just read the English subtitles because some of the delicate sensitive ones. Another problem is that only half of the turns and coincidences are described. Nevertheless, there is a completely Miyagi film and it's not exactly. Stylish and bone crunch is plenty of violence, plus a window on fewer than traditional googling over family aspect. All in a good ride but perhaps this one may be really helpful to check out the storyline before watching one.
