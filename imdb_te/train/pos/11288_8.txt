I thought by most of the critics that Johnny Weissmuller considered the best of Tarzan films, but I do not have any argument. One thing: the longest in the series I saw in 105 minutes. I saw only six of them but it was longer than I used and I thought the entire thing was too long with the draw-out action conclusion. <br /> However, a good mix of action, suspense and romance. The only things that do not have color and stereo sound. <br /> <br /> The primitive-effects I did not bother with, because they returned in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> This film is very important in some of the films: Skin! "Jane" was never worn this time after the movie Tarzan made after Hays code. Her dress was shown by a great man with Maureen O'Sullivan. Naked underwater scene, she's not - through a long-term. <br /> <br /> There are many activities here. Until the end, it was not overdone either. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Tarzan in the movie, except for "Boy" (their adopted son) - the film is still about everything, and O'Sullivan has done a dozen times on his Tarzan El. She does not have a problem with a pair of "lungs".
