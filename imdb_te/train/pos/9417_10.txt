A simple, delicate and lean film "The Man in the White Suite" is another breath of fresh air in filmmaking from Ealing studios. When I suspect that some modern audience initially suspected it was suspected that many experts had failed impressively on the platform, themes and characters were featured during the film. <br /> <br /> Alex Guinness gives another good role in a film that is not clearly credited as Ealing's inspired "Kind Hearts and Coronates" since 1949. At this time, he only plays a character of eight, but the most profound inventor and scientist finds the right tone and expression as the Sydney Stretton. In addition to guinness, the subtle, expressive display, the rest of the cast is effective. In major players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiser stand up. Though Parker is an ineffective and crucial mill owner and father, Thysger is inconvenient to be a broken but influential business winner. Joan Greenwood, deftly joking actress father at the peak of the film. The bright and seductive of the anger and depiction, she is the most spectacular in this movie, as well as the extraordinary, but more contrary to the more maladroit guinness. <br /> <br /> When she both attempts to search for her, the pair is very experimented with, which is both deeply sharp and fun. <br /> The themes are much lighter. The complexities of relationships between science, business and labor force are examined seriously and happily. Helminid by Alexander MacKentique with skill, the film is technically well-received in all areas; Accumulated photography, appropriate sound effects and music and majestic script, all quietly impress. Amazing satisfaction image with Guinness and Greenwood. <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
