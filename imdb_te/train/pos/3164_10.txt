I can not believe that we have no more than 70 shows. I have a total of eight seasons for 70 seasons! I absolutely love it !! Every night before going to sleep I see several episodes. It is good to leave it back and have a great laugh at the end of a long busy day. I'm so sad that I am airing ... at least we're running again !! I'm hoping and praying will come back at least with a reunion ... maybe Donna's ending to college and we finally have to make her and Eric married !!!! That is not a miracle! It will be even better if they continue for many years !!
