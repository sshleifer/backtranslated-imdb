Yes, as other critics have already said, this may not be the oldest L & H but in the 20th century stupid it is far from their worst work ... I mean Fox. The film has absolutely all the basic elements for things that are wrong for boys. But their funny approach and their decision to make them funny. They do not play for laughs like other comedians but they take their work and the situation very seriously and there is a summary of their eternal humor. In this film, they really faced some basic problems that really encountered by any one of us today, ie job-related stress. First, we'll check a physician and he suggests some very much needed rest and possibly staying by the sea. Surrealism comes to all of this. L & H always takes a very acceptable set of circumstances and it exaggerates, but can not believe it just a little bit longer. This laughs at us, because we have reasons for their self-evolving and abolition attempts. Stan and Olly are the universes of their appeal. In this film, all the material is presented as a delightful and arcane and flattering way. They are not the best of their previous work because they are the last film they made for Roach because he wanted to reflect "big" studios and specifically make them and make them fulfill their contractual obligations. Big mistake! They both stayed together and stayed for five years. They missed the world because they did not consider their choice. See, laugh, and enjoy their last great performance.
