<br /> <br /> Maitis, a bridge over a single night in Riga, passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge. He goes without a word. After a splash in water takes action after a growl for help. <br /> <br /> The film explains his efforts to learn more about the woman. On the lure of the local bars, he finds her Pocket book. He makes a big part of his life together. His "look" changes like his invasion will increase. He has to correct things. <br /> <br /> In a brilliantly painted dialogue with "Bastard ex-boyfriend", he wants Alexei to face the offense. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Footsteps. Lovely movie noir with lovely twist. Good indie is out.
