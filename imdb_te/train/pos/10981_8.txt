Hey, right now, it's home to me, because the theatreaks, in graying through videos in the flea market, was almost in a new state, and learned that it was somewhat "cult hit" when reading the box. <br /> <br /> What a weird image. Former First Lady Jacqueline Bovier Kennedy Onassis's cousin and cousin raccoons, cats, fluds (iris) and living in the living room living in the Island (Suffolk Co) 28 know what to share. Saffcock Co. All of them were once in the slum and old jockey came to set her right. However, it's a strange pair, Big Eddie and Little Eddie ... Eddie (daughter) always wears something on her head and dances, sings, and rarely gives a small sideways to the camera that makes it very sense. Big AD (mother of age 79) clearly prefers to run naked, and we get the instructions that are shown in gratitude. These women speak, speak and speak, mostly about the past, and excluding them, it does not fully feel. Wherever they live, cats live their business ("Look, that cat goes to the bathroom behind my image!"), And a bedroom is the center of their activities. I close my eyes and listen to Big Eddie's voice, which reminds me of my own last aunt, from the region's area and the Lawn Geylain accent. Little Eddie, Flee repellent in a scene, is lovely, all the cats look all the time, so this place must be the seat. The box refers to these two women as "exceptional" and in this case I say that they are a euphemism for their ridiculous folks, but the film is really something without its motions. It is creepy, sad and frustrating in equal parts, but when I started I could not stop seeing it. This is not my "normal" image but I found it to be somewhat lovely. This is not for everyone, even though it is guaranteed.
