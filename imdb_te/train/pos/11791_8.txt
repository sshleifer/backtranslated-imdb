This is a very witty short film by David Lynch, and the name David Lynch fits most people. This is your typical Lynch small. A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. <br /> <br /> This is a small mulchland doctor, my dear one The movie, so I also liked this novel, which is probably especially for Lynch fans but you might like it.
