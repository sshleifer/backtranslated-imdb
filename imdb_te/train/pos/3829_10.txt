This is a wonderful memorabilia that this weekend shared between literary rods. Mary and Percy Shelley, Lord Byron and others created an amazing group. Showing their discoveries for sexual enlightenment. Individual freedoms are politically ethical. Drug use for both stunts and addiction. Their creative views on life and writing. Each author explains the viewer without boring, explaining how to find their muse. Apart from every share of distractions and love. But with a landscape that does not look enthusiastic but increases the story. From the very calm then created terrible characters to be angry and loving. Has helped to enhance some of the most fascinating and scenes.
