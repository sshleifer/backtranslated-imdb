The film opened to poor performances in the first few weeks. Meena Kumari was dead and this was just the way to all the people. The songs in all Indian radios, especially the logo, were played on behalf of my behalf, while I was ill at them, even though their beauty was recognizable! <br /> <br /> Yes, I did that year. Because the marriage is very happy and Kamal Amrohi is hard to make money to earn money; Looking at expensive sets and dresses, do not be surprised !! Meena Kumari drops old and ill but listen to Lata Voice carefully. Ino logo Neh has her 50 year old voice, and the recording tracks, such as the Cholo Dilder Chawl, are clearly visible. I want someone else to see the songs that are not included in the film, I am going to change some of the songs that are less and less than the publishing of them. In recent interview Lata (2007) is one of the best composers she has ever worked with, unlike Gautam Mohamed Madan Mohan (a great personal friend). Note that you can not see the cast in the chalo dalder songs too. Rajkumar's short shot from the middle distance is only and can be seen only by Meena Kumari. Kamal Amrohi is essentially an enthusiastic and focused on the stars and the moon. <br /> <br /> There are many movies in this film. <br /> <br /> In the previous film, I was different. Barasat (Old), Devdas (Old Versions), Bandini, Do Bigga Jamine, Garam Hawa, Daastak, Gudi, Aiyan, Piaasa, Kagaz Ke Phool, Abbhaman, Guide, Sujatha, Bombay Ka Babu, Dog, Paranitha (Old), Umrao John etc. Etc. And if you value music more than the story, list to Bassat. <br /> <br /> Have fun with Pokeja but do not miss any of the above. .
