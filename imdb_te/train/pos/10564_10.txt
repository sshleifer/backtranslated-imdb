If you stop the knowledge and pace and the three shows Busby Berkeley numbers, it puts you before the over-rated 42nd Street. This is the 30th stage musical performance from Jimmy Cognci's Knockout frantic performance. One of the final releases before the motion picture production code is definitely executed. Must see.
