"Johnny Dangerous" is a sort of hit and miss comedy laughing and "huh?". But I suggest giving me a chance. I saw a lot. This film does not offer many people. It works. Just think of a small simulator of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. He's going to do well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to live. He works his way up with a beautiful wife from big owners. And of course like a lot of mob movies, someone wants him dead. 90% of jokes get a smile. Like I said, give me a chance. Just a fun mix by taking your Favorite Gangster Movies you have "Johnny Dangerous". <br /> <br />
