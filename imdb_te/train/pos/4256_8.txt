Such a joyous movie! Very warm heart rate. You can not help fall in love with Gigi's character. He develops as an adorable and sensitive artist in childhood. The whole movie revolves around him. Does he live in a wonderful world? Who lives all life ?? Curiosity, desire and anticipation. His brother tries to steal his fame, but his life is in the whole shade. The father is very stereotypically Italian and so is the mother. Was the father wanting me to come back with my father in the last scene? And have them cry and laughter. I also wish there was something ransom about elder brother. His personality was completely stolen. Love and passion ?? That's key to life. And looking through the camera ?? Take into account the small details and taste the sensitive details of life.
