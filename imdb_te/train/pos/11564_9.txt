I have seen this movie many times and wish to give bad writers to ten people but I think it's unfair to other good films. However, I think this is one of these rare gems: perfect comedy. I will venture one of the greatest funny films of all times. Matte and Lamman are perfectly fit and unmatched. The script is so sharp that you need to stand to bleed. The story is well known and is already described in other comments. Two Leads give outstanding performances, the girls are amazing and are splittingly funny towards the conditions. Not only in sight (find Hollywood, you do not have to be funny, you need to be keen) and move from picture to foot is seamless. They can not do such things earlier. Timeless.
