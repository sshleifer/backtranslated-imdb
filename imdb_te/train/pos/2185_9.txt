Poor Basil Rathbone, an inconsistent composer who lost his maiden. He has duplicated it for a while, from various sources to buy his lyrics and his music. Two sources (Bing Crosby Music) and (Mary Martin Words) meet and fall in love. And you know what they're doing. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing scary. Mary Paramount signed, while Crosby's Croft Music Hall regularly doubled in the radio show. I can not understand, she did not take a movie audience, so she went back to Broadway and lived in 1944 with a touch of Venus. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone times he played well with humor. <br /> <br /> His ego is constantly discouraged by Sidekick Oscar Levant and is again surprised that they did not make more movies together. <br /> <br /> A large number of crosby's paramount vehicles, the largest number in the title tune, made the previous reviewer an impromptu jam session in a pawn shop. It's a good job. <br /> Surprisingly the original plot and great entertainment.
