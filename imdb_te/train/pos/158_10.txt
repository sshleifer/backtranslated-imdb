I have seen this movie once, and anyone who complains about the plot after "clear construction". <br /> <br /> How is it that the two girls (Timothy / Hummer) meet again and again have a very unlikely story, which is very good reflected in another, more impassioned story for girls casting. This film is a journey between truth and fiction, about the likelihood, about the past or future events, which is more than genuine concerns. It is a reverie, varieties - so there are a lot of motives enough, Freud may have found interesting for his dream analysis, like all "Doppelgger" -systems. <br /> <br /> Also, I think "Gespensster" is interesting when compared to the exceptional current Asian films: Pepzoll's everyday urban architecture has also come to haunt us in a simple and strange manner. This film is not clear. I can not say clearly about the nature of "Gespensen" to describe the story of two girls who meet two girls and eventually become friends and lovers or describe the story of an orphan mother who searches Europe for her lost daughter.
