The film does not have the most fun parts, mostly just the most fun parts, but it does not really contain any parts that are really bad. The worst part is Sid's voice. His slothy slur is very much for me. I was sick to hear him for about 5 minutes. The film is good from the rather annoying slat voice. If you catch them, the image will be much better. This is a good image for kids. Adults have enough of it to keep the content and it's enough for kids to entertain. If you have children, mirrors with them must be rented.
