I actually enjoyed this program too. Even a young man is interested in sports and that horse racing. It is always difficult to do a series based on racing on corruption and at the same time gets permission from race tracks to portray on this controversial topic. I remember one episode centered around the horse that I expected to win a big race especially seeing a bit of color. A syringe was found on a stable floor and everyone thought it was inxicated but there was nothing in blood tests. All too late they did not doping the horse but the knee cartilage was removed. Like the oil and the engine occupying the car, the horse has failed with tragic consequences.
