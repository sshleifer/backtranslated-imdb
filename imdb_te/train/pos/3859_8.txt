Paul Verne's De Viered Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most constructive thrillers I have ever seen. It's really pleasant surprise. In this story, two-legged writer Gerard (Jeronna Crabb), who is associated with Christine (Ren√©e Sausesdick), a beautiful hairstyle, but the story is more intense in the heart of Gerard. Verohevn and cinematographer John de Bont created a beautiful and thick atmosphere with surreal and chaotic sex imagery, which really pulls into the story, you do not want to see, but you can not stay away. Earlier Verhoeven's best film (probably the second for Robocop). True the Fourth Man is not for everyone, some sex sequences are very grateful (just ignore them, but believe me, if you look at at least ten minutes you will be tied up.It is one of the films you want. Hoccock tradition, a comprehensive, controversial and breathtaking real hoodwright how it ends I know that I have to learn about it I like the metaphor. <br /> <br /> 8/10
