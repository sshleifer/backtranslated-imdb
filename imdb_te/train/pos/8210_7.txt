Clint Eastwood, who played Dirty Harry this time, recalls his role in Vigilant (Sonra Locke), who killed many of her children and her sister raped at Carnival several years ago. Eastwood plays its role and the film is basically a more actionable act, I'm not complaining. Sudden Impact is really enjoyable.
