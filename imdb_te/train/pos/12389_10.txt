I've seen this over and over again, normal, run-of-mill staple boredom to see Halloween, hoping I could get my horror juices flowing again, "Sentinel" took a chance. You look, I come back from looking at the Dark Castle remake of "The Haunted Hill House" - full and completely rubbish. Fortunately, "Sentinel" stay away from me! In a storytelling story about a model moving in a creepy building in Brooklyn Heights, the film gave me everything I'd expect - a comic and ironically juicy characters, exchanges and dialogues, Christopher Walken, Jeff Gold Blum and most importantly, Martin Balsam, an absenceist psychologist - 2) Fear of horror! I do not give a frame, but the scenes in this drama are cool to my prankis - (3) Excellent Gore, excellent makeup from the Michael Winner and the absurd (very uneven) direction flows out with this dubiousness. If you love "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - this is your favorite queen. Just asserted my love for the film - the first time I saw it, the jaw-dropped, I pulled it back and looked again. This is now one of the favorites of all time. Make yourself a favor and check it out!
