I saw this movie and I started looking at its characters, I think it's a fantastic movie. And when you come to that feel and the film really fills those expectations. I have many feelings throughout this film. Robert Denario and Cuba Gooding Jr. played both Oscar-worthy inspiring and awesome strong parts. The supporting cast is strong enough to create the winner's foundation for an equal footing. I can say without any hesitation, this film will not disappoint.
