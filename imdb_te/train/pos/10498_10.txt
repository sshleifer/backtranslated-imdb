It's a bit easier. About it. <br /> <br /> Graphics are some of the clean and realistic, where fences are only 2d, but it's a forgery. The rest of the graffiti are cleaner than the golden eye and many other N64 games. The sounds are awesome. <br /> <br /> The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it is the same for every platform game like Bonzo-Kajui and Donkey Kong 64. I have been a Christmas player in 1997, and since then I have earned 10 times more than 120 stars.
