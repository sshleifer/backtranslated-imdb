Recalling what I saw earlier this year when I first came, I was standing by Parker Posey's performance. And the image itself looks great. For anyone who has spent a little time in the nightclub / later-hour scene, this movie has a special appeal to you. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the role of Diaz (I remember every struggling DJ I knew). <br /> <br /> Many movies in this movie are required to be responsible without being bored and not boring. <br /> Babagoshosh!
