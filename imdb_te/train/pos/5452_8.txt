The front-code stunner with Stanwick plays a dirty prostitute who sleeps on his side. No one can ever go to predict those early hooligans. Stanwick is very unusual for Lilly, the daughter of an awkward owner / father who sells more than his booze (Johns) booze .Bar loses his way up into the old town (good!) For a good old man. John Wayne makes a poor "kameo" and proves that the actors are better with age and acting coach. I liked the silent and strong lines between the actors. I recommend this film to all film fans and watch Stanwick, who is great and beautiful as Lilly.
