If there is a genre that I have never been a fan of it is biopic. Always misleading, fraught with false information, more dramatic scenes, and surrounding tricks, biopics never work properly. Even in the hands of true talents such as Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often make a great deal of dissatisfaction with people who are trying to catch on the screen. Skepticism takes the high-speed position with biophysics that differs from big screen and notary betty pages. Some critics and filmmakers have objected to Gretchen Mole's role as Bettie Page, who is no longer a celebrity and does not have chaps for this role. I doubt Mole can handle this role anytime, but when I saw the film a few hours ago I ran away to his performance. Mole Abuse After the early life (who is subtle and tastefully done, some of the directors may possibly do) the iCONIC 1950's pin-up girl becomes more precisely talked about all-time designs that provides a knockout Oscar worthy performance. There is still a feeling that there may be a small part of the story missing, although the film still has three subplots at the time of its 90 minutes running. Director / co-writer Marie Harron and Giovanni Turner's amazing script is very unlikely and is not as intuitive as the inner finale. However, two women must regularly create two faulty biopics and give credit for creating a regular lifestyle that makes its subject and its decade popular. Oscar Time, Mole, Turner, and Harron should receive nominations. It is doubtful that this is even more deserving than any three women. 9/10
