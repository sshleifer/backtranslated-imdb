I saw this on Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some subcharacters acted gently. It took away from the film as a very savvy musical score, which really hates me throughout the whole movie. If the musical score improved, I could not see some exaggerated scenes. Then the picture is much better.
