There are some amazing things about this movie. Merio Davis can work, given the right asset; She is amazing in the comedy roles. William Hines can act, and you can see why he is one of the screen's most celebrated celebrities. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit tender, but it is very pretty that you do not recognize it. King Vidor is one of the main reasons for this. Producer? Irving Thalberg is an intellectual genius. <br /> <br /> It's about making filmmaking, in 1928 you can see the process of cameras, sets, directors, and actors emoting. You can see some of the main actors of the day (briefly); Even Charlie Chaplin makes an turn for himself, seeking an autograph. <br /> <br /> Hold the Eleanor Boardman, Elinar Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Widor, and many other names and other moments of old photographs. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of silences, you can take the time to catch this picture. It really is a wonderful trip back to time.
