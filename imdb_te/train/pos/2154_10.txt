I have seen this film many times and I'm never tired. It is a classic in every sense of the word. The film is at the same time cheerful, funny and yet very touching. Open your mind with a "subtitles" or generally a fan of foreign movie. This is a great movie for "Beginners" because the story is very entertaining. I'm not wrong, it is 100% Japanese (and it works), but everyone can get something from it (one of the main characters called Mr. Aoki - <br /> <br /> I can not think of this movie laughing I love it ... and there are many people too.
