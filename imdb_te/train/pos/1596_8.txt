Although Cher and Cage are the subject of this story, Garderia and Dukes are very talented - Loretta and Rani are in the 50s - and in love. The whole cast makes a nice job at John Mahoney from Aiello- it shows the true slice of life. I've seen a long time ago - I eventually met Cage to the point where he finally found his talent in Hollywood. From music to support to table of pots to support-it's a very entertaining film.
