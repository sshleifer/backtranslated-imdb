In Christie's writings, this story is never my favorite, so I am surprised that I enjoyed this adaptation. If the mouse is overly effective, the bones of the story are slightly overestimated, while the 'previous criminal' is more of a crime. Most of the students are pretty much as I guess, although they are not a very cosmopolitan bunch - probably not edited by the edited older ones! There were some adventurous accidents with the filming; Perhaps I did not read the book again, but it was very clear to me that the killer was very clear from their appearance. <br /> The humor is very high in the early ferries. Sometimes it works but I found it too too heavy this episode (though I smile at the 'lime single' throwaway line). Overall, however, the solid entry in the series is not the best.
