It took me a while to really appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. As a kid, I really enjoyed the sequels, especially The Return of Michael Myers, which I think is still the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first one took a long time and way took me a long way to get to the point. I have recently seen it twice and now I know I'm wrong. Today I really mean this movie, understand, the whole concept of this horror work. It's not about blood and gore. It's not about naked chicks and lame jokes. It's the darkest night of Larry Strode's short life. It comes back to his demented brother about the night he started 15 years ago. I think this film is scary and it's doing well. It's one of the first Slaser movies, the horror sub-genre that I always love. Halloween is in her first role as a very dark atmosphere, creepy music and talented young actors, Jamie Lee Curtis. I want to say more? It's never seen, it's a horror fan or not, it's supposed to do his cinematography right now. Very well recommended!
