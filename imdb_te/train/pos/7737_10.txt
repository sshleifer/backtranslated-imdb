If I were a fan of Jim Thompson's author, it would be pretty good when their works changed to the film. This is not the Scott Foley's invasion my sweet later edition. The suspicious, sexually charged Noir Classic makes great deal close and original. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward provide the best performances in their careers. And even the most unusual Bruce Dern may even make him self top. Like Thompson's book, the film creates a dark and surreal world where the passing logic crosses, and the double cross is not far away. All fans of the great Noir film must watch. ****
