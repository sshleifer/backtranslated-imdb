Only Chronicles of Heroic Knight ended just a few minutes ago, but I still have a lot of difficulties but the questions still fall on me. The fact that the first 7 episodes, or indeed the recurrence of the events of the First Record of the Battle of Lados, is, of course, not really. The original CotHK creator seems to have a different look of how it's original (and it may cause the first 7 episodes), but I can not find that. CotHK says that it starts Horns' war after 5 years later as part of Paran. I think that the first 5 episodes of the director appear to be a very original recap, a small reminder of the audience and the characters and their works, and the spark appears to be very small after crushing into the story. Now, when the kick into the episode of the spark's piece we found ourselves kicked ourselves another 10 years (now 15 years since the Battle of Heroes). Spark and his team in some cases, Parr and his crew will go into the gear while traveling, especially the love story of the paper between Spark and Nice. I also know that many times across the CotHK have been stressed to stop more than once I make sure that if I'm not for spark's long blue hair thrown in the original series I make sure it's right disc. However, considering this main set backs, the authors made a good job in creating reliable characters and a remarkable storyline. The only thing that harms me is the ashram and Wagner return. Spit ... how ??? The only villainous feature of the asylum was that he supported Mormoch, but both could not make me as great villains. Maybe that part of the series that I described missed something during the coarse. Despite the sequels, I highly recommend CotHK. I am also giving CotHK the original record of the Lord of the Rings trilogy of War II. Both of these are epic than anything I've seen or read. I highly recommend it.
