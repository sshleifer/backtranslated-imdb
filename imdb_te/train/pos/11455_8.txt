This German documentary, in English, is about the Scottish eco-architect Andy Golds Worthy. He makes art from the objects found in nature. For example, at the beginning of the film, we see him going through a vertical rock with a slight humidity in the shape of icicles and "glencing" into a snake shape. <br /> <br /> The icicles are dissolved, but that is part of Goldworth's work. He goes to a site and gets a feeling of it, and intuitively decide what to do that day. He has "dialogue" with stones and other things that he works and tries to work instead * against them. It can be stones, flowers, or leaves, or sticks. The sculpture may be minutes or years old, or may be completed and may not last long for photography. <br /> <br /> This movie and work is beautiful, exciting, and inspiring idea. It moves very slowly, it is suitable for the material, but you must be sure to go on a good night's sleep. <br /> <br /> Search the web for some other pages about Andy Goldworth or read about his local sculpture at Stanford University. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: If you want to find out what this film is all about for you, read this piece. I've been reading two of the thoughts I read and watch the movie I read. At first, Andy Golds reminded me of the nature of nature of nature and the very nature of Worthy's nature. We were born, we live, and finally we die. It is natural and it is also part of Goldworth's art. <br /> <br /> Goldworth found his hobby and his work completely in his life. Many of us have the best tolerance, the life we ​​do not recognize life, and the intentions that we want to spend more time with, what we remember. Andy Golds Worthy works great because he creates a mixture of all of these things in his life, and is nourishing him and his surroundings. <br /> You can view it on 8/28/2002.
