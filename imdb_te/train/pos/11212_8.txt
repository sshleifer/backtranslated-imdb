The film came in 1975 and is the second of three episodes of Sheriff Burford Pussar's life. Sheriff plays the role of Buffer Pouser Bove Svensson, and Lube Ask Mobster plays the role of Pinky Dobson. The last Sunday morning we saw sheriff Pazzer, his wife and his wife, who died in a driver, were later hospitalized. After Puser's recovery, he will go after the men who killed his wife. Puser would be able to complete a revenge later or try to get him out of the way before he succeeded. The only thing that troubles me about this film is this true story.
