Many people outside of Australia never heard of the myth of Ned Kelly. I once saw a documentary about the man, but the only time I had ever seen or heard anything about him. And I guess the film is the biggest problem facing this film. No one knows anything about it, and perhaps most people do not care about this. <br /> <br /> The film tells the life story of Ned Kelly. The Irish immigrant lived in Northwest Victoria during his lifetime, but never ever received by the authorities. The police blame him for everything he can think of, and harass his family. When Kelly gets upset as he does everything he creates a gang with his brother and two men. They start looting the banks and hijack the whole town for 3 days. This violence leads to a human hunter organized by the police and when they kill all three policemen, they are illegated. Finally they fall on the pub in Glenvovan, where they have a party with all the visitors, waiting for a train waiting to leave the police on a tracking track. But it is possible to stop the train at times because someone warns them and what happens is the battle between life and death between police and four gunmen ... <br /> <br /> The picture is wrong or wrong. A camp is a kind of Robin Hood, others say he is an ordinary criminal, a murderer and a thief: a camp predicts no one really knows because there are two camps that he will tell their own truth. . <br /> <br /> I am telling you the facts in the film, as well as the documentary, which of them is true, but I can not tell you both. <br /> <br /> The film is a nice addition to the document I once saw and I really enjoyed all the actors performances. Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, Geoffrey Rush All the well-known actors of all, but the lesser-known actors know how to make a good performance for the film. I really enjoyed this movie and I give it a 7.5 / 10
