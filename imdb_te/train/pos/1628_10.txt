This is the most enjoyable film bar I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> With the four criminal charges sent by their fathers to the Weinberg Military Academy, this gospel continues to remain steady throughout the film and is not the second time. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to describe this movie; Humorous elements are so bright and brilliantly concise that no more than a bright 80's teen comedy comedy will disappear. But oh it is more than that! I have not yet used a formula and style that I liked with the "ridiculous" offerings from Hollywood, the earliest years since the academy, from fresh minds in Mad Magazine. Initially, the film is full of infant cornel material, and you expect the writers to be 14 years old. Watch this movie if you like to act "not immature". A classic. *****
