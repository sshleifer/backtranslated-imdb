Eventually, I enjoyed the first season release of Amazing Stories on DVD. I've forgotten just what actors and directors worked in this series as a stellar cast. The only way you can see this distinctive series for a long time is only when re-running the VHS 2 or 3 episode collections or science fiction episodes. However, when sci-fi is running back, they are usually committed to the same episodes. There are some unusual parts of the season that they do not repeat the mission. Does anyone know how long this series passes? It says in the upper part of the IMDb from 1985 to 1987 but I thought it would take me longer than two years. If you like Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outer Limits, you'll love this series and are not disappointed with your purchase.
