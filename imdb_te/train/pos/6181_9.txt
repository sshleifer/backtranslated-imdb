A very pleasant picture, you know how you look at old music / secrets. It does not come close to Agatha Christie or Thin Man's secret as a film leader, but it is more interesting than your "boy who meets boy" or "let's show on a show" for backstage music. A musical, it's no Basby Berkeley or Freed Unit, but it can boost classic "Coctails for both" and the weird "Sweet Marijuana". The movie is the opening night of "Vanity's", a stage show in real time, where murder - and more - was found on the screen. Did the murderer find out before the curtain fell? Certainly, but the search is fun, humorous relief (fortunately, the goddess shaped, Toby Wing in the shape of the chorus), assuming spontaneously and somewhat predictable. Stupid Cop is just a bit too stupid, a bit too bitchy, a bit too brave celebrity woman, Bitch Prima Donna bit a bit too bitch, and a bit too self-sacrificing, but go to stereotypes, they're pretty stylish. Sometimes there is a group of really charming chorus girls, who have made a better choice than the girls for a Busby Berkley musical as well as a bump on the side of the bumper sometimes. Yes, the film was much better than that, and the Duke Ellington number was embarrassing, but it was a tremendously fraudulent trip if you enjoyed diving in older movies.
