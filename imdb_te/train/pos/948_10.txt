It is just one of the finest performances of Deacon's classic story. This script is most definitely followed by Dickens's story, and captures perfect balance between the motion picture and drama atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Scott brings a delightful realistic approach to the role of the screw and is in agreement with character development, ghosts are inspired by visits. I found that he was able to win me with the hard times that I was suffering from old hardship and the rarely made in other versions. Excellent work by supporting actors is great for this product, which is very enjoyable in all Christmas carol versions I have seen.
