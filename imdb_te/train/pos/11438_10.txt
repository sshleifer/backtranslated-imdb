Ralph and Mumford, in their own land, are harmless as suspicious pawns of Misfius, Cyanomos Bouch. Their story twice a time, the characters they met, and their struggle to correct things. Surprisingly impressive soundtrack and some of the best performances in the business, this offbeat film touched the mark. <br /> <br /> Animation approach is very sensitive and very three-dimensional compared to the "South Park" style cut. If I do not know that the animation is this style, I swear to be the traditional pen and ink. If you can see this image in Dolby Surround or THX, please do! If you do not, you will not really miss anything, but if you do, you'll get more from experience!
