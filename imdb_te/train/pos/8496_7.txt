Wow, I see this movie last time because it's years. This is different from watching in 2008, exactly in 2008. Initially I did not think I would make it through this film. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was very vicious, proud and disrespectful, and I found it difficult to see him. He sneaked into the negative image of the Americans. If that's not bad enough, the smallest American town's finest workers once showed that the picture just got worse. In the anti-spectrum, the Japanese demonstrated emotional and robotic performance. This film is not that funny, because I have a nostalgic value that I hang in there. <br /> <br /> Like boxing, the judges will escape what you can do with the round. Since the film is over, I have gone from seven to seven. The end is fantastic. You always want a harmonious ending and it's just that. This town is good for keeping jobs and keeping the factory, but the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values ​​is unique. This is a normal picture that ends in a high note.
