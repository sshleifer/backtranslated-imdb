Gundam 0079 Movie Trilogy When most of us know it, it's a lot of activities and much less. This OVA is very opposite. Although half a dozen parts, it is not filled with action, but emotional things. I believe that these two main action scenes are enough to satisfy me. After watching a lot of Gundam Series, Movies and OVAs, I'm totally ready for a civic-esquire movie. This film made that wonderful job. The reason for this film is that there are both good and bad people on both sides of the war. It appears Zeons more human rather than original films where they filmed a second rise in bad Nazis. Many people do not like the idea that I'm forced to watch this movie (lol), likes it. So, I would recommend it to the anti-war story. If you are not a fan of Gundam, you should not read it; You should see it now.
