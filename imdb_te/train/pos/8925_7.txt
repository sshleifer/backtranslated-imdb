The film was originally created in postwar years (especially when you were born between 1946 and 1953 and preferred to spend the afternoon on Saturday afternoon in your neighborhood film), the film is almost genre-specific. . And seeing the memory it probably was with you. It's a brief and something excitedly exciting moment in our growing days of style. <br /> <br /> It has a modern, space-level storyboard for its audience. This set will be packaged for a midnight show Friday at any city with a supermarket and a movie theater. It is hot rods and rebellious youth, but 'why they can not let us enjoy' way rather disturbed, moral rebellion-without a cause path. Teens, parents, old man, doctor, nurse, mechanic, boy, puppy, even cops - are sympathetic to us - all the characters are recognizable to us. <br /> <br /> It has a horror monster. It is the first victim 'it hurts ..... it hurts' and we have heard that we are convinced and frightened. The story is constantly growing throughout. The intense period of suspense, the colorful effects, the magnificent acting and humorous moments in McQueen are not intended. <br /> <br /> I saw in the summer, 9 or older, 'I've got married to a monster from Outer Space', and was surprised by the experience of this special double feature I went back a couple more times before I left. I know everybody has seen it. I know everyone liked it.
