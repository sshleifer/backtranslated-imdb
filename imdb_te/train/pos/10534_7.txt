Whether this is a good film, this kind of films have to be done, I think. It reminds me of "I love haccabius" as it is shining by a young American in a dirty pest with Isabelle Hubper, which is in the merry-rugged-moscowist route (?? !!!!). I hope the directors are going on the boundary, but Vincenzo is not always subtle, although Natalie feels like (some scenes are unfortunate of the "Tarte-La-Craem", like a baby slapstick), talking about the script and cinematography? The color of "Cube" is black, "Nothing" white, more happy, surprisingly, than Natalie's former films.
