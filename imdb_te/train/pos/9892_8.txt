<br /> <br /> A group of people trapped in an abandoned school. They start killing, they know they are beaten, so what do they do? A girl decides to take a bath, and she decides to cheat on her husband with her older husband (she is also), so they find some bed (in the old abandoned school) and go to it. <br /> <br and it comes with Gore and T & A. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting from the historical / sociological point. The simple 80's slasher is a unique angle which is the reflection of what we see, or how adults are young people, or the rest of the country with Hollywood views. This was an American slazer british film. <br /> <br /> If you like cheeky 80s slashers (like pies) then British actors trying to speak "American" if you like this one will often slip in their UK accents. .
