I seemed to be a plain French slap in the American face of this film. The camera focuses very often on fat people, sloppy homes and useless rural areas. This story exploits the small towns people who are familiar with the audience, and cinematography exploits them. Undoubtedly, thin people can be seen in Glenco and in well-organized houses, but Malle chose to show what's what we see. <br /> <br /> "I think some American filmmakers in America are going to France." I am assured to you that France is often a visitor, not all of them, overseas immigrants are not immediately compounded, and thereby resulting in serious social inequalities.But Americans have their bias towards their own compatriots and their jealousy toward the US Do not react to the interest of the French mask for hours, so we did not have a chance to see the images on this topic.
