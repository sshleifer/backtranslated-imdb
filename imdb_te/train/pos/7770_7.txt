"On the Wind" by Douglas Cirk's play Douglas Circk rendered "Kohirs's Do Cinema", Fosbinder and others. He is a master director - I think his cinematography is sophisticated - "Wind on the Wind" luscious paintings and cute deer. But I'm asking: Is it enough to take the picture? Acting on "On the Wind" was legitimate from weak (except Robert Stark - convinced he was a weak and spoiled playboy). Lauren Bacal has a powerful presence on the screen, usually incorrect. Dorothy Malone, a seductor, is a careless "Femme Fatale", but does not have the strength to her role. Rock Hudson is effective but not vapid. <br /> <br /> The plot has many interesting materials. <br /> <br /> LUSH (Lauren Bacall) - The woman of formula, formerly <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought together Kyle and loved by patriarchal. <br /> <br /> When I read the storyline on the back of the daddy, the secrets beyond the door, love triangle, depression, fistfits, laughter, and death. Treatment. My fault! Why? I try to explain: "On the Wind on the Wind" takes a serious and dramatic story. Before acting, I mean, in general, not good enough - lack of intensity. There are very strong scenes in the story, but the actors just do an effective job. <br /> <br /> I think the scenes were fully explored with Italian or Spanish actors - they ended up laughing or tearfully (for us). <br /> <br /> Let us look at the beautiful cinematography circus of Douglas. This is not enough for me. If you want to enjoy a good drama, see "Aventurera".
