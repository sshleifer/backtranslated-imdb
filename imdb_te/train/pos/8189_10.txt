<br /> <br /> This episode of the older 2 episodes, although I have never seen, did not think that the paranormal physician would go against anything other than the extra trestherial course or the paranormal. <br /> <br /> The episode brings a lot of scary things to us and can lose and defeat a real live evil when we say that humans are, in the future, impossible. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by the fact that it is a family film that brings out a sense of fear and confidence, especially to attract American audiences. But who is concerned about what Yanks says, we rock! The doctor who has been able to extend the episode one from far since the new series in 2005, is the first scary being extremely dangerous, from the pleasant, from light to darkness. <br /> <br /> There are 10 people in 10 years
