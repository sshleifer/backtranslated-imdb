She finds a girl in her sixteenth birthday that she is a witch and she lives with her anuntie in her house and they both are wizards because it is their own. Well this took me about getting used to a couple of weeks. When she first used her power, she was very funny because she made her enemy pineapple. She will have time to reverse and repeat a day. This series is really cool and it's a simple teens series but she went out of the house and wearing it to an apartment with her fellow college friends and I got boring and I stopped watching. And one of the other is really ditzy. I love Valerie and I hated Sabrina's enemy libby.
