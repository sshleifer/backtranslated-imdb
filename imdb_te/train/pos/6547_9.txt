Over the weekend, I took my 10-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew and I was completely entertained. At first, it was clean, and understood by my standards. Most of the children's toys filled with toilet comedy and macro-out jokes are associated with bringing cheap laughs from an early teen audience. <br /> <br /> This role is refreshing by Emma Roberts, who is always annoying and polite. Apart from the Brady Bunch film, chronological characters are ridiculed and ridiculed, with Nancy's style being treated with respect and respect. This is a great moment when Nancy dismissed the LA "style-conscious" girls with the shop owner when she adopted their Paris Hilton Streetwalker dress when she received a buttercil sample in her penny breads and homemade. This film shuns we take the need-to-knowledge-this-wholesome-girl talk most Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> Nancy is true for her and her values. <br /> <br /> Silence is the time to be engaged. My daughter and my wife caught my hand, but there were no inaccurate shock scenes. It all depends on tension and mood and is very fun. Supporting cast is good, especially Marshall Bell creepy caretaker. <br /> <br /> EPY Gemison, Chris Kutton and Bruce Willis have some great characters and there are many moments where adults smile. I'm not a computer animated film, but talking to animals and talking to gas, but I've enjoyed a lot of fun. I was there without child, and I still enjoyed the movie. This is a DVD that contains my daughter's name under the Christmas tree.
