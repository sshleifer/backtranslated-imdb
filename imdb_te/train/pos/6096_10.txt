I am technically not a great TV program, it is filmed in the video and its limits are displayed in audio and visual aspect. There is also a slight shortfall during acting. When I first broadcast in 1988, it frightened me hell. But I am 5 years old. But I recently bought the first 3 episodes DVD, unfortunately I heard it now removed. Even Warner's first DVD's bad sales are not going to be released any further release. Even the TV show movies do not have the same feel, in fact I thought it was a more bad tone. However, the colorful Emm Street 4 was the nightmare in the same year (both of which were made in the same movie and TV show), which was in a very serious tone, but the fame gradually became more apologetic and joking. Freddie-wise cracker.but I think the strength of this TV show is that you do not set up every minute of Freddie before he kills someone and then breaks a joke, it becomes a dream, it makes a dream more relaxed, strengthening the lense.im's gentle attention Performances creators or limits are burned in the video. I like this show, and it is not very enjoyable as a companion piece for movies. Today is better than anything on TV.
