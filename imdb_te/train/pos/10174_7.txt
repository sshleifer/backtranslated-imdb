Another World War II message to be careful about the spread of rumors to soldiers and allies. <br /> <br /> These "references" are called cartoons because it is a mixture of serious messages combined with a funny-looking main character called "Favorite Snapu". <br /> <br /> You have fears for everyone, what you have, and what happens here like Pvt. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two and he comes with "five". Even if you have enough rumors, enough people can trust them, you can start all kinds of panics and disasters. In your country and your reason to lose belief, as indicated here in this cartoon. The best way to lose the battle is to discourage the enemy. It's still going on. <br /> <br /> "We are losing this war," he said. Amazing about how some Americans still learned. This cartoon may be 65 years old, but it's perfectly relevant today. In this way, today there are two terrorist bombings in Europe and some still feel a bumper sticker slogan "Terror War". <br /> <br /> The author uses "hot air balloon juice" analogies to deliver the message above the famous "Doctor Sussex". <br /> <br /> You know that the rhythm is clever with Theodore Geisel (his real name). <br /> <br /> There is nothing happier here, but it does not. You need to understand the justification of the mental illness that was not there during the 1943 climate and World War II. People forget that war may be wounded with easy to win on the other side. It's a long time
