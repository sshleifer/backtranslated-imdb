Carlos Mencia is not one of the best performances of the date. The Messiah is known for breeding and enjoying the racial problems. However, he did more than this stand-up performance at San Francisco. Generally, you're not just laughing at Mencia's content, but you also think what's really going on in society today. <br /> <br /> On this bourgeois day, when menci asked for a woman's argument about illegal marriage, terrorism, the view of the love of Mel Gibson's Christ and whether he was influenced by Jesus, the community was physically or mentally disabled are. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia has been struggling with his critics many times, and he does not need to be afraid of the burden. For example, he goes to Pope John Paul II and a long distance (and he admits) with a joke about what he is doing mostly in heaven. <br /> <br /> The main message of Mancia in all of his shows has a voice for all of us and we do not need to talk about what we think and scare offense. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this performance, I will definitely recommend Mindy's mind and his performance in Comedy Central.
