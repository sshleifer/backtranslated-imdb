I first saw this film 3 years ago, then introduced by Disney Chief Eyeser and Real Jim Morris. <br /> A month ago, it came back to TV, this time I recorded it. Since then I've seen at least three times. <br /> <br /> It is an awesome, exciting, good movie intelligently written and credible for everybody. It declined to go to every sentimental trick in the book and other cliche. <br /> <br /> It is refreshing to watch movies that kill all the behavioral problems of children, not zirks. <br /> These are the ordinary people who have dreams like you and me. <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood has gone. <br /> <br /> The film is encouraged by a friend in a dream and by friends and family. Keep that dream. <br /> <br /> People in Big Lake TX appear to be as much a man as I want to move there. <br /> When I say b4, the film does not try to go through the brilliance. Dennis Quaid, as always, is disappointed. <br /> <br /> In this film, the writers are concerned for all, and the writers have a great deal of excitement. <br /> <br /> When a gem is in the forefront of the film, Jim arrives at the big game before the big game, and his wife calls him from the stand. He goes to his family. Three other pitfather faces on the table in the dugout is precious. <br /> If you look forward to a change of pace, then select this image.
