<br /> <br /> Today we have toss around the lightest word "superstar" way, but here it really is the person who deserves it. <br /> <br /> I am fed up with this set. The song selection is accurate - it only contains songs that I really want to listen to and listen to the documentary footage during the newly weakened new songs. I had five guys on stage in the band very minimalist atmosphere. (With the songs of this strength, you do not need a circus). <br /> <br /> The spectator's shots are quite awesome. How many performers can influence the original Beatles fans (now in their 50s and older), can begin with each other in "Can not Love My Love" and Impact Impact. <br /> <br /> In the wake of John Lennon's tragic death, I realized that Paul McCartney was immediately repentant. Paul lost John and Jorge (despite their ultimate ties, it would be difficult for them to lose the world with whom), but he never lost his wife Linda and never really realized Lennon's murder. I agree that Lennon's murder is terrible, but now I realize that I have forgotten about the consequences of Paul. <br /> <br /> I am very happy that I have no complaints to those who complained about the audio / video quality. Both are crystal clear in my set. I think this is the same people complain about the DVD's quality when it comes out of the next format; They are always satisfied. <br /> <br /> When I get my chance, this ticket is not my regret. <br /> <br /> When reminding John Lennon, they will first remember his murder and his music. I have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney now, because if he has nothing else, he will be remembered for his music first. And let me hope another lunatic will not change this because McCartney catalog looks great too.
