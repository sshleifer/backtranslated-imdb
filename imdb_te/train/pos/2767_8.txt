Gregory Peck gave a spectacular performance in the film. The last 15 minutes (or there are) are great and a perfect pleasure to see Peck. The rest of the film can not say the same. I'm sure it's not terrible and it's made with good intentions, but the real reason (if I'm honest) is to peck it. The rest are good for reading the Old Testament.
