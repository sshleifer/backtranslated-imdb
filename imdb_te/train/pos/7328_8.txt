I liked this movie very much. I wanted not to be too bad to spend an evening. It was specially satisfying. Some scenes are fun and not just as a stupid slapstick comedy, but with some meaning and moral values. The main ones are good, but the stars, even those that have written and I have never seen these actors, but they are very much interested in what they like and finally what happened to them. The script is clever and involved and has a refreshing feel to it. I am sorry to see you.
