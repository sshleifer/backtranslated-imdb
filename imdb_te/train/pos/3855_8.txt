The general sense of the viewers and the many European films that explore intelligence are inaccurate. There are media directors who use nudity before men to promote their images; However, Paul Verhoean uses Gerard Rive's nudity as part of the plot and always seeking aggressive or sensationalism. Not the last one; Sexual Renee Soutendijk's bisexual beauty fits her role as a woman who perfectly attracts a gay writer. <br /> The title (Brazil): "O 4 Homem" ("The 4th Man")
