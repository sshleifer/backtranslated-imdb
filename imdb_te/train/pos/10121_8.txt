Some of the later films of Takashi Miyak are not jungle and way, this is a very good criminal play. <br /> <br /> The basic story is the story of Japanese cop cop with Chinese parents. Her younger brother is a lawyer for the villain and his gang. The film is actually quite complicated, which has many complexities, both of which are interesting and attention away from the central narrative thrust. This problem and loss of about an hour into the image that makes this less than a great movie. (It's a very good one) is definitely worth seeing especially if you do not mind a frantic speed. /> <br /> Warning word, when there is violence is a blast and nasty. There are also semi-graphic depictions of gay sex. If it is not your tea cup, be careful. <br /> 10 to 7 or 8.
