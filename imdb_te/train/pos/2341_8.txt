This is actually a lyric performance, like a lyric, a Tim Burton movie. Since the show's performances are far more creative than most, it's worth a look. Best of all, it is not a "reality" performance. I'm thinking why the view public is willing to accept such programs (lack of creativity) and ignore the amazing performances that really have a creative creative bent. It's really unusual. More than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oh, and the story and the music are great. I would recommend if you enjoyed a few performances from the hitting way. It's not as strange as Twin Peaks, but it got a serious maze.
