John Van Druen Broadway has brought to the surface a maximum of stellar energy in this modern romantic fantasy, a modern witch stimulates the publisher. James Stewart can get top billing, but Kim Novak, who stole a show of one of the most attractive wizards, cast a spell on the film screen. The main attachment, in fact, is one of the few weaknesses of the film: it seems a bit old for the gray-fur Stewart character, and it's easy to see why he gets so hard for Novak, which makes it a little harder to understand what makes him feel attractive about him, they seem to be inadequate in the tempament and outlook . (Witches and battlefields are one of the funniest stories of the story shot in the Greenwich Village Beatinics and Bohemians.) Interestingly, the Stewart-Novak Coupe will release the same year, producing more heat in "Vertigo" <br /> <br /> The film's funny movements Mostly through a stellar assistant cast including a young Jack Lemmon (Kim's longest brother) Ayi, Elsa lancestar (their ditzy aunt), and Ernie Kovacs (!), A confused writer. Hermione Gingold also shows in a happy guest of a sort of Grand Witch. This movie is like - Wit, Romance, and great cast - if you take your eyes out of enchanting Miss Novak. I saw the movie half a dozen times and I can not do it forever.
