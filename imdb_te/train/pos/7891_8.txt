Now all the children and young people in Springwood, Ohio, a young man (Shawn Greenblatt) are still alive and are all dead. Freddie (Robert England) is not only remembered, but when he arrives in a new town, the young man is not remembered. When a tough female psychologist (Lisa Jane) tries to break a new patient. He finds where he came from. She brings him to Springwood to induce some memories but three teens (Leeley Dean, Brakein Meyer and Rick Dean Logan). Once they reached Springwood, a psychologist had some memories that she had lived in the town before a child. <br /> <br /> Freddie is a terrible, / fantasy / thriller with some horror scenes and funny movements directed by Rachel Thalle (Ghost, Tank Girl). Yaphet Kotto (Alien) Dreams is a supporting role of a psychologist. Some of these weird visual effects (everyone loves the climax, especially in 3-D) and have some good style in its heroic style. <br /> <br /> The DVD contains strong anamorphic widescreen (1.85: 1) transfer (included in the pan & scan) and strong Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The DVD is the original theatrical trailer, a Nightmare Feedback and Cast & Crew Info Jump. The "Em Street" series box set, eighth disc featuring interviews with the sixth cast & crew. There is also 3-D for the sixth film Climax, but you can also see 2-D. Wes Craven is the last of Em St Street films until Wes Craven's revival in a different, dark-style "New Nightmare" and the silly but surprisingly enjoyable spin of horror film "Freddy Vs Jason". Robert Shay (co-owner and co-CEO of "New Line Cinema"), Rojaanne Bar, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper in the entertaining comedy. Written by Michael de Luca (John Carpenters in the Mouth of Madness). From the story of the director. (*** Â½ / *****).
