Speaking to Mr. Mekardi, the film is good for the scenes in the scenes. The one who speaks to the girl who is out of the girl by a woman who fits out her explanation --- one around the rolls - she refers to her name - in the Greek voice "Mr. Mukerje" - and then Boer gets poisoned herself and ends her head behind her head - - It's a pleasure! "Fools - Fools - All My Life" ... etc etc - You get the point .. I need to buy this one. I love Dan Seymour's performance - he's usually played a little foreign Sultan or Police Chief and played in Casablanca and several great films.
