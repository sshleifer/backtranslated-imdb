"Der Todesking" Is not exactly the type of image that makes you merry? The second fictional monument of Jörg Buttegrirt is actually better than the infamous "necromantic", with seven smaller episodes? Every day for a week? Unrelated people are involved in suicides. Among these very disturbing parts, Buttgereit seriously spoils the corpse of the corpse really inserting horror images. These episodes are not all equally powerful, but the perfect, "Der Todesking" is all-time high in the list of all-time high-profile art-home films. Specifically Wednesday episodes, explaining the sexual stereotypes of the whole stranger in the park, and one Sunday, devastating to be serious and obsessed with a young man who dies himself. The extra value of this image, or any other shikenerinas are debatable and I'm not sure whether to communicate the butterit message here. Its readers blunt a strange chain letter that encourages suicide, but we do not know the motivation of these people to dramatically end their lives. Unlike I fully imagined, "Der Todding" is not exploitative or repulsive graphic! In contrast, I never thought, but Butterreet was very subtle and attentive to portray a pure psychological misfortune. Thursday episode is a good example for you. This shows the different perspectives of a famous German bridge, but names, ages and people's occupations appear on the screen. Production values ​​are weak and often not professional in editing, but this is not really calculated in this type of film. Is the matter strong and less grateful for us to think about? But how much do you need? The elements of life. Great use of even tragic music!
