<br /> <br /> The first one, specifically starring Michael Madsen and Tamer Kadagagli; <br /> <br /> The film is very interesting and interesting because, in the cast, there are a lot of internationally European actress and actress, such as from Turkey and Russia ... <br /> Second, the story is fundamental and you can imagine Interesting action is what you would like in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Third, the final chapter is neither unique nor interesting, it sounds like other action movies. <br /> Finally, I would recommend watching this film ... and I hope you enjoy: D
