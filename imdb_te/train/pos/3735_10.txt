Really impressive story of America's recruitment camp, a story made by teenagers for the Vietnam War. Human research has always appealed to me when it comes to war films, translating personal, subjective opinions in combat, opposing images of warfare, and actions and technical data analyzed for the abuse of human factor. <br /> <br /> The film has already managed to keep a new spin in an ancient Spain, and has focused on a typical anti-hero from perspective of classical standards and has managed to stay away from simple war films. The film focuses on Boaz's tragic role, avoiding restraint on his duty, refusing control over his duty, and refusing to fight something he does not believe, sending him and his companions to foreigners and finally ending his own cause of war. Perfect sarcasm. <br /> Acting is really extraordinary, and documentary-style shooting almost seems to have changed into the movie. Similarly, the film offers food for the idea of ​​ordinary war films or enthusiastic activists in combat sports enthusiasts, awakening some of the minds of a generation that is awesome to escape the hopeful draft.
