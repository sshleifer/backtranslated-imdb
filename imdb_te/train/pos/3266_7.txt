Another dauni must see! If you're an obsessive fan of me, you have seen this movie! Alex Finch plays his 22-year-old Yale Stude, who realized his life 26 years earlier. Alex Louie Jeffrey's reincarnation, the Secrets advocate Salahren (Cybill Sheppard). Louie was killed during their one year anniversary. He demands to go back, this time only in the body of Alex Finch. <br /> If this film is about 15 years old, it will surprise you if there is something really like a resurrection. . And if so, how often do you meet life after life with the same souls. I do not know the answer. But I want to see this movie. This is a riot, and looks like SO GOOD in a tuxedo in Downey. This film is believed to be in love with you, and true love never dies. It's just recyclable.
