I have a word a little bit of this movie, Wow! I saw "Darius Goes West" at Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater have been killed. The film shows the difficulties suffered by Darrius muscle weakness. The film did very well and you really became part of the film, and I felt emotionally in the movie because we remember that it's totally healthy, some people in this world are very small. And sometimes we should give them and help them, in the end. I will give them ten stars, Darius to ask for the money they need for the friend they need when they ask, Darius should know the world, Darius went to West.
