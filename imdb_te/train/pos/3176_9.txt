I've been catching this film in Brooklyn - it's hard to explain the story; It's a lot of absurd letters, but let's just have a hard time choosing who I've made the hardest laugh, I'm not sure where to start. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is refreshing to see; I did not see some recycled items too many times. If the film can reach a wide audience, I think it's a real audience-happy, story is very original and heartfelt. <br /> <br /> Here are the likes, funny back stories, the ultimate law and the danger and misunderstanding of the dramatic end. Cross Eyed is a very funny picture with a ton of heart; It's a touching story with a fast-paced fast-paced comedy. Definitely worth seeing!
