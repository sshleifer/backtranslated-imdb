The film is very relaxed, romantic-comedy, enjoyable. Meg Ryan did a very good job as Albert Einstein's intellectual niece, but believes her own skills. Tim Robbins will do the job well as a mechanic falling in love with his fiancee when he comes to his shop after his car. I love Volta Mathau alone as Albert Einstein. <br /> <br /> The film has a very bad feeling, but it keeps some kind of intense (if it really is possible). <br /> <br /> I personally am very entertaining this film, the older scientists - I thought fab and was fun! The film is estimated to be less than perception. If you like the humor of your choice, it's a picture for you!
