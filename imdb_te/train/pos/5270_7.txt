This image may be too bad, but it's fun. Evil acting and improving the silencing of the movie in the poor direction. The twins are so much fun in their canonsence roles. In the movie you expect it to be the first to wait for Conan or Exalsbure. If you're in good mood and you're good to see it, moody fun you have a good time. They try to kill for the scenes, its humorous scene in the movie. I want to do this with the Mystery Science Theater 3000!
