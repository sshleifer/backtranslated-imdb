I'm absolutely surprised to see how much the film has taken on the Colombian massacre. Not a major documentary, it is very strict. Fortunately we praised Ben Kokoy's performance, directed by ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant praised as being equally fine. There have been two different incidents, the real cause of this massacre is always a secret, ultimately blocking the two killers' motivations and not knowing, and fantasy into the terrible reality to go beyond them. ZERO DAY is intentionally inspired, making video tapes made of shooters and found after the event. If you know where you are going, you are hoping that you will not "go there" ... and the last minute there is anxiety tension. From the director to the script (though it is very sophisticated, although it is quite natural) is excellent from top to bottom for both the lead actors and supporting players. There was only one item in the ZERO DAY that caused me trouble. Okay, so why shooters do what they do, but one of the contributors is their angry. However, these boys are not really angry. They say a few things to say they are, but I do not believe that they actually forced them to kill innocent people. But it is still "why ???" Director Cosioo wanted me to be. Anyway, rent or buy this movie, which you will creep up and stay with you for a long time. Blair witch fans are more likely to be the favorites of this type of mock documentary.
