Urban cowboy did not seal with the same testosterone, you could find in the rodeo, in the Texas Texas that provided a perfect glimpse of that day and age. I really criticized this film, it's time and relative dwelling. Good music, fun times, and yes, there are some "tough and rolling" handy tank roads. Budd and Sissy's relationship, "is well thought out as" two ships passing night ". When Pam hits the note of Sissy's written note to the bus, it echoes the tragedy of many real life rites. The whole story is well thought out. I did an amazing job with cast and crew. I thought the screenplay was well written and directed. Scott Glenn should receive Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.
