Yesterday I attended "The Descent" World Premiere at Tribeca Film Festival in NYC. I was very happy. <br /> I sold and attended all the prominent actors, including Spacer Marcus Patrick, with me. <br /> I started with 7.5 out of 10 stars possible. College starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson). You can imagine a simple environment with wildlife and wildlife. The film is fantastic in this movie. She meets Jared (Chad Faust) and they become sweetheart. It looks like any other relationship in the beginning. The lady's woman's attention and love is in quest and the woman is difficult. The two were well organized. Very naive flirtation between the two. He invites you to his apartment and everything is different. <br /> Apartment is very cold and dark. They eventually light in a very dark basement and many candles. It really reminded me about the dungeon. He is here in his real colors and shows that she is raped. This is a very dark and sandy rape scene. This scene is neither young nor weak. <br /> <br /> Maya now begins to lose her soul for drugs and sexuality. She comes into her abyss. She begins to attend the brutality of the parties and wakes up one morning in a room where she does not recall. She was told to watch Adrian (Marcus Patrick). The first thing I remember about this role is that they "are the man who saves anyone who needs to be saved". He introduces Maya to drug trafficking. They are then associated with dramatic drama in the film. The club's scenes in this film are heavily skillful. <br /> <br /> I thought Maya did well afterwards and I found that the Director of Photography was finally appreciated during the audience credits. <br /> Maya is back in college as TA and her class - Jared is her rapper !! You may see confusion and emotion on the face of Maya. What should I do ?? What will I do? Her face and emotion shots are valuable. <br /> What happens is actually what happens? She shows interest in Jared. She wants to restore her relationship and be loved again. I'm really sitting. It's not. <br /> She invites him to his apartment and, of course, he shows. Now her apartment is dark and gritty. She is totally strip down. He feels he's going to be "lucky". She breaks him like any woman. She caressing him everywhere and he's excited. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> . Once again, the scene is dark, sandy and very sharp. <br /> <br /> If you look at the movie and do not want to know what happened next, skip this paragraph and go to the end <br /> <br /> Here Adrian goes back to the film. Maya Adrian saved herself (?) By jerding a very tough male sex. She thinks this is a last resort. Adrian Jared takes all the men out and does nothing of his dignity. Like Marcus, Adrian, this scene is believed to be believable by anyone. He is a strong actor who plays a strong role and comes out all over the screen. After the film, in the Q & A session, Marcus explained that the scene needed a lot of confidence between him and Chad. Maya believes that she will save this revenge, but I do not think it is. One of the last scenes has a close-up of the face of the face and you'll see her cheek tears roll. This spectacular scenario aroused a continuous discussion from the scene and anyone who is going to watch this film. Did she seek revenge on her request? Was she satisfied as expected? In my opinion, it does not. <br /> It looks great. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful movie, well-played characters, and I would recommend those who are thinking about what it will look like. When I was younger than 17 years, I was just a little back. Rosario, Chad, and Marcus should be congratulated for good works. Directing and photography should also be appreciated. It was one night I enjoyed.
