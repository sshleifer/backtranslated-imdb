The real events do not know when I sit to watch this, the fact that this is based on a true story. After the baby's father dies, Randah tries to help his daughter Desir√© (... someone does not actually know the name of their children) to cope with the damage. This is really what the "family" Flix (when you say, it's like getting everyone for a view, it's a lot of children, you're putting young people on it, buying a feeling), but that's not the parent's death, it really does not talk to anyone. This plot is interesting enough and can move well enough. Acting is different, and her fellow actress, Matis is very pretty, and with her and her colleagues (with some exceptions) the bunch is less convincing (and frankly, they are irritating, I'm not really in the audience for this topic). Amendment and cinematography are standard, and certainly not less than that. Though humor is limited to a few of the most amusing songs, the tone is not an aberration. There is a serious scene or both. I recommend this to fans of this kind of movies. 7/10
