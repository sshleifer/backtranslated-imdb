<br /> <br /> "Two losers from the Milwaukee, Koppel & Reimer (Parker & Stone) Basketball using baseball rules When the game is a huge success, they help a billionaire, everyone gets the same salary and create a professional baseball league that can change any team cities. <br /> <br /> Kopel & Reimar team, Milwaukee beer <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> If the movie is not a big fan of "Southpark", the Parker And Stone does a good job in their very first true movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny moments in this movie, Makaranam could not. It never really forever, and they are more serious in order to try to keep some of the cruel drama. <br /> <br /> My favorite aspect of the film: the soundtrack. It's great. I especially like "Take Me" and "Beer" by Reel Big Fish. <br /> <br /> Overall, raw, but very funny, picture. <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
