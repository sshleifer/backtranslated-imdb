"The Incredible Melting Man" is one of the most welcoming camp-horror leaks to produce a weird, majestic and powerful Z-grade for him / her. An ideal way to describe these low-budget 70 gemstones is the shameless copy of Hammer's "The Quatermus Experiment" ... a thousand times a thousand times! Astronaut Steve West is the only survivor of the dangerous space-mission, but turns into a terrible disease carrier that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt! After seeing his face in the mirror, the shock comes out of the Steve statues from the hospital (you can blame him?), Leave the trail of sticky pus and fall on the back of the body parts. Dr. Ted Nelson set up Steve with a satisfying appetite for human flesh, and instantly identifying him. The premise might be stupid, but the film is immense entertaining and has great makeup effects at the hands of Rick Baker. The face of the melting dude looks like a rotten pizza and his heavy breath sounds like a dard wader! The William Sachs screenplay does not waste tedious scientific interpretations or emotional speeches at any time. Repulsiveness starts soon and the picture will last until the last minute. Just enjoy this crazy horror gem and try to switch off your brain action too, because if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script, you will miss out on all the campy fun!
