This was a true story of how the three prisoners of the German prisoners prison war (POW) camp, Stalag Luft III, survived three British soldiers during World War II. This is the same POW camp, a scene for the Great Escape, resulting in the murder of 50 recovered officers by the Gestapo (which later became the most successful film of the same name). While other POWs in Stalag Luft III were busy working in their three large tunnels (Tom, Dick & Harry), two amateur British prisoners came up with the idea of ​​building a wooden trademark horse near a compound wire fence , Reduces the distance of the tunnel to freedom from this starting point. <br /> <br /> With the intention of building their version of the Trojan horse, they attempted to escape 'classical' attempts, playing a leap-frog in a combination of some pieces. <br /> Initially, two hidden pows ​​inside, carried into wooden horse compound and placed in almost the same place, near the fence, daily. While volunteer POWS was cut off on horseback, the riders were busy inside the horse while under a wire, under the wire, and in the woods while digging a tunnel from under the horse riding horse. <br /> <br /> This article also details details of the three fleeing POWs in Germany and the emergence of a European tunnel. Three POWs who tried to escape were actually hit home runs (successfully escaped to their home base.). Wooden Horse POW gives a very accurate and real feel of tension and events of breakout. The film is depicted in real locations along the route that two ships have traveled in their escape. The budget is much cheaper than The Great Escape, Wood's Horse is much more exciting than The Great Escape and it is very realistic to avoid them from the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> The story line is crisp and acting rings is real and it is strong enough to keep tension in all respects through the film. Wooden Horse is based on the name of one of the fleeing Eli Williams, so far, the best POW escape story ever created as a movie. Some original POWs were used in the film to replicate their existence as prisoners in Stalag Luft III. Please give me ten degrees better than this film.
