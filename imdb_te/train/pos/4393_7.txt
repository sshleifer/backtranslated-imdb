Aam Lee Lee clearly likes to make it easy into an image, fitting on the actions, characters and cups, so that they emerge. This is an ideal method of covering the chaotic endgame of American civil war through the chaotic reactions of young citizenship, not knowing in mind or in humans. The film will change about the formation of individuals, adolescents and relationships. <br /> <br /> James Shamus' script is probably the standard bearer of the film; Closer to it displays the most spectacular rules. Jeffrey Wright's name was only for this film. He is very clever here but is in a slow-burning role: Instead we treat very good (not performing) performances from a large, often noticeable summit. <br /> <br /> A great, positive picture. For example, if you find it difficult, more sweet bittersweet Cold Mountain or Fancy Do not Fancy. 7/10
