I feel a bit too exaggerated with comments about the presentation being on the cheetah. When a person comes to watch on the TV show, what does he see? He is watching the show except for a person who analyzes a critic or a story. But most of us do not see and performances that rest and enjoy. An ideal time to watch after a huge day in office / school. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family belongs to the perfect family, the perfectly imaginative family. If such a family exists in the real world, it will become a role model for us to follow. But this is not a TV program, and a real family, there is nothing wrong in describing the speculative family on television. <br /> <br /> It is true that this performance can be executed for a long time. People will be happy to see it, and then show us the following comments. <br /> <br /> Another good point about this program is to look at it but take a message back to the baby, even if it's a message. If Jesse's talks with Michelle does not feel like a child, it is very touching. <br /> <br /> After watching each show of the full house, there are many other shows that are rarely satisfied in your heart.
