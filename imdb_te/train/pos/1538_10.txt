This is the best movie I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> This story happened because I live only a few miles from the village, and I know how I work in Sweden in this area. The film tells the truth, trust me! <br /> It criticizes and honors the dull lifestyle. The producer wants to open this movie to more people and take care of your closest friends and relatives. <br /> You are living in another small village <br /> <br /> Anywhere in Sweden (or another country) you will probably get the most recognition from this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> Thanks to Maria Blom!
