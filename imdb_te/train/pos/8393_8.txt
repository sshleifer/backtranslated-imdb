The marriage of Maria Braun (MMB) A German girl (Maria) marries only German soldier (Herman Braun) at the end of the war. Half a day and one night after marriage, Herman sends forward again. To end up, Maria starts working primarily with a bar for American soldiers and learns a black soldier. She knew before she died before Hermann, that she and American soldiers were between them. Herman walked on the couch, and on the couch, and after confrontation between him and the American, Maria killed her. Herman admits this murder, ends up in jail and Maria is waiting for him. The country is in the pills; Everyone sees that they are busy for a cigarette. There are food shortages. It's the shortest time to survive the strongest. <br /> <br /> In general, the film guesses Maria's attitude - after the loss of Germany's soul in these circumstances, after she lost the war, she allowed herself to be in such a situation as to how to rebuild herself. For example, Maria has the following conversation with a peddler (played by Fassbinder himself); The peddler tries to sell a wonderful copy of her Kleist and she claims that "the Claust quickly cries out, it does not provide enough heat for cool". Peddler answers "Another way to watch it, right now it's the right way". <br /> <br /> Maria had met with a French / German businessman, Karl Oswald, after she barged her way to her first class train compartment. She decides she wants to be associated with Karl, "You have nothing to do with me, I have a relationship with you". She is responsible for the company, after a long time the company has full confidence. When she says, "I think I need to wait for the miracle." She replied, "In my own words, she became" Mata Hari "of the financial miracle. <br /> <br /> Many of the Fosbinder films reveal his mental processes In other words, he has his camera bullish, false social policies and actress For instance, when she asked the phone and her phone to her phone, she asked "I need to sleep with anyone." Fosbinder said that emotions are not present for all people and that we feel that members of society should work properly Only the sentimental feeling <br /> <br /> I especially liked the scenes when meeting Cornil and Maria Munich at the restaurant (obviously, often visiting Hitler himself), as Maria's 'brutal honesty' was wearing him, Maria is in control and Carl falls slightly. Karl "I love my life and I've told you about it". Maria "It's not life, but if we have signed an agreement to enjoy life, then we're going to eat and talk about food". I guess even about Fassbinder's attitudes about these relationships, never submit to anyone completely. <br /> <br /> "What is love in this society? A device, a device of energy, a weapon." <br /> <br /> "There is a typical fussbinder in the ruins of Mary and Batty's warfare, which is typical of Fassbinder - this dress is a bad time." The attitudes that he wanted to paint here are as bad as you think, "You can always keep your makeup and day Looking great. "But there is no interest in the fatbinder perfection It is not so remarkable that the film is very bad, as he rolled cigarettes (about 4 years), most of which was written by script writer Peter Murzyshimer, Facebinder, Maria and Parkie's American with overnight, overnight </ P> <br /> <br /> Hannah Skiggullah is very intelligent to Mariah, most of which she simply looks into the camera, but in her own words, "It's very difficult to get emotional, but I love it." <br /> There are different opinions about the conclusion. After the death of Carl Hart, Hermann finally appeared. (After Hermann was released from prison, "again people.") After the law was sent (she and Hermann's half), Maria shed his cigarette lights, and she and Hermann bled up. To me it's clear that she just made an accident. At the same time, she must kill her as she dreams seemed to come true. She should feel that she is not herself. She seemed to be alive when she was alive.
