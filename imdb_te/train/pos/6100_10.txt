It's really funny (and sexy) movie - it's not just crazy but it has great performances. The type of cinema is how entertaining the characters you feel are connected to everyone in the theater. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival and I was laughing with all the others, and even moved some of the more serious parts of the film. It's a unique movie about both doctors, and I do not give away but some powerful scenes are really funny ones as well - plus the dialogue is great. Wood Harris's character has a special relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Maya are also funny and sexy in their roles. If you have a chance to see - go - you will not be disappointed. Again worth looking at. Wood Harris deserves an award.
