Well, tons of reviews are here, what can i possibly add? <br /> I'm trying to do something. <br /> <br /> It's everything because it's my favorite scrooge cause. Sets, outdoor areas, clothing are so beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet. The supporting cast is well done. One of my favorite narrators & nephews, played by Roger Reese. His poor obedience is touching and his voice is Christmas noise for me. David Warner is also completely unbelievable Bob Crochet. His life is very difficult, but he is positive and dignified. <br /> <br /> The best part of course - George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scout. Some said his character was very difficult. I could not contradict further. Although initially his exchanges were cold or rugged, he was not in the role. He is a terribly disillusioned man who has hardened his heart through his own serious sexual passion for life and wealth. <br /> <br /> At the time of retrospect, it is clear that he is not all nervous. We are looking forward to hope. If he had gone completely, his partner Marley never came for her in the first place. And after all, we're not hoping for the last one. I think Dickens is a big part of what I'm trying to say. When Scougge appeared to his employer at Bellet with his employer, he spent a while in Belle, worrying about him saying he had lived with "laughing on my face". Clive Donner is smart enough to be the director to allow these movements in the film. <br /> Finally, his conversion is very happy to be happy, every time I see it with pleasure tears. He apologized to his nephew Fred, and honestly, moving it, not only for Christmas, but the soul of humanity. The joy he brings to Fred's wife is very clear. And every time the line gets me, "God forgave me when I wasted." <br /> <br /> <br />
