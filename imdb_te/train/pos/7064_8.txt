Dina Durbin really saved Universal from bankruptcy and stopped it as a big studio. Universal in the mid-30th century Most of the major directors at landmark, browning and vieller were gone. Only James Whale remained, but his prestigious horror films were behind him. Dina and Judy Garland appeared on a small "every Sunday" and was initially referred to as the penny role in Garland "Three Smart Girls". Universal Durbin changed when Garland was not available. Initially she was certainly an assistant player, but her probability changed the script to make her star. The film is directed by Henry Costor and has a European touch. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the beautiful scenery of the lake in "Switzerland". Three sisters, Jon (Non gray), K. (Barbara Reid) and Penny (Dena Dubin) are said to be penny when she gave her a wonderful voice to "My Heart Is Singing". They are not very good at home - their father is planning to marry a young woman (Bunny Burns), so three girls go to New York with their slave nurse (Lucille Watson) and decide to reconnect with them. Leswell Watson has good memory for Robert Taylor's strict mother role in "Waterloo Bridge" (1941). <br /> <br /> Donna is married to her Skriti's mother (Alice Brady) and Judson Craig (Charles Winniezer). Dina Penny, a distinctly embarrassing and enthusiastic kid sister who has no experience in the film is amazing and she is very beautiful with a picture. When she sings to her father "someone to care for her," you will get melted - she's a great voice. She is one of the hilarious lines of the film. <br /> <br /> They are "count" for romance Donna (Micah) Over) They decide to take a nightclub, but the countdown is bad due to mix-up Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) and Donna falling for him (he has half of Australia!) She flew into her arms and ran away (Where she attempts to persuade her to be a young opera singer) all over her mother (Nella Walker) patch to the patch and the things that are with their father, and Dona is counting the fountain (Mitcha Auer) and traveled with him to Australia. <br /> <br /> Most highly recommended River.
