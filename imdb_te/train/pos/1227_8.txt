I caught this film in my local film channel. The film deals with stereotypes of children, dealing with boys-relationships, sexual relations, and the like, and has all aspects of a good teens film. <br /> <br /> The film has a real-life concept - no loud music, no special effects and outrageous scenes - this is right for the movie. <br /> <br /> The whole picture is fun, looking fun. <br /> <br /> <br />
