When the film was on television I was about thirteen. It is far superior in action than most movies. Martin Sheen is amazing, and Nick Nolte is a small part, he also offers excellent support. <br /> <br /> Sheen in his '34 Ford (COOL) along the highway is "testing the water" That's awesome! <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in this low voting. <br /> <br /> I find that younger generations are more interested in the junk style of these days.
