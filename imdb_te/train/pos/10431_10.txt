I do not even know what to say about this film. It's one of the few movies I've ever had that I could consider romantic. It is like dancing in the "frame zappa" construction to try to talk about the plot or performance or technical details about the film. It should not be too far away from us to catch up with the right hand to the right to capture those naughty moments in life that move us. Charlie Kaufman's role in the movie is now desirous of writing adaptation. The end is open and the obscure, here's the happiest end, just the secret. Horny and brilliant children who explore the ability to feel very irrational and unrealistic feelings of any in-depth life lessons, feel just a couple ... special lady and a stranger recommend it ................
