Actor Herman Jose played the role of a soccer entrepreneur, earning two African players' passes and trying to sell them for little money to sell to Benfica's rival club (FC's club), FC Porto, so the players did not play well, Wanted to be wrong with that. But what's going on is that these two players are good and FC Porto sells for a good overseas business and earn a good business. A very good and funny comedy showcasing all the contests between Portugal's North / South (FC Porto / Benfica), for a small country as Portugal, without great ancestors in great films, Portugal. Highly recommended
