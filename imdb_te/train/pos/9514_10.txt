This is one of the best films I've seen. It has a good performance by Hanks, Newman and all. Absolutely the best performance of Jude Law. Cinematography is good, editing is good, and really has a great original score that matches with the movie mood. The product model is also a factor in what makes this film unique. For me, it takes a lot to beat the godfather, but wins this competition as it is presented with excellent cinematography. Definitely the best film nominee in my book.
