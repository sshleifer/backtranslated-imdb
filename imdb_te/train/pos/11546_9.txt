Watching the very first: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> The movie is a very impressive screenplay and comedy performance and timing. For 40 years now, it has not lost any energy. Neil Simon shows amazing insight into human nature and relationships, as well as how to create true comedy from exceptional circumstances. Jack Lemmann and Walter Maughou give great comedy shows. <br /> <br /> Neil Simon was inspired by realistic events in his own life, writing the character based on the film. <br /> <br /> One of the best written and featured Hollywood comedies of all time! Surprisingly, only 2 Academy Awards nominated for "Best Adaptive Screenplay" and "Best Film Editing". Hollywood is rarely comedies and how well they did.
