Although Ian Kershaw is far from this project due to the errors of Hitler's life, it is dramatic, but necessary. Robert Carlyle portrayed Hitler in his later years, in which he became the German Chancellor of Hitler from childhood, including The Night of the Long Knives. This TV-film (also a two-part mini-series) led to any series of Hitler's coming to power, e.g. <br /> <br /> The series follows Hitler and some others from the lives of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstang. All in all, filled with valuable and interesting actors, yet I feel I should have more stringent cinematography directed; Most actors are shot in half-body films, which (for me) is not a theater, not the film. The tempo is thicker at times, and the film is about 2,5 hours long.
