The Belgrade journey in a terrible bus that led the crowd of people drunk conductor and his mute son (who likes to shut his eyes). Their journey was frequently interrupted by many playful events, which were bizarrely described in the fall of the soul of the country in 1941 and are still very funny for today's use as simple jokes. "The man who stole programs" is 4 feet long and his four sons are almost two times larger than him. Finally, the film takes a dramatic turn and the tour is not just a swan song from a country that is dying.
