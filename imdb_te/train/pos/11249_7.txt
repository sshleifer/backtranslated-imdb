I saw a total of 6 episodes on DVD. Acting throughout is amazing - the question. I do not have enough action to say that. There is no such a real suspense, just developing a first-class character. Tinker Tyler is like "Wadundt". If you want a good story slowly, then it is for you. Peter Egan is the main Magnus Pum. <br /> <br /> The film portrays the life of a traitor. A person who wants to be a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service, but mentally emotionally suffers from his grief, which has become hypocritical in all matters. As a child he honored his father but his father was exposed to a crook and a con man of time and time. Pime is not for ideology or money, but it does not need to deceive him (his wife, son, teacher). The father damaged his father's influence - he would eat his moral fiber. He does not have true love or loyalty to him. <br /> <br /> The 6-hour series is not a huge psychological issue and many light moments. Very well though.
