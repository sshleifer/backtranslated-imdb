Sisters will be released honestly on March 24 in Sweden. Our Nordic friends are a good occasion to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. At the festival, the director focused on Kim Langikotto in the GÃ¶tborg "director's attention." She gave her a major class, praising her approach as a documentary filmmaker and telling viewers about special situations, which led her twice to shoot her illegally: the first version lost for good, so the second shooting was different from the end of the film. In this regard, a very terrible problem has been created to create a very strong image.
