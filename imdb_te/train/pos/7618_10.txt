<br /> <br /> I heard about losing a colleague with a difference of entertaining opinions, he liked it. Well I've seen an episode or 2 in the early seasons and bored, so I tune it out. A few years later I was defeated. Boring with current science fiction charges Wow wondered. You can say gravity, I swallow pace and scripting are very good, some flash forward / backs are with lots of letterhead letters, but better than anything. My favorite characters are Ben, Lock, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Saeed Jarra, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's father. Jack and Michael are definitely immature murderers, very violent and immature. Kate 1 step them on top, way more classy than Juliet Kate. Mr. Echo is way less and there is not much more to Charlie's level, both of them dead. Jacob talking black dresser (way back) true curiosity. The whole great, very layered series: Finding more <br /> <br />
