A brilliant story of a young couple's story using narrow waters married "Casoma". Strangely enough to look strangely between the surprise and persistent interference by others, it is quite typical in Italy (it may be surprising if such events are elsewhere). Pavignano and D'Alatri are very good in the work, and one of the strong points of the film. Acting by Stephania Roca and Fabio Volvo is stiff and persistent. And the sympathetic priest is funny and well rounded. All in all, really deserving film, perhaps one of the best Italian movies of the year.
