Sophoric is the film. But it's fun for everyone. It plays "the boys' locker room mentality" to "the other side". It is good to see how such tides have changed and how they look foolish. <br /> <br /> It looks like a small group or mixed gender party and look at 97.3%. The room will laugh directly for 2 hours. And other 2.7% ... can you really enjoy them anytime?
