I thought the kids in the show worked well. I especially enjoyed the performance of Emma's character. Well done! Battles are pretty good for a low budget performance. I was able to follow and enjoy the movie while watching for 5 minutes every day. I enjoyed the scenes with tooth fairy and her burning. The ghost moods released by children's souls are also good. Another good point is that it keeps moving. There are not too slow scenes. Adult leaders were also believable and helped make the show entertaining. All in all watching an image in an enjoyable night.
