Inspired by the excitement, dramatic, flamenco, the film is just amazing. It was set on the music of Amartya Bijet. The original music was written and performed by one of the greatest scientific guitarists, the modern Flamenco style proponent, Paco de Lucia plays a musician with the same name. Legendary flamenco dancer and choreographer Antonio Gades wrote the script and created this amazing version of the famous Georges Bizet / Prosperm Marie novel / opera. He plays the lead character Antonio, a prominent dancer / choreographer who mixes dancing with a repeat of Carmen's story in Flamenco style and rhythmic knocking, and has the maximum level of dynamics that demands audiences appeal. /> <br /> The bright and elegant Cristina Hoyos shines in the elegant artistic supporting role of her dance with its technical expertise. Three of the greatest performances by Hayes and Guidance's three great performances in the Gids Foundation were Carlos Sousa: "Bodas de Sangre" (1978), "Carmen" ("Carmen" 1983) and "El Amor Brujo" (1985) ). Gorgeous Laura Dell Soul is a young dancer named Carmen, a young dancer, whom Antony first met from the other Carmen, the author of his most famous novel in 1846, Prosper Mariemi, George Bjet's world renowned opera-comic. <br /> In the opera And as in the novel, Carmen is a must and worst in the solar film, the ultimate whites of fame, Should be. She did not tolerate personal love for any person and did not like death for submission. The story and opera have some 50 movie simulations and they are different, they only have only one tragic end. Solar / Gestures is the most beautiful and truly Spanish language of all. I've seen it twenty years ago, then it's unique and beautiful. Highly recommended.
