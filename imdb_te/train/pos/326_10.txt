"Jag Er nyfiken? Yellow" is very fun. Like at least one other reviewer, I'm laughing out loud on many occasions. Yellow is powerful, playful, self-aware, exploration. Bergmann does not expect here. The film was about the youth in the mid-60s and read about conflicts * about the problems, the country and the world. At some times Yellow is the main character and Leni, both ordinary people and politicians (eg Olaf Palme) are both interviewed and appear as a serious social-political documentary. At other times, yellow is a simulator of this kind of documentary. Always, a personal documentary that explores the life of the yellow Lana - her house life, she loves, her political views, her opinion. Her full person ?? Complex, flawed, conflicting, happy, sad, interesting. And this is all over the director's amazing extra size, Sjöman, and his staff documenting themselves to document. It gives me, really yellow wings. They are suddenly found to be very funny times and some funny ways, reminding the viewer that it is fiction and art, but their existence is another layer of the film; They are shooting themselves. Am I reminding a Bjork music video with this same quality ?? Making a music video is a music video, add infinity, each recurring wammer and more cartoons. I think Sjöman might have something in mind. "Jag r nyfiken? Yellow" tea is not everyone's cup, it is absolutely brilliant, witty, refreshing, ebullient, and authentic.
