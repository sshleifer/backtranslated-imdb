I'm always a big fan of this movie, first you see the cast, acting is awesome and help make this movie better. Cybill Shepard has given great reviews to her role, and they are well deserved. At the beginning of the film, Corin Jeffries (Cybili) marries the picture perfectly in the past when her husband, Louie, dies unexpectedly. Fortunately, Lies burned a second time when he admitted to being "recycled" as the newly-born Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex keeps up his new life and forgets his past life, but Corneann attempts to stay with him. After 23 years, Alex crosses the line, where he meets the daughter of Koryine's daughter Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and suddenly filled with unwanted memories (which start with fun and are in a difficult situation). The music was great and the scenes felt heart and were very beautiful. If you are not disappointed in giving you a chance, chances are you'll like it. Very funny and sweet!
