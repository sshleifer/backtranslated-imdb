Since Gordon Gecko used "Wall Street", it is 19 years to tell us that it is good. Now, Michael Douglas takes the GG personality and transforms it into the Secret Service Agent Pete Garrison. What to guess? It works! This is a serious political thriller for me. The same is true of the safety and security measures taken by the SS and the President of the First Lady. All Leads are pretty good but, as I try, I do not accept Eva Longoria as a Secret Service Agent. Jodie Foster just can not get the same feeling as Longoria you can cancel the belief and really feel Starling the FBI Agent in her "Silence of the Lambs". However, this is fun entertainment with a fun movie, beltway.
