I have always found myself discovering great (semi) unknown images. These inventions have almost always dramatic imagery - in my experience, unknown science fiction, action and horror are not known for very good reasons. I found "High Tide" in the video at a junk store, combining different quality dozens of tapes. <br /> <br /> In this movie I'm still looking at Judy Davis (Lilly), I've been looking for some of the most unseen performance. Yes, I have seen Davis in the last few episodes - a role in "A Passage to India". However, despite her magnificence in the film above, "high tide" is a completely different animal. Since I recently saw Gillian Armstrong's next feature film "Charlotte Gray", I was well aware of her impressive actress. <br /> <br /> The performance of Judy Davis is awesome, I can not say good things about it. She shares a wonderful screen-relationship with the other great actress of the film, as young Claudia Corben (as Ally). There is a lot of drama and quiet humanity that they blur, and the details of what I do not think I reveal here (see it for yourself!). Very good in "high tide" to cover in a review. In fact, I rarely do not care - the film fits well for me. In conclusion, I would like to appreciate Lara Jones for his brilliant conversation with directors Gillian Armstrong for his understanding of actors, and for his brilliant, poorly cinematography, great Russell Boyd (see his work in "Tender Mercies").
