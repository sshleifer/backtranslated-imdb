Oh, I loved this movie. I think it all has. This made me laugh out loud over a dozen times. Yes, I'm a girl, so I'm writing this on a girl's perspective. I was just a humiliating scoring at 5.2 rating. Did many boys vote It is above other romantic comedies. I do not enjoy all the chick flicks because I'm a woman, on the contrary I prefer the other styles. Romantic comedies they are undoubtedly and bold. But as I mentioned, this film is almost in my opinion. Great script, good one-liners, good acting. Although Eva Longoria Parker's character Desperate Housewives has been reminiscent of Gabriel, what? It's awesome. I want this movie to be rainy days, days of lower days and some laughs.
