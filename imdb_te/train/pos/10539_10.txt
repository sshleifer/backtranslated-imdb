It's a good movie, but it's not recommended if you do not like intelligent movies. It's about two boys who want to stay away from the world, and what exactly they get. This performance is great, not seemingly unpredictable, and today it has a good story, unlike many films. The film has complained that it is too simplistic or too boring. I think they should stick to movies like Toxic Avenger (I really like B movies) or Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. One Note: If you notice this, it will have the same actors from the cube except the four actors. Make two pointers: Credits Wait for me (trust me this). Enjoy the movie.
