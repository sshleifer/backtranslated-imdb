I first remember seeing this thing in the tv. I can not allow it to TVN! I had to own it! Humor is very NZ'ers but lose on, but give it a go! <br /> <br /> Matt and Chris have gone back to big and good (?) subjects since the back of their back. The great courage of the NZ-Devil Stuntman, Randy Campbell is often featured in the British TV series Balls of Steel. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, 'House Band' released Deja Voodoo 2 albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band has members of the Back of the Y team and 'I What You Have One One of the Bears (but I've Got Got)' and 'You Were Worth to Born in the 80's' <br /> The South-bye-South West Festival Festival also featured their feature length 'The Devil's Made Do It It' in early 2008. <br /> <br /> If you can not find these guys funny, you just F F ^ ^ K !!
