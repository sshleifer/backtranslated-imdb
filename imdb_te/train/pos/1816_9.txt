Reviews on this page claim that the movie is a little dark for the kids. It depends on the kid. The film is not for 2-6 years old; It is 8 years old and focused more on the larger group. I saw this film at the age of 10, and I totally loved it. Most animated films at that time were very small for my tastes. The film deals with more serious issues, and therefore has a slight emotional effect. The characters in this movie are deeper and dear to hell! These characters give even more emotional weight to the scary scenes of their lives. Good boys are not always good (like other cartoons). They are "real" motivations, revenge and greed, but also compassion and friendship; It shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> <br />
