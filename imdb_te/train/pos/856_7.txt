Distributed by the ridiculously fuzzy lines by Pierce Brosnan is alone. He played a kind of "James Bond's Psycho Twin brother", separated at birth, no doubt. As a serious hitman, his character is very sexy but also very, very well. A variety of vibrant, vibrant American "Guy door", Greg Kinnear, in contrast to many places, bright colors and quick-witty humor provide great entertainment. The story goes on a little deeper but the look of the movie is a great (possibly R-rated) laughter, and places that are part of the two members of the film, a new "Odd Couple", and works very well.
