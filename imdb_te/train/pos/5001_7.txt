Aardman does it again. <br /> <br /> Next to the picture, Adhamman animation proves exactly how to do animation. <br /> I saw the first episode of my life. I translated well for American audiences. <br /> <br /> As a fan of the BBC version and the short film, I know what I did. When I sit to watch this. Animators have done a great job of matching precision voices to a perfect match animal. <br /> Is not this for everyone? Not a long shot. In fact, I'd be glad to see the end of the show for the full season. But as already mentioned, the audience can not get it.
