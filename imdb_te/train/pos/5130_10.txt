<br /> <br /> In the past, did not everyone look pretty for everyone? I guess. Most stories have been made for commercial reasons, and some luck may have some artistic values ​​there. Is this an exception - only one? - It is obvious that the director has a vision and can be clearly understood as art. Why did no one ever think of Lester or Charlie Parker to shoot at Life's Day? <br /> There is a sequel. If you see the same quality please share it!
