Later, I looked at the movies ... I thought, "Why was this film so successful in the box office?" The film was also considered to be a brilliant / remorse scenario, acting is not good and the characters are not very interesting. For the Korean film ... I liked fighting scenes. If you want to see the film without thinking, it's a picture for you. But I had to confess ... the film is kind of child ... 6/10
