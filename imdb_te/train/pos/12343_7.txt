Artfully speaking, this is a beautiful picture - cinematography, music and clothes are beautiful. In fact, the film is much more beautiful than Akira Kurasawa's direction. <br /> <br /> In this way, the writing is well written and this story is, at some times, interesting. However, this story is still discouraging in some ways - after all, it is the story of a group of women working in a brothel. Although adultery is considered a more acceptable business in Japan, women are spending a better life. <br /> <br /> In this way, as a whole, it gets a 7 - mostly due to everything, but the sham's characters of Shame characters are very low. Writing. The weak link in the film is very bad as the story of the great Karasava.
