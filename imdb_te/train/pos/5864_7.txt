I do not laugh and do not like overtrade apocalypse. Perhaps my favorite Vietnam war film The Deer Hunter. Deer Hunter focused on an episode of the war and then focused on lives before the war. This film is essentially a Deer Hunter 2. The script is very loose compared to Deer Hunter. The tale of the story that the viewers really understand and feel for characters like Deerhunter never grew. Vietnam does not capture or involve itself in the flashbacks dherhanter. <br /> <br /> However, I thought I was acting correctly. Deniro and Harris are truly amazing actors. They totally dint themselves in their roles, expressing great exasperation of two former friends who lost their cousin Bobby. <br /> <br /> Harris's character is half dead alcoholic, hiding his life lost in Bobby, trying to save him. <br /> <br /> I also like the supporting actor. Everyone in the town is part of the film. The town certainly can not handle the Vietnam vets. Like many small towns, it's quiet, humble, and thinking about a business. Harris's character, however, can not be any of these things. It's interesting how wars influence people. Some people are quick to recover, and some can never really come back.
