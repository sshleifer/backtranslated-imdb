Sometimes it's hard to say why an image is so effective. From the moment I first came across "The Stone Boy", telling me something is a great movie. Even so, it seemed rare indeed to me that I really had a chance to see it. Then, one day, while looking through my local library's online catalog, I recently purchased this movie's DVD release. <br /> <br /> Cinematography says, "I'm very happy because cinematography does not reflect a tremendous depth and old old VHS copy. This is the most exciting topic of the film. I am convinced that a great cinematographer will take almost the same film as a photographer who has been pursuing a very precise visual style shot in "The Stone Boy". Here, he helps a lot from the most talented actors, and the director correctly understands the story. But Juan Ruiz behind the camera makes every scene something of beauty that has Ansia. And I can not say almost. Many movies you can never imagine such a thing. The scene then captures some details of the scene, part of the visual magic that takes your breath. <br /> <br /> Director Christopher Cain has a long and interesting career. As long as I have collected, this film is not very representative. But, sometimes, to catch a director at the start of his career, before all the big budgets and vision loss, there is real micro magic that can be traced. Cain will step back in the film, making things happen in their own lives, and then any more. As the early John Sayles movies, the characters were given breathing and talking time. Side stories are because of what they happen, and how life is. Cain displays a remarkable, crude, and accurate trait of human nature in the film. <br /> Acting is a part of this story. When people speak in the film, they are real people, and the fact that they are playing the role is not back. Gina Berriet's script allows Willy Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Frederick Forest to spend only the present time with the most talented and respected actors. Whether they say little or deep emphasis, it comes with the weight of pure reality. <br /> <br /> When you look at the actors involved or James Horner's great soundtrack seems so strange that such a movie was almost forgotten. Perhaps "The Stone Boy" has a long time in what can be done. In the 1970s I had a hangover concept of this film reminding me of this early childhood civilization. People speak of 80's in terms of modern styles and music, but I can not live or remember not 80 years old. The appearance of the images, the poor performance of the acting and the darkening of the acting, and the overall result should be under the skin of any person who grew up in the era or near of this era in North America. I'm looking for this. I see the world. <br /> <br /> "The Story of this Story" <br /> <br /> For more details on this concept: <br /> <br /> Black Stallion (1979) (1983), Trender in the Heart (1984), Mattwan (1987), High Tide (1987) , The Secret of Daisy (1989), The Secret Garden (1993), The Secret of Row Inch (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008)
