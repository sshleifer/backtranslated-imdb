This story is Anukush (Abhay Deol) - a professional marriage witness, who works as a witness to the couple in the wedding registration office - and Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi), who is interested in the love of Megha (Soha Ali Khan) flowing from his home at Nainital to marry her. This story begins, the waitress is waiting for Dheeraj's wedding registration office, but for some reason he does not show. So here comes the film Anushk, who is Rs. 200 she helps her for a job and provide shelter to her. Anushush grows to his side by working in a bank as an agent ... Ankush fell in love with Mega and she also fell in love with him (or kind of a love), both agree for marriage and Dharaj returns to the film. <br /> <br /> The original movie story is different than the movies we've seen and so I'm Mass but if you love to see a movie like me and see something different, Then you definitely like the movie. The film became a very romantic story by the characters of Abhii Deol and Soha Ali Khan. Characters that seem to be at the door next to the characters are very natural to you. The background music of the film plays a very good role, which is very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Music: Hemesh Rashmumia Creation, I did not expect much but I liked some songs including Khawala . <br /> Acting: Abhay Deol is the most fascinating, most intuitive and innocent act but he must stay away from singing. Soha Ali Khan, she is a toy, very cute toy. Again the most naive and natural acting and these two actors perfectly fit into their characters. Besides these two, Shayan Munshi requires some acting lessons and the fat is low to cover the bones. Other actors did their job well. <br /> <br /> Star stars: I give 5 to 3.5 stars. If you see in the theater, you enjoy the movie. Accept film freak and unusual stories. Otherwise wait for the DVD to come. The film does not exactly like the people and the business that can do it comes from the mouth campaign.
