Watch this movie for the beautiful pictures of Andy Golds Worthy's sculptures, and drive you to the open and relaxing experience of your eyes. Music completes the footage but does not always attract attention. Some commentators have called interview snippets as a weaker place by the artist, but consider: If you can read a lengthy book in his books or read one of his amazing lectures, why can you expand it in this film? This medium is more suitable for displaying the ephemeral nature of the artist's works, and is used in this regard.
