"<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />" brilliant direct and effective score from veteran Jane Henoman by Fran√ßois Due Raubayeux makes it easy for the film to be a timeless quality. <br /> <br /> It is a lonely buddy or bonding story with both loneliness and tiredness in the world , Returned from Algiers, and other colonies of this period (After the famous World War II in the 60th century), France disappeared abroad. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (original title) They are working to create the actions of their two (opposing) leaders after their release /> <br /> One thing happens after another and the viewer should really focus, because JAPRISOT is lean and economical with his writing: if it is <br /> <br /> These two men, physically and mentally, have a long weekend, to fight it out, their motivation is different, their goals are different - their survival is entirely dependent on everything. <br /> All the DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are quite different from the ex - the former, undoubtedly a handsome boy, and the next one ugly thug, <br /> <br /> That quest makes a great story, br>> There are women in this film, and I do not forget that in the Japrizat manner, they are also memorable, yet they are not even memorable; When it comes to realizing their true nature, there is a lot to spoil their happiness. <br /> Forward, Friends released in the UK; AN ANORORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 ENHANCED; English only (not even subtitles for hearing hard); 110 MINUTES expiration time; Mono soundtrack but DE RauBoyx is a lot of music punch! <br /> Highly recommended.
