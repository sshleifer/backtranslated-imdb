YETI is one of the greatest bad movies that made it because it deserves 8 star ratings. I saw it at a midnight screening and people are cheering at madness and insanity - this is one of those movie trainwrecks where you think the movie can not get any stranger and then it! Yeti Tha Project looks like millionaire as Chris Penn and John Goodman pounded two unhealthy suit suits - the scientist playing guy ever has ever been one of the worst actors to appear on the screen - and yes, there is a dumb boy (a little girl looks like) and he (hmmm- maybe a kid A treatment for murdering both his parents and a plane crash Ever since the news was muted. Then this hottie Italian girl looked at Yeti (which once she melts out) - and he instantly in love with her - one of the silly things about the film that makes this giant Yeti "bedroom eyes" at her - it's a big barry white like. In fact, the big Yeti hits the hottie and once her to his chest - she accidentally hit the Yeti Nipple and takes time to show the film get his big gray nipple hard, yes !!!! The edges of all the Yikes! Plus Italian Italian girl hair like "Gee, thanks Yeti keeps the big fish bone and uses it" - this is a frank scene where even Yeti eats a giant fish - because it should be heard by the American audience like the Italian producer dogs and he tried to get a little lassie - Now my hair is like a soft and dead trout . Ed Wood film's more bizarre than ever expected. If you're a fan of the classic movie, the worst - on the child.
