It's hard for me to criticize anything that Mitzi Boutique does. She is aesthetic and grace radiates and an unusual actress on screen. However, the plot is predictable. If I was sleeping with Jill Had Richard, I thought it was a little more crazy than he was in the past, adding more to the suspense. It would also be nice to learn about Jill and her husband Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, perhaps a bit more back story. I was disappointed when I finished the movie. I like to have more closure with Jack's death and possibly closing with her husband. But I say, I can not see a fire gun and she should not stand there. This is the most appropriate end for Richard. Of course, Mizzi did not come! I'm looking forward to his future projects.
