A few years ago I watched the film in Vinnnell as the audience liked it. <br /> <br /> The story begins in London in 1900, where the story decides to become an actress. She tries to become one, but a man learns on stage before she deals badly, she has the talent and she meets with the audience and emerges as a strong human being. <br /> <br /> There are some reviews, her performance was broken, and she accused her of being unable to bring her life and drowsiness. Esther Kahn should be and Fenix ​​takes a brave decision to make Esther a boring girl. So eventually her transformation is more powerful than it may not be. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is very good, and at the start of the century London films are all too dark. <br /> <br /> The only one in my opinion is that you are close to the length and letter of the film, only when you find the actor, that is why there are no dramatic actions in the film. Fenix ​​Credit It is not that we miss the interest in the movie after the first hour.
