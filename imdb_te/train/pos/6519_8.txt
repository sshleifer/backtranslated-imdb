The film had great stars in their previous years: Ingor Stevens was not pretty; Yule Brainer Jean Lafit, a very believer, was controversial about his piracy and wanted to be neutral with the United States. Charlotton Heston has done a good job as Andrew Jackson, but a few moments are a bit stagnant. This is really good for students to learn parts of our history, and all the happy conclusions show that lovers do not mix with each other - sometimes the happiest conclusion is that they will go away and in the long run understand them. I've seen twice every year for at least 16 years; And even though it's not the best film I've seen, I love it every time!
