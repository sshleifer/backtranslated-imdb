I have the pleasure of seeing this beautiful movie last night, watching a wonderful addition to a question and answer session with the director. I suspect that the first commentator's parents or anyone would be very close to death. I have a lot of losses, and this film speaks to me. It is not one of the main themes that we do not face queries / issues / stories with our loved ones until they are too late - they do not work too early or die. Talk with your loved ones, listen and record their stories, tell people you like and resolve the differences. I liked the message that no mistakes were made. I love the role of the director of the two daughters - one of the six siblings, I know how complicated those relationships are. His history as a cinematographer also comes through loud and clear - what a beautiful picture! Casting is outstanding - a movie is not missed!
