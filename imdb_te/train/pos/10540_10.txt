It only accepts with a taximeter, a spectacular film and a wider audience. The imagination for the show, the script's visual explanation, the humorous is constantly surprising. Both leads are great and really carry the picture. My advice did not even see a trailer, just look at the movie rent and expectations. I've rented a blockbuster, so it's readily available in Brisbane, but it's good for everyone, but I have a lot of opinions and it's always good, except it's 'stupid'. I loved this movie, you can not just get to see this gem every day. It has become a cult favorite. Try it once, I might feel it the same way.
