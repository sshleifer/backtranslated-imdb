When he saw the film, my son was 7 years old, he is now on the Russian fishing ship and he is very impressed with the film and the Legend of the Legend Boy and Eagle survive in these 39 years. He asked if he could get it for himself. Because he is only 3 o'clock in the day, many things are going through his head and he is in the ship for 3 months and his contract is 3 months ahead of time. He is attached to this film because he has Indian blood. On January 27th, he will be 47 years old and will get the film for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and it is one of the most dangerous jobs since we all know it. Can I help get this movie? Thanks in advance, Dolly Crowd-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
