"Slater Hai" is a somewhat ridiculous slazer film about a high school martyrer, some of whom are trapped, and some are caught up. His pranks are gone wrong and he will end up with terrible burning. Five years later his violence is reunited-only ten of them, and less and martyrs after murder. This act is completely awful, a man's stomach blast and another woman The victim literally comes with an acid bath, a couple having sex in bed electromagnetic, a man is crushed by a tractor, a girl is drowned, and a physician receives a hyperdemic needle in the eye. The killer is a good and crazy jester's mask and arrangement (a beautiful old English castle). But the end of that dream is entirely curious. That's part of the "Slaughter High" garbage, but I'm really only for the fans of the evil slaughter flicks.
