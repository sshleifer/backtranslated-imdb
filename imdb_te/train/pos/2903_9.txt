Tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy. Damien Sajipran has done another great job, following his great fist film called El Fonda del Mar and the amazing TV Pro Grammar Los Simulations. Moments of Tinto de Valliantes, a film made in Hollywood by Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors and here, they have great performances. <br /> <br /> The movie is very fun and funny and exciting moments.Tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy I fully recommend if you wanna be great <br /> <br /> "
