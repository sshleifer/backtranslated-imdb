This is one of the greatest "our gang" shorts of all time. Spanky is his most beautiful and ridiculous, and he's also hilarious to babysit the kids that he'll get. The gang is compelled by the gang to look after their younger siblings. The opening shot of all baby carcasses is a beautiful gang that is entertaining various items hanging from fishing poles. </ P> <p> The old toys are priceless, in his response - "Hey, where do you get that stuff - I look after the kids!" The younger brother who claims to be "awesome" throughout the movie, all the beautiful scenes, and "all about Tarzan," you'll ever see the best of "Our Gang".
