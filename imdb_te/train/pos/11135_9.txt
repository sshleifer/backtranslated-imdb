The Midnight Cowboy is a successful film that combines with Joe Book Ritz Rizzo, through the difficulties that affect both. The character does not have much unwanted roles in the film, but these men can find humanity at least one by one, giving their own kind of optimism to both of the hard reality surrounding the two. <br /> <br /> This film is Jon Voight's best performance and perhaps Dustin Hoffman's as well. Although the rest of the cast is made unknowingly, it will initially round the line of the roles of characters, including cowbucks in the bus. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Andy Warhol's Apprentice shows Paul Morrissey briefly at the moment. <br /> If you can not see this movie, it is necessary. Check it out.
