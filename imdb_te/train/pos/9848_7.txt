I saw this movie with my baby eyes and I was disappointed. This story is very popular, some of the abandoned orphans need to bring in an unlikely trilogy (mamoot - Sabertot Tiger and lazy) to her parents ... and do not forget to tell me about the amazing little fury animal her hazenut. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: It works, it's funny and it must see your children ("they like it").
