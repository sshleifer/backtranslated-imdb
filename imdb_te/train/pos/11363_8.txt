Imagine that a person is experiencing a criticism that he has spent 8 years in his life and has a psychological failure that actually attempts to solve a genuine murder case! The killing method is clear, but actually a monster that the government does not like to do is kill dozens of lives. When I think my job is stressful, I must remember the true story behind this strange picture. The devotion to the role of the main character is masterfully filmed by Rhea. This is one of my favorite films of the past five years - comic (and sometimes tragedy relationships) between Ria and Sutherland characters. One of the worst mass murderers in history came to me on the edge of my seat. Not nearly advertised and did not talk about "Lamb's Silence", the plot is just curious. Rent or buy this movie!
