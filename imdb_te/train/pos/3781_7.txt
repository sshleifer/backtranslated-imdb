I do not dare to say this film is better than the original, but it's pretty good at home. Though the comedy is original in the film, there are many scenes, I'm thinking of them. <br /> <br /> The story in the movie is more odd than the original, but it does it greatly. Peter Hewitt is doing a great job of directing the film with great actors. The main cast from the original film will return to their roles in the film and will do fantastic work with all their characters. I do not care if someone tells me, I think Kean Reeves is a great actor! As I did with Alex Winter Bill, I really enjoyed Ted's role in both these films. George Carlin is very happy to come back to Rufus, very nice! Hall London Jr., who plays Ted Logan's father, makes a good job. Ted begins with his father's body and the scenes featuring Hall London junior, with a great act like Ted, who heals it well. I can not forget to mention William Sadler as Death, he made me a complete film. The rest of the cast is great. <br /> <br /> If you like the first installment of Bill and Ted series, I hope I like this movie too. But do not expect this to be true. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading the movie
