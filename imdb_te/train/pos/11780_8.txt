This is a documentary I came across by chance in the UK TV channel More4 and I have to say I found a very interesting and provocative idea. I would also have sought the source material book for this documentary. This is primarily Professor Jared Diamond's doctrine, why parts of the earth's societies exist and why others did not. His argument is new to me, and argues that the proper animal farming that correctly correct crops and pets is absolutely not what's perfect. As far as the documentary is concerned, it is not well documented and most of the re-created scenes spoiling many modern documentaries. Diamond also helps by being condescending which intellectuals are very wrong when trying to get a message to people. People have called his theory Marxist, but I have not bought it and I see more social geologist. It was also refreshed to hear the theory based on religion on the evolution of society. Highly recommended view.
