I saw this movie on Demand on On the Today, and I do not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> I have heard about this film, but never have any views on it anymore. <br /> I'm impressed with what I saw. <br /> <br /> I really freak in some areas and remember when I really flip my seat a few times. <br /> <br /> Blob is scary looking. <br /> Now, I look in a jar of jelly and wonder if it can cope with my hands? <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen is as good as Steve Andrews, the film's lead character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know what you want,
