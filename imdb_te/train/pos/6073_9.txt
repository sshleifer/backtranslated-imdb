My college professor Othello may be Shakespeare's finest play. I do not know if I still agree with him. I bought this video version of the film. First I loved Kenneth Branagh as Igo, he was complicated complicated and worked well in this adaptation. Surprisingly, he did not direct it but played the role. Lawrence Fishburn shows that American actors can only play Shakespeare's role in British actors. There is no British versus American issue about it. In fact, if we all work together then Shakespeare can reach Mass that it deserves greatly. From other Shakespeare tragedies, it is treated with a race problem. There is something in existence from the beginning of time. The relationship between Igo and Emilia is good and can show the complexity of their community together. When Othello loves Dedomonna with all the hearts of herself, her jealousy and fears are weak to the person with bladder, such as Cassius. It's a great scene at the end of the film but I do not reveal the end. It's just worth watching. I think they'll be edited for up to 2 hours, but they always add to Shakespeare.
