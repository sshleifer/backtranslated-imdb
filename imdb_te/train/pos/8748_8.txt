I feel like I want to tell this film at the end of the film! Or Damn Australian? I still do not know, but I know I really liked this movie but this is not my favorite movie! <br /> <br /> The great story with great stars but with the terrible ending ... Oh, tell her that she is very good and yet ... yet, who made it? What really happened? Who is that person? There are no answers to these questions <br /> <br /> The Mysterious Movie, which has a good mark on the whole ... 8.5 going up and I give 8/10!
