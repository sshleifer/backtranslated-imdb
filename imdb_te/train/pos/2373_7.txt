The first credible adaptation of the first novel "HM Wells of the Worlds", the first novel by Pedagne Pictures, has been in development for nearly 5 years. A theatrical release was intended for this year (March, 2005), but this has never happened. <br /> <br /> The DVD was released when released with Spielberg's release on July 29 theaters. <br /> I love these reservations. ? It's not much 100% Wells Book, but 90% -95% of the believers are good to me. At least in some scenes, Ogilville is a confrontation of astronomers with a farmer, and an unnamed writer / storyteller having trouble with his cousin. But overall, this movie book is very close - much more than the classic 1953 version by George Paul. <br /> <br /> Its biggest mistake is made up of a very cheap budget. Most of the blue-screen appears to have been filmed and featured digitally applied backgrounds. Internal shots, and crowded City streets scenes are particularly annoying at this time. The 1898 Over Overview sounds like something from the London video game. Several scenes in horse carriages were duplicated - I could not rent a horse. <br /> <br /> In those budget limits, they are able to do much. Artfully, the image appears correctly. Martians and their trypots are very well made, and Wells is very true to the descriptions. I was particularly impressed with the hot ray. The Thunder Child Sequence, which is one of the highlights of the film, is very disappointing. <br /> Acting and directing can not win any Oscars. For the most part, they are not efficient, bad, but unusual. <br /> <br /> The music is great, especially with Hollywood music directors. <br /> <br /> The budget limit is very bad on a large screen. <br /> <br /> Some Nittix: Many scenes have different color filters (mostly red). It may be an artistic choice, but it will be used quite incomprehensible, and the DVD is seen as a sloping work of mastering. And the author / storyteller apparently shifts from scene to scenery to the scene. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - worth seeing? If you look at technology and budget restrictions, you can really enjoy it, especially if you read the original HG Wells novel. However, if you are easily discontinued by cheap product values, you pass it best (unless you're an MST3K fan). <br /> <br /> BTW: The Complete Release of Worlds War ("INVASION") struck Spielberg's theaters in the same month: DVD http://mddb.com/title/tt0449040/. It was also made in the budget, but it was updated to the present day like the Spellberg movie - but it's great! And on top of it, Jeff Wayne is making an animated film of his best-selling album since 1978, but it will not be until 2007.
