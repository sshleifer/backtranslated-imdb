It fits a musical Sunday in order to pumping your heart, and no one can do better than Little Richard. <br /> <br /> See Leon to provide a definitive role as he did with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a lovely biography when Little Rachard finds his father fighting with his father and herself with him. He won the war and no one had his voice or his style.
