The film claims to be as magnificent as many films. Movies are considered to be fun and fun time. And it's perfect. <br /> If you feel the rest of the picture, how it ends, the joy is not in the surprise of the shadows. This image is another carbon copy. Instead, the remaining 2 "thugs" celebrated how men entered their own right. <br /> <br /> This film is fun and fun. <br /> <br /> The camera work, especially the Dal√≠'s movements, are well implemented. The story is written, weak, characters are not 2 dimensional but they are full of life and desire. This film will not win any Oscars, nor any DVD block buster sales but a pleasant watch and a fun experience.
