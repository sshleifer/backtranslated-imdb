This film is amazing - it's just like a nightmare. Bizarre story, dark decors, swarming insects everywhere, thinking jumps and surreal dreams ... really great! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers find this wonder. Strange story, strange dreams, red curtains: it is very small for David Lynch's films. Nit Noir almost no plot. It is replaced by surreal moments, nightmares and meetings. That's an error. If the movie is really lovely plot full of tension with an attractive detonation, I will give a 10 out of 10. But that does not, and that's why I gave the movie 8. Niuit Noire is worth watching. Search the DVD and you'll be rewarded!
