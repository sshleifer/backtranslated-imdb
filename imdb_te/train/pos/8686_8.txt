The second official episode of "The Columbo" episode ("Murder By The Book", later filmed, hit the first gases). Robert Kulp, who competes with Whites with Peter Falk's detective in many future installations, is a magnificent figure as the short-tempered person of the sophisticated private detective agency that killed a client wife when he rejected his cloudmail schemes. These two stars fit well with this clever cat and mouse exercise, which is the best in the series.
