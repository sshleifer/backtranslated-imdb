Some summer space campers are actually accidentally sent into a robot space. The oxygen in the ship runs short. Air tanks, etc., had to be sent to one station. <br /> <br /> First, the plot of this film is not possible in real life. <br /> <br /> You are very surprised to see the same young actresses after so many years. (I first saw this film in 2000, which was filmed in 1986), and many still work in Hollywood. <br /> The spacecraft. This is not true. It will last for about 2 hours, you will notice and run very fast. You know that this is not true, but until the end you get sucked into it. <br /> <br /> The whole family is a good family image.
