I grew up in the town of Roersford, P., Jerry. I'm going to see my entire family filming. I must remember the one who has "blob" to my brothers and my brothers in Baket. I also wish my mother was in the film. Her hair style was Aneta Corset's same and she was sick one evening and she asked me to sit on the car with Steve McQueen for a few shots from seeing my mom and from behind. They paid her $ 25.00 and gave her a story telling her until she died last August. My mom is not a teenager and she has a few months since giving birth to my little sister.
