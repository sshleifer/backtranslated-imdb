<br /> <br /> Realistic, sarcastic, witty, witty, fast, sexy, extravagant, soft, romantic, hearty and brown, footage parade is first-class entertainment. The treatment material gives the latest edge and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking. Think that they started talking to these pictures just 7 years ago! The brightness of the dialog does not match anywhere, especially the "reality" contemporary film has taken and feels good. <br /> <br /> Hayes code is the latest, self-reference, critical and living cinematic direct speech of contemporary audience suffering from age-restricted content and disappointing and age-old angst. I recommend to watch any movie of this period, which I recommend to see what's best for popular movies from 1930-1935.
