"Who?" Has many fearless smiles and gags. This is not one of the best studios films of Shem, but it is one of the best short films produced by Columbia. Director Berndards originally wrote the screenplay for Stooges in 1946, but when Curley Howard faced a professionally stroke, the Columbia Comedy Team of Shilling and Lane (their version was released as "Pardon My Terror") <br /> <br /> Old Man Gudrich Ace detectives Shep, Larry, and Mo, should be killed. When they reached his home, Gudrich disappeared and tried to get rid of his niece and classical goons stools. Will they find Goodrich, and do nieces and grooms justice? <br /> <br /> The shemp in this movie is particularly funny. His reflexes were excellent after Mickey was given by Christine McIntyre; He tries to lure his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre! Other funny scenes: the closest part of the mo's mug looking through the camera lens; <br /> <br /> Nico Gon (played by Duke York) is one of the most extraordinary characters in the film Stogez. With his everyone-covered hair, he could almost pass for a stoogey, if he had not had a tower on everyone! "Who?" Stem is a gem in the films with Shem. Even hard die hard fans will enjoy this one! True stoji classic. 9 out of 10
