There is no doubt that the national past is based on the comedy. If you're acting like you're communicating, or how the Communists are, what are the original Russians or Brits, if you agree and do not harm the meetings, you can enjoy this movie. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin has succeeded to be completely disappointed by Nicole and the rest of the cast. Finally moving, logical - cinematic logic, of course. If you accept the rules of the game, it is worth watching.
