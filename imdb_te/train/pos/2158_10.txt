I do not like "grade inflation" but I should give it a 10. I can not think of anything that I do not like about it. I woke up tonight that I saw last night and thought about it. The Hollywood remake, which has told me about someone with J Law and Richard Gear, would be fantastic, but since 1996 this original Japanese version is a very emotional and thought provoking to me that I'm hard pressing to think <br /> <br /> The story is valuable to me, And if there are dogmatic combat scenes or guns or anything else! <br /> All characters seem to be well-developed ... ... but the basic characters have good character-development and cheerful performance, and casting seems to be quite right. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to recognize good music and music in our day and age, perhaps it is not well-deserved (I have a lot to learn how to dance) but I really think Jen Kelly and others who dance in our lives are very well thought out in this film , The role of the dance is to tell a story about a middle-aged man and a family in Japan <br /> <br /> This role contributed to a group of people in Japan.
