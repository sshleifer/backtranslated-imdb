* Adam Sandler, Don Cheadley, Jada Pinkett Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Ray Allen, Paula Newcom. Sandler sometimes dramatizes his old college roommate and friend (Sandler in his best role from "Panchem-Drunk Love" with a chuckle reunited with Cheadle) who is totally upset about his family on 9/11. Will continue to do impressive work with each character up to date), which is all well done do-do dentist ?? Family, wealth, happiness ?? But really a friend sees freedom in his personal life's personal life offerings. The weekend miracle is the coolest solution to Binder (formerly-best friend and acting accountant of Sandler's), with equal comedy and genuine heartbeat when two stars share screen, until the last and most directing role.
