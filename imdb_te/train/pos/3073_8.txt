This film needs more kind of Hollywood. There are no extravagant objects, no car, no wise one-liners. <br /> <br /> William Mackie plays the role of a murderer who does not work for his father, Donald Sutherland. Messi is the sensational son, Sutherland's dominant father. The son wants the business, the father does not allow him. Mackey loves his own son, who plays beautifully by David Darferman ("The Ring"). <br /> It meets the waiting room of his psychiatrist's office, which begins to fall in love with Neve Campbell. <br /> <br /> It is an interesting scenario of the characters and follows the film murderer who is reluctant, that's the necessity of his family. There are so many touching scenes, especially between Mackie and his little boy. <br /> <br /> You have a lot of humor as you would expect in a film with William Mackie. <br /> <br /> Nice work, actors and director. It is good to know that Hollywood is still doing a good budget in a small budget.
