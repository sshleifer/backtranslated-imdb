This is not an art house movie, it's fun. <br /> The depth is of beautiful people, the one & the one, and of the action. I found it very entertaining. It's not like to stay intelligent stimulating, it's a fun movie to watch! Jessie and Chase are very funny, it's just gravy. <br /> In summary, I would recommend that you check the boys or your girl for a little Friday night entertainment with your girl. (If other girls like to see it!) <br /> <br /> The villains are very good. Winnie, Cory Large, Hattien Guy from Heroes. Very evil villains.
