So, I can easily have a relationship with Polanski - where I once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide, and our apartment was in a building where midnight was able to get a fifty dollar noise breach for the sneezes "tenant." <br /> <br /> But I also enjoyed the film for other reasons. I can not say that it's fully functional - the politeness's character and irritability of the character, the last half hour or longer, is instead jarring and bizarre. Ebert, for one, was totally unaware, and he was the son of the film applause with a veteran actor actor. But I do personal scenes and moments that work beautifully, so even though I can not understand the whole movie - for example, what should Egypt do with it? <br /> <br /> I love the bad boy I have painted by Bernard Feston, for example. How many times have I been resolved to have stupid friends instead of all men! I like the movie theater scene - the moment in the history of the movie "Out of" Moment, I said. And boy, I love Isabelle Adjani - she's so foxy in this movie, it's almost unbelievable. <br /> <br /> She is also a good actor for the Polans. Here I agree with the comments that occasionally disagree with his performance. His character is considered low-key and tedious, so his low-key performance is sufficient. <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the meantime, But the apartment binds the country's alienation features - the thing I have done so full - so I'll remove it. All you need is a simple reference, and suddenly this Weirdore film is deeply important! Picking for pocket change on DVD is definitely worth it.
