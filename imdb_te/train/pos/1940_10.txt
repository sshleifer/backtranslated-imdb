I am really impressed with this film. The writing is fantastic, and the characters are all great, and simple. It's easy to emotionally embed them all. While creating real life characters, the creators of the film really hit the nail on the head, and the viewer breathed their world. Still, the music is fantastic. They employ some freelancers to score, and some soundtrack, and they are doing a great job for the film. If you could catch this film on a small theater or film festival (as I did), I'd recommend you to see it. Moreover, in the personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in the film. There is a reason to check it out.
