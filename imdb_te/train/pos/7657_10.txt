This is a very horrible, hard-hitting, hypocritical movie about a death break that goes into hypocrisy. It keeps you black and white photography from date. Mickey Rooney is basically stunning, yet amazingly sympathetic. One of the first films to paint the mental desertion of death. It's very sharp.
