This was my first horror film (perhaps why I could remember some parts of it), recalling that I was a child when I first saw this film. I do not remember much about acting, nude scenes or other stuff, but I remember that I had a male child with a grenade, repelled the male on a tree and a male truck falls off and shot on the head :) (Todd Schaffer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McPherson). I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAlister was killed by the killer stomach to get the truck's keys. This is the image you give creep and it's worth a look. But where do I find it? How do I download
