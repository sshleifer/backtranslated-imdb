Soyent Green Classic. I'm waiting for someone to come back. Science Fiction Classics are remaking these days (i.e. war of the worlds) and some director / producer soyland green. With today's computer animation and technology, it is likely to be a great film. Anti-utopian imagery is not too far. Human species can reduce it, such as no external impact Rochees. Like humans, they do not have to control human breeding, except for them, if they leave the lower species of animals below hand. Despite all diseases, wars, miscarriages, birth control, the human race is still a bacterial in the petri dish. According to classic Malthusian economics, any species, including humans, must multiply their livelihoods. 6 billion and growing ... it is obscene.
