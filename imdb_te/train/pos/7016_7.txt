Even though I can understand the bad things I have to say about this film, I'm still amazing. It is worth seeing that, unless you touch it, and your reviewer is not searching deep into each image's errors and mishaps, or simply just touching anything else. Do not come into any expecting movie, just have tissue and open mind. It is beautiful and acting is amazing. I think Will Smith, he is still surprised to yet play another solo dreary person. I believe there is someone who plays the role of feelings and emotions that we have at our worst / best experiences as a good actor really we can reach you and you will feel something. And this film is perfect. Give it a chance.
