One of the top films I have never seen is the Higher Learning. It's an amazing cast, and a very brilliant director. Singleton shows how life is in the university. There are 3 main story lines, skinned heads, African-Americans and homosexuals. I was amazed at all the stories, but I got a lot of people, it's a story about Kristen, and her feelings towards another girl. The ending was great. Seeing the movie 25 times plus, I still cry. I gave this film 11, but I have to settle in 10/10.
