Samuel Fuller brought this cinematic, fun and beautiful direction to the Pulp story, and he has managed to create one of the unseen gems in the 1950s film. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a tough guy (he is a character in the role of a young lady (Jean Peters) in New York subway and a number of films that dumped a piece of much-needed microfilm.This is 1953, so the microfilm is a The property of the spy, which does not stop anything from recovering, is shown at the girl's Waterfront Shock Sent, an abusive boyfriend sent back to the film, widmark feelings she and her "colleagues" are likely to shake down for big money. <br /> <br /> Fuller clumsily maintains love story, but more from the feeling of apathy than the bad writing or direction. Since love stories are very often and in Hollywood films, he has a love story in Durr√©s and is intentionally unreliable Peters gave a stunning New York cookie, part of a gangster mole and suffering.When violence happens to her, we take care of her, and it is full of Fuller's insurgent and pre-existing style, a happy ending not necessarily an early end . <br /> The ultimate success of "pickup in South Street" depends on the sides of the telma ritter on different sides of the world, a worst woman who earns money, whether a black woman, a necklace or a police communicator. Ritter gives her career's performance; In a renowned monologue, she was directly exposed to the whole tragedy of her character's life, and was desperate to wake up every morning in the morning, fight, crime and suffering world. Each character ritter occasionally meets for a short instant, giving the emotions that do not give a chance to be broadcast on those other films. Highlight of the Fleur film, and the highlight of the 50s film, is the period. <br /> Grade: A +
