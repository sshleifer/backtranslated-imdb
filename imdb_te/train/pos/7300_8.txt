The latest production of Michael Oblivitz is hard work, but it's slow and exciting. The last outing of the producer, "Mosquito-3" is the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark image, but they managed to do something. Only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy is always fun when dealing with the fantastic worlds under the surface of the ocean. But it is only acceptable. In some scenes the poor vision producing is enthusiastic. With Dolphins and Wales, the technology is all but waste. Many close-ups of heavy sequences and heavy content of the film did not take advantage of IMAX's amazing 3D capabilities. There are very few scenes of depth or variety. Close-ups of these fantastic creatures are just flat and only one life in the camera field, so there is no difference of depth. Michael Oblivitz is trying to follow his father's footsteps, but you've got a shark-wake cab, his inner and dull treatment is disappointing in his condition.
