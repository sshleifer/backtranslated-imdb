We forget that over the past centuries, the master / slave case leads to more money than the well-established estates driven by large groups of slaves, and a lot of money for white owners. This leads to groups of people found in the middle - a child interacting with slave owners and their female slaves. <br /> <br /> Some of these children became enslaved and others are free ... but free - <br /> <br /> A class that surrounds this offspring - Guns de Cooler Libre or free people - and that class was able to, To some extent, the property is owned, not to the education of the educated, and to obtain a comparative dignity. <br /> <br /> Many women are white breeding masters and mistresses for wealthy men. A kind of empowerment depending on the respective dignity chosen to impose own homes, allowances, schools and their families paid for their children. In essence, they are prostitutes to determine their own wealth, and relative independence from the proletariat - an arrangement called pla√ßage. <br /> <br /> The dinner of All Saints is a beautifully written story about the child of such a woman. The people who have touched a local gentleman, and their lives, are a similar result in a negative and positive way. New Zealand, which does not have a real sense of black / white lines, was an eye opener to Father, a gray area in the middle of a sloping gun area. These characters are very three-dimensional and well-adapted in the novel's adaptation by Anne Rice. The parts are well cast, the costumes are striking, and the ruthless way lines are removed, the obscure areas are much different from the differences that lead through the main character. Whites were unable to marry homosexuals, slaves could not help, whites and sympathizers could not even meet the economic realities of the proper work by their dependents. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this story to both novel and miniseries, unnecessarily. If you can not handle the truth, some people are unfair, some are unfair, by their white oppressors and their own people, and the other will lose injustice. <br /> <br /> This is not true, but remember if this story is an absorbing way to learn about it. <br /> <br /> I do not know, but these little children entertained me and tasted sour taste in the mouth I saw in my mouth, and I enjoyed it very much. Look. If you do not read from time to time, there is a lesson to learn from it.
