Definitely well filmed and made, well shot and done! But the story is very weak. Lincoln's role is also weak. Henry Fonda is not good, but the role played by that character. That means telling me that you are a brilliant cracking smart donkey in relation to the Lincoln Act or the court. Who did i think he was hell? Wanna cuzine? I'll come, "I call you jacass" ??? I mean Ford is going for great funny hero guy but I really do not like this guy at all. He has been sitting in a courtroom where the cheats in sports, talks like real sweeps simple and does not know. <br /> This turn is also weak. I mean it's just stupid. The whole story appeared as if it had been 5 years in his or her dreams. Saying that I liked it adequately, it's quite entertaining and I'm laughing in so many situations, so I can not say it's a bad movie. In fact, I must tell you that it's good, laughs at me and laughing at me is bad but this bright and silly story can not understand how I can not understand a great feeling. <Br /> <br /> I do not know how the film is historically accurate but if it is true I really need to move my head.
