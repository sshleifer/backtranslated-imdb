Two episodes have been seen twice. The story was enjoyed and enjoyed by the old Patrick Swayaji hero. He was incredibly optimistic for hunter Alan Quartermine and performed well for Richard Chamberlain's performance. I agree that I want to see someone like "Distress Lady". Alison Doody should stick to modern and long pieces. She does not have a woman's appearance of 1800. The rest of the cast are excellent and the storylines are very well followed. I'm glad to see this generation actors are not afraid to try on different roles and are not afraid to look like getting old. Age is inevitable, but it should not be hidden from it. A man who is 50+ is very sexy (and, Patrick is really sexy), then greener young, beautiful. The characters of the character of Hurah to go along with a great smile.
