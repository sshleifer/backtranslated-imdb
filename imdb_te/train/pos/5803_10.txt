Wow, when I was looking through the garage, I forgot how great the film was until it struck down. It's a kind of strange combination of Michael Jackson's bio, collection of musical instruments, and a few little kids save the story about a superhero. These oddities are better (especially the Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of the film is the superhero segment, in which Michael Jackson turns into a car, a robot and finally a spaceship (which sounds odd). <br /> <br /> The honest gem is a "Smoot Criminal" video of a precious film that owns only that part.
