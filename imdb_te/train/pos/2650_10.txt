My favorite movie producers list: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Almighty 3) The rest is ... The film is actually better than the book (and even though these TV miniseries). Flawless filming style, acting and (Kubrick's All Time Number One Skill) Music - The fairy tale of Horror. I saw TV documentaries a few years ago and liked the story and there were my hopes on this when I was caught. I'm exception! It's far better than I expected. It starts slowly (Kubrick trademark) and has a lot of time to increase suspense. The intro scene is a classic for all and I watched just 20 times for the cutting atmosphere that stimulates the entire film. Moreover, the film does not make a hatred in recent horror films (it's just adequate and not trivial). Look at this!
