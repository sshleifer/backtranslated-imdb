Well, let's start by saying that the film is not the exact composition of Andrei Chikata's crime and legal guise. Despite the "official policy" in the Politburo, even though the USSR did not have serious killers, the legal system actually carried out others and "Killer X" (he was originally called) was already a case of the Fatisov Burkov. In fact, as soon as they realized, many murders took place in their hands, and a dozen officers were appointed by the authorities to identify and end the killing of a person who was not identified as a regular serial killer. Parameters. The director and writers consistently recall the story, not only for the story, but on the basis of "real events". <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS FOLLOW **** <br /> <br /> That's a good example of fast-paced Hollywood-style thriller that gets across the basics of what happened. It's just enough truth behind its version of events to make it easy to follow and make comprehensive view. Yes, in menses, both male and female children raped and murdered both children and adults. Yes, dark laboratory has released him to continue killing years. Yes, innocent men accused the murders and "pleaded" their crimes to the police appeal. Yes, homosexuals have been abused when committed to crime (although with the help of Burkhak's commitment). And yes, it did not allow a special prosecutor, Gorbenov, to capture, but with a sensitive understanding of Buchanowski, a psychiatrist (even though Gorbenov was not really close to the epic Martinez in which the film was shot). <br /> <br /> This is a director and co-author Chris Gerolmo who has a perfect cast of a pitch that does not hurt. . Developing skill in developing Stephen Ria's killings and expertise Skills, developing skill with running Soviet party hacks and microscopic spine, is clear when necessary, with Max Geoffrey Demon's seating under current trial that Van Sido's childhood enthusiasm is all sharp dialogue and Improves underestimating the correct amendment. <br /> "Citizen X" is almost "not nearly" simply due to a moment of self-compliment at the end of the pitch perfect). The fictitious saying is not actually good, but it is not actually presented ... if it takes into consideration the junk "serial killer" films that Hollywood usually spit out, it's good for me.
