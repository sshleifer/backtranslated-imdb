I got this film for years tape and I started looking back again (how to wait for my laundry!) ​​Because I wanted to hear Benjamin Frankel's title music again. I ended up sitting about the first half hour, and it was wonderful to see how beautiful and beautiful the performances were. The film is the 50th British Star Characters: Cecil Parker, Michael Guff, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and Ernest Tegger, especially as the oldest giant of textile mill. Not about Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not just lovely attractive leads than journalists. This is a science fiction in its pure form and drum comedy. I am an all time classic, and I hope nobody will try to remake it!
