<br'06 Not really bad for Raw's first PPV. But for those who are really looking at the end is really surprising for everyone to attend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you do not know what to do, WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP FOR EDGE W / LITA Not a bad opener, if they have more time to keep in a wrestling competition, these two can put great matches. Edge won flair by the DQ after slamming him with his MITB briefcase. 3/10 SECOND MATCH- TRISH STRATUS VS. This kind of Mickey Jams for WWE Women's Championship did not notice the fact that this is the first time faced in the ring. Miley Chick goes for chic kick, but her own chic kick nails for triple ducks & the success of winning her title. 3/10 THIRD MATCH- TRIPLE H VS. Big SHOW is really good this match, really. The whole match focuses on the injured arm of the HHH Big Show but the Big Show still fights back. BHH 5/10 Fort Match - Shelton Benjamin W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {It's a bonus match.} Not that bad, it's alright. After Vissera Down referee, Benjamin's Mama had a purse [in which the bricks had] and three times slipped Vicerah on the head. Benjamin was trapped with a spinning heel kick for winning against the big man. <br /> <br /> In the fifth match, Jury King 'Lawyer will. Gregory Helms Boring, Slow & Sloppy. Both did not really make a good effort. Jerry Larlar achieved success after a pistol drop for victory. <br /> <br /> Sixth match -Tory Wilson VS. Victoria VS. Ashley VS. MARIA VS. Kindlez Michele in the first women's gown match, which is very entertaining for me. Finally, Candice removes Ashley to win the first women's Gauntlet match. 5/10 SEVENTH MATCH- JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. Shawn Michaels VS. Kane VS. The KURT ANGLE W / DAVIARI is a cool removal room competition for an Elimination Champ for WWE Championship. But last year's elimination chamber was not the best. The Last Three Masters, Cena & Carlito. Carlito was back on Masters and took a roll-up on him to remove him. Seconds Cena will make a roll-up in Carlito for three counters to win the Elimination Chamber and retain his WWE title. But his night is not yet. After the match 7/10, Vince McMahon came out and congratulated Cena for victory. Vince McMahon has said that he is still out of the night, saying he has edged his money in the bank to challenge Cena for the title. <br /> EIGHT MATCH-JOHN CENA VS. The Edge w / LITA {for the WWE Championship opener in the Chamber match} is pounded directly by the edge, the Edge then goes for a spinner nails, cover & breaks his shock cena. Edge slowly beat another spinner & cena and won his first WWE Championship in his career, surpassing three surprising figures. 1/10 Last year's New Years Revolution was much better than this year, but it's still fine. The EC match is also good and the surprise of Edge Cushing for his MITB prospect is certainly the most shocking of the PPV show. <br /> <br /> In total: I am 7/10 & c
