Suppose that did not like the fact that the first thing that won me the title is that the rock is very sore. I think Regal will have to get his European title back, Jeff Hardy is a bad farewell. Rob Van Dam won Intercontinental title Broke long ago. I'm happy with the storm and the Christian tag champs, the booker T and Big Show match is my opinion.
