"Inspirational" stories about "the victory of the human soul" are usually big turns. Honor Men is a very surprising thing about how much I enjoyed though. This movie is imaginative and cliche, but it works. Through two bargains, it goes to very happy shows. This is a good role for Cuba Gooding, Jr. We expect a lot from De Niro, and he is not disappointed. He creates a dark funny picture. Director George Tillman, Jr. came up with a winner to make an old-style film.
