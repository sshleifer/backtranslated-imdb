The film is a journey in the mind of a screenwriter who filmed in his own contradictory philosophy. 'Who am I?' And 'what am I?' He is examining the frightening question of being. This is an audacious and thought-provoking company. Beautiful pictures, drawing-inspired, eschar-like paradoxes are hand-drawn, or rather, removing them. Furthermore, we follow the author of his agony to say what we say and do, and we see him phone with his wife who went for Peru, leaving him to care for his baby, he works less and less, so he sees a kid so he gets his confusion. His wife returns to the scene, destroys his notes and helps him to eventually move back until he gets rid of him. This story is primarily philosophical, which is attractive to the eye and I emerged with devastating images. It's about the sides of the Maya, the world of illusion. But the paradox of the film, it should stand up and think that it should be a lot of talking and thinking. The provocative beauty and fast philosophy made me a long time for more than two hours of silence or short film. If the maker's intention, he was successful.
