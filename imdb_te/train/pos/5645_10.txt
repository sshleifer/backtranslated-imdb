I bought a DVD set on Amazon.com based on my other interests. They press the nail on the head with this. I remember watching the show when I was on TV, but it did not happen. Ten years later, it's like looking at the first time again. Lucas Black, such as the Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck, are great together, though some rivals. Almost good (Caleb) and evil (Sheriff Lukas Buck) are represented. I do not really understand Lukas really, but let's say it's right, I believe that I have something special to say that he has special powers. He can ring phones, write it, or cause a person's emotions to change. There are few episodes where nothing less, he's all but he really becomes a good person. In all, it is a wonderful series that I can think of as the way others (I.E Point is pleasant, threshold, nowhere man, and just a few name just sequest DSV), like most others. Steven King's The Dead Zone (Sunday USA Network) looks like this genre. Nothing to see in TV anymore. The reason for this is that it is dangerous to deal with Christianity and Satan and should be immediately removed from the TV. So, at this time, I bought DVD sets and still have to watch TV but by watching the shows so the TV shows off by the religious zealots "quality" family guy and a bad bunch called American Dad and The Simpsons).
