It's about Mizzie. I loved her. And did she look amazing? I love the popcorn movies on Sunday afternoon of this life. This is one of those installments that they always go to business at the most annoying times. Richard's character is completely creepy. I've been dating guys like that. Well, that's not entirely like lol. I wish Jack did not kill me. He's a cutie and eyes are very simple. I love stories of this unknown type. It always ensures me to get up and my doors are locked. My husband does not generally like this kind of movies but actually enjoyed the fact that I sat through the whole thing with me. I can not wait to see what Mizzi will do next!
