I used to see this program when I was a little girl. Even though I do not remember much about it, it should be a beautiful show. Also, I do not think I've seen every episode. However, if you ask me it is still a good show. I remember the obscure theme song. Everyone is an ideal cast, the costume design is great. Exhibitions are the highest level. I hope that some networks will bring one day to this day so that I can see every episode. Before I close it, I always remember this presentation in my memory, and I saw each episode. Now, in the end, when and when this program is always brought into the air, I hope you will catch one day before being broadcast for the better.
