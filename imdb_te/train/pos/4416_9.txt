Harvey Keitel's best performance is the new century so far. Very beautiful, Castro is a beautiful snap-shot in front of Cuba. The story revolves around the nephew of a local minor criminal who promotes friendship with an American with Hollywood connections. It is really about the moment which awakens the fact that a boy knows he lives in a bigger, more complex world he does not actually understand. The script is strong and full of humor, direction is crisp. For all, a professional job suited to the Latin American cinema tradition. A weakness is the decision to shoot sync-sound in English rather than Spanish - perhaps to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately, this film makes a little less convincing. If you can see beyond this, you will find a heartfelt trip to another world. Recommended.
