I have such a rubbish hit cable movie channels. <br /> <br /> The father of two sons listens to messages from "God" to kill those who are said to be "the devil". <br /> <br / Opening credits As the director of the cast as a film, it often warns about a bad image; <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film that is unnecessary or unnecessary sub-plot, and the script is the first class. <br /> <br /> All actors have been given fully disclosed performances, especially the mainstream child actor. <br /> <br /> The film 'Silence of the Lambs' is as good as the favorite.
