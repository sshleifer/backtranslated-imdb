This film is lovely. An accountant approval wants more from life than conventional success. It works well, and it is very different from the standard dance movie, not really about being "great", it's just a way to find someone's self-expression. At the end of the big victory is not a winner of a competition, but not the whole new lifestyle, but the pleasure of doing the likes of you to fill the other parts of your life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The background of Japan makes the subtle repression and "mysterious life" as both dancing and personal dance. We can see ourselves in all of us.
