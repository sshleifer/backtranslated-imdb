The film begins with his performance as a magician with Vincent Price. However, in the middle of a very successful event, the police came and shut him down. The owner of his home has created a home-made tricks in his own time. Consequently, the price will kill the bad man correctly. The reader understood why he understood why Pryce was killed and probably because this price was a bit mad, he simply could not stop (like eating potato chips). <br /> The film is filled with creative and amazing magic tricks (including cemetery for large circular shields and performances), great stories, as well as exciting action. One thing that you can not tell about this film is disappointing. <br /> While it is very sensitive, it is fun throughout, but it is very valuable. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the Vincent Price version of the House of Wax? And it did a 8 or 9. MAD MADIANIAN is a wonderful movie, but it is reminiscent of the movie (which is the house of WAX). The formula was reused in the follow-up to the bottom line as the HOUSE OF WAX was successful. Both were made in 3-D, Price had a plot with each justification for killing two places, but he was committed to the first time and was very entertaining to see. There are big differences, and there are some, House of Works is in color and horror film is more and MAD MADIANIAN is definitely a mystery <br /> <br /> My advice to watch this movie and the HOUSE OF WAX (price version only). They are two fantastic two horror films.
