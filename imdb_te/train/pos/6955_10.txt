My Super Ex-girlfriend is a hell of a roller coaster ride. Special effects are excellent and the clothes are Uma Thurman Wear Habba Baba. Uma Thurman is an inspiring comedian, but she proved everyone's fault and her role as a lunatic girlfriend. She's just simplistic !!! Luke Wilson is also an average joke, but he is brave to work with great actresses of all time. <br /> <br /> Ivan Ritman is very good at directing this film. Because this film is not directed. And Uma Thurman did not do well with this film. This film is the cast (Uma Thurman), which is the director, which is 10/10 from the screenplay and its original plot line. This film is highly recommended.
