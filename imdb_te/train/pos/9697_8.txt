It's really heart-warming family film. It's definitely fantastic animal training and "acting" (if you can call it like that) same as well (just in "Grinch stole Christmas" ... it's a simple bad training). The poly story is very well done, well reproduced and the characters are really elaborated. <br /> <br /> My ratings: Story 8.5 / 10, Acting 7.5 / 10, Animals + FX 8.5 / 10, Cinematography 8/10. <br /> <br> My overall rating: 8/10 - BIG FAMILY MOVIE AND MORE GREAT!
