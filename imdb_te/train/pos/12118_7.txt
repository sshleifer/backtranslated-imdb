When I saw that the film was only 80 minutes, I thought we were in trouble. Waiting Watches down the clock in an hour and a half down the clock W. Somerset Mum's novel seemed like a disaster. <br /> <br /> The film's half is not bad, and many people make this book echoing with its readers. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone who fits most of Philip Carey's role than wet noodle, for Lesley Howard complained that many film buffs were wet nude, and he was, but not sure how cree was. <br /> <br /> Howard drives him so much that you want him to move on and repeatedly hit his head in the end, and finally get him back and buy his spine. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ah, then Betty, Carrie was obsessed and denied his world around him. I do not know what Mildred Appeal's book on earth is, that movie is real to that detail. But as Davis has played, she has become the most fascinating character of her story, and she is the least dynamic person on screen at any time, if it is nasty and unfortunate. 20 years later Brando's "Stella !!" When shouting, Davis's performance was credited with changing the course of screen acting. That little-known Tennessee Williams play, and why it's not hard to watch. Davis's scary point is intense. She does not attempt to write any kind of sympathy from the audience, and she allows her to look ugly and most innocent. Carey was her performance when she was running late in the film to appear to be amazed by her dead or deadly disease (though she did not take much attention to the fact that she had an STD factor). In fact, the film was inserted before the production code came into effect. <br /> <br /> Yes, in most novels, and a lot of interesting pieces are left on the cutting floor. , And the story has really changed about Carey and Mildred and is not quite the other. I recognize that the interesting and most dismal part of the mum novel, but it is a part of the novel's title and I think the readers are now part of the drawing, so it's a wise decision for me. <br /> <br /> They chose the novel to adopt the method they adopted Part of the producers. <br /> Grade: B +
