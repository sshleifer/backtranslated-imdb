<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is the action of the Naio Shaw Brothers and the urban hatred of Ringo Lam. When looking at a movie, they think that the fighting scenes are just mediocre in nature, but it does not matter, which is the attitude and climate of magnet. This is a great movie two !! Always trying to be different from his contemporaries, Lam has given us traditional heroes (Fang Sai-Yu and Hung Shi-Quan) and put them in "Raiders of the Lost Ark Riders". However, these are not just lightweight comedies that you can see in Jet Lee's film. Instead these guys fight the death of brutal results. The movie is always good at any time and can die anymore. Too bad, they often do not like movies that they like.
