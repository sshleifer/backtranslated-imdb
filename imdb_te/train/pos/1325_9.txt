I saw the film at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and total 106 minutes totally curious. I like the documentaries, but often can be seen by dragging them for 25 minutes. <br /> <br /> The item of the film is Narama Khuri, a Jordanian woman, who found her book Forbidden Love, a fame published and published in 2001. Types of Muslim friends who murdered his family, who had a relationship with a Christian man. A few years later, some journalists began hitting the story, making it a fraudulent one. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this film, it is entirely explained, since she spent much time in the Norma company, because she tries to persuade us that her novel is more than fiction. <br /> <br /> <br /> Director Anna Bronowski has found a truly attractive woman to study, and she holds an endless interview with Qurrey for her truth. As always in life, the truth is not easy to find. Fearing for violent setbacks on the tasteless film of the painting of Norman's painting of Narva Panic for his life, the novel of Jordanian Muslims. She returns to Jordan and shows us the truth. Bronowski is not discouraged, and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us. <br /> <br /> The result is a fantastic form within the mind of a con artist. Obviously, there is little we can find and it is very difficult to follow, and finally we do not know whether we believe the Norman. She's rather an unjustly put-on woman trying to survive, or it's an amazing spinster. <br /> <br /> The film uses a lot of interview footage, as well as dramatisations to tell the tale of the story, and people like Norma exist: why we use these dramatisations to show us to the Bronice: we need a follower. Every day we go to the movie and let us believe what happened on the screen. It may only be a bit read out, which did not come to Q & A with Bryonovsky after the movie, but I took it away. <br /> <br /> This is a great Australian film, and must receive an international release, and if you ask me awards swag. The best film I have seen in AFF07 is definitely. <br /> If you get a chance, let's see.
