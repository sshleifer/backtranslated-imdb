Benefits of the film are astonishing combat scenes - an absolutely magnificent sword-tactic and martial arts show. True John Woo Master. The story will be a bit weekly though, but it never overshadows the high performance of the Across Marshall Art action. If you're in martial art films, you're going to love it!
