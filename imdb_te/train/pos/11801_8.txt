I've read some reviews of this TV movie, which says that the film is too long and it is fundamentally only sensational entertainment. I probably agree that the picture goes too long (2h30 was enough ...) but I do not think I should sensationalize the thing perfectly. Jim Jones's extensive electric tour and mental illness, mental illness and slow downs of drug abuse are not treated in a loyal manner. Jones's followers were also employed (Brenda Wacaro and Brad Dourrup's role in the matter), but also in the time of showing how to show, but notice an exceptional change in Jones's reality. It is mind-boggling to see a degenerate, ruthless and ruthless dictator to see a charismatic, left and gracious preacher. Perhaps the film does not adequately explore Jones's inspiration, which at times can produce a bit of a bit (even if censored) can produce the whole product, but the mesmerizing performance of Powers Bet is fulfilled. I'm not very familiar with Real Jim Jones's life, but the beauty is definitely a monster, he plays a believable and true role. Jones's speeches include Jones's Father Father Divine (Reward James Earl Jones), Congress Leo Ryan (Ned Beatty) Guyana Camp and of course suicide scenes. It's too dark to see and Bethee is the most commanding of those last moments. Suddenly one of the skeptical followers Madzi Sinclair shines in the scene, and Veronica Cartwright (as Jones's wife) and Brad Dourrup, especially when their time comes to drink a murderous drink. At the end of the scene, the relative calmness, tasteful direction and the natural beauty of the natural surroundings make it impossible for all images to be separated from each other's mind. Disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses. Looking only to be one of the really horrific events of the 20th century. It will not repeat again. As Jim Jones's inscription on the campus, "it is committed to repeat those who have not previously known.
