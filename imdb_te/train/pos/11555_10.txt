<br /> <br /> What can I say ... an amazing picture I can see. One of the top ten comedies made sure. <br /> <br /> The great script of a great cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Mottau Neil Simon, was based on his play. If you have a digital cable, it gets the menu at the bottom of the screen to give what's there. It usually gives this image ***% stars but in reality it deserves **** stars. If you're really looking at this movie, it's been funny and fresh for over a hundred years now.
