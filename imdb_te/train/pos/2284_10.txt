This is very cool, and for the most part, well thought drama. I was very impressed with the film, not for the plot and the spectacular acting, but such a single film was taken. Many movies involving spy or war are filled with a soft spoken Brit or powerful war, but it is not. It is not about this kind of war, nor is it a war between man and his life, an American spy in Germany, who will not be a supporter of a nasty. After the end of the war, Campbell feels he will come home as a leader, but his true bravery must be secretive to the public. Returning to the United States, Campbell meets Nazi supporters and Nazi Haters, provides internally and openly interesting controversy. Nolte more than pulls the character, and it fits well enough for asking.
