Carla is her secretary, she is deaf without hearing. When she is overloaded in her work, she can appoint Paul for her help. Paul is in jail, and his past is not entirely behind him. To say a lot about the story that has a lot of turns, it is wrong. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this film is that when Carla is able to hear it - a sort of "listen point" (like a point of view). The opening scenes that started with the development of cars and Paul's early character were much more interesting than later turns and turns, some of which could be difficult to bid for loyalty and / or loyalty. There is some unpleasant violence. With good perspective, cinematography is good. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing, but probably not hunt. 4/28/2002 at the San Francisco International Film Festival.
