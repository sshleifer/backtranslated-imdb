In 2006, AMPAS offered one of the most creative innovative documentaries that filmed wildlife in the coldest places on Earth, the Academy Award Winning Actor Morgan Freeman commented on March of the Penguins. <br /> <br /> Walt Disney Studios is now a monopoly on animated circuit for decades. They removed their straws in live action film making and it was all hit and missed. Disney then created a subdivision called Disneyity, and released its first film titled Earth. This is one of the most touching and informative documentaries I've seen in most of the time. <br /> <br /> The great James Earl Jones said that the earth does not offer anyone who has seen the Discovery Channel over the past five years or is closer to the global warming crisis. It touches the ground very deeply and embraces a very liberal approach. <br /> It gives me an emotional connection to the nature I had previously experienced. It also shows not only the beauty and mystifying parts of our beautiful planet, but it's often grunt and disturbing elements. It is one thing to see a "muafasa" fall from a slave, or a hunter in the middle of Bambi's mother's woods. At the end of the film, it's good that this is a movie. It is the penguins, polar bears, elephants, from all kinds of families, from all walks of life, living in and living in their natural habitats. These real things make a real cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Although there is little weight on the graphic nature of the film (most do not agree), the land is a touching experience. The great camera team and George Fenton have been working on amazing cinematography by stunning spectacular score. Compared to the penguins or the Grizzly Man's shadow, this does not really have any measurement but it's great on its own. At the end of the day, we'll witness in the movie because you never get to visit these images too many of our planet's appreciation and sadness grow a bit. We live here, it's never a reason for us to explore a planet or another. The earth is beautiful. <br /> <br /> ***
