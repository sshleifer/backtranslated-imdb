I have seen this baby many times 15 years ago, now I find it again, and some others like cinema experience. If it is dangerous, a great presentation of morality and life lessons recommended for family viewing with young children. Although it is still an adult, I have learned many times many years ago. Trying to find it today is enough. . . But I believe that I do not care about my age. Anime fans will find this great entry especially in the filmmaking of Masami Hata. With impressive artwork and distinctive designs, "Chirin No Suzu" refers to a valuable experience. Some of the songs recorded in English are not very hot, although the musical score is attractive. But the voice acting is even better than the release today. Unfortunately RCA left home from the Columbia home video in the mid 1980s and did not release any new format to my knowledge at least in the US. Look hard for it and you are very satisfied! It's artistic, intense, enjoyable and important landmark in Japanese animation.
