Along with "King of the Rocket Men", it still repeats on BBC TV in the mid-eight. <br /> If I'm loading a time capsule for this period, this series will definitely enter. <br /> <br /> Anyone looking for it for the first time thinks it's crazy but it is "serials". Dan del Oro (I call him Mr Dustbin's head) and funny after he was shot, saying that he "can not hurt your bullets" and turns out to be less than happy. I also like to deal with Sebastian in the first episode of the episode. <br /> I've seen it again because I have good memories from years to come, some good adventures and good music, you can expect water, rockfalls, runaway karts ... with the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner) When the story is remembered, the story is not nearly as good, and it will have an inevitable "past" episode! This comes from 10 to 8 because it is slowly suffering from pace, padding and other tricks. If you're interested in these serials, I would recommend the book Whitney Whitney, "A Door Into Fight, Out A Door in a Chess", although there is a small entry on this series.
