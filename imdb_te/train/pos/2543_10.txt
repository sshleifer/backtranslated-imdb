Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi have made several films together, but on the whole (curiously enough) Karlov is usually a good man. In the true exceptions, "Black Cat" (1934), Karlofe plays the evil head of a ghost tradition, and Lugosi wants to take revenge on him for destroying his life. But more common is "Black Friday", where (what he meant) carolof attempted to improve brain surgery, while Luçosi was a murderer. Lugosi is a brutal physician in "The Raven", Carlofe finally blacklocks Carlof to help his evil plans. Sometimes they are two negative characters. In "The Body Snatch", Carlofe kills lugosi, but Lugoshi is trying to intimidate him. <br /> They are exceptions to each other. In other films I mentioned, the audience's acceptance is rare. It's Carlof's Dr. Jonas Rück is a hard-organized scientific genius who calls his "official scientific community" for his theory, centuries ago in a rare asteroid in Nigeria. Another scientist, Dr. Felix Bennett (Lugoshi), the French young man, Ryan's younger wife, Dian, earned the support of a good financial tour led by Sir Francis Stevens and his wife, Lady Abelella Stevens (Walter Kingsford and Baleh Bondi). <Br / > Before they left, his mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) warned him that he wanted his knowledge. He is not and it ends in the tragedy. <br /> He tries to remove it, but he says, his scientific place, and he feels he does not get his credit. He finds substance, but it is infected with remarkable radiation. He finds that he is slowly burning, if he touches the dying people or animals. He really built a friendship or understanding with Benet, he figures out a kind of radioactive fighting cocktail for the mug in order to counter the accident. But two things are unparalleled here. The antidote will only last for a while and be replaced. And Radiation Rukh has influenced the brain. He was jealous of Diane's friendship with Ronald Diane's friendship (unfortunately by Sir Francis and Lady Abelba), and he was equally disappointed (the effects of radiation for acting to die) while others collected the spectacle of the miracles offered to "Radium X". <br /> <br /> Ruk is dead on the destruction of murders that soon destroy many lives. <br /> <br /> The film has expanded to some extent. Madame Curie died from cancer recently after she had been working with radium. In 1936 fully understood the risks of radiation, but had some idea about it. Duk can cause newspapers to talk about the "curse" on the wave of murders. With the idea of ​​a "cursed" invasion (in the continent of Africa) for the secret treasure that had been buried centuries ago, the name of the Englishman was not economics or geology (paging Howard Carter and Lord Cornova). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not want to be alone, During the Whitechapel Murders, Sir Charles Warren ordered a photo of the victims of the deaths of several dead victims to see Jack the Ripper's last movie retro, but only the idea of ​​retrieving the images of dead hooks, but the idea was not dead.Jules Verne founded his novel "The Brothers Kip" in 1899 And used the doctor here Bennett uses it as a science fiction story, he finds Ruck on the plate, but Benet accidentally falls to the plate. <br /> <br /> The film is good in many aspects, a change of carloff and lugosi is impartial towards each other There is a kind of tragedy that has been missing from their other images in this story, other performances, especially in Ms Kemble Cooper, In Daphald's "reminiscent of Basil Rathbone's frightening sister (Jane Murdstone), where her last action is the only way to bring this tragedy to the end, and she can say that she does not do more harm than her goal.
