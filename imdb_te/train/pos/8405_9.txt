I am proud that the DVD's 70 Second Crown International Drive-In sexbook contains a nunkat copy of this selection piece of comedy cheese. It's a really goofy and enjoyable improbable movie with a really breezy'n'easy 70's stir. It's a cool set of true love and friendship wheels and attempts to make an honest point about what's more important in life than a quick piece of tail. Lead Teen Goof's character Bobby Hamilton gets the opportunity to show girls, respect for his friends, and a local van-racing bully - obviously it's a blatant teen male fantasy pick. Hateful nature. Deborah White is a stunning charming piece of Gets love, Connie Lisa Marie is a beautiful blonde babe, and Befelk Neanderthal Stephan Oliver (60th biker film) and brilliantly hateful like Dugan Hicks. Gets's cranky carwash owner boss Andy is a pre-stardom Danny DeVito specifically as a lovably cantankerous ne'er-do-well slob who is wearing a very ugly loud Hawaiian shirts and suffers an intense gambling habit. I especially love the scene where the two thugs brutally beat Danny - having his hands on his back while another guy works over Danny's torso! And Sammy Johns' insidiously impressive fluke hit theme song will bounce around your skull for at least a week. In short, it's entertaining entertaining of Retro-70!
