In December 1989, when I was broadcasting Central TV, I was originally U.K. I've seen this movie. I still have a video tape, but wearing (many friends and family members have adopted it and have cooled it for so many years!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, coming home that night, holding the Christmas chassis, turning the lights up and looking at what is advertised as 'Christmas Ghost Story'. <br /> <br /> I just remember some of the scenes that I finally send out the hair on my neck. <br /> <br /> I have seen some comments for this film. Those people were scared like the stalk and slash ramel, which are Friday 13th and scary. This is a 'traditional' ghost story; No big budget action or special effects ... no catchy, no blood, no gratuitous pornographic scenes, chains or pistols etc ... so how refreshing !!!! It's the atmosphere. If you like chilling horror, well written, good acting and pure horror atmosphere, this is a picture for you. I like the original horror; Last night I saw the original Haunting and this was a wonderful movie. So again the atmosphere - so block in Woman. The ending of the movie is different from the book, but it's still pretty good. I recommend. Try it ... if you like traditional ghost stories ... SO ... turn off lights, turn the fire, lock the doors, hold the drink ... and have fun ...:)
