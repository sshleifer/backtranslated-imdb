Two sailors vacation - women's man Joseph Brady (Jean Kelly) and the innocent Clarence Dulittle (Frank Sinatra) are shy. They meet the beautiful Susan Abbott (Catherine Grayson) and fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculous (even for a 1940 music) and everything is so nice and thorough - annoying gets pretty quickly. This movie is too long. It's 140 minutes and so much for such a silly story. There are also some boring numbers by Jose Irubby and his orchestra. <br /> <br /> This is magical when Kelly is playing or singing songs of Sinatra or Grayson. None of the songs are particularly memorable but Sinatra has such beautiful voice that you do not care about. It all depicted in the rich Technicolor featuring the explanations MGM. Acting - Kelly was good (though he was looking to see him as a ladies man) and Sinatra was very good (though he even looked like he was a coward!). Grayson did not give anything to do but she was very pretty to see. A few shots she literally took my breath away! Here are plenty of highlights: Sinatra and Kelly's big dance and singing number; Singing any Sinatra; Grayson's two songs and just the famous animated sequence featuring Kelly Jerry dancing - an animated mouse! Tom makes a very funny kami. <br /> It's too long and the plot is not just emphasizing, but it is still valuable to hold. It was a huge success in its day.
