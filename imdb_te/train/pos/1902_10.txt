Start the song by sang Christopher Cross. The song "If you catch between the moon and the city of New York." It's a great theme and song which is even after all years, never gets tired of it. This is really a great song about New York City. However, the great Dudley Moore starred as a drunkard Millionaire who was engaged to Jill Iconberry's role in CBE. Jill later appeared on LA Law. However, he received his excellent British butler, Sir John Gielgood OM, who won an Academy Award for his performance as Best Supporting Actor. In this film, Arthur falls in love with the role of Liza Minnelly, who plays the role of her Oscar winner in Cazaret. No, Liza does not sing. She acted as a diner waitress. I love Gerardin Fitzgerald as Bach Merriarch of the family who decides the family's fortune. Nevertheless, she was excellent and won the Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress. Bernie Martin bestly plays Liza's father on Jerry's father Seinfeld. He is great too. The film was well written, starred and wanted more to the audience.
