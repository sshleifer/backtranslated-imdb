I have seen these theaters and will worship it thoroughly. Geoffrey Rush gave the best performance as a super villain, which I have never seen from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. Kyle Mitchell and Paul Rubens have a matchmaker in heaven. This film is made for me by William H. Mike was introduced to him, who is currently one of my favorite actors. Hank was great as Blue Blue, and I especially liked that the character was not really British. With the scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought my eyes tears. I liked the fact that the bowler spoke to the ball. The fact that Stiller and his character were mistreated by Mr. Furious, and that his threats and one-liners are all unpleasant, and they are not in any sense. He said, "I can not stop myself from being praised," says Fragkator, Frikken-Pus, ". But one of the things I enjoy is Captain Amazing who actually died. I will recommend this film anytime, and I will give my personal personal two-thumbs.
