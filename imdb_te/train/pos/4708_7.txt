Yes, Keaton enjoyed the film. With a skip at his stage of his personalized pin-stripe suits, he'll remind you of Jimmy Cognni's! Johnny (Keaton) is a young hood who can pay for her mother's high-cost medical bills and send her brother (Griffin Dunne) to the law school. No one even knew Johnny Kelly's movie Johnny Dangerously until later. Joe Piscopo Vermin & Johnny did not like a bit (& I do not like vermine). Johnny is a nice singing / dance routine by Melle Henr. I love the part when they're in a car that's constantly changing! Skipper from Gilligan Island "Police Calling All Police"! Watch this for the 1930s gangster laughs! The gags in this movie are gorgeous but you have to catch them or you will miss them! See every scene in the background.
