I was very surprised about this film. <br /> <br /> It's never a picture of anita, like you never ever been in the film. <br /> <br /> This is a very positive message for anybody watching this movie. If you are adequately detected, you can do anything. In Keira Knightley's best films, and I thought she was a brilliant actress and this character was wonderful. Parminder Nagra is also very good. Sadly, I can not say for Jonathan Rice-Mayors because he is a good actor and does not want to be honest, his eyes are a little terrible. <br /> All in all, a fantastic picture, and a fantastic story
