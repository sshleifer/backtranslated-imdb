I can not agree with comments. The first time I saw it on the UK TV channel, it was an indie film and I think it's a different thing if you take a movie in this sense. I could not believe what I had seen and immediately hooked. The plot may be as bad as a JS show (which means no plot), but acting is bad, it's so happy and it's all awesome bad movie. <br /> <br /> It tells a lot about America rather than Bully or Ken Park, but it gives a glimpse into America's community and any day afternoon TV viewers in America. <br /> <br /> 100% fun! <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
