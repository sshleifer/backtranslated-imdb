Critics are mute. This movie is funny and smart. I loved this movie. Why does everybody hate this movie? I love that people do not like this movie. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and they put through the work to make this film. I will make movies with you. So people should see it and do not comment. I like this movie. It's OK by all means. There are some parts, but at least they are made. Jerry Stiller likes this love because the film stars as King's Queen's Show. But better than that. I can not believe it is rated very low.
