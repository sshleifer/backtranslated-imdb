My all-time favorite movie! I have seen many movies, but this one will hit them all! Excelent acting, amazing story. As you start to love a "normal" caring guy Jorge. He is an actor, he is himself and very handsome person. And maby is the most important thing: you will learn to look different and different from people with Down Syndrome.
