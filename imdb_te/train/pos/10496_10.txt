Great actors, an Oscar nominee actress, an amazing scene, a good line story line and you're laughing to fit in my new handbag (and still very large). This image is good. It has acted pretty serious scenes and has funny moments. Well, side division. I had a lot of fun with the movie audience, and my cheeks were tears in tears at the 'ladies' lady in the tea shop. The magic material for the British film industry and Craig Ferguson is one of my favorite movies this year, not sure at all times.
