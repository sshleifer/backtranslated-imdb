The film has a powerful philosophical conclusion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the late 1960s, youthful alienation from the youth and youth perspective is a clear plot of "jubrisky point". "Mark Freakt or Daria Halpin does not have much acting experience and actually improves the message of the film. <br /> <br /> The two players have a real sense of unenformed actors as mentally distracted from the crisis around them. This is not a script-based movie, but it is a great deal with amazing cinematography, except for the first ten minutes <br /> <br /> All the beautiful landscapes with the emotional neglect of Mark and Daria are in the other world, and the whole world. <br /> <br /> With the more sound of the Doors I forced Pink Floyd to force music. <Br> /> <br /> However, I like the film, it's different, it's artistic and imaginative. <br /> <br /> Over the years, "Jabrisky Ayint "appears to be more attractive. It tells the sentiment in the United States in the late 1960s. It was sort of a bohemian, artistic is awesome. And in the last eight minutes of the film are mesmerizing Philosophically.
