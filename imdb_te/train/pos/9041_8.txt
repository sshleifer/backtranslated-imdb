In fact, the story of a teenager named Homer Hickham (Jake Gyllenhall) is growing in a coal town in West Virginia, where a boy's general destination "ends up in mines." But his eye for Homer sky and flying rockets, his mine-foreman father's worry, and generally the shock of towns. Absolutely wrong, he and three of his equally expelled buddies were making three rackets, who fled from the barrage land eight miles in town and were not frightened by the fake racquets many times in their community. Unfortunately, most towns and especially Homer's father (Chris Cooper) feel that they are wasting their time. However, people will be amazed and the spirals will begin to see their rockets send their home missiles shortly. Only a teacher in the high school (Laura Dern) understands their endeavors and knows that college scholarships can be rewarded as prizes in the National Science Fair. Now the gang must learn the perfection of their craft and they must overcome many difficulties facing them to shoot the stars. Director Joe Johnston has always been known for his films, Zune & Jurassic Park 3 & "October Sky" is definitely more than any of his other films. Without any doubts, "October Sky" is his best effort & apparently his best film. It is not only a true story shot, but as a feature film, it has every single thing, which requires a high level film. And there are some exclusive performances in addition to Johnston's extra-ordinary direction. Jake Gyllenhall released the movie for 19 years and he performed a beautiful and natural appearance. He is a perfect actor. Chris Cooper as his father also gives a very good performance. The same goes for Laura Dern & even she is beautiful. The rest of the shows are well. Background score is fine. A highly inspiring movie in the film that increases your spirit. One of the movies that definitely inspires all of your movies. Exciting exciting movie with amusing loads. Tappipokudadu.
