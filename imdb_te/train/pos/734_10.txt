To make this film start from the beginning, punk rack is fun. The last punk of the 70s is the Rock Ramones and the Kings themselves. BG Richie Randell, who lives in Souls Rock, N Roll, is a rebellious high school girl. Riff Ramones, writing songs for her favorite rock band <br /> Meanwhile, the school to attend the riff, rented a brand-new principle, Mrs. Togar. She is a long, threatening Amazon of a woman. And she pledges to make students 'toe-line'. A couple of her pupils also act as monitors and report her with dirt on their companions. Ms. Togor is determined to be particularly naff riff, and protruding Rip's anarchist sneak peeks. <br /> There are good ways to defeat Togo at every turn. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Mary Voronov's amazing performances, in the role of Principal Togar. Mary is a popular B-movie actress. In this film, she plays the role of Fascist Mrs. Togar. PJ as riff Souls, turns into an electroly appearance. Clint Howard duplicis as Eagbauer, with his character being very fun. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ramons make a lot of their hit songs. Thus the viewer sees how much Ramon's effectiveness in the 70-year-old Punk Rock scene. Certainly, this is a good image for Ramones fans. But if you're not rocks, or rock punk, this film is an incredible explosion (literally) with powerful fun.
