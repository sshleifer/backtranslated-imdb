The most famous films of the French sexual empowerment of the seventies featured in the most sarcastic roles played by Garard D'Pardyu and Patrick Devere. <br /> <br /> It is one of many dark psychological dramas of the seventies / eighties such as "Serie Noor", "Buffy Fried" and "Beau Pare". <br /> <br /> However, I would like to correct the previous comment posted on this image: The title translated in English is far from the French version. This is where the prophets go "two places", but in French the title is literally translated by "waltz dancers", a metaphor for the movement of testes.
