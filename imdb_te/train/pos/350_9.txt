I want to see Valentine because I have played some of my favorite movies by Denis Richards and Marley Shelton. I saw Valentin, and I was surprised at how great the story was. It kills me to see this is a low rating because it's not terrible. The brilliant parts of actors and actresses are so clever and cunning that the ending and ending way. Some of the scenes are slightly unreliable and poor and in some small parts I got a little boring, but overall it's fun and exciting. It has a mind-twisting story line that you've been guessing the whole way and does not deserve all the rubbish it gets. I recommend this movie to watch anytime, but especially on Valentine's Day, I'm sure you want to give a ton of cold. Oh, and do not even pay attention to the Trailer OR rating, please, do not ...
