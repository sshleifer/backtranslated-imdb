John Waters was astonishingly, I saw what I saw (perhaps better fast food fast food woman). The director's vision is incomplete ... The narrative is strange, the characters are the family's personal and odd reflections family and his own Internal life ... the tone is always forced or stylist Were not-tilt. <br /> <br /> There is no adorable shot design, no, or magazine grading .... Blondton as Martha's sister is amazing .. Eddie Ferlong is inspired casting. The most important thing that we value is the family ... and the uninterrupted life - the spoken matrix, tea-bogging, recycled clothing, grandmother with the grandmother of yesterday's art - and the lesson of the film.
