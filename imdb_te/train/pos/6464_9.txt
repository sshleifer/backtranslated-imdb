Wow I loved this movie! It's a simple life in a small village. About deceit and honesty, love and surrender. Great! This is about the things that everyone has encountered in life. You have to do things wisely. But some do not appreciate your hobby and you try to stop it. Others are thinking of 'what neighbors' than to find others' opinion and to follow their heart. Anyone's opinion does not let you stop from the fulfillment of your dreams and passion. Actually I was really impressed that the actors are really ordinary people, not my family. No big beauties, but all the people in love with you in the movie.
