This documentary was broadcast on both the RTE and the BBC in the past months. <br /> <br /> Initially the documentary was intended to explain the political life of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez. The Irish team formed with such intentions. What will they do when Venezuela comes to the first attempt to defeat Chavez and his government's rebel groups (specifically Venezuela's oil concerns)? <br /> A witness to the audience, how the media affects the situation, and dismisses Chavez, which increases rebel events. <br /> <br /> It's a really exciting documentary, <br /> <br /> Both of them work in pairs with inexperienced filmmakers. <br /> <br />
