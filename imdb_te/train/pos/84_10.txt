I've used this religion. The golden fish is happy in a bowl on top of it. A young boy and his mother are away from home. The boy was given money to buy milk. As he goes home, he stops at Carnival to play a game. He is a little scary guy in a black suit beside him. The boy is falling milk bottle. It breaks down. The person in black suit will replace him with milk. This scene changes what's going on at home. A black cat enters the apartment and enters the apartment. He finds the fish bowl and sees it. The fish is energized and rotates from the bowl. Now, a group of young people in my classroom and I fell in love with the fish. The cat takes up fish in his mouth and we all have our breath. The cat fishes into the bowl. The double story line contains black and suspicious black cat suspicious man. Both stimulate a sense of partisanship. Both are innocent. This is a great discussion forum in my class.
