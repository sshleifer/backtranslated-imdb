The last episode of Star Trek's third season is the outstanding and most unfortunate last season's highlight. Spock, McCoy and Kirk beam down to the sapidon to make the planet's population completely missed, except in the presence of the main library and Mr. Atos, librarians. All 3 Trek characters will soon be accidentally driven into a time traveling machine in the past several years of Serpentine. Kirk is giving a trustworthy performance in an ice age valkon love while repeating his happy experience on time travel - he has been accused of magic and fleeing before fleeing, and when the 'Everg Edge of Forever' was found, Sarpidon was found to have the door. In the end, all 3 Trek characters will save Suratdin Beta Neo Star Star for only a few minutes to reach the Sun. <br /> <br /> Ironically, William Shutner noted that in his book "Star Trek Memories", Leonard Nimoy was not given any reason for the event, which is the source of some controversy. Lysette script for reasons why Spock behave in such an emotional way. Nimoy directly expressed his suspicions to the show's executive producer Fred Freiburger, saying that the Valkannes fell in love. (p.272) However, the Freiburger cause, the ice age set, allowed Spock to experience emotions, since the Valkens are still not completely logical today. This is a great example of improving the part of Freiburger to save the script that is above average for this particular episode. In the "Godo's Steppendran" in "Godway Tuden", it is clear that in the third season, the decline in script quality is bad, playing music with hippes or sometimes emotion and scripting. Here's more believable. Spike's performance here is fantastic and freerger agrees to Shutner. (p.272) Since Spock and McCoy travel back in a two-year period, McCoy is not just a spock, but a return to a more ancient human race. But it is wrong to take into consideration the performance of many other Season 3 shows, excellent Spock / McCoy performance and poor quality of this script. Who would assume that the current residents of the Serpentine escape from the fate of their destructive planet in their predecessor? It really came to expect from the 'classic trek' - the real inspired story. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The "best of" Season 3's "Outstanding" and exceptional quality performances like "Entertainment Incident", "Day of the Dove" Shatner, Truth A Beauty, Thianian Webb, and Children Sheed Lead and Paradise Syndrome. (p.273) My Personal Opinion and Children 'Shield Lead' is a very poor episode 'Truth No Beauty in It Truth No Beauty' is troublesome, "Our Yours" is definitely the Top Season Three Stars list Trek TOS films. I give 10 to 9 for 'all theverter dents'.
