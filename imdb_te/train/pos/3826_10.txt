I really have the ability to capture real life (silently fantastically really) because I really love Korean movies. I see Korean movies for that reason alone. These directors saw other movies before me. <br /> <br /> If the title of the non-Christian perspective, Chang-Dong Lee is the modern Protestant Church (regardless of any kind) Acquired the impartial and almost real character of acne and all. . I've always waited for a Christian film that really depicts the dark recesses of church life. Because Christian movies speak in their language, they want to share their faith. Despite having good intentions, most films with religious experiences are followed by the echo of Disney movie or School Special. They have to show life. The real people come from the curse, the real people lust, the real people. And Christians believe that salvation is available to those who desire it, and we are still challenging everyday life in this life. And the duo-Yuvan Zion role is entirely seen as God's sincere and most cruel character, but due to the bitter realities of life, she once lost her love. She did not refuse God. <br /> <br /> "If God's love, why does he allow such terrible things to happen?" This movie is not the right answer. <br /> <br /> The last 10 minutes of the film opened to interpretation, leaving a hopeful future for our main character, and "secret sunshine" brings the idea of ​​a full circle. Secondly, the film has attempted to be religious or attempted to make any effort and it is out. There is no reason why it should work more. It's true, it's honest. That is why it is the best summary of the true Christian life I have seen in the film.
