I have to confess my doubts about this film before I watch. The main reason is that it is compared to the Hitchcock film. I've seen many of the hitchcock inspirations, or it could be done by 'Master of Suspense', but so far I have not seen anything in this film. Time. In my opinion Hitchcock has become a home name that can be used to promote some (cheap) breathtaking very easily, but on the other hand I have to admit I was stunned because I was the European film. Normally this is their Hollywood studios, who want to misuse Hitchcock's name if they increase their revenue. But this film was made in one of the most Chinese European countries and I was killed by many French people who refused to let their films inspire the English writer. <br /> <br /> I decided to try this movie and I said I'm happy. <br /> <br /> "Call to Lives" or "Read Lips" is called in English. Carla is the story of a young secretary. She is a hard-working, loyal employee, but her colleagues have never been praised. She had a lot of sadness from a hearing deficit that criticized her to climb up the firm's hierarchical ladder. But when she is allowed to employ a traine that works for her, it changes everything. Paul Angeli is a 25-year-old and completely unskilled former prisoner. The man is a thief, but Carla gives him a chance and covers him when needed. <br /> <br /> "To illustrate a very good thriller - definitely this film - I can not make comparisons between Hitchcock and Jacques Audyard's directing. The man did a good job with this movie, I did not hear about him before, but he knows how to build a suspense and how interesting you are till the end. I suspect that in Hollywood instead of using a disabled woman in a powerful role instead of becoming a helpless victim of a misdemeanic husband (you know, simple-movie story). Vincent Cassell is very popular, but Emmanuel Devos is a complete secret to me. Paul is in prison and Carla is normally the hardest person of the helpless woman, but thanks to their performances, you have some bad luck in these two lives but they do not have anything to do with their characters, but they are both incredible and realistic. Prospective two strong people who will make the best <br /> <br /> All of this together is a very powerful script and an incredibly powerful image. Although my doubts about it, I soon became one of its great worshipers. I will give this film 8/10. Do not hesitate to give it an attempt.
