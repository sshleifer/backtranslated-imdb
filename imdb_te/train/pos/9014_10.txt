<br /> <br /> Before I saw this film, I do not know with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> She played the role of herself, well?), suffering from her. I'm totally scared of this beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Who thought that the last desires of a particular young woman and the sexual orientation of the needs of women could be tender and romantic? Well, as they do in this amazing picture, right performers will be presenting them in the right manner. I forgot to see how Miss Carter was filmed in the film. <br /> <br /> I think you are looking for someone in this movie. Enjoy it as I did. Thank you for giving me feedback.
