I was very fortunate to have seen an unexpected moment at a movie festival and I saw back the next night for the second of three shows. A funny, brutal and sharp-defeat attack on every aspect of mainstream entertainment is slowly swallowed by the lowest-common-rationalist journalists by a solitary-corrupt journalist who slowly gauged his guerrilla-battle over all of the film, and such unpredictability And refresh is executed, Redits restored after the roll after you leave, can still have the original pictures. Someone discourages any unfulfilled expectations to light up their imaginations (and I mean hunting) down to this less visible item. Fight Club and any Charlie Kaffman movie fans, and the need to look for anyone who escapes multiplexes like the bulk of the dogs.
