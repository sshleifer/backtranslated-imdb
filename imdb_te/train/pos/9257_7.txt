This navy transport is your regular women in love story? <br /> <br /> <br /> Maybe hell, you know how the formula works now, a pretty woman is familiar with a film, someone should fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> The film follows some distinct stories, but does not say anything about the content. Crisp Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Bassie have small sights, but are small. Certain things do not make sense that it is necessary to come for a random fight, but it is fun, and the fighting has actually taken place. <br /> This is certainly ridiculous, but it has a very good sense of it. Humor is well balanced, you will not harm your stomach, but you will keep a smile. <br /> <br /> There is quite a bit of continuous activities, not one of the children.
