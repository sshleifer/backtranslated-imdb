I painted this film on a long Island, and I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend are extraordinary in this movie. Clearly some party scenes are drinking all the beer there, (which is said to be white, boring and tasteful to swallow again, especially in the scene of the funnel). But no one ever heard about the film anytime we are going to release any film. It did not come out in the theaters (apparently) and I was sure that it was never released in the video and I was not released on DVD. Even though some people see it, it is very small. So something should be. I absolutely love to buy it for my brother, and I can not find anywhere. Does anyone know where / where / how to buy this movie? And what format will it be?
