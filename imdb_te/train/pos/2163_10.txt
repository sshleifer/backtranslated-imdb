I love this movie. This is a definite example of good surprises from the Asian cinema. Recently the Hollywood remake came with Richard Gere and just awful Jennifer Lopez. Do not worry two movies. Actually the Japanese film is touch, subtle and awesome. The Hollywood version is the exact opposite. When I first saw the trailer for the remade US Version, I was amazed and acted in it. This is a distinct Hollywood unnatural cross commercial announcement. The remake explains that the remake can never be improved by some foreign films. <br /> <br /> The American audience is reluctant to subtitle only because the original image is not widely viewed. <br /> <br /> The film is not primarily an American saying, because the Reserve is ultra social conservative in the film which has a role in the role of Japanese people. Certainly the main character wakes up for a more complete understanding of living life through dance, but half of the film's tension comes from stereotypes and ridiculous ballroom dancers in Japan. <br /> <br /> Trying to watch this movie is not a terrible full screen, <br /> <br /> Yes, the "original image" is very old, and I know this is only for Japanese people. Speaking of foreign films, I will make some quick recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding - I'm listening to this list for the first time, for the best possible film! 2.Jony Stencho-very funny Italian identity mistake! <br /> <br /> The Asian-flier & US style platform 4.Run is a shari-a Korean action movie that combines both the Run-a-German film and features a techno score. )
