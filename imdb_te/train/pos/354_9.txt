A group of friends from the primary school of model-calibrated San Francisco women are suddenly intimidated and attacked by the person who sends Valentine's Day cards. Who is the killer and why are they their next killer? <br /> <br /> My rating often changes in later scenes of an image - sometimes up a bit, sometimes a bit decreased. However, my rating would not remember another image where it dramatically changed as it's for Valentin. The first time I saw it in its theatrical release, I thought it was very awful - I gave it 10 to 4, equivalent to a "F" Letter grade. Looking at it for the second time last night, I can not remember what the heck does not like about it. I can only guess that I am really in the wrong mood I can see or I can not find it. Anyway, I loved this time, it was given from 10 to 9, or an "A". <br /> <br /> It may sound ridiculous that I can not find a similar image, but to get something. Valentine is almost comedy / horror. Director Jamie Blanks, who was also responsible for the Urban Legend of 1998, became very popular in the late 1990s with the scream (1996) and ran a lot of elements on top of a line, which Valentine's deliberately cheesy / irritating (almost absurdity is a positive stylized term). On top of that, he gives us the picture imbued with comic commentary on romantic relationships. Teen horror of comedy is unusual to have the same exaggerated comptity tone. In most cases of the film, and the villain, the comic or dysfunctional execution, is associated with the theme of Valentine's Day. <br /> <br /> Many viewers will remove the points from the movie for its cliche -white but unsustainable scenes and plot developments. However, as stated above, the film is intentionally distorted, unbearable and ridiculous. While hating Eros, Blocks is trying to overcome the typical teen slaser (and the more successful) by sneezing / spoofing the sessions of the genre. This is the charm of the horror film of Valentine's Day. It is rarely worn throughout the film and is the heart of the slasher style, making it the main animal for Valery's translucent lampooning. Scream has a similar target with its horror, but the film says "self-aware". Valentine's Day is not deliberately self-aware; Common sources depend on the viewer. Some people think I "read a lot" in the movie, "not wanting another slaser movie after the Urban Legend" and producer Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do that. <br /> <br /> Valentine's Day is very different from its emotional sources Audience may not like it, Tom Savage's novel by the same name. The novels' characters, arrangement and storyline are very different. Sellers said, "Although it's a good book, I do not think it's the right story for a movie". Therefore, instead of the novel, it is much dryer and more intense in the tone, as Valentine's Day Center is used as a launch pad to create variations for the horror / thriller story. This fact does not volunteer to those who know the books of the film, but helps to understand why this film is its distinctive plot and attitude. It's very good to see it as an independent organization with the same theme. <br /> <br /> Blocks directing is impeccable. Valentine's Day looks beautiful across complex, deep colors, interesting sets and good performances. Blocks are so admirable that the scenes of his villain and the attacks are too dark. He directs his actors with Ablom, often producing ridiculous performances. <br /> <br /> Even though Valentine's Day is not a masterpiece, this is a very good horror / thriller movie that looks intolerant. If you are expecting something more slapped in the tongue you can find it very appreciated.
