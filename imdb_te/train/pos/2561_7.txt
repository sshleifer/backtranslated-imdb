In December 1957, Saonara earned 8 Oscar nominations, earning 4 wins. Red Button won the Oscar Award for Best Supporting Actor in the role of Airman Joe Kelly, who fell in love with a Japanese woman in Kobe during the Korean War. The Oscar, nominated for Best Actor, played the role of Major Lloyd Grover, returning to Japan, Korea Korea Fly Ace, strongly backed by military support for marriages between American troops and Japanese, and his friend Joe Kelly is going to marry. Ironically, Marlon Brando's character soon recognized his own love for a Japanese woman. The film will highlight the advance and cultural differences of the film. It's good to see this film alone with these beautiful images and beautiful themes. Good picture, gimme and more ... gimmeclassics
