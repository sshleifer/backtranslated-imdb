<br /> <br /> I am one of the best political forces I have ever seen, with a spectacular performance for Kusak, Tommy, and all supporting actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Action scenes are well filmed and choreographed. Very funny. <br /> <br /> All of these give a big thumb to the film. This is the most critical of the US military intervention in the Middle East, as well as getting bad reviews from people who do not share the same political opinion or are politically ignorant to congratulate Dark and Drake's humor. In fact, the truth is that the border between fun and fun is close to that.
