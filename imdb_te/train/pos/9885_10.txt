Young Erendira and her tyrranical grandmother provide for a great fantasy from the new world. This interpretation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "La Inseabile Ya Tristi Historia Da La Candida Aurendera, ..." The Marquez Purists will not be able to take the right course. The story is intact and has full force of work. The film's strength is especially Papas' grandmother in its performance. Marcus fans and MÃ¡rquez enthusiasts enjoy this movie for Wit's true sandy brand.
