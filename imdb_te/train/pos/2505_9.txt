Most of the superstar in the film (Gauth, Hyde, and Wang Lee Han, a very famous singer in Japan) has ruled many fans of the film. But do not judge before I see you, I say. The movie is very serious when the film and crew are very serious, and they have worked hard. A touching story within it is a good picture. Many scenes are very fun and some are sad. They are so good until I can stop seeing again. <br /> <br /> The story is beautifully written but I admit that their work is very disappointing. This is especially for Hyde because his skill of acting is from another and it is unrealistic to hear when he speaks to other languages ​​except his native language (japan). <br /> <br /> This is their first time to act in this movie. This is very important. <br /> <br /> Gut wants to show us that someone may be weak when losing the most important person in their life. Tossi was killed and asked to turn him into a vampire, because she would not die, but when she died when Kai Shoot Son died, Shah said that I was still very strange about Hyde's skill but in that scene I had two Give guns! <br /> <br /> They are a good friend of the former mafia and show because they are the brother of Shaw's brother. <br /> I love this movie anyway ~ (too ^^). <br /> <br /> It is an action movie with a touching beautiful story.
