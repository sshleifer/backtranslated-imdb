The real dirty in the French cinema, this dismal work is not the same in contemporary production. Harlem's attempt to remain completely absorbed by Louis Malle's "Le Po Follet" (1963) His illusions, hero, a computer scientist, lost and lost hatred. There is no doubt. Out of the human race, he is a kind of enthusiologist and his colleagues. One of them draws his attention: Tissarand-Jose Garcia plays a very damaging role in the decades-. Later Tissireand is kind of a kind: his pessimism breaks on this poor man. The scene night - the club climaxs a strange relationship: the leader sees his victim ever being fulfilled in his life ... Now the film takes a little more time to talk about the most traditional turns (the misguided of Clozot). <br /> <br /> <br /> The strange thing beyond the form is voice voice over, one of the heroes who is always referred to as "our hero" for the hero, one for the above mentioned hero. The story now takes place in the city of Rooney, Guy de Moussaussat in Paris. <br /> <br /> This depressing movie fits only for audiences who get information. And he's just an expression of his disgust for people with his frustration, for a very small summary of X-rated films, but after seeing it, you're down in the dumps Feeling maybe.
