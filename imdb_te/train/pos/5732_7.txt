From September to September, I've been taking four to six films from Harold Washington Library, which has an impressive DVD collection. Recently, I was thrilled to find David Lynch's small pictures: (HWL is really a crafty library: at any time of its pictures three-thirds!). Yesterday, knowing little about the animated series, I chose Dumbbell. For David Lynch fans, I'm here to report that seeing eight episodes is half an hour long. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable feature of these shorts is their soundtracks. Each episode has its own rhythm. Breath and digestive systems provide percussion. Rare voices end of the slang pauses. Supports physical violence. Chipping birds and buzzing sockets are hanging on the edges. Many other things complete the orchestra. The trajectory of crude animation is often synchronized with sound, but the soundtrack hit me as Lynch's basic curiosity in creating and broadcasting this work. In this way, these eight shorts are unique ligurian rhythms. <br /> <br /> Those odd, ugly, deep, dumb and hell are fun. We have enough space for them to reflect how human beings are absurd. I can not say that I'll see the collection again, but to anyone who is surprised by the inner empire movements, Dumbland is your half hourly value.
