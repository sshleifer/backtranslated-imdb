This is an incredible picture in many ways. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. The animation shows that there are plenty of producers who create movies that are visually stunning and visually superb, such as anything coming from Disney studios. <br /> <br /> A distinction from the typical Disney fare does not include some wise-facing sidekick for the relief of this DreamWorks film comedy. And, there are no sudden moments of the characters being lost. Spirit's Birth: I'm sure a scene in the film will not appear in the Disney movie. But it's totally tasteless and not dangerous at all. "Spirit" is a great breath of fresh air. Do not make me wrong. I've loved Disney for years and will continue to do that. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of great animated fare. As soon as it turned out, my children wanted to see them again. I have the same feeling. I totally recommend it.
