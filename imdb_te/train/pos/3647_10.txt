I really like if they really do a sports story. In the past, many have been hooked by hockey. It's not. This is just the pure image, the old-style type of story - and Dennis Quaid is based on the guy in real life that exactly what he does in the film. A high school coach plays a role in a professional baseball ball, trying to be late in athletics-speaking life. <br /> In the end, he tried to reach the goal of Major Leagues, even though it was a very brief venue. <br /> <br /> All the characters present here are good people, you are from Quaid. <br /> <br /> Quidditch is confident in acting in the game Jim Morris, unlike players in the past, movies, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a man who fires 90-plus miles per hour. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is real, proven by a real-life mud in a documentary on DVD. <br /> If you're looking for a nice and inspiring real life sports film, you can not make it wrong.
