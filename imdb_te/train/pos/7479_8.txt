"Sweet never sour without sour." This quote is surely the theme of this movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a teenager who has delivered everything in his life. He takes things for granted and it comes around a full swing in this great movie with an amazing twist. <br /> <br /> When you go back to the film and see how you look at it and its picture of how you live. As long as you experience the bad (experience), you can not really appreciate the good things in love (good) and love. <br /> <br /> Complaint Only This movie is evolved at most points and is really difficult to understand. I think the end is perfect though. I'll see you and see for yourself.
