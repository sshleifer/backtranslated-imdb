The invisible man shows love to everyone! It reminds me of the old school's 80's series (a team, airwolf, knightrider) special effects small but very effective !! But in this series they have a lot of importance. It really shows! The whole cast looks exactly where the characters fit perfect and they can do whatever they want !! Especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Vendreca. Ventresca really shines this one! I'm a very sarcastic actor in his acting style and it does not get a shot in a big picture (MR Tarantino has to direct it! Instead of having a major boring tombstone (cc) you want it to be worth it!
