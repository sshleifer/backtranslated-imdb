My name is John Mooreby and my story about the paperhouse: In May 2003, Alfred Hitchcock's mood, I was very scared and deeply disturbed. I started a frantic search for a film that was shocking the same way. But no one is satisfied. The Blues Witch Project, The Ring, The Evil Dead, The Sixth Sense, 28 Days Later, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Dark, Alien, Peeping Tom, The Cell, Rosemary's Baby, Witchfinder General, Friday 13th And Omen. I want to make sure I'm disappointed! <br /> <br /> The paperhouse is based on a favorite book I own, called the Marian Dreams. Some books I found in horror films also came with paper, but they did not tell me about the relationship between the book and the pictures. <br /> When I was on the Internet, I found the truth, after that I bought the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought the paper book and dull belief were unbelievable. Unfaithful is not sure, but it is not stupid. This is the name of my prayers, but this is a very original story. One day in Anna's school she caught a house in her scrapbook (which was not significant), then she became ill and every time she was falling or falling asleep, she would find herself out of a creepy old house (and I'm not honest). She learns more every time Dreamworld and EG keeps fresh on the drawing that appears on an apple tree. Truthfulness attracts Drewworld as a sad boy named a man who truly is in the world of honesty. Marc wants to leave a slippery house, but Anna moves in a lighthouse (a place to go), but still does not matter. Anna decides to bring her father. She receives her pencil and gets a lot of work, but the result is ill and Anna does not particularly love her eyes. Quote "He looks mad". Anna tries to shove him and starts again, but proves that the pencil is insufficient (which means nothing). Then Anna loses his temper and crosses his father's eyes! <br /> <br /> So far, the view of the film is surprising and upsetting me. But I found what I was looking for after 2 years. How does the question compare with Psycho? Answer, 1 old dark house, 2 mental parent's fears, 3 a real shock, 4 and a very scary music.
