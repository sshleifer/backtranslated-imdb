Her husband (Christopher MacDonald) is a lovely romantic heroine about a woman who was killed shortly after she became pregnant (Cybill Shepard). Then we see the husband in heaven, telling him that he was taken very quickly and that his wife needed to know him. He is said to come back to Earth but not himself. Shepherd's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson), who is preparing to graduate from college and face a young man (Robert Downey Jr.), was born to her father in 19 years. The film is a little on the speculative side ... The story goes all the places you expect, but it's a powerful cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) fun to charmingly help you but you can not help. The shepherd is rarely seen for a better purpose, and she and Daniele's supporting roles are supported by talented character actors. The lovely and lovely fantasy that you enjoy and enchant.
