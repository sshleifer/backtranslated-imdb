This is the best Chinese film I've seen, and, in my opinion, is much better than the hero or chatting Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The film is a combination of several genres: it's a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. <br /> <br /> This film will surely reach my top 5, and every film lover should be happy. Action sequences are traditional dubious jumping and flying, but the way of the shot is very different from the hero's style and the flying is always nice and usually makes sense (ghosts can fly) <br /> Watch this movie, you will not regret it. 10/10
