On this film I had a free but new release from the blockbuster and I wanted to catch something quick, as the shop was ready to be in touch for the evening. The plain white cover and title made me interested. I (relatively speaking) "old" lady and my son was a 30-year-old man. I like movies like The Sixth Sense, Interview with a Vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejose. My son, on the other hand, is enjoying a distinctive foreign film directed by a film graduate and Bergman or Hertzog. We generally hate the choices of one of the movies, but we both looked and no one liked the film! This is not the film we have seen before. We're two cynical / complex personality types and we're generally catching on movies when looking at them - but in this case we are caught up and enjoyed the whole film from the start. If the film is promoted and shown in major Street Theater in the US, it's actually a good idea.
