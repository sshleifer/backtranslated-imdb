I saw Marion Davis in a couple of movies and really did not understand her appeal. She did not dance to peanuts, she did not try to sing and she appeared in a transal - for her performance. But she has not seen quiet comedies and this film is amazing. Instead of her own film, as suggested here, I was saturated with Gloria Swanson, who started in Slaptic Comedy and went to most emotional women's films and married a count. <br /> <br /> Marion, a top mimic, is the best rabbit simulator, Hollywood Georgia, her daughter Peggy, (Marian Davis), always a great star when she can be seen as Grandma, Colonel Pepper (Dell Henderson) Decided to prove it. Their hopes will be reduced and they will fall to the last 40 cents when they meet Billy Boone (William Hines), who works in the last studios, and promise Peggy to get a job. Peggy is considered to be a great dramatic actress, but the studio thinks she is an outstanding comic. They persuade her to make the film and the preview is her greatest success. Charlie Chaplin asks her autograph but she does not recognize him and treats him pretty hard. "Who is the little boy" - when she learns frenes! Peggy and Billy had to call from the High Art Studio, but only wanted Peggy and suddenly she was on her way. <br /> <br /> She has finally got a chance to be a dramatic actress - but she does not cry! !! The director tries everything to shout and when he succeeds, she can not stop it is a hilarious scene !!! Her new celebrity, Andre (Paul Raleigh), forgets her funny past and persuades her to be superior and more sophisticated - she also receives a new name - Patricia Pepore !!! She also seems Billy and her father forgot - she has developed a "STAR" personality !!! When Slapstick Studio "Patricia's" film chooses the same city, Billy is thrilled to watch her, but she is not quite ready for a snobby stance. When she calls him the cheap clown, he learns that once she is not a girl he knows. <br /> <br /> After the studio dinner (filming the greatest daily performances of the great daily) comes from the "Patricia" boss. It seems she is a flop with movies and seems to like to book them in theaters - the public tired of her habits and wish to return to the old Peggy. She and Andre decides to marry, she dreams of a countess (although Billy says, Andre has a spaghetti serving him in a cafe downtown and does not count more than him). On her wedding day, visiting Billy, she learns that she is Billy after a happy custard pie fight. <br /> <br /> All guest stars are happy - John Gilbert speaks with MGM Gates, Liv Cody Ellinar Glyn, who wrote "It", but only a number of adventurous love stories taken into MGM films. William Hines, another actor I wanted to watch many movies, especially - in the cafeteria scene, he has excellent comic timing. Harry Griffon is happy to be the director of comedy - the film has a very happy sequence and Marianne has been on top of them - I'm 10 to 10 people. <br /> <br /> The highly recommended, highly recommendable.
