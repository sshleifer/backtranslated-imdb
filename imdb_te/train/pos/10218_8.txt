When we come to movies, remember that it's practically empty slate. Hollywood patriotism has turned into films with messages from war films, noir, two reel votes, etc. We have Blackboard Jungle, On the Waterfront and so on. Some folks may think that there is an improvement. I do not. Who says Mogul: If you want to send a message, call Western Union? He is right.

You can try it if you like the movies that appear to be in the dungeon of others.
