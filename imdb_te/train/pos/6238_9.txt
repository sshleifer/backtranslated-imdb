The inexorable view of the suburbs of Vienna in the 21st century, combining the six groups of characters by former documentary producer U.Seidl, is a provocative, minimal and serious observation film. In the Big Brother reality shows, Hundestz takes up modern, liberalism, a staggering and deepest level. <br /> <br /> The likelihood of European art-film seems to be very difficult, cruel and inaccessible, but in a glorified way of the modern society's blue discrimination concept. <br /> <br /> World Cinema lovers must have.
