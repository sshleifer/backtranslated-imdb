I read a little bit of chee before I saw this film and you learned something, he was a real leader for the people because he wanted everyone to see equality and he hated what his brutal forces were doing to his people, as well as all other Latin Americans! Now I do not know about others, but he has done the right thing for me to seek socialism, so that everyone has to pay their fair share. However, the powerful elite clearly do not go for that. Therefore, Che has been forced to kill him to suppress the revolution without understanding what he wants. Many of his followers left for the rest of the room. This is a good example when Castro continues his leadership in Cuba. I was concerned and he told me before he died: "If you kill me, it's fine but you kill only one person and you can not kill that!" <br /> <br /> I've given you 10 to 7 in this film.
