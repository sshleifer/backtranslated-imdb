This movie appears as a project. Motion picture producers did not experience the cross section of society, but worked without experience. The characters are incomplete and innocent. Despite this enthusiastic feel, the film is effective. It's like a cross section of life in neighboring kids trying to realize or cultivate their honest sexual feelings. When a big-parent is raised, there is a shame for sexuality from that generation. It offers some predictable but well-known conflict. The main character in her romantic relationship is much deeper than sexual feelings, which is perhaps much more enjoyable. A good watch but nothing is confusing ....
