I have seen some of the other movies in the past that have seen the film. I thought the product values ​​like textiles and settings with the bridge were great. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting to see how the spirit and the demons feel. <br /> <br /> I agree with some comments about fighting scenes. <br /> Finally, a moral story. Some Japanese viewers are curious about what they think about the film. <br /> <br /> "Benjai and Prince" Some scenes have been made better when struggling at the "mental" level. <br /> <br /> Motion picture ideas reveal what has happened now. Intense.
