This is my personal personal favorite when I was young, it's 90's children's movies ... lovable dinosaurs, cute kids, a villain villain, and some great songs (and simple little mermaid / beauty and beast-type songs, but it's fun for them)! I returned to this film again and I loved it forever! I recommend everyone in every age should look at this movie, and I definitely think it should introduce to younger generations! Sorry, I do not have much information, I'm so busy ... please believe me. Go against this film and kill all their inner child!
