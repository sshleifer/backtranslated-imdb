I thought this film was greatly intrigued by my cousin who made me confused and made my cousin. Tell the truth I think that young Kevin Dillon is hot.hahahaha ... but I also thought the girl was stupid to go together and what was wrong with what she told her before her death was "I was inside you" .I do not know what she is doing with him What is she going to say is what she gets for what age do other girls know? I do not think that I can not believe such a policeman now. But it's pretty clear to tell the truth, if I want him to be cap I'm still suspicious of him or her way. And it's funny when she's cool in the eye in the store.Hohohahah.He is a dead policeman. This is called back up. Sometimes these movies make me mad, people stupid and do stupid things. But I thought about the film.
