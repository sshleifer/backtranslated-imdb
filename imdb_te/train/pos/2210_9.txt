I can not believe how much I hate Hall Sparks! He's the favorite host of the show, hands down. I hate the famous gossip and do not like the talk shows in general, but when Hall Sparks is host to the Talk Soup, I have to watch TV. I rarely missed the episode in his run, and when the guest hosts began pouring out (many guests still worked well). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I guess I never saw Hallmark Sparks for the whole weekend. They were made up of hourly portions of the talk soup, and sketch comedy bits which had the best clips from the whole week. The original bits made by Hall Sparks are fun. He was caught by a bad comedy demon, and he was an exorcist like a scene on his head, as he said jokes about airborne food. <br /> <br /> Well, the clandestine hallmark of Sparks is dedicated to the entertainment of an episode multicolisy, as the group multiplies through the studio and multiplied by the episode. Explain them, but along with the talk soup, I've seen the other two shows that The Simpsons and Late Night with Canon O'Brien. If you like the comedy styling of those shows, Sparks might like to have a talk soup over the years. <br /> <br /> Henson and Tailors have been greatly hosted. Three people brought different hospitals to the hospitals but they were all good comedies in my opinion. During the years of Tyler and guest star, my interest in this show has been decline, but every now and then I can catch the spiritual heir of the soup, the show, and certainly enough to bring the most unexpected laughs from the new host time, I'm talking about a TV show that is no longer in the air and I usually speak on the channel I hate I've wasted enough time. Look different!
