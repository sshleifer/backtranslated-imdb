When I was released I saw this film and when I was 12 ... and still remember the amazing scenes of how the hero / heroine escaped every time and the film's best feature is the villain filming! I have copied many "escape scenes" from most of the so-called lot of action movies too! And when I see such a copy it does not impress me, it always increases my appreciation of this masterpiece! :) The main actors are astonishingly. Chemistry's slow and realistic development b / w hero and heroine are very naturally and wonderfully portrayed. We thought that the children, the love that we have developed is very natural. Taking the path and hardships they face, together with true love, sacrifice and care can also make children. Every guy will see this movie when I give him a chance! --Vijay.
