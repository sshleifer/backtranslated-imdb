Perhaps the most perfect Stephen King adaptation yet. Not surprisingly, King himself wrote the screenplay. This story creates a beautiful Maine home for the Creed family. One of the other residents is Judd, a fun old man who knows some things about this area. One runs right through their frontyard on their roadway. The other way is to lead Pet Petals, where decades of children are buried dead animals on the highway. Soon, Elli Creed's cat, the church, will die. Fortunately, this family is away for Thanksgiving, except for Louie (father). Judy brings Louis to another cemetery, beyond the pet semester, where the church is buried. Later, the church was greeted by the Church of Louis (not politely). When he returned, he seemed to be chewing his way out of the bag that was buried. Perhaps he was buried alive. Maybe not. I can not tell you without destroying the story. <br /> <br /> All the King Simulations I have seen are very awful. The characters are real and the conditions are simple. Mary Lambert makes a great job of directing inquiries. As part of the development of the plot, the suspense keeps the film high. The scene of the gauge killed will never be in your mind. Then, of course, we have the end. It's easy to learn what's going on, but Lambert turns off some real scary, and sometimes disturbing, moments. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good image and a wonderful simulation. If you're enjoying the fear and do not need to be chased by some occasional disturbing images, "Pet Semetary" is only what you're looking for. But horror fans prefer to avoid it.
