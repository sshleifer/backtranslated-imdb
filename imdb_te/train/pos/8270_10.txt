This unusual picture, you constantly tricks. It's heading towards the clich√© at several points, and then something that's surprising may happen with those original beginnings. It will give you a lot to say more, but stick with this picture and you will be rewarded greatly. William Hines is absolutely delightful - a star he definitely deserves to recognize. The gay subtitle in its relationship with Jack Pigford is fantastic - there is also a scene on Hans Pickford's chest (Pickford is cool). The two actors play this sub-text with a great depth of emotion and there are so many moving motions. And I did not think I was involved in a football match as I did in this film and I can not even understand the rules! Hines' rival for Ralph's girl of Francis X. Bushman is also amazing (yes, it's not entirely a gay movie). Excellent silent classic - Twenty commercials with a edge is a great example of commercial cinema.
