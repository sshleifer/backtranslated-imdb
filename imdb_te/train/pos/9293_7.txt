This is a pretty good ensemble piece (see cast and rent it - you know it's already interesting), and the director bishop will give their chance, take his time, the characters are mutually exclusive and the landscape <br /> <br /> Some of us, Christopher Jones is looking to highlight after his selfish exile from films; He has a command image presence. And yes, with Christopher Jones, participated by Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor, this "wild in the Streets" reunion party!
