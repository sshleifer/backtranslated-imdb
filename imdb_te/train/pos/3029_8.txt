The novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations from Green; For example, silent but horrific humor that struck in the scenes with Boer and Lorre, or some of the story-killing murder-child invasion. <br /> <br /> When this film is misleading from the novel, it's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I do not suggest this image is bad. It's always part of it and the story is like a good mind '. <br /> <br /> The film is a terrible shame that is not available on DVD.
