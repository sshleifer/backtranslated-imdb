When I was about 8 years old, I first saw Walking Tall movies and I thought Joe Dan Baker and Bo Swenson did great work, since they were watching movies, and the real Sheriff Builder Pussar I could do. All 3 episodes of the film gave me chills and I was the only one who was the real hero of the budger pusser, I'm just alive today and I have more people than he does. I am grateful to him for the distance and the courage of all the crimes. I'm so sorry to have his family go through such horror and pain. My heart leaves them. Do not be negative about these films and actors who have shot Sharif Puser's 30-year-old fan and 3-part Walking Tall films and actors, what a wonderful person they are and what a great family he is. And for all the young people that I have not heard much about Burford, I'm trying to see Walking Tall movies and know more about him.
