You're waiting to see if the remake is good or worse. I pay Audie Murphy a 3 (I'm a tough grader), the second lowest I've ever given Audie ("War at Bloody Beach" though you're curious). I gave the film a "8" rating (and I'm a tough grader) if you want to call it against the north, it's a civil war story of "rebels". <br /> <br /> There are people like Quantere and men who travel with these bandits. <br /> <br /> The original water was a very clean cut, although these men were afraid to see what had happened. In fact, movies such as an older version are viewed by a larger audience, who can identify the story. The new image gives a fairly honest version, revealing a message more easily through an older version than an older version because it is more "R" and a Gruff's nature, more appropriate to rate it with a GP. </ P> </ p> <p> <br/> From the sixties, filmmakers have addressed "realism", but some of them have been delivered. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> This is clearly visible in the Western style commonly seen today. This image is an example. It gives true settings, but it also gives us the belief that we are in that era. <br /> <br /> It has some coconuts, which makes it full of a complete bit and has some detailed conditions. <br /> It begins with a bit campy, but really improves. The main character is the one we recognize, and at least have some sympathy. The Audi Murphy's character of the opening film has no sympathy and is quite justified without inspiration. <br /> <br /> The character in the film follows the lines of the true opposite hero. There is a method of inspiration and his madness. <br /> He never really feels "right", but we can understand where he comes from. <br /> <br /> There are many actions in this film. There is also some humor. <br /> <br /> When a heroine tells her that she is a liar she is a good scene. <br /> <br /> The film is going to do the film for decades. <br /> This is the director and the writer team. Full success.
