My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (Mary, US Marine Corps), is in Guadalcanal, and lost his feet to Japan and received a naval cross. My father was surprised to learn that the film was technical advisor and I had an impact on the film and I thought it was really how it felt, and this movie was real. <br /> <br /> My father was the superstition of facts and personalities, and I thought he always believed that he had something of such things. <br /> <br /> He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, receiving the highest praise from Japan Emperor for his contribution and programs to return to McDowell, who has been married for more than 40 years (mystic, her Japanese), and a few years ago from Japan Emperor. . <br /> <br /> When my father was a sea, but you are a sea, I know that you are always a sea. <br /> Now, he is very much in love with him. <br /> <br /> If you have a copy of this one, I would love to see this movie. And I'd like to give my father to my 94th birthday this year!
