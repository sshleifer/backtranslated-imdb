It has already kept the best version of Homer's epic. Totally shot in natural locations in the Mediterranean regions. The sea and sky are very slow blue, the islands are green and can not be touched. Clothing linen, wool and fur, settings Stony and Bear, everything is somewhat tough and oldest, a bit you can find in coconuts or pasolini movies, and makes it more authentic. The story is based on mythology and goes into the supernatural The idea of ​​life in the 10th century is a good idea. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is somewhat slower and strict, but overall it is very beautiful to get you quick. Actually, it's close to the original plot by Homer, but not text. Ulysses will not appear until the first hour, initially his son is concentrated on looking at him. Then he suddenly loses a storm, and landlords take care of him on the fascist island. His adventures are called a commentary for his hospitality: Horror Cyclope, Magic World of Cirse, Underworld, Siren et al. Finally, he returns to his homeland Ithaca after 20 years, and it dramatically ends when he kills it <br /> <br /> As a storytelling, the Odyssey man's unparalleled metaphorical struggle. The cast is fantastic and international here. Irene Papas gives us a simple Greek tragedy style like Penelope, but the Albanian actor Beckham Flemish, like Allistas, is a magnificent. Seeing is good and fully convincing, the character seems to have been made really for him. Strange he never gave the characters in this sense. Barbara Bach (also known as Barbara Gregorini), also known as James Bond Girl in "The Spy Who Loved Me", and Athena's play, Michael Breton, was not recognized in a strange film called "Performance" with Mick Jagger. <br /> <br /> When 35 years ago, the series was actually the first big European co-production for TV, Italy, France, Germany and Yugoslavia, which is quite new for its time. By 1974, I saw this small-range of 8 episodes on French television. I am a child, although it is black and white, it makes a very clear impression. <br /> <br /> I am surprised if I have not been seen recently on French TV and have a chance to see again. <br /> Recently I am on the DVD (excellent color) on the Internet. Unfortunately it has no subtitles in Italian, but French and German versions already exist. It is widely recognized in the English Saxon world and I have never heard of any English version of the film and it is very insulting. If you get the chance to see it, never forget it. <br /> There are not many versions of Odyssey before or after. Classic knife-and-sandals, such as "Commands" by Camerini in 1955 featuring Kirk Douglas, but a complicated story is not impressive and too short. Based on a special effects by Conchalowski in 1997, Hayyer's story and atmosphere is a distinct Hollywood film that has been very low and opaque.
