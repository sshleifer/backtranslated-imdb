The effectiveness of the four city slickers in the crisis in Appalachia became synonymous with rural misery. When a dam crosses a challenging White Writer tour on a river bank, every four businessmen face their dark fears. Locals along the way decide "their way" with interlopers it leads to the load of many deaths and injuries for survivors. Although Woyt provides major and strong performance, everyone in the passengers is exceptional. Rural scenery and culture well-seized, including the scene of a breathtaking duo ban. It was not exactly the exact date of the date when it came out (both of us enjoyed it). I remembered this sort of break out of dramatic performance for Burt, WAITE was already established. Every week is not the sort of image you can see, it's a strong punch and beautifully portrayed.
