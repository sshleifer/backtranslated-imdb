Verhoen's film is completely and full of worse. He is a director hug and should be ashamed. Through his own entry he read 2 chapters of the book, was frustrated and decided to make the whole thing from the start. <br /> <br /> Heinlein does not support the worst that he should be alive and seen. <br /> It basically steals the name, the book's politics (which is a good piece), and throws in some T & A, so the average idiot American artist is bored. <br /> <br /> This anime is the best one, but it is very clear, the best I can say.
