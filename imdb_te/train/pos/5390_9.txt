Life is a fantastic pre-coded image featuring some of the best of the Beggins era. It is in the hospital's maternity ward, especially for women who are in trouble. It is an old woman, a strict unwed mother (Glenda Farrell), a weaker youth, an Italian woman, and the main character (Loretta Young) who spent 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Lynden) is in the hospital at every two. <br /> <br /> This film is the most interesting and entertaining. It's not terrible, but it's interesting to see such a neglected thing on the silver screen. Performance is amazing all around. Loretta Young is beautiful here in his staple. Eric Lyndon came out somewhere and is honest. His innocence reminds Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is as great as ever, the foremost-of-the-codes and for good reason.
