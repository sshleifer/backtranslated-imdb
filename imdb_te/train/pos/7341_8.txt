I enjoy Ralph Bakshi movies ("Wizards", "Cool World" and animated "Lord of the Rings") and a Frank Frazetta collector and fan am. I'm Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard's world loves the sword and hypnosis fan. <br /> <br /> I lost a theater release of "Fire and Ice" in 1983, video or some revival ever since. So the 2005 release gave me a dream come true. However, I bought some tremors because I was not the only one to see it once and put it on a shelf as a "collectible" collection until I die. Fortunately, my fears have been broken up and I am stuck with this movie. <br /> <br /> It is similar to the Freretta Art which is very illusion / knife and enchanted pictures without cheesy or dirty. The art is cool and you see the glimpses of Frazetta at his best. My little boys also liked watching me and ask me to watch again and again. However, there are some objections to my wife's less objectionable princess (most Frazetta-esquire). It is unbelievable and there is no romance. <br /> There is roto-scoping, but personally I like roto-smoking. <br /> <br /> Despite facing some continuous problems, I recommend this movie to all fans, fracetes, canon and knife and hypnosis fans. Have fun!
