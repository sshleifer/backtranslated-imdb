This is one of my favorite martial arts films in Hong Kong. It was one of John Wu's first films and was one of the few traditional martial arts films he directed. The film has seen the effects of his work under Chang Chen. Action is good and fighting choreography is performed by Fight Hack, which appears to be one of the bad guys in the film. It has a fan of faces of the "Five Vanessa" fame and fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers Productions. The storyline is interesting, there are some good stories of the story and the intelligence of making characters and their relationships with each other is intelligible. The film is only in VHS release in the UK. Media Asia has released an area 3 DVD and has versions available from the USA DVD. The film is lovely to see it as its original language or dubbing version as it is English. I highly recommend this film.
