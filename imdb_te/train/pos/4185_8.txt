Unfortunately editing, frenzy dialogue, bad (you do not even exist) acting, meaningless heroes, shootings are too long ... and the MST3K-style riffing is perfect for "Corps Eaters Drinking Game": Scrippable in the forms ... a shot Take - Enter your name ... Take a shot - catch a bad foley edit ... Take a lot, take a lot of shots. <br /> If I did not have enough nudity I did not rate more than 8 and despite its insane misconduct, it was only an hour - hell, such a film was at least 20-30 minutes long!
