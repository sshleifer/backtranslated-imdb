Henry Fonda Brilliantly captures what we believe as long as Abraham Lincoln. This is a cheat. By Fonda's performance we led Abraham to believe Lincoln was a living bumpkin (on the surface). But you can see how a good guy and a good man can influence people around him, including his face during Lynchmab and especially in court dealings, with what is happening around him at the bottom of external postures. <br /> <br /> In this film, Henry Fonda shows that he has a good grip on how to deliver humor. It was a factor of his years. When he's telling stories and jokes he's perfect down timing. There is a scene in my very sad trial. He again shows this gift in The Lady Eve in 1940. <br /> <br /> The ending of John Ford is going to be at the top of the hill, signaling the tremendous storm of the Civil War. He goes forward in history. The movie is fiction but Lincoln's insight is amazing. Definitely worth watching.
