This film should be an art for everyone enjoying soccer. The first strikes about the film about a soccer world cup was the way it was shot. After the game as a TV broadcast, there is a generous footage dedicated to follow individual players in games. These moods and situations will bring forward, these men try to reach fame. Today's TV broadcasting style is slightly different than 1986, compared to those images. <br /> <br /> The players are not only stars. Audiences, referees, matches and journalists covering the environment are playing a major role in developing today's history. You can see how these factors are very clear in this picture. Many of the prominent athletes here include: Maradona (Argentina), Elkzer and Ladduop (Denmark)), Francescoi (Uruguay), Platini (France), Leinicker (England), Rumämegeg (Germany), Beurek # Spain), Socrates (Brazil) and Sánchez (Mexico). <br /> The movie is not a collection of 1986 Mexico's best soccer movements, most of them are well covered. All films are presented with many aspects of the game, and competitions are based on the progress of these players and teams, and the play-related drama is spanning. <br /> What happened to referees during Mexico 1986, and comments about the film and the World Cup were so many Mado-radicals. These comments are not considered by the referee and two punkers, as they are human beings and that all of the above mentioned is one way or another. Referees do not allow TV-based replays to make decisions on soccer rules, so many referees should decide what they have realized. Consequently, referees are active in a game development. Their impact on many parts of the film can be seen. <br /> <br /> When compared to the sequel movie for the 1990 World Cup, it's very discouraging. It comes from the fact that most people have played a role in this game, but the film shows a more distant and impractical perspective.
