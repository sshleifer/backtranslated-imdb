Poker Story Jackie Chan sets excellent sets to show his special talent and courage. Jackie's greatest single fight sequence in Jackie's best and most dangerous jackfire final is Jack's best and most dangerous after the brutal and less comedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the film does not hold to this quality, which is a form of copical thriller rather than some comedy. I always like JC as Project A, shining through its natural jokes. I do not work in extreme limits on some of the police story. <br /> <br /> Although jockeys are already with the finest movies in Hong Kong films, this is really awful stick subtitle. <br /> If you do not see a JC movie first, start a good movie.
