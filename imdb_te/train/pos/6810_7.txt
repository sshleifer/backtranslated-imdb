After reading this book, I waited for 3 bucks across the DVD at Wal-Mart, sure, what hell ... I got the DVD and viewed it last night. When I started looking up, I checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes. I'm fine, okay ... story slowly, slowly rushing, how far is it. By the time I got to the original murders, I was like, "How much time has it left?" Checked. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am happy to see that part of the DVD sequence selection menu is part 1 and one part 2. Another half an hour to go! I am very happy and unveiled the second half of the film, more than the first. <br /> <br /> The original film of 1967 (despite my sincere desire) read this novel, which is for two-part tv miniseries, I feel that Perry's role is absolutely wrong and some minor instances have come out of me, but I've done a lot better, the first half drops in a bit, the second half holds a high grip and I think that Coopat did his book: 1 / After 3 murders, 1/3 afterwards, and 1/3 of the killers were arrested <br /> <br /> Again, the second half is more exciting, but at the same time, first of all, after the murders were imprisoned, 1/2, then 1/4, and 1/4. <br /> <br /> Now when I look back and think about pulling things off and making mistakes, I will close the hell. Watch the movie and make your own damn mind! <br /> <br /> <br
