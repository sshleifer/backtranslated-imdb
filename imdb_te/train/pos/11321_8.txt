When I began to look at the show, "Oh, no! This is Elfen lied and that bloody!" <br /> In fact, the setup is almost identical, with a young boy living in a small child with a large child, suddenly participating in a fantastic adventure, sexy young girls come to him. <br /> There are comparisons. The love story with one in Inuyasha is very subtle and intense, the child's comments and behavior are very low. The magic setup is a bit brown, seven servants, seven servants, the Holy Grail are fighting, all servants are known for anyone, from all masters single school, engagement rules etc. <br /> <br /> I saw 24 episodes in a day and I was very proud of the other genres without comparing to the animations I liked.
