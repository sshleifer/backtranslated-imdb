I do not agree with the above comments - it's very interesting and exciting feature film, which has an extraordinary structure and moves towards a frightening maximum range of useful use of silence. Furthermore, it analyzes the odd motivation of suicide in the most frank way, which does not pull any punches on the show and does not matter and stuff on the subject. It has documentary about it as well as horror and art house films and deserves the law of two distinct horror films, such as The Blair Witch Project and Original Ring (both of which are both an early and unrecognized effect). If you are interested in horror film edges this is definitely worth it.
