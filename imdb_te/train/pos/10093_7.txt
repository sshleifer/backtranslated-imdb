A beautiful shopkeeper in London wipes his feet off by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds himself married and lives in his home in British Ceylon. Based on the Robert Stanchy book, this early set-up recalls Hilsac's "Rebecca" most reminiscent of the eminent chief of Elizabeth Taylor building and (soon) his own husband, who is still his thief, but still under the thumb of his father. Taylor, who is the last minute alternative for a sick Vivienne League, is wealthy-soft in her upscale fashion wardrobe, and her performance is strong; However, after husband Peter Finnch has drunk heavily and barking orders, he may think that it is masochistic (that concludes this concept), rather than his dedication. Still, this movie offers a lot of adventures for soap effects: romantic drama, travel, a detailed dance, an elephant stampede, and a perfect seasonal cholera! **** from
