This is Modesty that we do not know! This is syntactically referred to in the comic strip and is summarized to sell to newspapers! Lee and Janet Bachelor give a true Maddie Blaze fans and a dream job - tell the prequel story of fans who have seen before fans. In their audio commentary, they agreed that the story changed their origin to make the story smooth. It should be noted that the "Purists" also told Mickey that everything was not true, because she could not find her "spending time". I do not rent or borrow a DVD like other "critics", I buy! And I do not want to refund! I've seen it three times and I'm not sleeping through it! Great dialogue and well-drawn characters that have thought about novels and comic strips (I'm also a bad man Micklo)! I can not even wait for the next Modesty (and Willie) film, specifically this "prequel" signal to come!
