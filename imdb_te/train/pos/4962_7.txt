"Brak Show" is good .Maybe it is not at the same level as "Aqua Teen Hangar" or "Coast Space Coast Coast", but certainly not many levels of intellectuals .Using the typical lives of Zorak and Brak 's life and school, the 50' lives. The humor and animation of this show is that it has a lot of extreme situations and strange characters "Aqua Teen Hangar" (and in one episode you can see Meatwad) .But it 's fine, it' s funny episodes. Some songs are great, not many, but I liked this show. Brock's father's ridiculous character. (It's a human being, no one knows why)
