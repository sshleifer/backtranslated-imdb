Peter M. Cohen is a winner's satire in the imaging game, twisting around and inward. In critical media media publications critical critiques in the film are "dangerous" and "obscene" only to show less of its intensity, such as a refreshing and centralized division of sexual harassment and desires of people. This is in the tradition of what I call "reality based" in the footsteps of "The Company of Men," "Chasing Amy", "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "Two Girls and a Guy". Cohen's conversation was pleasant and I constantly worried about the extent of the actual pace of today's conversations. Bryan von Holt, Jory Barber and Jonathan Abrahams are three different, brutal hunters, a female predator (Amanda Pete), with their recently married friend (beautifully owned by Daddy). Under the satirical surface it brings back a more attractive romantic comedy than a more coated studio product.
