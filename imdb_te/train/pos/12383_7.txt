Christina Rainas plays a lovely model in New York, who seeks a new apartment and meets strange neighbors, secrets herself out of the building and is slowly constructed up to the climax by the end of the movie. The film has flooded the devil from the Roman Catholic Church, the Hell Gate, the extreme rituals, the growing conspiracy, and ultimately the most talented actors and actresses. We are like Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Rafin, Arthur Kennedy, José Ferrer, Slivia Miles, Beverly Dienzel, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldberg, Forget Caradine. Many of these actors have ham - especially Burgess Meredith giving a good comic / dimensional performance in the neighborhood with a small bird and cat. Melerith Balsam and Chris Sarandon are memorable. Although some performers do not have a humorous role, José Ferrer can not do anything in the ungrateful role. Sentinel is a fine horror movie with mental features and some really awful scenes. The closing scene is repulsive and still chilling. I look wrong with some of the inappropriate sex and violence in the film, especially with the whole scene with DJJ and Miles. Is that really necessary? I'm not. Also, father / daughter stuff is a bit too good, but the whole picture works and is a winning pace. Director Michael Winner is a worker and is capable of creating tension and horror film motion. The scenes with Karadin are particularly effective.
