Gordon Parks, a photographer of the fruitful Black Life magazine, has produced a true confusing-time of a film - it's not confusing! Based on the true story of two NYC cops - later known as Batman and Robin - Unilateral use of extreme strategies to clean their typical neighborhoods, the term is a police bond before it becomes a recursive formula. <br /> <br /> The man and the 70s NYC were a form of these images and a police officer from "Serpiko". These two cops are securitized-sectional rookies, barring dealers begin in their free space. But instead of getting praise from City Police Department, they do not get resistance and resistance from their peers. <br /> <br /> They intend to save the minefield and bonhard works of policemen and legal corruption alone on their streets in the streets, brutal drug kings, and surrounding areas of an evil ghetto. <br /> <br /> David Selby and Ron LeBman are excellent in Leeds; LeBman's eyes are drastically scattered around every scenario, which is part of a flawless comic performance and Selby's acting less key and curl. All the comic elements of these two stories make up - displaying a subtle disappointment combined with firm conviction. Director Parks, who has already called for his coverage of the controversial issues in his photography, does not abstain from the mystery of the story. Besides, the police and streets that these two men live in the role of the criminals in the world of criminals. Adding to this reality is the fact that the real Huntz and Greenberg act as technical advisers to the film, as well as the surrealist role of two fellow officers who are mocking the leaders. <br /> <br /> It is a true tribute to the influence of Park's direction that can balance this dull mile with a brilliant comedy. <br /> Why would MGM / UA give this over 30 years on the shelf? Is it a home video or DVD release in the US? It is a small masterpiece since the 1970s.
