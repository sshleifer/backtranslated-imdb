By 1987, John Wu's icon appeared in Hong Kong world films such as 'A Better Tomorrow', 'Ju Ways', and Samo Hung's Spooky Kind Chow Yun Fat on Classic 'Mr. Vampire'. Jackie Chan has an international success in the video, but in many years HK cinema has a Chinese Ghost Story in its first true crossover theater hit West. <br /> Western artists like never seen. HK combines the film and its appearance of the various materials used for cinematic years (flying swords, elaborate dance directing and supernatural arts) to create a unique image of feel and execution. <br /> <br /> The killer is the director of the cuis-tung ching (still known as the action choreographer on the good films like Woo's' A Better Tomorrow 2 '/'), under the watchful eye of the legendary producer Tui Hark, the fantasy / horror movie Created a masterpiece. And at his disposal (less than 6 marshal coordinators), with such a team of experts, the film is fantastic but not spectacular. <br /> <br /> Exciting David Wu / 'Bride 2 with White Hair' and 'Classic' titles like 'A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3', 'Strict' and Cultural Hit Club 'are just a mere intellectual The work of His mastery of the perfectly dance-directed flying, tree-cutting knife battles created them the best HK film. Fast moving, overwhelming, but confused, even today is the pinnacle of their art. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers' crews have done wonders. Each shot is a skillfully painted painting film. The striking blue night scenes, the devil ever covered in the gorgeous fog, the stage where the story is so great. It is a picture of everything used to paint the dreamy beauty. The silken costume and costume worn by Hussein Singh also became parts of the film, sex scenes or war scenes flowing across the screen. Hsiao Tsing has also become a subject of the fluttering beauty of each skill combination with a set of scenes to create a very memorable scene from a simple act even a simple scene in the outfits. The sets are also excellent, giving the other worldly sense of forests, and drying of hell for the wonderful end, the temple and hardness to the flag-filled wasteland. <br /> Another major reason for the success of the films is Romeo Diaz and James Wang. Hong Kong films added some of us to some of the amazing songs and songs to a sequence of success, but the music in "A Chinese Chinese Story" is quite simple. From the original song, it becomes as important as classical characters. <br /> The score is a perfect blend of modern and traditional instruments. The drums, bells and guitars pound away on action scenes for great effect, but it's slow, overwhelming romantic slippers when it comes on. Here; Flutes, strings, and female band effects may be the best pieces of music in a HK image. <br /> <br /> And we have the talent of the acting talent in the romance of romance and romance of this daughter, Sawo-Shen and Hossoo Singh's Love Making, Leslie Cheung (`A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2 'and the most famous singer) is the innocent tax collector. (Gratefully light) His work is never up to comedy scenes and his sequences with Joey Wong are played with just the right hobby and innocence. <br /> <br /> Joy Wong Chow Yun Fat / Andy Law Classic "Gamblers of God") The essence of her beauty beauty. Tragic Hassio Singh is amazing in her role. She shows her the role of her characters and that she has suffered her to do, but she also gives subtle romance in the scenes that are oppressing men for their gruesome deaths. Famous actor Wu Ma (`Mr. Vampire ',' Swadeshwara ') was intelligent, courageous, but never scary, yen. He treads the fine line between the unusual and annoying easy to practice. <br /> But what about monsters and beasts? I heard him cry. Well they are from a dirty but fun stop motion / animatronic zombies (resulting in a great running result that continuously halt attempts on the unsuspecting Tsau-Shen) that are rather dirty but surprisingly effective Lord Black, are late. Poisoned flying heads, and most excellent wire work done with an arsenal. <br /> <br /> But the greatest influence and the killer tongue of creation tree spirit. We first face this thing rushing down the impact of an 'Evil Dead' style camera into the zombiefied husks into the victims of the forces down to deliver a lethal French kiss on the down powers of its victims. But later it was shown in its silly fame. This is killing the forest and killing forests, growing large and long, passing around the surrounding and surrounding areas, killing them before taking them and moving them around people before dismissing the tree trunks! It can also be opened to reveal a fang-filled mouth! It's a formidable idea not to work deeply into the main plot. <br /> <br /> This is the best example of Hong Kong Movie Making. A real team effort given us a real ground breaking picture. It is filled with humor, innovation, action, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, lush visuals, beautiful music, and most of the eternal romance in the eternal charm and movies of the film.
