I'm going to give you 8 people, but you have got my contribution because you have 6.5 people in most good votes. Sticks River is a pure genius. Certainly, Woody is his permanent things, but at least his role is appropriate. The first half hour is really happy, and the rest of the movie is easy to watch. The dialogue was clever enough and it was fun watching Woody's card tricks at parties, with the reaction from the upper hull. This is much better than newspaper critics. And plus, the Apprentice of the little sorcerer to go along with it. And of course, did you notice that Jansen is getting a bit frumpy? Charles Dance is always entertaining as Hugh Jackman.
