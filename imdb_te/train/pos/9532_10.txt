<br /> <br /> Composite intensity and smoothness of the touch will not work for anyone who wants a typical fast-read action movie . If we live in Elizabeth's day, this film is like a Shakespearean tragedy. But if we do not, it is a drama-suspense film. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but the story is complicated. The film is as intelligent as the relationships and the problems explored. Most story story is told, which makes it more subtle and movable - it works well on the story based on the comic book (or graphic novel). <br /> <br /> In fact, in the 1930s, I have actually been there for some part of this story - there is such a real and dream-like quality in its style. <br /> <br /> I often have books based on movies, but in this case I am. <br /> (I also enjoyed the book.) I bought a great DVD, it has excellent striking scenes and intelligent commentary. <br /> And I talked about it for the first time, because I wanted to use it as a little way for my little cousin, he had problems at home and I wanted to use him as a way to launch debate on father-son problems - and talk.)
