I am happy to hear a rumor that it will finally be issued on DVD. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Errol Flynn's most entertaining film, especially when "Gentleman Jim" is the carbot ring career. The movie begins. <br /> <br /> It goes from good movie to good cinema. <br /> <br /> This is a good example for the film, as most proud men can play the role of a good man, as well as Flynn. According to the report, this is Flynn's favorite character and I believe. You can understand how much happiness he got here. Ward Bond also looks as if his character is really enjoyable in the role of prominent John L. Sullivan. Bond, it's never good. <br /> <br /> Here are the right amount of boxing sequences and they are very well done. It is very fun to see even when the Corbett family continues on stands in gym's matches. In the Arena, the stable arguments and words of the Corbett family can get bigger and more embarrassing, but they have come to the right conclusion. <br /> <br /> When talking about this conclusion, Sullivan speech has touched a lot of the big fight and highlighted the image. While some of the average enthusiastic critics (Variety, for example) like that end or the image is very fictional - duh - most films are like or fictional. And, in this case, make it a good story and nice finish. (In real life, Corbett is a very soft spoken gentleman, not like Floyne's role, but Flynn still makes him a good guy. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most entertaining classic films ever watched and I'm just waiting for the DVD.
