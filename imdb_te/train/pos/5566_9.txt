This movie is fun to watch, there is not much plot (well, not a plot), but there are good jokes and situations where you laugh. Chong Chech's cousin (they know that there is a basic storyline trying to have a nice date for dope sound, a music store, a massage parlor, a comedy club, and even they are also cheech who do not even go to one's house!
