It seems like a perfect day for swimming. A typical family will benefit from it and goes to the shore. Unfortunately, the father was trapped under a boat and his wife or young son could not help him - but the waves were growing. <br /> <br /> The short film of John Sturges (69 minutes) is unanswered questions because the woman (Barbara Stanwick) will help. Stanwick finds the one who can help, but she has the price to pay. There is a double query that poses the picture. How far did you go to help the person you love and on the other hand - who behaved about Stenwick's behavior - really loved her husband? As a good little story, he leaves the viewer with the questions he answers to himself.
