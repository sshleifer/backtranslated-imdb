Despite the critique of criticism, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. This is an image that is closely viewed; Some of the funny bits have been passing and there is no simple amount of attention to draw them. For example, use a price gun at Michael Keaton Pet Shop and keep an eye on documentary years that appear in the beginning of scenes. Though humor is funny to you, you accidentally hits one of the rare films here. Director Amy Heckling is really sharper here - if you are familiar with well-known movies (Ridgemont Hay, Clueless, European Celebration, Fast Times), you should give it a look. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Michelle Keaton is the main character and fan cast (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopa, Peter Boyle). Highly recommended.
