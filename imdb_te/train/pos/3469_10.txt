This is one of the few films that released a "what" situation that caused my opinion. It's very surprising to hear someone talking to one another, and remember all the wonderful things (and not so amazing) between them. I think there is a very good chance that it actually happened like this film suggests, and they actually made peace with each other. It is self-sufficient to ask what has happened to every fan of good memories and what happened between them. It's Amazing Cinema. The comic images of the film are fantastic. They thought that they would comfort people who would like to have a chance to remove the gas from anyone to think of doing things in between. The attention of John to look at such attention, refreshing character from hearing the worst talk about him ...
