Terry Gilliam is a wonderful movie, I enjoyed it very much. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and Christopher Plummer's little character make this movie so awesome! This is the only Terry Gillium film I've ever seen, and Twelve Monkeys is definitely on my Top 10. I think this is one of the four best Bruce Willis films; And the best of Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt provides a perfect presentation. One of the ten best actors I've ever seen. He played his character (Geoffrey) very daring. Bruce Willis' character (James Cole) was also very convinced. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt played exceptionally. Providing an amazing story for great performances; And back up, Terry Gilliam's amazing direction.
