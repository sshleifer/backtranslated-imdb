Last night I saw Late and the word in mind was "original." They are copying whatever they're doing on all other networks and it's a term you do not use too much on TV, which copies ends up with seven nights, unfunny comic, and reality trash of criminal performances. <br /> <br /> The first thing is the presence of Jim Dale that hit me like a brick. People who are not familiar with the British "Carry On ..." series or Harry Potter book may not be aware of Dale. I'm not sure whether the author adds or makes her presence. I have to tune more, but it does give the show "Harry Potter" atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a gift. It never explains where he came, but he can bring back someone from the dead for a minute. Teams with Chi McBride ("Boston Public," Roll Bounce) to solve the killings by using this talent. Everything is fine and funny and things get really complicated until he comes across the love of childhood, Anna Friel (Goal! Dream Begins, Timeline). He can not send her back and he can never touch her. <br /> <br /> I will tuning to see if this series will be entertaining forever.
