This beautiful but empty film is presented by Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer. Diarych plays a woman with a beautiful, empty life. Really beautiful cinematography and sets, and yes Dietrich's bottomless trunk are also excellent. She is awesome; Boyer looks young and elegant. <br /> <br /> The story of the woman who wants to understand and the life of seeking a former priest looks pretty old, but set against the skies, which works with such unreal sets and somehow, given the two stars, the excellent Max Steiner score, and the good assistant cast. This film runs for 76 minutes and is radically modified, plus some characters just appear or disappear. <br /> <br /> <br /> Joseph Shildtruz's Arab Guide, c. The old priest of Aubrey Smith, Lucille Watson, Tilly Loach the Dancer, John Caradine the DeWiner, and Basil Rathbone plays ... I'm not sure. He just travels from the desert and spoils everything! As others have said, John Gilbert decides to act with Dietrich. I can not help, I think he's amazing. The Boris character of the world no longer matches the great Gilbert. <br /> <br /> After the success of Queen Cristina (Garbo), he may have earned his career track. <br /> <br /> I do not think of any of the 30 paintings of the Dietrich. She looks great and wears some amazing outfits. <br /> <br /> Lush Sets and Color and Valentines are my favorite Sheik costumes worthy of a look perfect for two great actors.
