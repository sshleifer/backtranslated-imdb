**** Spaniers **** The movie "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of the legendary US Marine Sniper Carlos "Gunny" Hathak. A soft-spoken Mr. Rogers see-alike who killed almost 300 confirmed and unconfirmed Vietcong and North Vietnamese soldiers during his two trips in "Nam". What is the deadly and effective trained military sniper <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is a big American Sergeant Thomas Beckett at the end of his career as a marine sniper is a cool cam and deadly The civil life on the trunk then understands. Since he has not learned anything from outside his skills learned in the US marines unless he decides to become a horde hitman. <br /> <br /> The story "sniper" is focused on Sgt.Beckett with the support of former soldier silver medalist and US government agent Richard. Miller, Billy Jane, was sent deep into the Panama race. Two snipers are rebel General Miguel Alverage, Frederick Miraglitto and Columbia Pharmacist Pin Raul Ocho, Carlos Alvarez, who are planning a military plan for the country. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Sgt. Beckett takes a rebel leader who thinks scope and the best view of "sniper". This shows how step by step. Beckett with the help of his spotter Cpt. Papuac, Eden Young, is going to do his job. A sub-plot also subsequently failed in the movie about the insurgent sniper Diwilia, Everwen Willey, who hunted Beckett and later killed the papich, both waiting to get out of the forest through a military helicopter. You might think that you have played between the two ends of the dead cat and the end of the mouse. <br /> <br /> What was the artist's shot from the movie to one of the funniest and fifteen minutes that was damaged? A Rambo-like sniper movie ended with Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller are battling the entire battalion of insurgents with thick-flying bullets as a London fog. <br /> <br /> "Sniper" is not really glamorous in combat films: who is a secluded killer who killed the diamonds cutter or the accuracy and skill of skilled nervous surgery and the whole mystery.
