The first time I saw "Human Bondage" a few days ago and Wow! What a mysterious and almost horrific image. I loved how Philip's feet went with the music of every step. <br /> <br /> One of the great attitudes of this film is that Bettie Davis comes to your eyes in advance. This was because she worked best, but it was not so common to be as bad as a actress in 1934, because it was not so simple, sandy and false ... great, Betty was different and she wanted to know her if she wanted to know that she was evil and courageous and loved her. <br /> <br /> If you're a true lover of the movie, it's great looking at it. <br /> <br /> There is a way to distribute a line to her part, for which the film belongs to her. "Music and fire are like a collective ... me old kaju and some sparklers" or "but you're in the chair!" Or "with my heart, I still love the person I killed !!" ... she came from some pictures, but you get my motion. She is very brave, sassy, ​​and exotic looking at those beautiful big eyes. <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard is terrific ... very calm, persistent, desirable to be loved. I thought he was adorable and did not understand how everyone was falling for him, but then again, everyone ... except Mildred. He did a great job. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like was the writing of early films. It is almost unbelievable that they will play a role with disgust and in fact someone will come first. The performances were great, but in real life, Philip Mildred was never interested. This is a simple truth ... see it !!
