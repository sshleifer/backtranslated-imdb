Everything is fine in the last days. Children's television also. And Fraggle Rock proves my point very easily. I am about fourteen years old when writing this comment, but even in my teen years, I can not stop the charm of Frogly Rock. In fact for living yourself under a rock (haha!), Frogly Rock is a fun and fun about the crowd of fun and goofy creatures known as Froggles who live in a rock. But they are not the only creatures. This work belongs to many other species. On the one hand live inventor-scientist Dock and his dog Sprocket (later friendship with Gobo Fraggil), the outside of Rock, the family of Gorgus-proposed rulers of Universe. Boobor (a pessimistic indigenous god) and Red (caught up with sport and general tension) is caught, five major frogs Gobo (fearless leader), Mikey (Artie and Peaceful), Wembley <br /> In some strange situations each episode has the same Singing and dancing at the time. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a family exhibition. The plot may not have good songs. And dance routines have their own attention. The characters are strong and fond of, their conflicts are believable and thrilling their adventures. Gorgeous is shocking, docking and sprocky, Uncle Traveling Matt happily (the postcard sections of the 80s!) And the final episode, Change of Address, genuinely touching. Please try again and again!
