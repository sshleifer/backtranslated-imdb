I was watching this movie in my normal time, which was true in real time. <br /> <br /> Since the passing of the film slowly began, I thought first of all what I was supposed to do, with the fact that its shots were late for a long time. But after a while, I'm starting to go further in the cinema, telling me more about his story. In the end, you seem to know your whole life. <br /> <br /> The film has given me much interest and I do not even know about the rising sun. <br /> <br /> Lynch's bizarre is not a part of the genre but the amusing characters fit in the film.
