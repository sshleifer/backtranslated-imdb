H.G. 'The Invisible Man' to Remember Wells? Well here's another picture, more serious. "Halo Man" is not a story of not being a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon has portrayed Sebastian Cain, a scientific genius, going to the invisible world and helping military needs. The serum was originally a part of the first, and the man was not coming back. The first attempts were very unstable. Until one night he perfected the formula. And who, but Caine laboratory is rat. Gorilla was first and almost died, so when he arrived, it was a close. So when Cain, he decided to use it for fun. When he disappeared, the team tried to bring him back to the world of meat. Nevertheless, the visual principle does not necessarily work properly, and the cyan spills. So he ends up being a mad invisible killer. It is better to get out of town instead of taking the lives of people around you. I care less for those you wrong. Great picture, plenty of fun. 3 of 5 stars!
