I know, I know: it's childish. But I love this kind of movie. A bird that suffers a lot of "mishaps" and still does not lose his faith in the sense of humanity and humor. The film's specialty is that the main character Paulie-chilika - and he's not getting some hotshot human momentum. And yet I like the storyline: Polly tells the cleaner when she hits her life at the rock cleaner. (By the way: the voice of Jay Moss sounds almost like Joe Pesci's!). And of course cheek Marin, man is humorous to me. I've seen "Smoke Up" since then, I appreciated his innocent way of performance, making the situation a happy one ... I can not help.
