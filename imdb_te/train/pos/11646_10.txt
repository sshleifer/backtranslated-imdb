Although the film is one of the most favorite elements of Mexican producers' producers, there is a funny way to keep a serious life on screen in our cities. <br /> <br /> This is a very important Mexican director, last time, the history of our city is made up of diverse literary disciplines, which is a farce or sarcasm, a matter in our country, but a freshness tone is a very different commentator. <br /> <br /> The actors are a little known, but the excellent way is reflected in their paper, each of the directors to be able to reflect the stories in our world anywhere, to make fun of laughter and mourning. Perhaps not many people in our country are happy, but I think people of other countries are attractive and share the surrealism of Mexico.
