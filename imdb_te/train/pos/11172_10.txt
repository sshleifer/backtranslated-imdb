Personally, I absolutely love this movie and novel (I first read the book and decided to see the movie). First of all plot is really original and one of a kind. Acting is very great and I love casting. Judd Crandal (Fred Guinee plays) perfectly matches his character and really sells it to you. There are also some corny lines thrown there (Idk if they understand that they are corny), but they really lighten up the mood and offer a good laugh. The Maine atmosphere is really a perfect place to portray this movie and it attracts you throughout the movie. Not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again, I recommend this 100% of this horror fan!
