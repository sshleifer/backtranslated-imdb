It's great. When I first saw the Japanese version, it was a horrible film I had ever seen. It's not blood and guts, it's strange, atmospheric and terrifying. When Mother gave me a ghost on the couch in the Japanese version, I had a heart attack ... American reform was wrecked, and was concerned that the breeze would fall from the dark creepy little version of the original version. I do not worry. The filmmakers were cleverly associated with the original film of the Japanese, and directed the film. They also set up the same place in Japan. In fact, the Japanese director had a pains to remake the film, only actors of American actors. In fact, the overall purpose of "Strangers in a Strange Land" was added to the whole horror. They are not entirely terrifying and hardhearted ghosts, but they are totally trapped in foreign lands, difficult to unite in society. It was added to the overall agitation built in the movie and it was a wonderful touch. <br /> But Buffy actually does a very good job. She will suffer and she reveals her fear. Such a casual, Smart Allick comments are not for a linear who eliminates the total darkness and horror of the American horror movies or characters' situation. In fact, I'm also good at the ring, and I'm also totally enjoying it. I hope the new horror of the horror of the American horror is starting closer to the Japanese New Wave Ringu's incredible success. We're actually getting movies that are ultimately classified as "horror"! 8/10
