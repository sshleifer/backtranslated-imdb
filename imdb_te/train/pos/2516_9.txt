Based on the idea from Gackt, Moon Child Mallepa was held in the country of poverty that was called. In the futuristic timeline, the story revolves around two main characters, the key (HYDE) and the show (gasket) and their friends. <br /> <br /> Despite some actions, I strongly believe that this is a film about friendship. <br /> <br /> Unlike most bloodthirsty characters, Kai has played a bloodthirsty character, killing to live. A vampire has found friendship with the young man, and he is not afraid of the key. Regardless of what some imagined, I see the key as the father of the father. Kai has been there for the past of Shi's life, he carefully cared for him and taught him to live in a world where the power of Muslims controls their lives. On the other hand, Shao is seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man who grew up with his life as a pleasure and not about games, a sense of death and his beloved. <br /> <br /> "The way they met me is very good, Sun also has a big role in the film, he is a different breeder, <br /> <br /> The actor has played a brilliant role in this movie. <br /> <br /> I believe every actor believes that this is the first time that he appeared in such a big screen. Both acted very well and created incredible characters, rather than the films that the musician turned out and the songs filled with the pictures, they made great acting jobs! The moon's child really had an effect on me, which gave friendships a new meaning and inspection, we should congratulate every friendship of our life This film shows a lot of hopes, th Despite all the bad things that happen in the lives of Ri, there is always hope. Life is violent, it's does not exist anymore. It shows a strong feeling of friendship between each other, even though the son of the enemies, the end of the war is somehow "amusing" Shallow is. One of them eventually replied, no matter how far they were away. The ending scene has shown us.
