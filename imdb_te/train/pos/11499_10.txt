While the show first appeared, I recently chose a DVD set and hoped to do more episodes. This program is the 70s version of the TV series "X-Files" of the poplar 90's. But a bit more of a funny / light hearted approach. But I can not get me wrong, some of these episodes are full of horror themes, most of which have some pretty Greek plots (imaginative-it's the early 70s television). <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit silly and acting, but the charm and attraction of this series. Mystery crime plays, comedies or science fiction / horror themes all combined in this series. Each episode will be clocked in 50 minutes or more (1 hour with commercials), and I always want more than 50 minutes. A great classic show that has been underestimated in my book!
