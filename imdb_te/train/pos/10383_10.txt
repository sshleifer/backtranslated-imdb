In my first year of living in New York, in 1976, I saw this film. I went to live for the next 26 years, but this small TV movie was never seen again and again. This is part of a PBS series I call, and I never forgot. <br /> <br /> "Wife's husband was waiting to take part in the war again and did not seek professional and financial independence." Frances Lee McCain is a wonderful photographer in the role of photographer and The advantages are the same challenging characters spent the next 30 odd years searching for her. <br /> <br /> Does it have a video of this film? Must necessarily leave at least one DVD Yo need?
