I know it's a good end but it's just that honestly. An image ends with a gloomy dark nature, but this time I was really impressed with Darth Vader when I turned against the Emperor. There is a painful sequence in the film when tortured and beaten by Luke Emperor / Darth Sidius. Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of Sith, will be destroyed when his dark master is removed. A good sacrifice. The cinematography of the film is good. I am surprised with all the ships of Rebel Warships and all Imperial WarShips and Super Star Destroyers. I liked the new breed of Mon Kaalomari, Evokes, Land's co-pilot and a lot of people ... My favorite scenes are in the picture: 1-wader destroys Emperor and damages it. 2- Lucky OB-Wan and Yoda's souls and Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (The Great Scene in Star Wars). I personally like Star Wars Best Duel among the Darth Vader vs Luke Skywalker on the script and the Death Star and Endor War presenting the ground and space combat. Post-script: The scene with the slave bikini is memorable. 9/10.
