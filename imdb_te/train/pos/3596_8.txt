I sat in the end and saw the film through the whole route and I was very impressed. Michel Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses --- not only the fact that she is acting, but she chooses the right fit for the role, which is more meaningful and important than what it looks like. I will read some comments that have relieved me of some of the horrific feminism that I felt earlier, but I'm definitely disagreeing. Diana is a feminist. She follows her dreams and the word "feminism" is all about her (except her younger brother and her trainer and manager, Hector, except her father's father) compared to her real father. It's good to see these pictures showing the true side of Feminism - not the people who are losing - but they can dream and do anything. She is still true when Diana is still in love, and has a more realistic, more complicated relationship than she and Adrian's performances. Girlify is a true flavor of reality and it is back to some confidence into my perception of people. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A relatively important film for young women, but everyone wants to go a long way in their lives.
