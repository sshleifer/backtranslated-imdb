Although Tango is close to Gabriel, this year is an outstanding work of art. Director Lampella made a nice little film a few years ago as Raccestine Epoptivoista (I fell in love with a disappointing woman). Joki is truly a Saturday afternoon beautiful picture in a small village / town in real life. Actors are probably not beautiful or beautiful but they do work pretty. I definitely hope many people get the coming spring in the JUSSI statue (football OSCAR). It can also do abroad.
