Image review is different from the version of the version of the story version, as many reviewers here say. I have never seen the Stage version of the story, so I have a favorable review of this film than most other reviewers. Perhaps Richard Attenborough is not the best choice for the film, but this entertaining account is a picture of many dancers who are trying to earn big time on dance dancer Michael Douglas. The film is correct to select any leading actors or performers who shut down in the final trial-out group. In this way we focus our attention on the dancers' movements and personal stories and struggles, as they open up on a marathon day they try. Douglas is also not the best choice for the episode. Apparently some songs were stuck in favor of new and a backstage clip-ridden story of a romantic relationship between a dancer and choreographer was added. I have to say that I am a weak part of the film. The cassie talent and / or luck of repeating infiltrations are often frustrating to be done often during sinking in artistic occupations. However, the past of this film has been dead in the past, and it's interesting to see this tired old shoe kicking up his heel again. The revelations of the dancers started with a good start with the number of "I Can Do That", but the dancers put it short in different places in telling their stories. Frankly, their stories are slightly different from those in real life, and they will never get this chance. *** 4 stars.
