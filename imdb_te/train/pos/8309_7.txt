The movie designed for TV is always good when entertaining like Little Richard. It was a much better movie about the rock and roller story, Little Richard I played earlier, and played a very good job, by Leon, who had never seen before. I have learned much about Richard because of many TV films, it's smaller than what made for a humiliating movie. Instead, we have seen a great deal of worry, it will crack the film and eventually destroy a very good career. Best of all in the film and acting is above average in the TV movie. 10 to 7.
