If you are younger than 13 or 13 and are in a deep dose, you'll enjoy D-War. If you're a fan of all kinds of intellectual action films, you will enjoy the D-War. Otherwise, do not bother! I saw this film with my nephews and their friends 3. They really loved it and made me feel good. After the cinematography, I could not thank all the children (my nephews and their friends) took to the theater. <br /> The CG is cool. Acting and directing are terrible. The storyline is very simple. But since the audience is half a child, they are screaming, shouting and enthusiastic every time the screen is open. <br /> <br /> It is a good film to take your children, but the D-War is frustrating, except for the final battle order. I gave the film 10 to 7 because I liked the kids very much.
