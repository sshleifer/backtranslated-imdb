True, the idea of ​​the TV series Alley McBeell has emerged from the immense success that has also been enjoyed in Germany all over the world. However, Edel & Stark is quite different from Alli Macbell in many ways. <br /> <br /> The two main characters work together. Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Stark (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, It It ???), Felix Edel (Felix Noble) is one of the leading actors in the criminal cases such as sitcom in Berlin and surroundings, the famous actor played by Rebecca Emmanuel. Moreover, they help co-stars with amazing actors, most notably their secretary, Isabel Tuenteren, who is a rare gem with great comic ability. Fredix, Frank's darker wheeler dealer, Otto, and Babu's best friend and room-mate Patricia, works well for the role of Barbara Demer. Happiness to see all Monday nites in all: No wonder the series and its stars have received many prizes. <br /> <br /> I feel that I need to wait to find many episodes.
