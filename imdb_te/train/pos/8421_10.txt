Joseph Van Sternberg directs George of Russia, who finds himself in this wonderful silent film about silent Hollywood and former Imperial General. Emil Jonangs won a well-deserved Oscar for his role in the typical role of a bit in a generally silent film in Russia. The film goes back to his days in Russia, which led to the country's collapse of revolutionaries. William Powell made his first screen debut as Hollywood director. The film was interesting in the fall of Russia and in the early days of the screen behind the scenes was a tinseltown adaptation. Van Sternberg offers another classic, and one that is filled with great elements of romance, intrigue, and tragedy.
