The second series considers some people that Scooby has been destroyed. I totally disagree. Although the quality of the performances went up or down, I won my opinion, pretty much chatterer.i jumpedtheshark.com and 72% said Scrapsy's second series was the cause of Scuba's fall. Yes so loads say yes, but 28% is still incorrect. Most part of the episodes that are focused on the comedy are the same as in the same formula.scrappy, the breath of fresh air to show.sure the same 5 people / dog solving, some people tune out but when the scrappy display is introduced in the DOUBLED.Back Viewing statistics. All parts and departments are very funny. I was witty by the yabba shorts .But at the end of the day if you are the subject of opinion or not the scrappy, there is actually no factor involved. But in my opinion this is a fantastic series of tire which began to show a new formula and lease of life.
