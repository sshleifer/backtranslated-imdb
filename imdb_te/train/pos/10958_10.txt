The show was very ridiculous, and I could not stop seeing marathon in Comedy Central Tonight (I've seen all episodes in the past). I always thought Silverman was a huge talent and it was a vehicle for that talent to finally enjoy the spectacular audience. I saw this presentation and I was laughing at a big time ... I can not tell you about many TV shows ... you? This program is finally new and interesting and (especially) funny! This is a show I will never miss and it is one I will buy on DVD as soon as I get out. You owe it to me to see this event ... I will evaluate for a long time for this series ... And clearly, people who are suffering from this program can not get it ... maybe they intelligence to understand it ... they attack something they do not understand Do not make fools. Silverman argues that anyone who uses the term "bigot", or that she only targets "shock" ... mark off ... she is exactly the opposite; Just Google and she'll soon see you as a huge proponent of her civil rights. If you do not know that all of these terrible angles are contrary to her, you can not get it. And if you do not get it, do the rest for us and be quiet about it, so we can all enjoy happy ...
