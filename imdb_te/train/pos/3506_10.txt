<br /> <br /> Peter Solethe is the locals who live in poverty, or Louiszada, in the lower east of New York. The heart of the solstice is on the right, he examines this extraordinary family, which is typical of the various 'inner cities' of the country. Mr. Sollet develops in favor of his story. This is mainly children who leave good parents, parents and their grandmother is under her wing. <br /> <br /> Not all of his characters have been defeated, but they all look good. These kids are not drugs, or they stole because they are poor. If the story was made by Hollywood, instead of struggling children, they would have seen the process of the usual fools, but the deep inside of them was not lost. <br /> <br /> Victor Russak is the revelation of Victor Vargas. He is natural. So Jolly Marty. Her character shows us a nonsense girl who can not trick us or do anything she does not want to do. Algracecia Guzman, grandmother is amazing. She believes in her maternal trust in her mind, and she can not lead her to the most important. <br /> <br /> For all, this is a wonderful picture for Peter Soltek.
