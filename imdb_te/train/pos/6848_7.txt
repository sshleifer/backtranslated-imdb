Very silly movie, starts with Soft Porn sequence, Ventures into the art gallery farcelike comedy, is a shocker of a discovery in the hotel room then adds a random murder introduction to no obvious reason. It is obvious as the following viewer is unfair that a revelatory "twist" is ending bizarre and surreal (especially the stopwatch scene is amazingly unnecessary) (see the trivia section exactly why it is intentionally unfair). <br /> <br /> The film is endless yet another great detail and over and over as characters in an idiot, ending sequences that go through its path as dangerous to as many groups as possible and view the viewer as nigara - Again just explain what's in the picture. . <br /> <br /> Although there is a pleasure to see the whole picture of the female characters in the restaurant scene at the end of the restaurant scene, there is a pleasure to see the whole movie: despite its very many flaws, the whole package works just fine.
