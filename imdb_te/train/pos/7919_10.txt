During the 1950s romance tour with his father (Ed McMahon) The "Full Moon Hai" shot by young Tony Walker (Adam Orkin) is intended to be a fully campy joke. Sure enough, Tony bites, and when a full moon furry and fangs increase. <br /> <br /> The special feature of the film is that he does not age as long as he has a wolf curse and if he has spent twenty years he will have to fulfill a task. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is just fun funny once it's up to you. Ed McMahon's role is over patriotic rights wing Yahoo (he thinks he heard Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars's coach / principal a long time couple, and then more. Most eye-opening cast members Dend Wilson - reminiscent of Lamont in "Sanford and Son" - got a big surprise as a bus driver. But perhaps the funniest scenario is changing the presidents; Gag was really impressed with Gerald Ford! Anyway, this is a real treat. Alan Arkin, who plays a Jane psychiatrist - won the Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his sons, and I'm surprised if he remembers the pair in the film (from Adam to his son Anthony is also a minor character). Very funny. <br /> <br /> PS: Larry Cohen is the title of the killer baby's film "It's Alive".
