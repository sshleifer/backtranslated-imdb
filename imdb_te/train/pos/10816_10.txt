No, this can not be a high budget brightness, but it is brilliant in its own right. If you look for what it does, he holds a 12-inch love rod that keeps flapping in stride and has a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist. Those who come to give this film a lesser review will probably say they're looking for the next culture classic or hidden "gem" and just do not have much there. I am pointing out that everyone is "a 5 per cent baby attached to a fish pole". I did not think they would have a film with a budget that could have "good" actors or effects. guts and lavas are actually quite acceptable. The film is a bit choppy going from sequence to sequence, but overall it is one of the movies I've seen, which does not follow any trend or speculation. Very nice for a laugh.
