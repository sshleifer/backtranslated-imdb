Surprisingly, this film has never been to a big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for a video release. Where my expectations are not high, they are disappointed. Ang Lee has always had all the wonderful acting, intelligent and exciting story that you guessed right up to the ultimate and exciting filming. <br /> <br /> The people who expect something along Mel Gibson's line in the Patriot (Brownhart) or Braveheart (acceptable) are people. Depression, all others who will appreciate the above mentioned features will have a wonderful time looking at it. 9 out of 10
