Not surprisingly, the film is neutral in the direction of the US due to the nature and origin of filmmakers. Perhaps most of the 'anti-sect' segment comes from Ken Loach, and the British New Labor Party does not necessarily take the line. The events that took place a year ago were surprising for most Americans and many audiences, yet appeared live by CNN. The authors and directors chose to show that the tragedy is not American Monopoly. Does this surprise anyone in the same way that 3,000 deaths were given to the West of Wales, Tutu, Tamil, Bosnian, Chile and Kurdish (what we need for the victims)? If it call a 'awakening' for the States, then the Israeli / Palestinian road journalist Bush Jnr in the next 12 months is more equally tragic than a solution. He will take revenge without changing the world into a safe place. I am surprised by many contributors who have found the idealism of the Founding Fathers and now look at its self-interest paramount to determine why to build the US like freedom, justice and tolerance, but the third world wonders come from the next drink, lunch or bullet.
