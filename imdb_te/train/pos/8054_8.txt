"Entering Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial arts I have had a chance to see. Sammo Hung plays a Chinese boy boy who has come to visit a Chinese friend. Just like the Tang Lung of "Dragon Way". Samo is the place where he went, so he must have his martial arts skills to solve conflicts. Fortunately, the Sammy character learns martial arts by imitating and imitating his idol, Bruce Lee. He bruce Lee strokes his nose in the same way and releases his scratching house. He also uses nunchucks in the scene. It's like watching fat Bruce Lee. At the end of the film with foreign fighters is a great showdown. Samo has to face each opponent. <br /> <br /> It is one of the first movies I saw in Sammo Hung Movies Movies. "I saw. Exciting fighting scenes and very laughing. A rare classic Sammy Hung Film I recommend for all you martial arts fans out there. 8.5 / 10!
