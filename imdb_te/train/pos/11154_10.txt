In my opinion, it is one of the greatest films in the United States, and it has won each award and is ranked at the AFI Top 100 list (although it is very low in the IMDB Top 250 list, only 183 of this work). If you enjoy the highest carrier (Wait and Hoffman a fantastic match), well-drawn journalists and innovative direction, editing and cinematography, I've loved so far. At the end of the 60th decade of New York City's New York City, a clear, always credible film comes to Schlesinger, and many people living on the 42nd Street 42nd Street's denial, poverty and despair. Where filmmaker techniques are experimentally extracting the feel of the underground New York film movement (and city) and are less than dazzling. Many ideas stolen by other filmmakers (such as caricature, voice-over flashbacks, pharmaceutical / trip scenes and cartoonish face and murder scenes) <br /> Relationships between Joe and Racso have an exceptionally strong friendship or homophobic underpinning Stay organized. I do not have time for director censorship, but I want to put his powers on the importance of a strong human connection in life, without sexual or sexual relations. >> If Midnight Cowboy did not see it, you're really missing on true American classics, over the years it's definitely a brave, moving picture of the lost size, effect and importance of the impact. I would recommend this picture to everyone. <br /> Score: 10 out of 10.
