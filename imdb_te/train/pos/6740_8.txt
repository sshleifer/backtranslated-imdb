The main character's main role is the role of the observer in the path of police and self-destructive morale from his past, which is obvious to the viewer in 1950. <br /> <br /> In addition to the haunting music and well-written story, the film is the best example of Nair Noir. Danny's eyes are close and Carl Malden has become his master, he is unsatisfied, but there is also a compassion for those in his command. <br /> <br /> Otto Primer made this kind of film about his own. If there is any mistake, it will take the beauty of Jean Tirnei, where the space is unusual with the hardened cap. Their scenes in the cafe are, however, wonderful and true to the ring. <br /> <br /> Tom Tally is perfect as Gary Merrill Hood in the bit of her father. Great lighting and mood setting. The worst things are the most atmospheric building, I love the old woman in the basement. <br /> 10 to 8.
