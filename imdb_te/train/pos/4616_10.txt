The title of the film is derived from a party game called "Seven Minutes in Paradise". The game gained popularity among my husband's friends when he was at junior high school in Brooklyn, NY, and he describes things like "spin-the-bottle", "lifesaver relay" and other early kissing games. According to the rules, the name of a boy and a girl is drawn, and the people who have chosen were in a dark room and ordered to stay there for seven minutes. At the same time, there are speculation among party guests regarding the nerves that two guests are hand-holding, embracing and / or kissing each other in privacy. At the end of seven minutes, the leader of the game "Time Up" or the door should cope with the door, and the pair will emerge from the room. After questioning by other guests, they have to accept what they did during their "Seven Minutes in Heaven". Then all the other couples will be selected to enter the room. <br /> <br /> Such sports have acted as social "ice breakers" for children and young people, but they may feel embarrassed and intimidated by people who are shy. . The film was given to this title because it is for the first time that young people deal with experiences and romantic love.
