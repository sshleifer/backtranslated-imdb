SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt that the end was a bit abrupt. When I returned, I saw the crew adjusted to live on earth. I can not imagine what the authors have predicted, and at the beginning of the episode some Voyager "pre-loading" in the range of land. (Of course, the time line was eradicated, so it all mutt.) How I like Admiral Janway who died for Voyager crew. As fans, we have our cake and get it to eat, by Janeway live through both the ultimate sacrifice. I agree that I can dive into Javagal and her old self-communication conversations awkwardly and easily into the camp. Fortunately, Malgue (s) pulled it out.
