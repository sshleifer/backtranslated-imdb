"The Shooter" is a different kind of film for Michael Dudikoff. Although it is commonly associated with a mix of martial arts, the film is Western because he has enabled some formula to show that he is a far more capable actor than any of the story lines. <br /> <br /> The main problem is, of course, the film does not allow any solid character development. Meat is really left to the viewer. We're the real name of Michael Atherton, a killer who is a killer, a small town in mind, a frightening local heroine who is afraid of a local shooter, a shooter who feels like we are only a victim.
