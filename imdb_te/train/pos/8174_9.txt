I love this movie. As a kid, this is one of the first movies I've seen. Sure, it's light now, but in the back day, it's awesome. Dentalists are so much afraid, so why do not killer killer about the dentist? It's cheesy, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it's awesome. And I always have love for medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen plays Dr. Feinstone, no one could have done it well. And for the low-budget horror film, the effects and are great too. And I also love the theme music, it goes well with the image. Ken Forn (Dawn of the Dead) also plays a nose policeman in this case and works best. There is a fair amount of blood, and some really cool violence / death scenes. Check it out!
