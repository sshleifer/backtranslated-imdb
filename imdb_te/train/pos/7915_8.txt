It is called "by time" by more than 300 artists by computer animation. At the end of the 80s and released in the 1990s, this was cutting edge stuff today. <br /> <br /> There are not many feelings in small scenes, but only in other forms, but it's fun to watch. It's all about stories, not really about any narrative. There are some strange scenes in which odd-looking men- animals will dance around the birds. It's all new then the computer is animated which is animated. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br It's a chance to showcase technology.What words, with just electronic music? <br /> <br /> It's a nice, secret 40 minutes of "eye candy" and "head candy." It may have been affected by today's CG effects, but you It is still considered fun.
