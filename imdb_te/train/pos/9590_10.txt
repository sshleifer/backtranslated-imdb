The documentary begins in NYC in 1986, where black and Spanish drag queens have "balls". Wherever they are, they like to strut and vote their audience before the audience. We have learned many members and see how they work together and how they support each other. One man tells another - "There are three attacks against you - you are black, gay and drag queen". These people (sin) are not accepted in society - only balls. There they are who they are and what they want and accept. Then the film will be reduced three years later (1989) and see how things have changed (for some tragedies). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many interviewed people are very fun and get a lot of humor from their circumstances. They are well aware of their place in society and accept humor - they must. They live in "houses" that are run by different "moms" and we all find that everyone is helping them. <br /> <br /> When the film came in 1990, the controversial - and big hit. It won the Best Documentary Awards in many festivals - but was not nominated for an Academy Award. The reason for their "black and Spanish drag queens is not the academy material". Not lovely? Homophobia and racism all together. <br /> It is still a great film - and a piece of time. It's no longer like - they're no longer NY. The balls are still maintained, but not in the spirit looking here. Even drag community became more "accepted" (better or worse). And the houses I've heard have gone too far. It is sad. I know where these characters are now - I know I'm dead with AIDS but I do not know about others. What happens to the age of 13 and 15 years old? <br /> Still, it's one of the kind of documentary - lovely, funny and inspiring. All the way to see! Where is a definite 10. DVD ???
