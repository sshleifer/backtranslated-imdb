I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny, sexy, painful, and warm. Andy MacDowell's performance is nuanced and vulnerable. Still, McDowell's film director did not create another role in the film. The romance between Kate and her young man is lovely to see and plays well. Her relationship with her friends is a thorn and a balm in her life. Imldda Stallion, who is an MVP in most British films, works great in this regard. There is some sadness in this regard, but I think it will be saved by the end of the film, with excellent performances, good direction and witty works. The quality of the film is excellent and the music is fine, but the sound track is not available.
