This is the title because it is a shame that the film can be avoided by people who hate football. Bend It Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports film. The storyline was touted by heartless and intellectuals, jokes smiled and the characters acted well. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are exciting as youngsters Jess and Jules putting great performances on both the pitch and off. Anupam Kher Jess's frightened father, and a brilliant bad guy like Jonathan Rice-Meyers in 'Devil Ride', sees his handsome Irish accent perfectly as a good man for a time! See this movie if you do not like football. If anything, you make a smile.
