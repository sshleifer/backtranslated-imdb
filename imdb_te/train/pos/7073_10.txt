One of the great movie I have seen this year. Perhaps probably before the sun rises, it's also late in the lob at night. I like the idea of ​​portraying our weakness against man's free will and destiny. James and Catherine have previously failed destination and an indescribable grief. I'd end up. But there is a big question. <br /> Last view of the airport. José was again sent back to meet James with future scientists. He told scientists that he already had his message and knew someone else could spread the virus. When Catherine told James, the two together met Katrina. Goin's assistant. So it also gets the real information about the virus, Jose (who does James see him at that time?) And he has teeth. So why does everything still happen ?? Do the prophetic scientists do nothing after the truth is revealed? My big question after the movie ...
