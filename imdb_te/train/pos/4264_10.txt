I saw this film twice or more and it looked very good! The WWII ended up with the latest and the so-called "cold war" began. Hence, the film is one of the best "campaigns" for the Americans, one of the Patriotic films, and the second, creating "Western Nato Block" for the upcoming threat. The film celebrates the United States for centuries and is heading towards the already existing war. Nice and funny Columbus explains the discovery of the American continent and describes the purchase of New Amsterdam's "episode" and the purchase of Manhattan from a drunken local Indian .. It is at least once promoted by fashion for curiosity)! :)
