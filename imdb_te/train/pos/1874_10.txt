Everyone will see this movie because everyone can break in some way and this can help us understand 1) My life is not as bad as I think, and 2) how important it is to take a child when needed. There are so many. To be sure that we are actually based on a genuine person, we always have a glimpse of life and the world. Corruption, but corruption does not reach your home. All of us have a choice! Certainly this is a recommendation ... when you're at it, I want to throw in "Color Purple" and "Woman, Your Art Loss" by TD Jakes <br /> <br /> These are the films based on all lives and give us a glimpse of life.
