If I did not add to the characters in Henry Fool, I would probably like this movie. I do not care for those who have never seen Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> This makes the film moving in the movie. There are a lot of humorous movements and the film certainly has Hart's trademark humor and rhythm of dialogue. For all, it's just the beginning of a technically well-made film and the new fans of Hartley. For older fans who love his previous works like trust and enthusiasm, the film can go any way. I have mixed feelings about the film and Hurtley's later films. Hartley makes his stories better, in small situations, focusing on intimate and remarkable ways of interacting with each other. In the late 90s and since then, his films expanded in the range of subject matter. Mass Media in No Such Thing, Religion in Life Book and Now Terrorism in Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> I do not know if Hartley's talent is big enough or he can justify it. <br /> Surprisingly, the film can still reduce intimate relationships, the woman who loves her husband. The only problem is, I've seen Henry Fool and everyone seems to be out too much of the character in this movie. You can tell that the film was written long after Henry Fool's sequel was complete without any purpose. However, terrorist plots conveniently dare to use Henry's Confessions' books as a magquive (in the Hitchcakian sense). <br /> <br /> Who is Fay as a person in Henry Fowl? <br /> <br /> In contrast to those who neglected a man in Henry Fowl, Fay's impulses induced Henry to fully inspire the plot needs. It is true for the characters in Henry Fool and it does not work straight into the straight forward thriller. Hartley's method of bigger items like terrorism is very sarcastic and interesting. It works and does not work at the same time. Depending on what you have done on Hartley's work, I can tell you how much you love Hurtley's work or hate it. Fans of Henry Fool have been severely warned about despair. Welcome to Hall Heart's world for the rest and enjoy the ride.
