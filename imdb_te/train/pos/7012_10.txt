A tear jerker is definitely a "good feeling" film. All actors are always excellent and like Will Smith, does the job and does well. I have gone but I will choose any 10 "10" ratings and they're better than what I have said. <br /> <br /> However, since I have at least 10 lines to post a comment, I do not know Rosario Dawson as a viewer. She is very happy with acting and I look forward to acting in many films. <br /> <br /> In this film, Will Smith did not prove anything to prove his ability to act.
