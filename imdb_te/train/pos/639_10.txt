A good family performance with great actors of these actors. It's a nice break from the late reality show Blitz. Currently it is not a favorite on television, since it also has a teen lead, except that the Zone of Arcadia is similar. The clubhouse has a look as Jeremy Sapphire likes the main character (Pete Young) and gives the simplicity of a sweet and undoubtedly simplicity. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Winningham and Kirsten Storms surround the main cast members, and everyone is fantastic in their role. I really like Kirsten Storms as Peter's sister Betsy's; She is a very pill, but she still cares about her mother and brother, even though she hates to show it. It can really take some episodes to find the legs, but the Clubhouse is easily one of the best performances that came along a good period, so check it out - you'll be happy!
