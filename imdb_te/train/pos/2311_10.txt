Reese Witherspoon's first film. Loved it. Top lyricism and acting. You are emotionally involved with the characters. <br /> <br /> You will see why Reese Witherspoon is doing well with his acting career. <br /> <br /> Other cast members are also doing a great job. <br /> <br /> The movie flows very well. The whole picture is not a boring moment. The man in the moon's length is correct. <br /> As I said before, I think the film is excellent. I saw many times, and I saw everyone.
