Although it is obviously a low budget product, it is worth watching the shows and songs in the film. One of the few musical characters of Walken until date. (He was an excellent dancer and singer and he performed his acrobatic skills - look for Cartwheel!) Also starring Jason Canary. A great children's story and most loved characters.
