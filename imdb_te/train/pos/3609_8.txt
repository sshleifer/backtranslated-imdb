I went to Wal-Mart and discovered the movie on DVD and did not think I was bad or good. This is the result of watching the whole movie from beginning to end. Michelle Rodr√≠guez, (Diana Guzman), "Blood Rainne", '05, gave a great performance and she is a real study in the art of how beautiful, sexy, and acting at the same time really performing. Diana did not like her own life for the abuse she gave to her mother, especially her father. She decides to get boxing training in the local Brooklyn Gym and is not well received by male boxers. She has a lot of confrontation between her classmates and boys in high school. There are many references to women's bathroom and private parts of the boys. If you like boxing and see hot sexy gal, you can do wonders in the ring and you guys will beat them, you know what it is.
