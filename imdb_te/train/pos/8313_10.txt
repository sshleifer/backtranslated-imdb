First of all, I think it is disadvantageous to comment below to comment below. Apparently you do not taste and you do not respect the taste of others. I do not give you a history lesson but I think it should be done. Black actors are not just like others but are not successful. If you are not part of the "black" race, you can not understand the quality, creativity and enthusiasm of older movies such as "Spark" and "Mahogany" and "Coolie Hai". Unfortunately, because you are not black, you do not have the feeling that we can feel when you look at these classics, so you have to keep your mouth shut and adhere to your dance-dancing breed. Thank you.
