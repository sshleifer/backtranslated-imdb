This may be directed by someone with more experience. Shulin has not done a bad job but it's not a great work of cinema art. <br /> This is a beautiful picture. Since I used to show local channels, I liked it. Graham Green is one of my favorite writers of the past century. Some bad movies have been made from his novels and stories. (Many love "The Fallen Idol" but I'm not in them I saw "Brighton Rock" many years ago and liked it but I'm thinking of the novel's love). Charles Boyer is not, it's true, come across Spanish. He is tired, careful and attentive - but he has a perfect temper for this character. Lauren Baccal is attractive to him as a British girl. But the support players are the best: Katina Paxinou is amazing. Her performance was a little grand gignon, but I gave that to the director. <br /> <br /> "She comes across an unhealthy start-up young man, and the character wants to be helpful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
