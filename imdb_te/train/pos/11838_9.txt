This is one of the most peaceful, relaxing and beautifully animated films I've ever seen. With the beautiful music throughout the film, sounds and music are thought to be in the picture! This film is great in children, but adults too. It teaches your lessons, you do not forget who you are, and your mind will be swayed, courageous and courageous. This movie can be screwed up at times, which is always a good touch on cinemas. This movie is funny, sad, beautiful, and puts your seat on the edge! Some movies really give you a mess feeling after seeing them, and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my vote 9/10 stars for an amazing idea for animation, music, and an image, I gave myself a whole lot of soul!
