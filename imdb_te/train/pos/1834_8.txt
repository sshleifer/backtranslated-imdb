This film is very touching. I do not care what people are saying about this film, this is a good movie. Amitabh Bachchan's dad's characters dying is good, because he taught his son how to act in some way, Akshay Kumar is the greatest in the role of Aditya Thakur in his role. The supporting role of Shefli Shetty, played by Sumitra Thakur, is amazing. Priyanka Chopra is good in his small role in the film. Rampal Yadav is a brain-dead servant and has a very good connection as a father in the show of Bonanah Irani and the comedy scene is a pleasure. The direction is pretty good.
