A random encounter between a salesman and a hitman changes their lives. It's an impressive effort for the whimsical film, the author-director Shepard. In a grim role from James Bond, Brosnan is a lone hitman who can make his job under pressure, and can not connect to someone mentally to deal with him. Kinnear is perfectly balanced as a seminal figure, a vacant fellow in his life. It is good that Davis Kinnear's affectionate wife. Mainly studying a character, the film is fresh and unpredictable, because it is a very dark comedy concept.
