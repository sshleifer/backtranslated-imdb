I love Sabrina the Teenage Witch and have seen every episode. While I was sitting at 6pm every night and waited at Nickloddon, the show went downhill when Sabrina left High School. She should have the best range when she's friends with Valerie (which I'm not sure). The next series (friends with Dreama) from there is still very good, but it does not look right when she left high school. Although all the major characters are not old-fashioned "forgetful", although the first series in Sabrina College is still good and visually appealing, her aunt's holiday and Sabrina moves are not right for their home. She is no longer a teenager, so the show's name is not correct and this program is not right without Hilda and Zelda and Josh, especially Sabrina, who marries a man who is almost unharmed. Thanks to the goodness he got in the last five minutes of the last episode she took away. All I still love to see the old episodes of Sabrina Teenage Witch, but I think the authors took too long and left it to leave Sabrina High School. After that the show definitely lost some of its magic
