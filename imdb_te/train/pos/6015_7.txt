In the early 1970s, many of us who accepted heartfelt hippie / acid / alternate culture realize that we are not going to change our mainstream society. I want this picture "What now?" Many people I felt at that time thought. <br /> When do we go to the commune and create our own vision of utopia or do we work for the modalities and modification? <br /> <br /> For the police from vintage gestures, the radical rhetoric, Pink Floyd's music making love in the desert and explosive pictures - there's a lot. It captures a very important moment at the moment.
