First things first! This is not an action movie even though it's a lot of action! I can compare to American sports movies! The team of very bad players can not win the unexpected and win the tournament beyond a game or expectation! In this case it's not about football or baseball, but taekwondo! Initially this street thugs seem good for nothing! But soon we can not have thugs and realize that in reality we can do something in life! Good to see them fighting and training! I was amazed how funny this film was! From the beginning to the end you laugh off your pants! Young Korean actors are very convinced! Let's see this amazing feel good movie!
