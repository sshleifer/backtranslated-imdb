I wholeheartedly agree with the comments so far. I mentioned this documentary as the most exciting and informative I have ever seen. As I mentioned earlier, I remember starting out, it's just another nature study - interesting, not necessarily unique, but I'm very wrong. Only the story of the colony is not amazing, but it is a great attraction to recall music. I remembered exactly that, it was native Native American pumps (supplemented with music at the end of One Flu over the Cookies Nest). I'm also looking for a copy. It needs to be seen by anyone, especially schools. It should be re-released.
