It was the second remake of the film that was filmed in 1911 and 1918. In many ways, Oxford AT a Yank, reminds me of the next film. Both films are one of the high schools of the world and two, ultimately, slowly learn about the teamwork and decency about how hard blow is concerned, a conceited blow is hard. In this movie, William Hines plays "Tom Brown" and his main rival, "Bob" by Francis X Busman. And, in the supporting role is Jack Pickford - always remembered by Mary's brother. Among the three men, Piquedford is the best one, Tom's palpable loser - he really has some good scenes and dramatic time before the Big Game! There are all standard clippings and cinemas, because many times before and after, because it offers some surprises. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Harold Lloyd's The Fernman - for the better silent college film, it is clearly more interesting to the football scenes and sympathetic than Harold's much-loved annoying Tom Brown. Freshman probably you can find from college image. Harvard AT BROWN is the least reason that William Hines is a never-for-nothing and dishonest character with the same plot, and more (as well as WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET) have seen one of these movies, you see them. Well made, but definitely not original! <br /> <br /> Because one of his other films is just a rehash, given a picture of 10 a score someone is advised to watch these other movies. <br /> 4/25/08 == This small movie I have checked and seen is the highest rated film in IMDB since 1920! Talk about over-rated! There are dozens and dozens of movies that have been improved - it's estimated how the movie is # 1.
