More movies like psychological analysis, but psycho makes a good sound like a title. A man with a motion picture (if you make the storyteller) describes images in its own way. Most of them are classics, but they are all listed here in IMDb and I strongly advise you to see them (especially Hitchcock Movies, Solyaris, Dialogue & Lynch Movies), because Slavoj Zizek refers to them! <br /> <br /> In other words, he can ruin them for you. I do not remember if he's spared much more than I've listed (I think Chaplin movies), but if I wrote you all of them would be the best of it! The IMDb listing does not have a picture, I've reported them so it can get up there too quickly. It's a Mag Ryan film, but it's not a big deal, but it's just a brief snippet. <br /> If you open up to see what you see, Jejez's views and opinions are silly and fun to hear. Another angle (even if your favorite movie will ruin a bit ... it will not do it, but it does)!
