The whole thing keeps guessing over how you end up with a one-do it's more enjoyable than anything else or suspense story. <br /> <br /> And it is, Cain and Michael have been able to do some kind of reincarnation of Michael Caine and Laughs Oliver Slade - the most unusual skill player has ever been a skill and a lot of puzzles. <br /> <br /> When you intimidate yourself, it's hard to write a review about the outcome and the plot. Initially we know what you need to know about this film. Michael Caine is a highly energetic playwright whose latest play has failed miserably. When a young enthusiastic writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sent the manuscript of his game, Cain realized that he could solve his problems as his own problem and get his reputation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From that point on, <br /> <br /> Cain and Reeve are experimented with each other, a powerful dynamic tension for everyone. <br /> <br /> Summing: Well worth seeing - but not happy with ending everyone.
