I know I've already entered this film festival (or at least I feel like I'm making it) but I want to get the "Best Animated Short Film" in each of them. Bravo. I can not wait for the full picture. I realized that this is often not heard due to the extreme nature of your animations, but now listen to it and accept it as truth. Kudos, my friend. Okay, now I'm trying to get the text of the ten lines ... although I still understand. And here comes another show - I can not stop here yet. This is very annoying and yet at the same time I have nothing good to do. In fact, I still see all of your movies in another spasmodic "Jason Steel Marathon". <br /> I have a lot of people
