After watching the next Action Star Reality TV series, I was happy to see the winners' film soon. I demonstrated new talent, but I was surprised and surprised. Billy Jane, of course, his usual great self, but Karin and Sean held their own beside him. Jared and Jean (also from the competition) are also good to watch their guest appearances. Sean's role, not Billy's, is predatory, and his frustration in learning new rules in the game is played well. She is courageous because she seeks the love of Corinna Sean and is in it for money. I liked how much the game played for the last second. And then beyond! Not a great movie, but an entertaining one way and a great show for both folks for the first time out of the gate.
