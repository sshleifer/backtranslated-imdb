This movie is very fun. The cast is very good, and I'll make a comment the second before I mention - Glenn Quinn is the best and he has enough reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of songs by "Beyond Gravity", but this is not really a surprise. This film is produced by VH1. If you do not like soft rock / pop music, you can flash up those scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot of the band trying to earn the top spot in LA, the way too many barriers are not very original, but quite entertaining, some surprising plots will change here and there.
