It is a great episode of reunion, band and justice. From the contraction to the conclusion, Clark has made an important criticism from a troubled young man who is willing to put his emotions to a superman, Superman, his super prince, and save all the planet. This is not just a breathtaking story about teamwork, loyalty, and friendship; It is more important in life and also a lesson for Clark. I did not want to finish this series, but the next episodes would be fulfilled without any "rewind" without any "rewind" and the good end of Smallville - Superman's fantastic start. <br /> In this episode, however, we need to see more contrast between the leaks and the team. Nine stars must give enough credit.
