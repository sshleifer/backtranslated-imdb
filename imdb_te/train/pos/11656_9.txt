I've seen a couple movies eating disorders but this is definitely one of my favorites. Other ones problem is that people with eating errors just automatically get better or they accept and accept the fact that they need it. The movie is the most realistic reason for me to feel that the main character Lexi is not automatically improved. She is better and there is a later error. I saw that the film is much better than others, it's very hard, it's very hard work, it's a long way to recovery. This film shows everything. There should be more movies like this.
