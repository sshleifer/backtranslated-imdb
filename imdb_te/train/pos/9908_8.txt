God blesses 80 lucrative images of God. It's a fun, pleasant movie. There are dark films in this movie. Now horror films do not just say sharp movies. This goes on: These stupid jacks and cheerleaders are selected by a high school, and then one of their pranks is a terrible mistake. Joker / Jester mask (pretty creepy, I can add), revenge and revenge, marty begins to kill these teens a year later, having their old abandoned high school reunion. Is this primarily plot? What's wrong with this? It's the beauty of the 80's slasher movies, most of them I would say. Many things are very ridiculous, but when they go you will get a 'much more. <br /> <br /> It's a few outrageous murders, and some are very creative. (Can a beer can poison, acid bath, I can not remember a javelin that I used never before in any other slasher image) It's really a fun, fun movie. That's it. Never forget the fact that the characters are full idiots, their stupidity is never minded, and never mind the outrageous, random things happening in this film. The ability to control the lights by the killer (if he does not change any buttons, you see it) and the toilets come out of the blood, the hives can bathe, you can bathe your fun! <br /> <br /> These films represent 80's slashers because it really makes fun of what. Such movies can not be repeated, why do you know? It's no longer 80. So you can save them for whom they are good! <br /> <br /> There are also a kick donkey villain in the film, and Marty Rongzhen. The confused, the plaintiff, was killed in the craziest joster's murder of his old enemies. A good villain makes a good slasher. Simone Scudamore committed suicide shortly after the release of Slater High. The film alone adds something creepy, and it sticks with and it also makes you feel sorry for Marty's character, I guess. All in all, great 80s slashers fun! It's a shame that never again ...
