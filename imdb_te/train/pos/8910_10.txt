Most of the Atomic Age monster I saw as a child in television, and some of them, BLOB also covered me in the daytime. Movies like INVADERS from MARS make it all very clear "small fry" when it comes to things like Homeworld invading things that kids just are not trustworthy; BLOB just reaffirms the fact. I was deeply impressed by the evening spent on the floor, such as body snatches and martin invaders and blobs entering a unsuspecting society. In the early 1980s, there was a summer when a local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) ran an atomic age class every weekend. This 16mm images and very black and white (and no projector sounding), and BLOB's "color" print deteriorated to a thicker pink- but, man, it is fun. I was like my mother, and she enjoyed it as much as I did. It's in the Science Museum, and I really fell in love with BLOB. The intent of the filmmaker is to earn money, but it is related to "talents" (players) from filmmakers, which I love in the film. Corny? You bet. Cheesy? They can not get any cheesy. But, man, what a movie!
