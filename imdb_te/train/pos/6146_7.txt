Perhaps Disney was hoping for another Mary Papins but it was a different story and her great Julie Andrews was a very different performer when Angela was delighted. Lancebury claims that it offers complete cast and magical performance. There is something she does not understand well about her character and she is superbly supported by David Tomlinson. Tomillin carries a tune but he certainly does not quite chop as a singer. It does not matter who he is a gifted actor you rarely notice. Radi McDowell has once again played great roles from many actors, who are the winners, and Tessie Ocea is very small but it is better to look back at the old time. Sam Jaffe and the English television star Bruce Forsyth's king are also appealing to the small roles. Score beautiful songs, especially the Bryant Sea and The Believe Not Believing. A large number of portals extends to the road limit, but it has the most theatricality. The effects appear today a bit cliche but the scene of the German invaders is pretty impressive as the brutal army attacked the film. Children are not as annoying as other movies but a little boy makes a fight to understand what's going on. I love the marching song of the home army. The home guard is very important to Britain and it is a warm tribute. The animation is happiest, better than Pixar which I find strangest. A warm happy picture and its a miracle did not go on stage.
