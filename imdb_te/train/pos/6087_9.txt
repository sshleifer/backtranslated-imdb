I watched the film in the first weeks of the week, (I did not remember exactly when) that was meant to be a good film for Ben Stiller. This film is not a good man without a good humor. You'll have to think about them as Ben Stiller's jokes. As you say, you have good humor. From a couple of people on this website I see that it's not good to say about it and that it did not get a good rating, but I gave this movie a bigger one, this film is good and I should have got a better rating. Maybe this is not a movie for you. I give another person feedback.
