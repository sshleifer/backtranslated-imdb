The film is amazing and I would recommend the same for baby and adults alike. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is attractive; American studios are much better than those produced at that time. However, there are two conditions for this statement. Disney studied the studio Gribley back catalog and took it to the butcher. My main point, although the original English version was great, Disney reunited this movie. New actors wrecked it with Van der Beck and others, and avoided the characters' appeal, e.g. Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous colleagues to Wyno Young. The original music score is much better than the Disney Remix. Why did Disney make such changes? Disney can make more money by Van der Beck and cast, even if it is appropriate, in that process they tap the film. This is still a beautiful picture and I still recommend it to anyone. My main beef disney was ruined from a movie I loved and still love. I'm lucky to have the original Japanese import, which is now going to guard my life!
