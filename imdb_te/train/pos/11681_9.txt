Several reviews and comments that I read about this film say that this is a long-awaited film and performance rather than by Clara Bow. Although Clara's next engagement is rather distinct from story-line, I found that I still had some heart-confusion and a lot of fun. Clara plays a happy-lucky hockey girl who does nothing to win a man who loves her ... This man is married! Clara's modesty's day is astonishing, but I believe the sweetness and the fun of the movie is fun. Definitely not a fantastic story line (very distinctive, indeed), this film is a good performance of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
