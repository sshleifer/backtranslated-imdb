I got the first Bill and Ted movie for Christmas and I had to get a second when I saw in a shop. This is the first but very hilarious story is just funny (I think). It is funny how they got their own person hell and how they came to play death. The funny thing is that they played him in stupid mini-games like clue. The only thing I want to change is the station and death band, but it's not the other one.
