I love this show and my 11 year old daughter and I love watching together. It teaches good old fashion values ​​in a fun, adventurous and fun way (though somewhat imaginable story). <br /> I have set my DVR to record the episodes and I know when I have done it. Hold the tail end of an episode (before the first one ... I do not know what it's episode) but a definitive Terrible sequencing mistake! <br /> <br /> Adam Sheriff had a small garment of coffee "leather" when she tried to quit him and some of them broke out of an illegal coat, I think. <br /> <br /> With the stone coat, he laid it on his desk and put the cloth on the right where it was crushed from it. This cloth is exactly rectangular ... I think it's almost impossible to cut from the leather piece (Nagaihaiday after the 1950s? Yes Leather? I do not think so). <br /> <br /> After 10 seconds in the scene, again looking at the coat, we still fall on the roy desk. But this time the cloth is more similar to the shape of North Carolina and is now completely different on the coat (but still perfectly equal to the hole in the coat) and the seam (smack-dub cloth in the middle) is now a seam in the coat. Our daughter has enjoyed a lot of laughs, we will again see a small scene and enjoy again! <br /> We still love the show completely and make sequencing errors fun!
