In any of the movies, Nicholas Cage is a strong, silent hero, Dennis Hopper as a homicidal man, Lara Flynn Boyle as Wump / Trump, and finally JT. Walsh heavily. These four characters are characters that can play in their sleep, and they often see them playing the boundaries in exactly the clich√©. Hence, John Doll, the master of fetching a lot of mood of a short act, is no relief to direct this nuanced Nailrush Thriller. Hopper maintains that he does not get to the top, while Cage shows a little deeper than his usual-surface action heroes, Boyle turns out to be innocent, innocent and scheming, and the hard iron of a person's soul to Wayne. Dale's direction gives the Big Sky a sense of the nation's vacuum, where the story takes place, which refers to any drastic change in the wrinkled shirt. The plot turns are top notch, and one of the other great turns of this film is that the supporting characters actually work if they have brains. Smaller vessels like deputy sheriff do not have more brains than their heads. But with a director as smart as Dull, you should not be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this film. A wonderful picture.
