I'm a huge fan of Saymerier, Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous (not big on singles) to say safely to see Cameron Crow's awaiting his name. I say that this is a very unusual image for Vanilla Sky and I'd love to see if I look forward to something like Crowe's other films. Well, after seeing it, say the former is correct, and the second is not more wrong. This is a very unusual image, and nothing really comes together until the end. Anyone you see coming halfway in this film can not be distinguished from you or distinguished from their memory. However, the film is Stellar, and I look forward to receiving it as soon as the DVD is released. I was moved by the picture, and felt the emotional cost through the end. If the director allowed him into the platform, an experience drawn from the entire spectrum of human emotions to the viewer. In the theater I saw in the movie, more than a few people have been lost and it was frustrated when they found that they did not return to the plot. I'm sure others do not have the ability to properly follow any movie. I'm not a pumpy sound, but some are more cut for Seagal, Chan, Van Dumme movies, and these films can not enjoy the movie. It is very cerebral, so make sure you're prepared for a two-hour mental bender, and do so after much thought. <br /> <br /> It is very similar to the other crores of the film, which at least one of the Crowe films, the soundtrack itself is the character of itself. This is almost the case with Crowe's long time music, as they are familiar to the most famous, and his marriage to Hearty actor Nancy Wilson. It is also worth noting that there is a definite chemistry between Tom Cruise's performance and Crowe's directing, which seemed familiar to anyone who saw Jerry Maguire. <br /> <br /> If I compare this movie anyway, I would say: If you enjoyed David Fincher's game, then surely the Vanilla Sky fan.
