I love this movie but the music in all previous students' meetings is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it was done in 1972. That is, in 1972 the main cast was graduated. Dances etc. from the 1950s and early 1960s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you attend my 30th high school reunion, I can assure you that you will play last music in the last high school or dance. People are their parents' music. <br /> <br /> I understand the problems of finding the 1970s music. But it was not completely eliminated and filmmakers took much care. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to see the rest of the movie 's illusion in the film. <br /> <br /> It is a bad director and / or producer decision.
