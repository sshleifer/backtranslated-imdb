I can not believe that I'll watch this movie now - I think slaves are considered a different movie, and I have escaped the roots for the same reason - I see the Schindler's list. <br /> <br /> The main thing I have noticed about Color Purple is the pain of other people Do not "entertain" by. Whites are not about blackmail by blacks. Blacks were able to do their own rape with their own daughters - or to give them their "husbands" slaves. It is painful to see, but everyone has finally redeemed himself, and acting is unusual! I can not believe Oprah is played at the age of 35! And I just start WOPE ADI - she is amazing. I am silent yesterday afternoon and Showtime color purple run.
