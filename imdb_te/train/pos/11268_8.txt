Jane Porter's former love interest is being searched for a gold mine for Tarzan's hidden gold escort, Harry Holt (Neal Hamilton) and his friend Martin (Paul Cavanagh), "Elephant Cemetery" for the first time in Tarzan, The APE MAN. Only soon the two men find the hidden intent ... ie Jane. Tarzan will stand for that? Perhaps Tarzan does not stand for any "disturbance" of the "cemetery of the Elephant") and caught up with the intent of the local tribe when he was trying to bring Martin Tarzan into the film, after which he and his party Tarzan had gone along with them, Tar Will John be and have enough ability to get them in time? The film is filled with scenes facing Tarzan and other animals and captures the viewer's interest and has a climax that does not stop. The depiction of cruelty and local people shown towards animals may have some disruptions today but all this is basically reminiscent of fantasy adventure entertainment and can not be taken very seriously.
