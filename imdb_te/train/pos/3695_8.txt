I was lucky enough to attend a screening in Stockholm for this beautifully expressive, enjoyable, and thought-provoking movie. With the romance in Arsenal, Tessie fell in love with Paris in Paris, navigating different forms in eighteen different "Quarties", without spoiling the Parseens and Zaccinern's principles. Has its Goldmint comes from desperation on the parts of the Directors undoubtedly ?? Just 5-10 minutes to disappoint over screen time time? <br /> <br /> I discussed all 18 sections of the discussion. I decided it would just be recurring and long winds. Instead, each director promises to enjoy their innovative styles and talents, and you definitely get your affection. Although Gus Van Sant could not resist the temptation that does not experiment experimentally, his LES MARAIS is one of the best works, well placed in the Kurt Cobain hint. Ken Brothers is one of the more accessible parts in Paris, a mute but mentally transparent Steve Buscemi, permanent humor and perfectly produces a lot of laughter in my theater, and perhaps correctly recreate a scene of those ingenious camera angles. <br /> <br /> In this way, all the storytellers are exquisitely unique? Filtered through the minds of various directors ?? But separates the rest from the rest, which is a Quirini de la Madeleine of Vincenzo Notti, a bloodbath in the Paris Backstreets night starring Eliza Wood in a dark horror-gothic love. It looks like the screen is not a hole in the black-and-white shapes, but the blood-red contrast, which is almost a field of Sin City? A refreshing back and visual turnover is an otherwise properly grounded image. <br /> <br /> And yet, my favorite director is TUB Tuckwere by FAUBOURG St Denis, but I think my favorite and my friend as my friend and I went to the theater so I decided to think "finally, my favorite director is here." However, the vaccine chooses a blind boy's phone and can not be dismissed from his girlfriend (Portman - not annoying), and can not deny that he offers a lovely episode that reflects their relationship. Like the style of Taekar, the story is crazy, fate and repeat, which is played by Throwing and running (Lola Renthin), which makes the most adrenaline-pumping segment in Paris Zay Tome, a tycour after Tycoor's most powerful tool? Music. <br /> In order to fill a negative account, all directors can not handle the ticker, van Sant, Cowans, Coilite, and DePardyu. Sylvain Chom√© leaves the bottom of the pile by capturing a small rebranding section, explaining how the little boy met his parents. They have two lonely mimes. This part is your face French and desperately active, which is a disgrace for international audiences. Suwa is also worried about her son's loss with Juliet Binoo, who is looking for a poor and flawless division. Nothing happened. <br /> Lastly, there is a somewhat quicker and heartfelt sense of the surroundings and inner part of the 18 stories. <br /> <br /> Other stories are so good that the Paris Jim Tommy really gets dried up with a crisp performance and entertaining work-artist. This is definitely one of the headlines of 2006 (I do not say much, I think) and it's a very personal picture that is essential for picking a favorite and least favorite. <br /> <br /> <br /> "
