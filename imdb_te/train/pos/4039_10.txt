So many complaints that I have heard about this film really come down to one thing: it's not Versus. Yes, cast and crew are basically the same. Yes, some of the action sequences in the second half of Kimura's film are rebuilding shots, but the similarities are over here. Versus is essentially all outside, displaying Kayamura's ability to create an interesting B-film in natural areas. For Alive, almost everything is done inside. In small, narrow spaces. Here the art design is thrust into your face, and art design is it! We treat many complex and interesting places, and our characters are mostly confined to those places. Moreover, we can not take much action until the film ends. Versus is all about action and cool, here too much attention is put on the characters and situation and the trouble with your mind. Because of this, Alive is a very interesting film than the viruses. You may not go to a random scene to watch it for five or ten minutes of cool race, but you will stick to the screen for about two hours, watching for two hours each other interesting characters. <br /> <p> I'm ecstatic now ordered the DVD despite some naysay. You should also have a lot! But this is definitely a different animal from Versus - it is often slow, and it requires a bit of thought to get too much. I'm wielding media blasters for the subtitled R1 DVD release!
