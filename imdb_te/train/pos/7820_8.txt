"True Story of the South African Moving Friendship and the World Away the World." <br /> <br /> Richard Attenborough, directed to "A Bridge to Far" and "Gandhi", Steve Biko wants to bring the story to life and journalist Donald Woods tells his story. Wood's two books, such as "Byoko" and "Asking for Trouble" <br /> <br /> The film takes place in South Africa in the late 1970s. South Africa has the grip of horrific distortion, which keeps blackened blacks out of blacks and classifies whites as a high breed. Blacks live in shantunos in the outskirts of cities and towns, and they are often abused by police and the army. Such as killing the bundouces and armed police forces and killing the inhabitants, a demon attack on a Shantytown. Then we introduced to Donald Woods (Kevin Klein), the editor of the famous newspaper. Woods goes to meet him after publishing a negative story about black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Both are firstly cautious, but they soon become good friends, and Biki shows horror stories of the apartheid system from Woods to a black point. This encourages Woods to talk about what is happening around him and frustrates him to bring Steve Beaco's story openly to the white man's South African and world. Soon, Steve Bico is imprisoned and sentenced to death in prison. Now Woods and his family run from South Africa to England, where Woods can publish his book Steve Biko and apartheid. <br /> When I hear about "Cry Freedom" for the first time, Steve Bucco is a film that is totally dedicated to life. I never really heard about Steve Biko before I saw this film, the events in the film are really before my time. But when Donald Woods tried to avoid the authorities, the story of Donald Woods and more about his journey across Lesotho's border. Woods was placed in a five-year housing custody after Steve Biko was killed. So he had to escape to publish his manuscript on Steve Bucco. Because manuscript is considered to be treason in South Africa, so Woods could face a task similar to the bicco. Real Donald Woods and his wife served as consultant. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington was only in the film for the first hour, and I was disappointed, the film. But he's as stunning as Steve Biko, and I really well read his personality and his voice sounded perfect. His performance earned him Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Donald Woods, and Penelope Wilton offer an amazing and thought-provoking performance, such as his wife Wendy. <br /> <br /> The filming took place in Zimbabwe, South Africa when they tried to portray. In South Africa, the South African Gestapo followed everywhere film crew, so they got bad vibes and they broke up and moved to neighbor Zimbabwe instead. Nevertheless, apart from seven years of apartheid, 'Cry Cry Freedom' was not banned in South Africa. <br /> <br /> Richard Attenborough brings extravagant movements into the background with intense power and will. When he is seen as a peaceful protest by peaceful protesters, he is recovering at the end of the cinema, when the police fire them, turns into a massacre. The film concludes with names of all anti-apartheid transports in jail, and explanations for their deaths. Most people do not have an explanation. Some are "epilepsy", which is hard to believe, and many have fallen from the stairs or "hanging from suicide". I do not know what really happened to them, but I said that no one of these men died in their hands and died in the hands of others. Or the police should be more precise in hand. <br /> <br /> "Credit Freedom" is the film that Steve Biko's character and story should look out for. It's also a searing and devastating character in a gorgeous land division and racial segregation and hellish grip.
