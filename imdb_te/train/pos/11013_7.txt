There are several Hollywood films in the years of war designed to support our troops from the public. Today, some may dismiss them or watch them publicly - they're technically, but it's a positive sort and intent to unite the country. The film is a very effective and exciting example of the genre - pretty genuine script and good product values. Pat O'Brien plays the same role he plays in other films (you know, tough-talking, hard-driven, but "the guy in the trap"). Randolph Scott, as always, is effective and fun and the rest are fantastic (look for young Robert Ryan, one of the banners in training). Although the story has many other memories of our pilots and crew, the film is very interesting and it is not too far away. It's probably the end-of-the-end film - bit over the top but very satisfying. Only serious about negative, and this is mostly for nitpickers, some of the stock footage that some people sloppily merge into the film and history "nuts" like me who are both teachers and aircraft lovers probably will notice this - all others probably have not noticed.
