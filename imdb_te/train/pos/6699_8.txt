<br /> <br /> When Sabrina first came into our screens I was around 12 years old, so the young witch spent my youth years looking to enter all kinds of weird misfortune. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite shows, sixty sitcom 'Beviched' but this time the character is cooler. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. She is also happy to see her looking friendly and easy. The characters in the beginning are great; Hilville, Jenny, Libby, Quiz Master, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal fav, had already left) Hilda and Zelda started off her sisters, but later became irritated. As far as getting closer to the secrets of the Srikrishna, Mr. Craft itself. I had original ideas loved about the first three series, learning the secret of family and learning new spellings but it turned out to be more speculative. <br /> <br /> Many of the characters like Valerie, Drema and Brad were abandoned, and then they decided to make me Sabrina in college. <br /> <br /> Sabrina is self-absorbed in college, less magic, <br /> <br /> The last series is boring, and I have seen only what to see what has happened. Hilda and Zelda did not appear to be misinterpreted and Miles was gone. The last episode Sabrina ends with Harvey on her wedding day and she has a great feeling to be great for Aurora (Spoiler). Forget about the late last two or three series that reminded me about a lot of teen shows, it's a great event overall. Magical.
