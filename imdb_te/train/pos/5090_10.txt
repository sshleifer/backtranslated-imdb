I liked this movie. Great storyline and actors and good movie sets. It tells the story so that I can pay attention without being easy to understand and fall asleep. I want to know where I can get the soundtrack. I can not find anywhere else. Please email me if you know where to get a soundtrack. I can not find a soundtrack, I thought the film was lovely. Swayze has done a great job. I think that's some of his best work. His last movies are okay, but this is really a story for a change. This will fall into history as one of the best TV films ever broadcast. Congratulations to producers and writers of such a great work.
