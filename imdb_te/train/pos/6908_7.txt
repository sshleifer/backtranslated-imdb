Richard Dreifuss starred in "Moon Over Parader", a 1988 film for Paul Majors, starring Raúl Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfus has starred in a New York actor, Jonathan Nolan, in the Caribbean country of Pardoor. When the dictator suddenly died, the Secret Police Chief (Julia) drafted Jonathan for dictators, and found a comparison between the dictator and the country's controller. <br /> <br /> Immediately, Jonathan Alfons is the Sims, and Simms's prostitute friend Madonna (Braga). Switch promise to help her anyway. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the Sims' mother in the drag and how we work in third world countries. The role of the wines, a salesman, is actually a CIA operative. <br /> <br /> This film, however, flirts but really treads on a very serious ground and is a send-up more, and a funny one. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfus performs a marvelous work by Jonathan's actor and Alphonse's dictator, creating two different characters and making both ones easier. Beautiful Sonia is brilliant as Madonna, and Raúl Julia is undoubtedly Straussmann behind, holding hands in a furious funny display. This is one of those shows if you do not know what the character is - he can be pleasant or emotional at any time. <br /> <br /> Charo is a maid and at the same time acting as funny and unusual. <br /> <br /> Very good movie, not a big blockbuster, but it is entertaining.
