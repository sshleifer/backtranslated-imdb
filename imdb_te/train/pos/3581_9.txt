I saw the film again in the 80s and when I saw it on the TV again I noticed and forgot it. <br /> <br /> I am an amazing actor, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Bramilly, Fredrick Forest, and Jason Presson (twelve years old boy that is responsible for the accidental shooting of his older brother). The film has a very real feel - a poor, silent, deeply moving story suffers from a family's suffering. Conversation is low but telling, and nonverbal performance is the best. Sans of the general rural version of the general public is a psychiatrist but equally impressive family fate. <br /> <br /> Stone Boy has a great deal of time and emotional power involved in watching it.
