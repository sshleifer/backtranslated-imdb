This really funny movie is just one voluptuous middle-aged male in Hollywood, and a touching, funny love story, a fairy-tale cast of characters. Capop√©zza and Malasis are rivals in Italian neighborhoods in New York. The level of taste - seriously - are at the opposite level. Their children cast major roles in the production of Romeo and Juliet. Naturally, they fell in love. On stage! <br /> <br /> Parents played against each other against the backdrop of confusion and confusion with their children and their children, the delicate flavorless home of Capophezza and the backdrop of their incredible insipid weddings. <br /> <br /> There are four over-the-top parents and lovely young lovers, a vague brilliant priest of the characters, a plain speaking grandma, a wand waves and a woman who goes on to spiritual advice she receives from Bless Rosso. The beds shaped like seat, and motel with two pigeons. <br /> The family names of these two families are fun. "Capoemazza" can be understood as "low-eyebrow", and "malasiasi" means "tight snobs". <br /> If you are sensitive to Italian martial arts, you may not like this movie. If Betty Midler is disturbed by you, you may not like it, because the women of the film are like Martha Stewart as Betty Midler. The rest of us should love it!
