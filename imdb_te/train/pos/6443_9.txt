Yesterday I saw this movie for the third time. It was recommended me a fridge several weeks ago. I have never seen or seen (in general) the "Swedish Movie" and (like me) Hollywood productions who are suspicious of any foreign films (usually). Hell is an example change! This film touches me, because it keeps my hope and can change to the better way for mankind. Sweden's village is just a model for all areas of the earth where people live together to sing, sing, ignore, observe, and meet, religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions, disguised cruelty. Every one of the masks (one keeps it) is a trigger out of the outside and we feel that we want to live our own lives. I can not see such stories, because I put my hope as mentioned above. The five minutes that combined Gabriella's song with her acting is one of my movie-headlines! Thank you for this 5-minute Pollock, which made me happy!
