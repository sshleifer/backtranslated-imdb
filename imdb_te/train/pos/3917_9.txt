U.S. 1984 I first saw this movie when it was released. I have seen so many times. Including rehearsal art in the lives of strikes, characters and visa contracts about the film. It is not quite sure if the film sees two sequences and sometimes a character from a characters' lives or rehearsals throughout. The climax of the film will continue. These years later my friends and I still like to talk about whether or not the "Carmen" really stagnant. From the roles of other characters, for stylized murder, it was opened to the debate. The duality, the quality of acting, the art of love, and the illumination of the performances combine all of the creation of an incredible image, once again the line between the mixture and life and art.
