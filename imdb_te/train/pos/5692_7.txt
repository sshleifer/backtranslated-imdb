This is the second film based on the life and times of John Curtis Estes, the ultra hank romance known as John Holmes. Boogie Nights depends on his life. <br /> Maybe someday we're going to make a film in the life of Tommy Byron. <br /> <br /> The story is not very good. There are many law & order episodes with more turns and turns than Wonderland, and the director can never get a criminal case going on without any pleasure. Wal-Killer had two problems - he was not as good as Holmes (and not like Boogie Nights, there is no prosthesis at this time), and he looks better than Mop Holmes. <br /> <br /> The director does not introduce a preferred person in the cast. He is a racist, immortal, or executioner with his wife, and does not get much to play the police role. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is that Eric Bogosian tells Paris Hilton to "lose". <br /> <br /> Those who are interested in those who are interested in pornography in the 1980s or in real offenses should not necessarily lose it.
