Pierce Brosnan is the newest but no longer James Bond, a murderer. He was very good at what he was doing, but he was old and tired. Greg Kinnair is as good as a straight and narrow businessman. As the story begins, these two men are shown in their special lives. One night they have drinks in a bar, and they start talking. Then suddenly you will find that these two people live together in a series of events. The story is fantastic, acting is top-notch, and humor is a hilarity I thought Pierce Brosnan would be this funny, but he really is and I should see this movie a must.
