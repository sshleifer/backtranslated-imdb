One of the ten best films of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Cold Blood is the simplicity and reality of its storyline and is completely inspired. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake walks with the film. The story seems to be almost entirely presented from Perry's perspective, although Dick is the leader and the planner of the couple. The viewer does not appear, Dick becomes more unstable, not immature, Perry thinks that Perry is not pulled into these pressures, but Dick and his need to remove anyone and a big score. A true story with a true story, Cold Blood portrays the story behind a cold, windy night's brutal and supernatural murder of the rural Kansas family, because Dick buys an elderly rural myth and cash in their home. Like the "prosecutor" played by Will Geyer (a character unnoticed in the script), their views are clearly stated and only $ 10 for their lives. Director Richard Brooks wisely chooses not to share the worst details of the hearts until the end of the film, we only learned before, and watching Dick and Perry's lives are not slowly extinguished by law enforcement, but Perry's ever-rising Doom's growing sense. He repeatedly remarks, "No one will ever be away," and "I can not think of what we have left behind." Dick is not mature or morbid enough to experience any guilt feelings on their crimes, it's just embarrassing in Perry. In fact, after they were found, they finally ended the disappearing dick with the undeniable proof of the two men being put on the criminals, and suddenly the fangs. <br /> <br /> Some people are sorry for Perry from the beginning of the film, and the events progressed, and I hated Dick. <br /> <br /> He played in the genius of the cinema. We do not have a moment, we think the actors play the role of characters, but that they are seeing actual participants and events that occur. The story is cruel, but the run runs a little more than two hours are just like a few minutes. <br /> I'm a couple of people who are interested in such things as "errors" listed here on the IMDb page in Cold Blood, such as the "revolving" shot shot at Dick and Perry Kansas. , It's not even a process shot, the camera actually looks at the backslash and the car's windshield beyond the movie you've seen <br /> <br /> When a large cargo truck on the left of Dick's Pontiac is creating an optical illusion that they are going backwards, but because they are traveling at a faster pace, they are very close and they are actually shot from the original shot-shot vehicle. As mentioned earlier, the ten best writers in the 20th century film One of which is not too small in some course language, will approach a modern image), but is absolutely fantastic.
