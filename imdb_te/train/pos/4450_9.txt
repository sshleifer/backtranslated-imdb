An old man living in the mountains awakens one morning and loses his baby. He rotates forests to see a murder but he has seen murder or has he lost his mind? Is he just getting older? The film is so great, because they have to make their own minds who look at what's going on. There is very little dialogue in this movie but the words do not need to speak for the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The other part that I like is the shots of fall and winter woods. That's pretty but the only thing I do not like is the old man's scene in his underwear. He would have tied a tough robe, but something else, it's a very deep picture.
