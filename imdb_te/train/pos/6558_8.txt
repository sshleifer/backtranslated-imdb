I disagree with the previous comment about this movie. I was beautiful and fun and I think I carried a good message for young girls like my daughter. You do not need to dress up as the cooler hottest one. <br /> <br /> I think you're good at the cast and the story is good for a target audience. All in all my wife and daughter (10) and I thought each was a good movie. I definitely recommend it. It encouraged my daughter to read the original Nancy Drew secrets, and I would love her more if she loved hardy boys. <br /> <br /> She wanted to start reading right away because she was trying to sleep tonight. I can not get a better result for the film than re-interested in that classic series.
