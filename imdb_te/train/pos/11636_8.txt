Beautifully portrayed, well acted, hard copy script suspense film. My seat is on the edge. I liked the main actress, and thought that the villain did well. In the way of a theme is not chew here, but if you get in your seat, watch off your brain, watch the fancy camera work, and enjoy the plot, you will have a great time. The plot is well worn, and regular movie directors learn more or less than ten minutes to expect, but I'm not bored, I'm enjoying seeing it. In the old days, they did not pay much attention to just two letters, and there were some lovely moments when some people felt that I should have some lines. But these folks are probably right to make this film a movie. The plot gave me a lot of voice and never let go. It is not advisable to think too much during the movie or later. It certainly makes a great deal of feeling as I'm not sure. Sit back and have fun.
