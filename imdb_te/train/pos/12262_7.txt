Some thirty years ago, the author Numa Sadol published a book-length interview with Belgian comic book artist Georges Remy (known as Tintin Creator Herz). This film meets Sadod on this day reminding us of the interview, when we heard cassettes (Herz died in 1983), he saw some old photos and footage. Hercz did not publish some of the interviews in the book when she asked, and found that she was separated from his wife (after his wife in his later years). A few years later, many of the anti-imperial books have not been altered in the Tintin books since early and imperialist books (Tintin in the Soviet Union, Tintin in the Soviet regions). Blue Lotus). Overall, I came from this film to learn more about Herrigi and can not say a little bit more than when I came to the theater.
