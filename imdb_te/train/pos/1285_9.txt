The frustrated middle-aged deputy district attorney George Maxwell (George E. Cary, the best performance produced by the film) can not keep his niggi and frezed wife Edith (An Absolute Bitch Anne Bellamy). Worse yet, the poor George is overloaded with more newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter (Dishy brunette Sheri Jackson). George's lovely, lovely and free-spirited swinging hippie cousin has a strange event with Candy Wilson (who played with sexy aplomb by hilariously delicious blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). Jorge was arrested in prison by his bitter Julia Freeman (Kathy Williams in a good poisonous turn), who wants George in the spring of his psychotic biker boyfriend Laurence Mackay (a beloved Robert Tessier, who heads his hair). Director Tom Laughlin (same is the same person who shot Billy Jack!) And screenwriter James McLaughty created a fabulous story with an amazing female nudity and most entertaining surplus, soft-core sex, and raw violence. In addition, they are definitely the peak of all ages 60 years of young culture's peak wild'n'asy unnecessary sensibility and are associated with the plot in a tight 75-minute time, so the film is not well-received. A perfect highlight takes place when Candy invites his girlfriends to Maxwell's home for a full-blown ghost bash with candy cam smokers, voice rock music, and, of course, hot naked dancing chicks. Robert O. Rangland's funky score gnarly spot hits. Stanton Fox's full black and white cinematography deliriously adds an extra sandy edge to sleazy goings-on. Beautifully, the film is rated as a spectacular show for Priccia Wimmer to this lovely and fresh-face Pixie, which she displays her sweet, bubbling personality and attractive beauty. The whole trousy treat.
