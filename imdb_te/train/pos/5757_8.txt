The film started only in the 1970s. It's a strange action movie in the town of a small California worker. In some ways the mill or plant is closed, so suddenly, the prevailing bad behavior occurs in the streets! Boring towns! So Ben Arnold (John Michael Vincent) goes to another town to hire his brother, Chorus, played by Chris Christopher. Aron is a Vietnam Vat. He meets with a bunch of other vet Vietnamese vet. They come into town to clean it up (they will develop), but under their good deeds, they really run gambling houses, seeking protection money, etc !!! It takes some time to catch people, and in the Bible Cain and Abel Showdown, Vincent must take his older brother. Interestingly (note that this is a confident fight!) The film has an interesting blue-collar pillar. Vincent has the role of an angel in this role? He feels very well with his brother, his pregnancy does not make the evil deeds he accused. Does he finally get his feelings ?? His girlfriend, Victoria Principal, was badly shot back and was beaten to his home. Chris Cristoferson is influential as Aaron. While he is scared of his parents' lives, he does not make any mistake when he laughs, and gently speaks with Kos and Vincent's little daughter (she refers to her as' Uncle Aaron ')! Vincent and Christopherson have one of the best contradictory chemists. Bernadette Peters plays an interesting role as a 'saloon' girl, who attracts Aaron's attention. If you can find it better 70 action action movie! Is not it available on DVD yet ??
