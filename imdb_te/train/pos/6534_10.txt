I have heard that this film is very good for my friends, and they say they are fantastic, so I have a lot more expectations - and Nancy Drew has surpassed those high expectations! It has funny episodes, which entertained me with all the people trying to take action and kill her, and Nama Roberts was fantastic as Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast is great. I would definitely recommend this film !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "Wondering why those guys are trying to kill me?" <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I hate when I try to kill me, it's rare! <br /> <p> ~ Nancy Drew
