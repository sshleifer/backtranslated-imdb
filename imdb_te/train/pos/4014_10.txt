Spoiler (not really spoiler after all) for those who are lucky to see this movie anytime. When this was released it saw this movie and it can still remember its parts. It is located in a small town in the west or in the town. It resembles a ghost town with some residents. One of them is a wife and a wife is especially bad. At the end of the film she makes her man die and goes out of town but must cross the desert. She did not know what would happen to the next stage, but after her death she had not beat her and deliberately dropped the water before the drops left her. She does not know that soon she will be very bad. Mark Damon kills a couple of bad guys in a comic - but it is another story, which I do not remember very good. The rest of the film is the first time I've seen a really bad woman in the movie, it's bad or bad - it's not comparable compared to the witch in Snowwit, to learn easily. Some of the most important western characters are the main characters and still absorbing.
