I'm from Belgium and that's why my English writing is poor, sorry ... <br /> <br /> It's one of the smallest movies in TV, which is just a thin air. <br /> <br /> When I'm browsing through my old VHS video collection and this title comes across, I see it and it's IMDb score greater than 7/10, it's very good. <br /> <br /> When I put the film well and I am in doubt. This film is made by this director only ...? Did not make good movies in this film? <br /> <br /> Anyway, if I think he's pulling his job and making another good movie, please really like it .....
