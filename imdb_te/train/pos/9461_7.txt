Steve Karel is a person who has been involved in a real life dawn (sort of), a movie that I did not like but disliked. This film is not laughing with loud laughter, it's a big heart. We all are like Steve Karel, not the office fans want to see him, but I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Don Burns, daughters, and his daughters are widely deemed widowed paternal widows. One weekend, he and his daughters traveled down to see his family. While there, he goes to a bookstore and comes to a woman. When he returned to his home, he was dating this lady with his brother Mitch (played by Don Cook) (with Juliet Bino). <br /> Dawn in real life, sometimes I am a bit unbelievable. Is the Burns family really kind of people who do the exercises together and do board games and do a bunch of other family things? I am very skeptical. I do not know any such family. Is it stopping me from giving up a thumbs up? <br /> Dawn in real life: *** / ****
