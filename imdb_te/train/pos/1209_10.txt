In the era of such awful cartoons, I'm in shock to make a film with such good morality at the bottom of the IMDB list of animated films. <br /> <br /> The film is initially contradictory. I can not deny it. However, when I was at the target age for this film, I noticed, or if I did that, it was not so important. People who make it can use the "New Generation", which is another way to enable the Care Bear Family. <br /> <br /> How do we decide which bear family really started? </ P> <br /> It was my favorite film at the age of 3-6 years and this was not feared or confused with me. > <br />
