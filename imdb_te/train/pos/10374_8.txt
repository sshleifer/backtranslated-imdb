<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ' Matt moved to the city and taken by his cousin George (Damian Robertson). Well, anyway that's the plan. George is associated with a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and is delivering for him. Needless to say, Matt George pulled into the world. <br /> <br /> I think Matt George taught how to teach some morals and dignity while teaching mott how to relax and live a little bit of life. Toby and Damien have worked well together and have done an amazing job. <br /> <br /> Each character in this film is appreciated by each other, two cops are great. David Nambumbuzha brought a great comic relief to the film. One of my favorite roles has reminded me of 'Pando' from both hands. <br /> <br /> Among the things that I liked about the roll, I lived in Perth and Fremantle for more than 20 years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> This rocks 'n' rolls
