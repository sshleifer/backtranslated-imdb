I really did this theater director, Hyduto Nakita. If you see the ring in front of you then you get to know the style and idea of ​​the film. It has better performance than continuous (and predictable) stingers that affect most of the major films of this genre. If you like the coolest movies, you probably prefer it. Good, creepy entry by Hydeo Nakata. 8/10
