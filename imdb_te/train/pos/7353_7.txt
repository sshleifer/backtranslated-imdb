The film is one of the least undervalued films in Bollywood history. This 1994 block buster has all the best performances, music and direction. The song "Oi Amma" was the song I was running in Allahabad and their loudspeakers at the Holi marker in March. Anyone who likes to see drills on some Like It Hot and Morlin Munro must watch this movie. Thomas to Govinda. You know that the film is shot in South India and the blackboard silver screen hit after Sholay is very low. Movies like this Indian comedy can never die.
