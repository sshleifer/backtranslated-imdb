I have my doubts about another love story, in which the disabled can get meaning and relief through honest communication. And this is still not at the top of my list. But Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and the finest, almost fantastic, and just protecting this from another tear-jerk. The description of the ALS victim's carter is strong, perhaps at some times even greater (sometimes she will dissolve into the mutterings that do not remove the dialogue). But the overall effect is laudable and rewarding. <br /> <br /> Bronag may be a complete compliment to his performance. <br /> <br />
