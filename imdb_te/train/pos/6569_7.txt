"Jake Speed" is a good picture with an outstanding message. It's of course its flaws. Sometimes it's slow. The villain in this story introduces a long distance. It is the speed at the snail's heart rate of action. <br /> <br /> It's a Z-grade cast (although I always appreciate the work of Karen Copins, who looks straight at the good looks of Sandra Bullock) <br /> <br /> Speed ​​"is a thank you to Wayne Crawford (a title role) and a fascinating script by Andrew Lane. <br /> <br /> The story is said to be" stranger in a strange land ", which is good and The adventurous Jake Speed ​​is kept in the real world of good people in the bad world.The Jake Boy Scout is more than a horse shining armor. <br /> <br /> Jake Speed ​​is a dirty because it really needs to be hit Protected saint of optimism in the mean and the evil world. <br /> <br /> This is a great message for Hollywood, <br /> <br /> A film industry is really gaining momentum to portray good and good people, but I do not mean that I should watch Waltons in every theater at cineplex, but it's good if there are more movies like "Jake Speed". <br /> <br /> Definitely, "Jake Speed" includes torture, blood and guns, but the whole message is a good thing for you - a good show of "South," a TV show about a Canadian mountainee. If the guy try hard enough, you'll beat the evil forces every time
