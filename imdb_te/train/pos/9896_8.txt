I understand this film for the last few months. <br /> <br /> The plot of the high school youngsters who are threatened by a boy named Mighty, <br /> <br /> A few years later, a reckless teenager has been invited to return to their own high school, which is now forbidden for a party. <br /> <br /> By this film, teenagers are the most scary in the possible ways. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film you find that it is in a dream, nothing of it has happened. But he was in hospital with severe burns. <br /> If murders were not done, flares and pranks were made. <br /> Acting is terrible, but it's fine. <br /> I love the story. I really sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). <br /> When you finally do what they are for those who come to them, you are satisfied with the victims to take their sweet revenge. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for 80 slashers, I'll give you 8 stars for this movie. Good cheesy slasher!
