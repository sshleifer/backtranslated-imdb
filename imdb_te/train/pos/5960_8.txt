It's great to see Jorja Fox in the role where she gets a lot smile. She wanted to hear her singing. She is a good change to see her from the CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The film was also entertaining, but it seemed to have skipped some episodes in most episodes. Many characters seemed to be very upset about a minute and a bit later and left to your imagination to recognize why. Quirky for each character though and in some cases, I can not wait to see what they will do next or they will not hear the next one. The film is not full of very snappy people, but it is the real complex people who make mistakes and think badly about them and find a way to solve them.
