I can not say that I was a bad movie. Originally the "poverty line" studios were quite typical of the type of film that was released at that time. Filmed in Monogram, Bela Lugosi is somewhat more demented doctor-scientist in his role as the most efficient, companion of the community's respected member. In the film, Bela and his followers have a nasty habit of stealing a young bride, and after their death, Bela's wife is injected with a serum that takes their bodies to protect their bodies. Lagosi is more than working to make this enjoyable movie, however, the movie suffers from the co-stars Luana Walters and Tristram Caffeine's ultra-wood acting. Caffeine (a good name for a person in the horror film) is particularly bad in this case. I saw him in many films and TV shows and he always looks the same; Hard, woody and completely astounding. Miss Walters is a little better, but she does not have acting talent to let her act on her performance. However, the viewer loses another extreme scheme at the end of the Great Lugosi Act at the end! Despite some poor performance, "The Corps Vanishhes" is a delightful movie for everyone.
