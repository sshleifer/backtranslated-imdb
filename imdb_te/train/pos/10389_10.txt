I saw this movie when I was a child. It fell out of me. This was preceded by television days, so the image of this size sends a young kid into orbit. It impressed me, I went to see the film for twelve days. The special effects used at this time are very early in its time. Like Rex Ingram Genie, Sabu is a real pleasure. "I want to be a sailor" after spending a few months left on the film. I will recommend this film to everyone. I've forgotten about Conrad Weed as you'd ever want to meet. Moreover, DuPage is not in love with her in the June film. The color is exceptional. Give this image to AAA!
