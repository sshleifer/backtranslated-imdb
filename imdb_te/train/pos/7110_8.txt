John Garfield Marine plays a grenade grenade when he has learned to live with his disability while struggling with Guadalcanal. He has all the stereotypes of blindness and is sure he will be a burden for everybody. The hospital staff and his fellow injured Marines can not come to him. Eleanor Parker did not play home with his girl back home. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self-pity, and prejudices. Despite Garyfield's so-called syrup drama, watching is a critical character that is memorable in a great show. He is in a machine gun niche where he attempts to escape Japanese soldiers in a night-long night battle with Japanese soldiers, and then sees a dream scene in a hospital where he has a rail platform with white cane, dark glasses, and a tin cup holding his girlfriend's camera Walks backwards.
