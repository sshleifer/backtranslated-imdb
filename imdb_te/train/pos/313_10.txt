I am Black American and I loved this soap opera. About 5-7 years ago, I dubbed in Spain in Telemundo. The story is true of a black commander, a white commander. She has led to leadership and candid, a sexual offensive way. <br /> <br /> Many of us can learn a lot from XICA. She did not take her, nothing, and saw her possibilities. <br /> <br /> She is trying to make her future and her future children safe. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful soap opera, I wanted to release on DVD, but it was not released. This soap opera is the best soap opera. We need it to be on DVD or on TV. Currently it is played in Aztec America, which is only available in Mexico or in the US via the payment cable. It needs to be released again to the Timbondo.
