Purple Rain is a great movie if you are a 40-year-old musical lover who broke into Prince Music in the 1980s. The most commonly used principle of this story: Rising musical talent is to overcome personal and professional hurdles to find his audience and self-esteem. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially Purple Rain / I'm worthy to sit through the movie 4. He is a filmmaker and a motion picture actor like Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, a circa thriller. Apolonia Cotore, former Prince Proteg√©, shows some acting talent and chemistry with cute and prince, but her script does not let her get away. Morris Dey and other supporting actors are provided with comic elements.
