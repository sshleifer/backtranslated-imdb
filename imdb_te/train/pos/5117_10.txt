Very few films have influenced American culture in the urban cowboy. It temporarily thank God. But the UC can not take your eyes when you wobble the channels at 3:00 AM .... My first three animal house and one of those flixs that is walking to Tall BTW is also near a point in a class. Recalls that Urban cowboy touched the theaters, opening the hunky tanks in every corner, men were cowboy hats who had their penny hats and you do not know how you felt a social monotony up to two steps! Personally I think it's a great movie. I was really surprised at the important things of Trevolta Satnet Hoover. Who will be beaten. He is really believable. Soundtrack is awesome. The bad guy Charlie Tilton, the Dallas fame of TV's Johnny Lee career is just amazing for the guy. The show stolen is Scott Glenn, a gorger former con red neck cowboy. I could not find anything against paper-free coffee, but I thought it was a great power line ... "pack-at * And looking around Sissy to kill him I see my Julia Roberts Fantasy. 9/10
