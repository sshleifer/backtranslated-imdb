Who has speculated - Hall Hartley creates a film cover for Syria in retaining his signature exclusive style. <br /> For more than a decade, Hal Hartley did not see the film, I contacted some of the warnings. His amazing production of nineties attracted critics and audiences with their unique style and dialogue. The director's earliest films consist of colorful characters and included sexuality, New York, or New York City - which gave consideration to life - is offbeat and intelligent. <br /> <br /> My early caution is derived from this movie description as "spy thriller". For my pleasant surprise, Hart moves his well-established style and focuses on creating the most original drama of international intrigue. It works in more ways than expected. <br /> <br /> It is also the status of the current situation in the world and the status of war. Dark elements on all sides. Harley was newly introduced to his new talent - a political picture of the same breath in Syria. In fact he will come to him. The performer does a good job of describing Hart's attention and style. Parker Posey fans will see her full bloom here, yet with us and more mature and beautiful than before.
