My comment is RELEASE attached to the DATE section, but I can not find a place for it. The film was released in the US in February 1955. I saw in March 1958 at the "first run" theater in Washington, DC. Is it reissued or some problem? In my opinion, this movie is very light entertainment, but there are some classic characters. John McIntyre is a bang-up job as a corrupt judge / businessman / thief. Walter Brennan was primarily involved in the Red River years. And, in my opinion, James Stewart will give a performance fine as he has ever done. I saw this film a half a dozen times or more and never again saw the tire again. Photography and scenery are excellent, and it provides entertaining entertainment in an hour and thirty six minutes.
