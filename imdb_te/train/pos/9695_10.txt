He portrayed a parrot played by Russian immigrant janitor (Tony Shalhoub) about how he searched America to his original masters, which tells a number of stories. <br /> He is an elderly woman (Jenna Rowlands), he is Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin), and others. <br /> More than anything, this is a very good movie.
