Thanks again from the darkness. No relief ... thriller is actually thrilling! The new "IT" girl Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Crushers" and "The Notebook") in this short little classic suspense thriller from the famous horror film director Wes Craven ("Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street") < br> When Mau Adams sees interacting with 4 or 5 people, what is this 1520 minute reality? Person or phone. She is natural. When she encounters the sillian Murphy (when she is shocked at "Batman Begins"), the film really takes flight. Looking at the viewer's view, watching the two viewers look at the audience, making the image look good! Airplane boarding sequence consists of mesmerizing and 30-plus minutes on the onboard is an emotional claustrophobia. <br /> Like many thrillers, when the Lamb becomes a superhero, the climax is only discouraging. An interesting plot device we believe that Rachel has the pent needed to despair through this, but we can not face a bit scarcely. Most overdone scenes include guests at hotel guests, an annoying airline passenger, scissor's injury and fx at the hotel. This film strength is character development and mental games between leads. The sad fine screen has been used by Brian Cox underneath, but overall it is an average suspense thriller that is worth watching.
