Maria Braun married her and her husband Herman in the midst of fighting. An explosion was opened by the building, and she had to sign papers on the collapse of her and herman's street. Perhaps this can hit a huge handmade metaphor for the upcoming issues: marriage, talking on rocks. <br /> <br /> Rainer Werner develops difficulties at Fosbinder's melodramas, and his best and best friend, The most provocative, too (Hanna ski in this role is unusual Rananga shown), we will see. Two interviews: If the American GI's bar is working and she heard Herman's death from a soldier she should stand with him, and her heart was dead. And works for a German businessman (effectively sympathetic Ivan Desney), and sometimes a mistress and a rising star in his institution (naturally, returns and murder occurs, and rap takes care to be safe). <br /> <br /> It is difficult to say that there is nothing about Maria. Money, sex, power, and everything else. She eats her cake with a cake and a horror smile: when her husband earns more or less (actually less than the last ten minutes of the film) things - anytime, others with him, being a man or very weak Because the Secretary has played an interesting role, others with her, one secretary, Dab <br /> <br /> Maria is quietly, self-confident and lonely, has an ideal life against a life to be made in the shadow, she says about American soldier and poor old and sick Oswald - two men, The roses are confused and soul-searching husband Herman is released from prison after Canada <br /> <br /> Fosbinder uses this inherent contradiction, and she believes that moves with Maria will appear against the meetings.Drama (for example, walking in Heberon Zabolent and half-naked Maria and GI, the scene's best work, Not just surprising or guilty of much more reaction but looking to be alive) to be predictable Director of such a high-minded, with a storyline that continues the technique of his firearms. But really not. It's like a big metaphor for a country, after the war, unable to go back to normal. Fosbinder puts the sound of the radio in the background, and Maria finds her family running around the house, hustle and surrounding her around and the radio talks about a divided German, and even more confusing things. <br /> This is the only way to endure it, or it may be my commentary. <br /> <br /> Under the face and eyes of the shigula is, of course, difficult to tell. It's one of the showstoppers that captures an old time Hollywood man star glamor and glamor, although it's a wonderful show, really, with a girl down the streets and dirty ethics. When she is finally together with her husband, many of the men in an opposite outfit who have seen a scene of a super seduction black stripes and high heels are dressed while thinking about it. It's almost as fun as it is, and Shigu's magic gets on it, the men on her head respect him and embarrass her, in a single sentence, a headstrong, or someone who loves some. This is what captures Fassbinder in his excellent first part of his "trilogy"; I totally choose Veronica Wass as a masterpiece, Maria Braun is good as a character study, playing a woman and (almost) nothing to lose.
