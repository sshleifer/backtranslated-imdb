Brunag and Fishburn provide excellent performances in this version of Shakespeare classics. Bragg Igogo plays better than the role I played in the film or the stage. Some people have this image of iGo-centric, but I do not agree. Fishburn, the first black othello in the history of film, provides a ridiculous, powerful display. Fishburn is always a good actor, but Venice's Moore may be his best. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with this film, the general subtraction of several important scenarios. Desdemona's character is given less depth than her play. In the film, she did not even add her. One of the worst cuts made by Bragg in the film is the removal of the dialogue at the beginning of the second conversation between Iggo and Dedomonia. This part of the film may not be the innocent child played by Desdemona in the film. There are many subdivisions that have harmed the integrity of the film. <br /> If you read the play or do not see the image version of Othello, I recommend this film. Story, cut or not, is still very exciting. The performance announced in the past is very good. If some important scenes are included, and Desdemona's character is a bit more important, this is a great movie. As it seems, this is still an admirable form of the original. I give a marginal recommendation.
