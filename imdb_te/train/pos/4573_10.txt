Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> Many years ago we had a party in our home - friends come and we sat down. Around the table, eating, drinking wine, talking, smiling - have a good time. There is TV - it is a picture which we do not care too much about. Then, suddenly, all of us stopped talking and laughing. The mirrors did not click, the forks did not move, the food plates were cold. We can not get our eyes on the screen, where his whole body controls him and his left hand, a young disabled man who chose a piece of chalk with his feet and eternity is just a word on the floor. When we finish writing a word, we know that we have achieved one but three wins - the success of human desire and the spirit, the film's success in the movie and the success of the film. <br /> <br /> Jim Sheridan's "My Left Foot" is Christie Brown, Cerebral An inspired, definitive, biological drama about the person born of Pussy. Dublin dirty; Every one of Day Lewis's shows (I have mixed feelings for his performance in Gunny) but I trust his great role in Christie Brown's "My Left Foot"
