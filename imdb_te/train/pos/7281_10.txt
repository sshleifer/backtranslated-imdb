I saw this movie in a local station on Sunday afternoon in the afternoon of Sunday afternoon in 1969 or 1970. I was a little kid at the time, but I enjoyed it and it was not really scared. I thought it was such a cool and most original storyline. Thinking back, in those years the T.V. I am still surprised to see it in the day of cutting. Since then, I have brought this film back, and I see it again and I have always loved it. John Waters was the idol of the film. It is not only a horror film, but one of the most majestic films ever made at that time. Surprisingly, you will not hear about the cult that you have purchased in films like "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes". It is a cult, but it should really become a cult classic, in my opinion. As far as I know, it came a little earlier before the Blood Feast departed, making it one of the first true "Gore" films. In fact, the film features Herschel Gordon Lewis's material and a small Russie mayor threw a good measure. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I love anyone who likes the worst, blue, white and horror images of the early '60s (I read the date at the end of 1960).
