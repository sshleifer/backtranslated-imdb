After watching "Mafia Marriage", I lost almost all my faith in the Korean film business. <br /> <br /> The leading female character, a university student, had to teach a person who was a spoiled, rich, charismatic high school student. He is actually the age of male character. <br /> <br /> With some new Guanrells, both of them were great friends. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that Quan performed a new job. He is a revelation !! <br /> <br /> The film was very difficult to avoid any clich√©s that appear in ordinary romantic comedies. And we have not shown any unnecessary nude and sex scenes. <br /> It's intelligent, lovely, fresh, and want to see again. <br /> <br />
