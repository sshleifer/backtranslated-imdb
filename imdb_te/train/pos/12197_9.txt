While it may be the perfect film leader, Columbia Studios did not cut the original structure of Orson Welles. <br /> <br /> We are left with a flawless and incredible picture of the great drama talent like 'Actor / Director and Rita Hewervar. <br /> <br /> 'No Lady from Shanghai' movie is very strange and confusing. The fateful encounter with Wells, a seductive and dangerous Elsa Bannister (a great acting) with an uneven voice, is portrayed by Michael O'Hara, a passenger who is an Irishman, and she and her disabled husband (Everett Sloan) yacht. Elsa, or 'Rosalie', as Michael prefers to call her, acted well as an innocent, helpless toy, playing the role of Hara in the web. Because lovers are so secretive in the ocean, he comes to his law firm, George Grissby (Glenn Anders), a partner of Arthur Bannister. He is an unnatural, unfaithful man who offers a special proposal to Michael: He receives $ 5,000 to lead Grissby to death by Grissby, so it appears to be a murder. Michael is planning to get a technology, and Elsa is planning to get into the sun. <br /> <br /> Hathworth presents us with the best femme livestock in the simplest role. Sometimes she is unfortunate and like a child, others are cruel, world-tired and difficult. She is beautifully beautiful, her condition calls her when she is wearing a swimsuit or dressed in black and wearing a gun. Hayworth is beautifully captured here, and she is far from the famous Guilda character. Her then husband, Orson Wells, cut her trademark embroidery lax to a diluted blonde crop (angry Columbia bass Harry Cohen). It was a wonderful marketing strategy, and he changed the attitude. <br /> <br /> "The couple have serious difficulties with their marriage, It's hard to guess whether they are genuine chemistry on the screen, they are divorced, so it's a curiosity that gives some feedback to the complex relationship. Encounter is stronger Wool and raw sexuality, 'Fall Guy' with Wales (he agrees with himself in the film!) And Rita double-crossing child. <br /> <br /> Wells does not have much sense in the character Noir 'drifter' Wells Voice- O'Hara did not use her brain very much, 'expecting her (Elsa) to think Wells was generally seen as brilliant, attractive members,   ందువల్ల అతని మలుపు తిరిగిన బుద్దిగల మైఖేల్ అసాధారణ మరియు చాలా ఆసక్తికరంగా ఉంటుంది. వాస్తవానికి, వెల్స్ మంచి ప్రతిభకు నటుడు మరియు అతను దాన్ని బాగా లాగుతాడు. <br /> <br /> ఎవెరెట్ స్లోన్ హేవుత్వర్ యొక్క అంగవైకల్యమైన భర్త వలె దారుణంగా సున్నితమైనవాడు. Why does he appoint Michael? It is clear that his wife fell in love with him, so why would he invite the 'threat' to the board? One commentary says that binaries may not be in his unbalanced state that Michael is offering his wife 'service'. Before she met her husband, she was certain in the course of Elsa's behavior (she's another destruction?) And Grisby's knowledge of Bunnyster's most intimate secrets in several sequences. <br /> <p> This is a film that was eventually confused with a flawless plot. We are more interested in the love triangle than murders, with many mouths. Wells has its own superb cinematic touchs, quite simply 'glasses' climax. This is a spectacular sight, which removes errors in the movie and is an end to bring greatness. This fun house scene is visually amazing, featuring a dolly-like feel to the set of sequels (obviously Orson painted them). <br /> <br /> The dialogue is scorching and confusing, as a substitute for Rita's short-girl voice that is streamed through voice and hopeless, high-pitched. Hawthat proves her acting abilities, and she proves to be the ultimate Femme Fatale of 'Noir'. It has done a lot of joyous and obscure and often unforgettable music for Columbia instead of 40 years, which has been a pity for the previous dark-themed Nair (Rita is a brilliant dancer). <br /> <br /> She is a brilliant actress when she gives the opportunity to show her talent. <br /> <br />
