To keep it just, I enjoyed this movie. For my interest, the reason for happiness is not related to the subject itself. I listened to stories from my mother and grandmother that I knew how to use the North England class life and attitudes (as they had) and this was an interesting description of what they said to me. Specifically, this method was challenged when he was a "father", but the uninterrupted father of what was best for his family, including his stubbornness. <br /> <br /> People who are watching this movie will probably be disappointed with the film because the story is not easily transferred to various media. However, a movie is a historical document and I have personally experienced it, because it's a social phenomenon.
