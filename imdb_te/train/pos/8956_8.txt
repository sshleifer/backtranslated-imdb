After watching the practical magic I saw this movie, the old movie is very high. As I changed in the Gillian story, I changed my way of changing lighting, makeup and clothing. Jimmy Stewart's habits did not do much for me in the film, but they served to show the reserve of the Gillian character. I also struck by Nicky and Gillian's habits - the director wanted him to be seen by the men and wanted to appear in Gillians. Nicky's gestures, especially when he showed me the Redlich, made me losing my losers. I have never thought about wars like being undoubtedly, so it's an interesting way out of those roles.
