Ms Patty's Duke story and myriad depression fights on her life are like my life battles. I saw her acting. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the film in 1990, I saw this movie and I loved this movie too. Anyone who has fought the manic depression can not get much from this film. It does not mind about her awards or if they have shown what they want. No problem here. The problem is Ms Duke's illness and how it fought to survive and overtake. <br /> <br /> If the person is not affected by the disease, the Duke is proud of his achievements if they do not know them personally. They are hell to live. This is a real picture for me because it showed real problems and no one showed me about depression and manic activity. This is true ... so, so, true. <br /> <br /> I am grateful to Mrs. Patty Dukke for a person who has the courage to inform her of public illness. Bocka
