How to look at both men and women in a single movie is a fantastic science fiction movie. I talked to many people about the film and almost every person loved it and most women thought it was just frustrating and stupid! This is the only film that has such solid views based on gender. <br /> <br /> Film begins with the next trial, with a murder led by Charlton Heston. . It will be set in the near future and the head of the major international sailent corporation has been killed. As the film unfolds, you realize this terrible and most inequitable future American society. Rich live ("furniture" - euphemism for payment mississements accompanying the apartment) in enormous apartments with security and all the cheerful money. At the same time, mass dirt, unemployed and many cases live in abandoned cars or apartment hallways. Most population and fog have taken a serious toll and the future looks really terrifying! <br /> <br /> I do not really explain why Rich Man was dead and could not live a terrible truth - it could ruin the movie for you. However, the film has a great story and acting and is exciting to watch. In addition, Edward G. Robinson described Hastan as a crushing muscular in his final screen appearance. It's a great science fiction film, although it's not easily frustrating or lacking in short, it's authoritative and deep.
