Eight simple rules have begun as a very entertaining series. <br /> <br /> I love the best part of the show with John Ritter and his character Paul Hennes and his children. <br /> I always preferred Kerry Bridget. <br /> <br /> Early episodes Paul and Kate were a fun, good young young plot of discipline. The kids, though I think John Ritter died when the show has lost it's sparkle. I admired the cast and crew I hoped to continue with the series, but when he died I thought I was participating in the show. The total point of the show was based on the '8 General Rules Guide to Dating My Teenage Daughter', written by a real person with teenage daughters and the relevance of the relevance and appearance changed without Hennessy's father <br /> <br /> Bridget seemed more worried, Similarly, Kate always has his children's life lessons It was ridiculous when giving it to Paul before. I feel Granddad is funny (especially when he's looking for the Great Escape) but feel the C.J is unnecessary. He was funny in the episodes but thought that the lines of the story were similar to other American sitcoms during his arrival. Not all the new ones just are not mere excitement and it's working at Kate school for anyone and does C.J and GrandDaddy always find frustration there? Since I am very strong in the beginning, I would always recommend this presentation to friends because it is valuable for Paul and Kerry.
