Anne Bronte's epic novel The Windfell Hall's tent should be studied and studied throughout schools and libraries and people's rooms. Its fantastic story and alcoholic and damaged weddings and mothers tell the truth of "true" to keep his son away from his brutish husband. Today's stories are the same as we see and hear and I believe that many people can learn from reading this book. The author is based on real experiences that came back in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Let's look at this movie, a great version of the book and it's very moving. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Anne was happy that she was prepared. <br /> <br /> Exciting acting and great positioning.
