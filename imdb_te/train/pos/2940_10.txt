I came first on Deliras, I only heard. I listened to the whole comedy and I never laughed in my life. Eddie's ability to paint images in hilarious minds and to make a great simulator attractive. When I finally saw him, I had to have it. Eddie Murphy's performance on Delerius shows his genius! Since it was the new millennium, his actions in 1983 were just funny. My parents love teenagers and I (age eighteen). From that point on, I see Murphy's other movies like Coming to America and Harlem Nights. There are no other comedians like Edy.
