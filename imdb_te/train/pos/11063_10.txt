I was totally impressed by Shelley Adrianne's "Waitress" (2007). This film only confirms what is clear from the movie. Adrian is an outstanding talented author-director, original and unique artist. She was shown with unfortunate humor and real warm positive and manual attitudes of everyday life. Andy Shetty steals with a spectacular performance as the woman falling on the edge. Reg Roggers, like male leader Zad Nelson, is good. Ben is also a great character by foolishness. <br /> <br /> "At the end of the film," The Bastard Song ", the song is a positive inspiration for her: <br /> <br />" <br /> <br /> If you want to eat through the rain <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
