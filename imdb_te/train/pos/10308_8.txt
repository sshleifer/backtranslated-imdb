Morgan Freeman is more than God than George Burns? This film is definitely better than "Oh, God". I walk completely and through all the way through LMAO. Kerry Anamman was out of Warnebe, and Aniston played the role of a frustrated girlfriend for her most well-known performance. I, for one, did not consider her ugly or untalented either. I think my favorite scene is when I open the file cabinet thinking that Kare will never achieve her biography. See if you can find the file in a cabinet containing events of his bathroom comedy: I ​​am moving up this. Well written and even better played, this humor will go down one of the best of this funnyman.
