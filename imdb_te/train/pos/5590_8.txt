<br /> <br /> In this story, many viewers understand that the film is wrong with the film, which is in the slam-bang scenario of today's snippet experience. In that context, the film like Ecstasy wandered from another planet. <br /> <br /> The film is a poet, especially on the hills surrounding the hills, trees, clouds and so on. The world that man and woman connects into his fold. These reveal the almost totally unseen style and size from today's technology-based center, where rapid editing editing works to draw attention to the audience and not to focus on it. In addition, the story tells the story and the eye through the eye, almost without dialogue. It is in the amount of another extreme departure from today's literary fare, as visuals are only counting when audiences are enthusiastic. But perhaps quite unhappy - this film is quietly silent sometimes, because we do not think silent films are silent. But the characters in the sense rarely speak when we expect them. In this way, the burden of the story shared between the filmmaker and the viewer. <br /> <br /> Previously, we need to think about these visuals, and let the visuals be remembered in the past. -making. It is simpler to say that a movie like Matichis comes from today's very different aesthetics. I do not say I'm good or worse. Nonetheless, Eustacee refers to a tremendous perspective from experience in the film today, where such contemplative values ​​are slowly and frustrated. <br /> <br /> The film has a number of artifacts, but with a beautifully composed beer-garden scene, artistic heights with a growing shot to reveal a delicate tease under its final crane. The rural pans are amazingly expressed with lifestyle, nature and reproductive panchayat celebrations. This is kind of spectacles not to overwhelm you, but instead - given half the chance - a sponge tingling of a "jaw" stirring quietly into an experience that is memorable in its own way. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is sometimes heavily handmade, while the piles of paintings, especially in the final, ode-to-work order. It's hard to know that this is a disruptive presence. Probably having a heroic dimension with symbolism, there is a loving hero and common people - a background with the influence of the Soviet film is promoted. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I agree that I first tuned the head to see the beautiful Heidi Lamar. But now I've got more than just a peek-a-boo romp in the woods in this process.
