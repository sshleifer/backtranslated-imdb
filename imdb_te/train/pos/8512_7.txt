I can tell you how bad this movie is. I am in this film and I have not seen it yet, but I'm afraid to pay someone to see me drinking. Especially considering what we had that year. The thing is they are probably over edited over. Especially my colleague was hit by the Mexican prostitution (they had to be around him). We get some come and go shows but since I can not really remember anything. I have been in MC for some scenes (from what I have told you that everyone has removed the camera crew, either a thrower or a girl who showed her the world (or losing her wallet) to the world .The entire trip was crazy but people were on camera Different.
