When I fell on the cable on this film, I hugged it completely. The story of the Surfers team, which can move large waves and waves, moves the waves to repel the waves that are scared of any logical person. There is nothing special about this film, it's the two most interesting people that talk about what they are doing and lets talk about them. Surely there are sights on them surfing, but this movie makes people so special. Here are a bunch of boys who are enthusiastic about what they are doing crossing the people looking at. Half way into this film you should go off and learn the surf as well. Some documentaries may be interested in making movies of its movies better and more relevant to its great films. Look at this.
