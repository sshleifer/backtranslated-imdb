This film is really good because in Indian cinema these days, what you see is skin, music and bad acting ... you can see some tradition, race and at least some fun ... It's all in Indian cinema! After seeing this movie, you can at least be aware of all the big overtreat music or any violence, its truth, it's about love, and care for the course you love in life ... it's a wonderful movie ... kids can be seen without a doubt , And the adults enjoy the perfectly lavish simplicity of India ... this rap Its, minkiskits and become a part of it until the skin shows.
