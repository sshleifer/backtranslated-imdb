I remember trying for a few minutes of this film, I'm surprised I do not watch all, from director Steve Gordon, directing his only film heart failure before dying. Mainly Arthur Bach (Golden Globe winner, and Oscar nominated Dudley Moore) has everything he owns, a building, a butler Hobson (Oscar and Golden Globe winner, and BAFTA nominee Sir John Gielgood), and booze. When he married the daughter of fellow millionaire Burt Johnson (Stephen Eliot), he and his family were selected Susan (Jill Eyecherberry). Instead, Arthur holds the Queen's Waitress Lido Marola (Golden Globe Liza Minnelly), who is a legendary threat and his father's 3/4 fortune from Stanford (Thomas Barbour) and Aunt Martha (Gerald Fitzgerald). After Hoffson's death, Arthur disobeyed the family's wishes on the wedding day, but the aunt Martha still gives Arthur's legacy to live with Linda, a true love. John Bentley as Perry and Peter Evans as party guest. Andr√© Peter Bach, Anne Perl Bach, Justin Johnston, Mrs. Nesbit, Florence Tharole, Marissa Copeland as Marcela Lothare as Mrs. Moore is a sweetly funny and nearly drunk millionaire, preferring Minella as a woman who loves and Gaillwood Moore's humorous satirical satirist makes it a great Oscar winner as an amazing screwball comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Song, which was nominated for Best Song, Screenplay List Direct Directly, which was "Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Come") (which won the Golden Globe Award) (which is 100 years, 100th out of 100 songs) , BAFTA nominated for Anthony Asquit Award for Burt Bacharach for Film Music, a comedy / musical Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture. Sir John Gielgood was ranked 35th on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was 53 in 100 years and 100 Laughs. Very nice!
