The film is unique because it is overlooked ... It's a different story that shows how to survive or continue, and if you have open heart, you may find the ability to love an open mind. I saw the first of these cables in the late 70s and really had the limits of homosexuality at the time. I believe that the film will move forward in a little bit of life as a messy way. This is a standard in the sense that it is precursor to what is now widely described as a family. Mega Foster's extraordinary general performances & Perry King may be recognized, but we still have to go to where we come and still have relationships where this film should be available on DVD / VHS.
