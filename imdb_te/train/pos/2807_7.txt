I caught the last half of this film on cable one night cable and struck it by how much ill it was. Even when one of the two sufferers degrades him, the camera goes on. Moving and damping the shots of the images that he has taken out of his body and his concentration-camping body. Do not watch this movie if your superstition. Do not look again if your feeling is really cool.
