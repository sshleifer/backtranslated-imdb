Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. Brown (named by some people) with cerebral paralysis in my left foot, entitled an insulting, violent bush in Gandhi of the New York, as the worst Christie, as New York Gangs (ten times stronger than Adrian Brody in the pianist). His characters influence each friend, but each one is unique, and totally unique. He is completely transformed, he takes on each character. I'm beginning to believe he can work on anything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He does not make fun of the character, and he does not feel the role. Difficult to achieve. And Christie Brown comes to life. A wise man. An outrageous man. <br /> <br /> Despite the film, minor scene-transformation flaws and the like, it is an inspiration. Yes, this is predictable. But is this a stupid sentiment? No. I laughed. I cried. Cheese is not a moment. It is proof that this is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in my favorite scene restaurant when discussing Christie Eileen, Peter and her friends with artists. Here is Daniel Day Lewis an acting climax. "I'll kick you only as part of your anatomy that is animated." "Wheel out the wheel!" And his appearance is never slow, never felters, and is beautiful. Just. He has a screen time here too. <br /> I can see again, and I'm never tired of crystalline tiredness, turmoil, and loud lectures. <br /> You must see. Fo shoe, yo!
