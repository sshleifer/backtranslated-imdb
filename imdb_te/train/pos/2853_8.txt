I finally saw this movie after renting in Black Buster (VHS). I boldly accept the original. Yes, perhaps the characters are not fully absorbed, but it is not one of those films. Besides, we focus on the director's eye treatment, his focus on the story. And it does not stop. And to be honest, I did not want to. I believe that 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' and the Run, Lola, have influenced the director of the run. But I see the beautiful woman on the street to look at the three leaders for a while. I had to look at the director's other work because this film was really very interesting to me. If you want insight, culture, storm and speed, go somewhere else. If you want a laugh, watch the camera movement and criminal pleasure, here.
