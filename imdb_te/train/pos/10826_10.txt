I have rarely emerged from watching a film with such a warm, happy feeling. I was really good friends and I thought it was a wonderful time! I totally enjoyed this film. Acting was good, but I would definitely have to tell Bill Nay exactly the misleading performance. Bill is a wonderful actor and he wants to see him in more movies. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and they always like to see them when they are doing a great job. And Billy Connolly, as always, is absolutely gorgeous. It is an excellent ensemble performance from all relevant. Such a refreshing experience to see a well written, beautifully featured and good-looking movie.
