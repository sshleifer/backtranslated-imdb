This most productive film is entertaining to many people who do not see some more vague anime images. I enjoyed most of the time after the flat opening minutes, notably in the museum (the previous title sequence was quite entertaining and some of the nice bits of animation). James Garner became the commander and Leonard Nimay as King.
