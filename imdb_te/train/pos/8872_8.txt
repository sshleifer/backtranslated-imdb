The first film I saw in John Singleton and he was a good director. The film starts with a newly arrived group and many of them show what's going on. Omar Eppes has acted as a track actress with a partial scholarship and has had difficulty with his work. He made friends with ice cube and tyra banks. Christie Swanson's friendship with Jennifer Connelly, a great girl and a lesbian, and she is not sure about the way she goes. Michael Rapaport is a boy in Idaho, his neo-Nazis group and their leader Cole Hauser. The three main characters and Lawrence Fishburn are a political science professor trying to help them. It was a great movie and it was unfortunate that the studio would make a lot of cuts to the film.
