Recently, when we were growing in the 1950s and 19th centuries I was a friend and I was discussing academic and moral effects. She referred to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who wrote The Rye of the Ancient Mariner in 1798. Both of us need to read a piece of epic poem in English literature in high school and college.
