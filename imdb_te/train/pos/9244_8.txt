If you only read the compilation of the plot, the movie is quite distinct in the 1930s. This story is very modalin. The film 's strength and beauty is in live, earthly shows. I rarely see Jean Harlow's performance displaying such a range, her face is rich and subtle nuances. If you look at their faces in a wedding ceremony in Chapelle, there is a clear depth between the main characters. The raw emotions are quite honest, so true. The final sequence is almost unbearable: when Clarke Gabbal looked so joyous and surprised to his son, he was avoiding him and said, "My kid!" By the way, Mr. Goble's own son died after his death. This is the best example of Depression Red Cinema.
