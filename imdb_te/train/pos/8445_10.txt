Homeside: The Movie has proven to be a good writer, well-directed, well-directed series. At the end of the final season, the loose ends that are not properly addressed are tied up. The whole series, and especially the film, creates life (and death) in a culturally exclusive city with the most deadly heart rate in Baltimore. My attraction to the series began a long time before I went to Baltimore, but once I experienced life here, I realized how realistic it is. And the film definitely retains that soul. I will definitely miss the series's new original parts, but thank you for producers and the cast to give us last glimpse at the dark side of NBC and Charm City.
