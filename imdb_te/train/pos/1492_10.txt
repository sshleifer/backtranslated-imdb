A beautiful picture of Muksein's first love story. Perhaps one for each, and this author is the story of author-director Yasmin Ahmed with a boy called Mussain. Since her films have scenes on her personal experiences, we know her films are semi-autobiographical, translating these emotions to these screenshots and big screens, and her films always have a warm honesty and honesty. <br /> <br /> If mukusin is not different, and so far the most polished ad is a work (I have also added it as a personal bias, Sepet still has a special place in my heart). Back - Pak Atan, Mak Inom, Orked and Kak Yam, this time though, we go back to when Orked was 10. The characters we all got from Robben, from the movies that traveled with them, were all young, and here, Sharifa Amani's sisters Sharifa Aryan and Sharifa Alea respectively played the arcade and mac indome characters, which probably would come along with their amazing chemistry and never play their siblings not to mention. Adiqah is played by Katak Yum, and Pak Athan seems to have hair on his head. Through this film of ముసిసిన్, we come in the circle of the world, and the full circle of the world that Yasmin is familiar with us. We also came to learn and understand about the little family set up in their days of residing in their kumbuk (revisited in Roben), where Orked attended the Chinese school, and some serious injuries you wonder about the explosion of energy in Gubra, Included!). The perpetrators of the permanent family and the family are unwilling to play with the children, playing with the more "masculine-masac" with the girls, and the fancy outings are going to have football matches with the family. Cycling through the villages, climbing trees, flying kites - provides a cool peer for the archdiocese with the arrival of a boy called Muksin (Mohammad Saeed Naswip) in the village. <br /> <br /> Both of us want to cross the line between beautiful emotions, friendship and romance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Increasing the story of the Muscin, the events, we would have experienced it, and sometimes the childhood is a throwback to our own recollections. In short, the scenes are "pleasant" shouting! We are very nice to some neighbors, others, nasi parks and rumor mongers, notice life in a normal kampung spreading the unhealthy spread that arise from envy. <br /> <br /> There are 2 additional family dynamics, from immediate neighbors, and from the ownership of the residual, both as adequate subplugments and Orchid's own contrary. <br /> <br /> As always, Yasmin movies have been used exclusively for the songs, and for Muksin, with her father's song "Hujan" as well as "Me Me Me Quitte Pass", where Yasmin's films are concentrated in the same characters, The beauty of it is when you see them standing alone, or when they are together and pieced, interracial sex, Rema, and forgiveness are universal issues, such as dealing with specific themes and makes a compelling family drama. New audiences are curious to know some stories or recurring characters or events, but fans such as a pudgy boy stealing a glance at the Orchestra will surely look back at most links in the Muccin. <br /> <br /> And the parts of the Muslim are very interesting, which is probably the distinction or the consciousness of Yasmin style. As a story about childhood, I remember the memory, then there are definitely details. <br /> <br /> The mushroom did not show up all these details, but was focused on what was important among the two. <br /> Another highly recommended picture and rare I think it's right for all ages - take your child's brother or sister!
