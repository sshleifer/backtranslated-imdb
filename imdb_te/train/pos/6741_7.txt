The title sequence shows people pressing credits written on a rain-soaked pavement; The album mocks Alfred Newman's "Street Scene". Then we meet Dett. Sgt. Mark Dickson (Dana Andrews), his old man, always wanted to be: the person on the right side of the law. But he's pretty vicious for a good guy. After several complaints against his crowded people, his employer, Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon) praises him. Foley says he is a good man, but he needs to get his head straight and be like a debt. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tommy Scalies (Gary Merrill, in excellent performance) has an illegal dice game and ted Morrison Harry van Gell). Her husband is too late to her and uses her as a diego, and Pinevin strikes her when she refuses to play. The courageous Morrison intervenes but the pine falls cooler. It feels bad, but then it dies to die; Pine sees guilt. <br /> <br /> This is not the story above. Dickson soon fell in love with Morgan, but before losing his anger and a terrible document he was trying to hide. Morgan's father, a story-spinning taxi driver (Tom Tully), can take rap for it. <br /> <br /> It is up to Dixon to call blame on skelel. <br /> <br /> Vato Primerman William L. Stuart directs Ben Hugh in the novel "Night Cry" and presents a script for three others. With these amazing performances and all the shadowy photography and hate morality we look forward to from this genre is a solid film noir. The studio seems to have been portrayed to appease the senses, which will last until the end of lights. However, "Laura" starring Primer's classic Noir, Andrews and Tearney. You'll enjoy it, but you can not lose it.
