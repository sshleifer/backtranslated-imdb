It's just a 4-rate movie as a movie, but it's enough for fans of the 1940s, which is almost-must-see and rates as a 9-kind show! I saw this film to play the role of Colonel, who took over the role of Richard (Captain Midnight) Web. Doris Day's amazing performance made me wonder. Outside the Kamami Jane, I did not see her singing more than her song here. Randolph Scott is much better, even if he does not see much screen time. It's been a while since I saw the film, but I know that Humphrey Bogart is in a show. With so many familiar faces, it is hard to track. If it changes to a TV station near you, hold Doris Day Sequence, if nothing else!
