You are using IMDb. <br /> <br /> Some of your favorite films have given you some more votes. <br /> There is something you like. <br /> It's all due. Fifty seconds. One world ends, the other starts. <br /> How can not it be given ten? I wonder at those who want to give this seven or an eight ... exactly how did the first film? For the record, long, still great shot of the opening shot, an incredible discovery, the situation fits perfectly. And the dog on the bike is a lovely touch. <br /> The term is used in anti-second sec.
