The National Lampoon Class Reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80s, with some great music from the unique characters, the laugh map and the chuckberry. Walter Bailor leaves the opportunity to retaliate in his class reunion when his colleagues are completely insulted at their high school graduation. He is one of his classmates who have an innocent blind girl, a horny man, a high school beauty, the king of all the preps, and the ugly old dining lady who hangs all the children during high school. This is a sort of scary element in the movie and it has some brief scenes of sexuality so I do not recommend it for younger children but it's a great movie for teens. You may not like Class Reunion, if you're looking for a movie with a beautiful score, complex characters or killer special effects. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and some great laughs and a lot of fun (and not who) this movie should be on your list of movies. ++,
