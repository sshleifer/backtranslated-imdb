I could see this movie every weekend of my life and it does not get sick! Acting, scripting, directing and the general concept of the film was made of every aspect of human emotion very awesome. It's been a long time since I actually saw a movie that would reflect from the choke, the worst from laughter and the feeling of every intent that comes through this most amazing work! We need more movies like this !!! Mike Binder: Are You Watching ???
