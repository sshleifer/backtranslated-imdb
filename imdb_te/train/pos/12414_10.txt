Renee Harlin's first American film was one of the finest jail-set horror films of the late 80s (such as "Death House" or "The Chair"). Twenty years earlier, Garn Lane Smith was executed by a wrongly condemned person. Now, he's a newly restored prison warden, and the man's ghost is back for bloody revenge. This atmospheric and most moody movie contains lots of horror gore and violence. Viggo Mortensen, Small Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are the beginning of an entertaining carnage.
