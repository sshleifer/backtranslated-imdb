I was disappointed by Adrian Padrar in the past because this took me to a surprise, but when he delivered the humor and real emotions he made perfect balance in the show, avoiding the pores and mourning. Always-amazing Julie Waters is amazing here, and anyone in the Rita who was studying in 1983 should not rent her immediately. The rest of the supporting roles are also well played, and many are amazing. It's fun.
