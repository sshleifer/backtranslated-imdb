Now I would love to do the puppet work of Full Moon. But robot jokes should be one of the best projects. Yes, you heard me. The story is amazing work, the atmosphere really works and the actors make the first rate job. Gary Graham, who really made his mark on TV in programs such as ALIEN NATION SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, shows that he is asset kicks and action star. Stop motion effects were smaller. The color is wrong, they look plastic instead of metal that they think. But if you like Gary Graham or other full Moon movies, a small complaint compared to the amount of robot jokes, then you like this movie. 9 Stars out 10.
