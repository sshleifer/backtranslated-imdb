What can you say when you find a good French film that draws a mysterious story with the social background of characters? The main character is we believe those characters and we want them to be together once they meet each other. It's simple and really effective. The background story is less important. Why does the screenplay go towards a half-thriving thriller? It helps not to get caught up in social shows that many French film-gakers do. Not quite amenable, correct: Sur MÃ¨re Les is an entertaining French film that is a good entertainer. <br /> <br /> The ending for all the clever Nair points in the screenplay is very simple. It's in the Rear window (which is a clear indication and definitely not a noir film) but it becomes much easier as a very compelling case. I was amazed where the observation officer's role was not cleared. He brings far less to the story; We wonder if we missed the front part when he appeared alone. Jacques Auditor is not a new actor yet. Strange and weird.
