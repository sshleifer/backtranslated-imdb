I H.R. Pufnstuff and dashingly grew up with talented Jack Wild and now my daughters are very much loved by Jack Wild's fans. The film should be fun and entertaining. This movie is not limited to children. The dialogue is directed by most adults and Witchiepoo's performance is something you do not want to miss. The music in the film is Jack Wild and Mama Cass. And as Jack Wild Fan, I'll never have to watch him dance or hear him sing. Jack has made this movie even more awesome, especially the early song "If i eye cut". It pauses me in loving worship to give my children the wonderful childhood memories I'm going for now. Let's go all living island with friendship and happiness! And keep Jack Judd's memory alive to others by playing Pufnstuff.
