Paris, Jay Tam (2006) is a 18-segment film. You can do math - 18 episodes in 120 minutes means each director has to say seven minutes or his story. The film depends on the story that you can tell a story in that short story. Composition works. Almost all the divisions are powerful, complete and satisfying. Everyone offers a different thing to the Paris experience, and almost every director gives outstanding performances from the cast of the great and near-great actors. <br /> <br /> There are very powerful images in this movie, choose one or two favorites. Perhaps the most memorable for me was "Place des Victories," as a mourning mother in the Zen Rowlands, Jolie Bino in the "Kleititie Latin" Catalina Santino Moreno "Lloyd 16ème" and Margo French learned to speak French as Margaretle herself Paris Can be visited (in the "14ème Arrondissement" section). <br /> <br /> In the "Paris metro station" (segment "toilets"), an American traveler is never disturbed, especially for the Guliver heck. My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months, so we can surely catch some of the missing mini points. However, Paris is very beautiful, I will try to see it on the big screen. In any case, do not miss it!
