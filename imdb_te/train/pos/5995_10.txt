I'm not sure whether it's right or wrong, but before I see a young person I'll do the other comments. I have to say that I have disagreed with many negative comments or problems. <br /> <br /> The director / producer of "Lawn Wolf" wants to see things that I do not necessarily want from the incentive, but the people wet their feet like me. When I read from a first-timer, I appreciated the work. Courageous job in that regard! There are some comments about music. I thought it was good for a piece. Some people came to the hole with it, but I did not necessarily know that (and us) were created without understanding, and when he started gun and started crunching the guitar wires, it's like we know there is a train on the track, but it's moving now. Yes there is a 180 degree slip / clip, but shi * happens. Anyone can see Hug's dirty shirt white (at the end, in the rain) "Australia"? How much money and people are behind that movie! Give Pause for Kid Gods! I think everything has done well. The two things that I mentioned are not rarely mentioned-not to walk up to the glittering brass frame with the camera, I'll show a splitter now so I can remove the shots at first, but people are not necessarily <br /> <br /> My experience So far it is not difficult to make a movie, it takes time to learn how to do it, then actually do not have time to do it Stir, and then you have the "post-production time!" Before you can call, it will take some time to think about all the details you have to shoot and kill. IMHO, Director / Writer Ryan Geoffrey has done his work, and if this is really his first report card, I call him "A". The rest of you will report to a head office for the son.
