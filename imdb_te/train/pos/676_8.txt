'The Last Wave' is more than the sum of its parts. It's not just a catastrophe, just the Australian Sun is not searching for primitive spirituality, and certainly more than a simple court drama. Writer / director Peter Weir has been conducting these items to the next level two years ago, producing really effective and thought-provoking film with the same paddy climate given to Picnic et Hanging Rock two years ago. Burton (Chamberlain) Aboriginal 's back to protect Charles Lee (Gulpple) Iii called upon to preserve, and he is directly responsible for the vahincaledu, Lee from the truth, but when it comes to understand that his ear. <br /> <br /> Burton has two days of horror with more horror than ever - Dream Time, two different levels of truth. 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' is a good memory because of its eternal mystery. We have run the same route, but we have to find the answers. In 'The Last Wave', we can tear all together at the end of the film. However, even with all the information, we should choose how much we believe, because the movie takes us beyond the boundaries of our general reality. <br /> <br /> Production of the Doom is gradually improved at every stage of production, great effectiveness, budgeting, soft lighting, heavy rain and sound. Random music is simple and never big. Richard Chamberlain disappointed the audience when he tried to reveal the mystery. <br /> <br /> <br /> David Gulpplel is caught up in two worlds, wants to do the right thing, but he fears because he fears. <br /> <br /> All together, Weir is a familiar name in the film for thirty years. Seriously recommended.
