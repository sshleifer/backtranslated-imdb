I am fine with this movie. It has animals, it has beautiful music, and it has my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. Now, I still like this movie for different reasons. It has a well-trained animal with a variety of acrobatics and scenes in the camera. It's beautiful, well-written music that fits perfect scenes, exciting quick melodic and heart wrenching main theme, still makes me cry. People ham it too. And my favorite actor is Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you do not know what you say, Depending on the water fear of a sauce, and a street-smart ridicule interesting and slightly nerve bulldog, the possibility. When their family leaves, those three friends are taken to a farm. Dismayed and worried, pets are out and planning across Sierra Mountains for their life's tour. A truly amazing journey. So what, maybe home is just over that mountain. But what's that? <br /> <br /> I am giving three wonderful actors the voices to the main animal characters, and to anyone else ... yes, everybody will see it.
