This is undoubtedly one of the funniest films ever made. Amitabh is a country pumpkin, Arjun Singh, happy. The best thing is never stop laughing. The plot is a single old-fashioned story, which breaks away from dead parents, ultimately with a delightful reunion. There are villains (Ranjit) and brothers (Shashi Kapoor) and Whipplans (Pareen Babi) and lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather who is thrown off for a good collision. <br /> <br /> This film is about Amitabh and remembers everything you remember at the end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh brought a very respectful lifestyle to the city and his conversations and habits were fun. After the movie he turns Angry Angry Man He is famous but humor. <br /> <br /> In his memoirs, his walking, talking and speaking English, song (Pad Gungur re-band, Meera Nachi Thi) and everything else with his daddo. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh, it is his best. It can easily give a 10/10.
