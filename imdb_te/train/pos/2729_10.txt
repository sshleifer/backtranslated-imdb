I'm good at acting, not for content. After reading the book the film reads, then watching the movie. Two ex-vans traveling to their destination to steal money from a safe person who is still in prison. During the ride, the tension begins to mount, the soundtrack in the movie adds to the whole imagination. After the killers finish their work, the next morning morning, the daughter's friend will find the remnants of the family. The blood tear scream that struck the scene on the telephone with a cut cord really gave me the cold and cold of my blood. The murders have met their borders and have a small convenience to this frivolous family. Robert Blake is amazing in his role as Perry Smith. The book was written greatly by Truman Capote.
