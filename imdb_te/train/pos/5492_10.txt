I was briefly impressed with Chavez's attitude against globalization, but I saw the movie at the Amdon Documentary International Film Festival, and I realized what he really achieved. The film tells the story of a conspiracy / conspiracy by corrupt western governments who love democratically elected President Chavez and return to Venezuela's return to the brutal dictatorship of Venezuela's oligarchs, oil companies and oil companies. This film is a must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice, and is also a lesson for the rest of the world! I appreciate Venezuela's people to protect their country from such people as HoneyBut and the Bush regime.
