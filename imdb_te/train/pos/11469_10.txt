Everyone knows about this 'Zero Day' event. I think how Epiphant did this film, let's see how many guys we see. They showed their life a year. Throughout the film we love them and laugh with them, even though we know what we do. And it gives me chills. I felt guilty that I was hurt by their comments and I thought the call was a sweet person. Did you know what happened to me? And when they commit suicide and if they decide to do it in 3 or 4 years, I think this is funny but I still fear that their heads will fly. In fact I am. I loved them. They were evil, perhaps, I thought they were really normal guys, and it really did not. <br /> <br /> This is the IMO, the main power of the film. Our friends, or relatives, or anyone can do crazy things, and we can not see it. This film, it's good, I felt bad. That's why I can not sleep. This little feeling in my stomach is still there. Butterflies.
