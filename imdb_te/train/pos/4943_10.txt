<br /> <br /> Freeman is a great actor but sometimes he is involved in bad projects. This is not one of those times. <br /> If the films are long and long and not good, in less than a hour, it's a little more than fifteen, the characters are very early (the great depictions of them by Freeman and Vega), the short of background information on them The piece is realistic, although Morgan is less frequent to his director's name but has never been suggested,   ా సంతృప్తి చెందాడు మరియు అతను ఒక స్క్రిప్ట్ కు కట్టుబడి భయపడ్డాడు, మరియు ఒక ఇండీ చలన చిత్రంలో ఒక పాత్ర కోసం పరిశోధన చేస్తున్నాడు, అతను కొన్ని సంవత్సరాల పాటు చలన చిత్రాల్లో నటించాడు, స్టోర్ / సూపర్మార్కెట్ మేనేజర్. The story falls in a tough neighborhood in a supermarket, where he meets the cashier of 10 items or less (Vega) and forgets to pick him up with "Ride". /> <br /> The roadway in many ways, Morgan has shown each of his incomparable smile and a positive view of laughing and quirks, showing an accomplished actor who trained his mind to define each one whom he sees (by character, the Penelope Cruz is more beautiful than the Penelope Cruz Is more beautiful than the age of 25) Estundi. The end job. <br /> <br /> It is a tachy, but there is a lot of dialogue, but the balance between light and fun and intense and sadness, the last 20 minutes for the longer screen of the theater is begging but mistakenly the nature of the story, so give from the director Not a good call
