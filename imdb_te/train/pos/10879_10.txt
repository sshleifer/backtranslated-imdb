I want to see the cut from the day I heard it last year. Anyway, I started watching today, when I started the film, I started instead of week but it came 10 minutes later. I thought the movie was very good. But the thing I did not like was how the killer created, I was thinking before I rented that probably would suck like urban legends: the last cut, I almost died of it. Everything in the UL Final Cut needs to be improved. Final cut: better than 100 UL. The best part of the CUT is killer and death scenes. <br /> I would cut 10 to 8 people
