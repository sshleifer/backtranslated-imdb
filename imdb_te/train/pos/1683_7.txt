I saw this movie as a second feature in a disc containing a previously banned video Nasty 'Blood Rights'. Since Blood Rites is absolutely awful, I do not really expect much from this film. But in fact, it would seem that the worst director Andy Milligan himself has surpassed this time as the seeds of the worst are longer than blood rites tops and sick sexy sixties. The plot is actually equal to blood rites because we focus on an extraordinary family unit, and of course; There is a legacy in stake. The picture is filmed in black and white, and it's the look and feel of me is very much reminiscent of Trash classic 'Curious Doctor Hum'. There was no gore in the show, the director was eager to attract sexual attention and by shutting out promise and hatred. Acting is usually trashy, but most women seem to be naked at some point and despite a poor reputation, director Andy Milligan actually has an eye for this sort of thing, actually there are a lot of scenes in this movie beautiful. Plate paper thin, and most filler; But the music is impressive, and the director also has very sexy scenes, surprisingly, romantic scenes. Overall, this is not a great movie; But it can appeal to the cult fan, and the better known and the lower the quality than the 'Blood Rights'.
