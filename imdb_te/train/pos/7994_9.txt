I liked this movie too. It's dark, it's not bullet-dodging, car-caching your brain action movie. The backgrounds and motifs of the characters are very obscure to the eye and allow the viewer to come to their own conclusion. <br /> <br /> It is inspired by the desire to be in love or revenge or to repent - for what he thinks is "right". 'Will God Forgive You for What We Have?' Oral men can not answer - so what he does is to do what he's doing, he's always trained what he's doing. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington is a great actor - honestly can not think of a bad movie he did - and he made a great helper. I will recommend this film to anyone.
