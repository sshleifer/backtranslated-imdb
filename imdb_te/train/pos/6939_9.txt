I am very impressed with this movie. I have to rate it as one of the best classic era Westerns. <br /> <br /> Throughout this period: acting, matured dialogue, no-nonsense story and amazing cinematography. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann is the director of many photography film makers of the same age. That is the same picture-noir look. Man and Jimmy Stewart worked with many Western countries during this period. . <br /> <br /> If you like this movie Man-Stewart's film "Bend of the River" is the prestigious Winchester 73 Rifleman , A weapon that won the fair and square in a competition. It stole the villain from the villain. <br /> <br /> In this interesting story, Stewart Act help Shelley Winters, Don Duria, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Gryre and J. C. Flippen included. They are happy to see them. However, Rock Hudson is an Indian ("Young Bull"), but you do not have everything.
