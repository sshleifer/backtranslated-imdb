When I initially heard about the title, I thought of 'The Simpsons', like most other critics, I saw the cast, I was totally amazed, and the great role-actors actually had! First we played the role of Macbain, the title character Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction). He saves from a Vietnam POW-Camp from some of his buddies, one of the Santos (Chick Veneera, Anks) and McBain (loading with Vietnam soldiers), leaving the One Day Dolly Bill, <br /> <br /> After 18 years, Santos And his sister Cristina (Maria Conchita Alonso, The Running Man, Predator 2), together with the rebels, their nasty dictator in Colombia, El president (Victor Argo, Taxi Driver, King of New York) when trying to get rid of Santos Mission fails, Christina goes to Melibine. <br /> <br /> Mc Bain asks his good ol 'Vietnam buddies to help him. Originally Token was a strict black man, starring in director James Gilkenhas's previous film, "The Exodemator" directed by Steve James of Eastland, "American Ninja", where the real name of the landlord was also coincidental. I'm not. There are other references to the funeral, among other things, McCain masks in a mask when he first looks at him while working on a welding job. A bridge! <br /> <br /> Other guys in Vietnam-Pack: All kinds of accessories for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers), and Doc, Dalton (Jay Patterson), IMDb Connecting, <br /> <br /> And in other large roles, we have been told that Louis Guzman (Louis Guzman) N (Luis Guzman), Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way), as a small-job-dealer could get a good job. Also, Drug bokalley Drug Bockley, hanging in a crane on the roof by the Macbain-gang, nearly hanged himself on a meat-grinder by John Eastland. The destroyer movie! Now, I do not see Glickhaus' "Shake Down / Blue Jean Cap" yet, but I'm ready to bake a half-a-dollar bill that has been packed in the film! <br /> <br /> Return to the plot of the movie .. They go to Columbia and save the day. But who cares about the plot, the cast is great, and the action scenes are well done, and you never get bored while watching this movie! Highly recommended for all Action lovers!
