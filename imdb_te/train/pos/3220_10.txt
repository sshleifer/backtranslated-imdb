Souls Academy Acting or Lukas may not have special effects, but it definitely makes me. I do not tell you about it, you've already read the summary. This is a great doomed future action / science fiction movie. Kurt Russell can not say much, he usually has a strange or drone look on his face, but it fits the character. There are great action and fight scenes; Some scenes are unrealistic, but believe in Hollywood land to escape our normal lives. I did not see Sainior 2 but it was one of my favorites. I'm fortunate enough to have a wife dug on the guy movies; We both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes tough guy / sci-fi movies.
