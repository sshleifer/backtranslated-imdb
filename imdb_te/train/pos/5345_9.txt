Yesterday my Spanish / Catalan wife and I saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain again led to a political confrontation. That's why this masterpiece should be shown in all Spanish high schools. This is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminal of fascism. The American pilot, who joined the Spanish Civil War, chose a democratically elected Republican government. One of the most inventive scenes Uribe has ever done is surprisingly well-known criminal character. The colors are amazing. The cruelty of a war (can not anyone tell the difference between a war and a civil war?) The scenario of hope is when two children express their feelings and save one another. The coward who started their abuse of innocence with innocent children is now active again. 'El Niagaze de Carol' / 'Carroll's Travel' is one of the many sad stories of the 20th century. This is a good lesson in history in any book. Another great work from Peninsula Iberica!
