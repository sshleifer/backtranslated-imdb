Beginning with the film's remake of a classic, the rating must already be reduced. <br /> <br /> When the United States government is scared of one of its own citizens, it plays the lead role in Viggo Mortensen. Jason Priestley from the movie sounds like the character! But it is true, the government will do anything possible to destroy a person's life for trying to get into his wife's home. <br /> <br /> "For some time the police were protecting his wife from being pregnant in this country." Words of the disc jockey <br /> <br /> There are some great scenes of the scene in this movie, and along the great car and very spirituality. After a lot of consideration, I gave the film 7.
