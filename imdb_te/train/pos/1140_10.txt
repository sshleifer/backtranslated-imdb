I'm a fan of this movie for years and years. Due to the hot hatches in the slum, I had to close that shelf and see it. Why did the people who came back in 1991 exceeded me? Sally Field and Kevin Klein are excellent. Even though I never seen daytime soap operas, this film kills me every time I see it. The acting for comedy is the second and the script is very smart. If you do not already have it, you'd love to see it. You are Elizabeth Shui, Woopti Goldberg, Teary Hatcher, and Carrie Fisher ... to give you some spectacular performances.
