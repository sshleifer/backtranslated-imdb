The recapitulation: In the morning the morning of his bachelor party finds Paul is desperate by his mother-in-law and a sleeping woman beside him. Unfortunately, the waitress from the bar, and not his future husband. And suddenly she will change everywhere ... toll booth at the freeway at the Freeway and at the laws of his parents. And it's hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex-boyfriend followed him and photographed. It's not just to save his marriage ... it's about survival. <br /> Comments: Better than expected. The sweet romantic comedy that I had imagined, but with some slight fringe is something quite ridiculous. The film was not afraid to take some jokes. And when Jason Lee is half-afraid of his character and is deeply in trouble, he's now going to release a comedy when he's here. And he's got beautiful support from beautiful women Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. <br /> <br /> In fact, I felt that Laclin Munro played a good role in the former role. <br /> <br /> The importance of comedy is more important than romance, and the final result is good. <br /> I've enjoyed a lot. <br /> <br />
