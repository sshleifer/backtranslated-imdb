I do not think this way at all, but the first thing he considered after my friend heard "Midnight Cowboy" was a gay porno. At that time, I tried Jerry, trying to combine Jerry Prayer on the bus and Kramer's illness and a snail in the "Seinfeld" episode. <br /> <br /> The film is so great, surprisingly cheerful and I can not remember all the dull pessimism of all the movies, because they are all the worst. <br /> <br /> In this story, the infamous young cowboy Joe Buck wants to be a woman (a sexual harassment, mainly), which is considered to be an easy woman, a woman ends up hassling, charging him for his sexual encounters. <br /> Then he encounters Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, who is "rusto" by all and gorgeous homosexuals that make everyone happy. You feel him as a nasty, but a friendly person (like Han Solo or Lando Colrician) and surprisingly he and Joe are friends, and the film is very sweet and heartfelt. Rizzo is actually a very sad, pitiful man who is very ill and very depressed and self-conscious, he hates what he calls "rusto" and wants to go to Florida, where he thinks life is better and all his problems will be solved. Along with the joyous movements (like trying to steal), the food in the hippie party, and "Gee, well, you know, e "It's free, but I'm not stealth" "And that classic moment is completely unhappy and unexpected schedule is damaged by that taxi, and" Hey, I'm here! Joe Buck was a prominent and respected actor Jon Voitte, and Retso Rizzzo epic and beloved Dustin Hoffman. <br /> Then the main characters were not the first time they worked together, but a lot of chemistry Thick and intense. <br /> <br /> Then the sad part is too over for me to call it "discouraged" Ratso Rizzzo falls all over the film, just walking, coughing a lot, ill, and arrives at a head-point in the bus to Florida, where he is severely damaged, and miles away from Miami he eventually dies in the bus. <br /> <br /> You are 13 years old Even if you lose your dog, you want to go home, cry and scream, and the soundtrack shows all the time of pretty "Evirbons Talking" in the movie at appropriate times. An odd move, but a great one, the song is fine and perfectly fits in with the image tone. Let's see, it's good, buy it
