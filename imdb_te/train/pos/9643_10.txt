This film is everything. Emotion, Power, Affection, Stefan Rodeo's adorable naked beach dancing ... It also reveals the need for real internal traffic and external conversations in any relationship. Cedric and Matthew Gay do not mean that they do not have a very useful insight. I was classed as homophobic, but congratulated and loved by different people by homosexuals and homosexuals and bisexual people. Matthew's inability to maintain his emotions encourages our society not to work for us, and disagreements between him and Cedric. It must be sure to be !!!!
