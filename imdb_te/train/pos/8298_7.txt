Outstanding TV-TV is the best film ever, with an invitation to hell with amazing performers (Uriach, Lucy, Cassidy, McCarthy, Pre-Murphy Brown Joe Regalbutto, Soleil Moon-Fray) and a good fastest plot. Urich always liked and Lucy is the top mother of all female fetal characters. STEPFORD WIVES and the Kind of a Hybrid Version of LIVE, the film does not have many complaints until the soppy, maudlin denoument likely to be opening up to its apocalyptic Miltonesque vision and horror fans. 7/10
