The anti-German concept of the film is now painful, but this is an excellent example of great war-time campaigns. It was back when Cecil B. Demille was still a great director. (His next best film, Academy Awards, he never made a good sound). The film does not have much feelings in other films of Picker, in fact it is not DemiLe's movie, pickers. The 2000 "The Patriot" is comparable to the British as well as the wisdom of Germany. The film is a villain villain who has a reputable name for the good Germany Astraheem. They took an unfortunate trip to Pickford on a luxury ship that was torpedoed by the German submarine. So what do Americans get to move more into battle? Looking to sink Lucitana, or looking at America's favorite Canadian imports? Throughout his film DeMille, his protagonist goes from another kind of terrible disaster to death, hypothermia, abuse, rape, death penalty, and explosion, leaving her to the right place to keep her safe. The way the jury saved her from the firing squad is not reliable than what she had been told by men in the "Jurassic Park" was finally rescued from helicopters. If I were to make such a campaign strong, I punished myself for a German-German ancestor. <br /> Is not it a good movie? Aside from the humorous comedy about the Americans, do you think they are untouchables? Is it obviously a joke after that? You may not be entertained. You can find a little more melodramatic, and more clearly than one hand, but the first thing that came to my mind after the watching was the year before the false image of Potenin's massacre, as well as the film's ability to revolutionize the cinema language. It surprised me: what happened to Cecil B. Demille? His ambition between the sound of the sound and the "Greatest Show on Earth" seemed to be lost. Ben who are expensive, but not ambitious. In one sentence, this film is 1) Film historians, 2) Silent Film Buffs, 3) Mary Pickford Fans, or 4) Demil Fans, if any such person.
