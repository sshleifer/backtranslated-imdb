Finally, an indie movie that offers some great fears! I see a lot of horror films ... theatrical, straight-to-dvd, cable, etc ... and most of them are sucking ... Some are to be seen ... are also very small ... Dark Remains are one of the better ones. I caught the screening of the film at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience liked it ... and my wife and I loved it! There is no nominal number, the budget on this film is very small, but you do not know it ... the film is awesome ... acting is totally working ... the story is fine ... and the scares are great! Although most filmmakers focus only on scaring, they often forget about the development of stories and characters. Bryan Avenet-Bradley needs to know that the character and story are important. <br /> You know the two dice that care about the characters, and are very scared when they are in danger. <br /> <br /> Looking at the horror films that cost $ 80 million to $ 5,000, I found "Dark Remains" as one of the gemstones. Check out this movie!
