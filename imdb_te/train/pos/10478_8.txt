<br /> <br /> This is a must see for those who occasionally smoke those who smoke their secret confidential information in an attempt to escape parents, teachers, police and others. She is completely unaware that she is completely broke and cheated about the fact that she is a woman in her forties, her living in a building, orchids farming, and the so-called rich and honest husband. When he suddenly dies, she faces the truth. The lawyer comes by telling her that she is a huge debt. Her gardener did not know what to do with her until she told her about the recent success of marijuana in Britain.

I can think of some of the images that made me laugh more than these films. Still, there is a dramatic touch. The film is distinctive British: jokes are not obscene, there is no violence. It should not be specified as a recommendation to take some drafts before looking at 'save grace'. It's more fun! The scene is particularly fun with 2 older women in their tea shop. I thought my jaws would break. 9/10
