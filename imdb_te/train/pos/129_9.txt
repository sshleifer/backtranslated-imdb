With a thread of amazing cinematography and caffcasque absurdity, the film comes from the simplest yet lovely opening scene. The film plays a role in a dream, and I feel why people hate it or love it. The characters are filmed above and the story is mild and probably not a little pointless. But the film is wrong but conscious alternatives. The film works are not trying to work in history, but reconstruction of the 1940s war films. <br /> <br /> I would argue that the film has a very realistic material, but this film is a completely filmed movie. It is one of the most beautifully painted films, and its style has a wild imagination. I can understand why people hate, but I give 9/10.
