This is the feeling that you are seeing a string of clocks frequently encountered in the genre when you look at it and you know that the clicks are clicked only after copying from the movie They are great because they are great <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73" is a pleasure to see, although the wide range of plot is somewhat predictable, but you have seen that you have copied them several times in the movies, but it still has many twists that you are surprised. Direction, Direction and Man's direction are excellent. Stewart shines exclusively, and you're a fan Unusual, very thoughtful and / or witty lines go to very small characters because these characters (more so) do more than cardboard cutouts, which provide additional originality for the film. <br /> This is a very poor picture, and it's worth a look. This DVD also has an interview with Stewart, which provides some of the images.
