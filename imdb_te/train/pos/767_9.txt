I'm a real product of the hip-hop and electronic dance music genre, which is one of my favorite movies from time to time. Beet Street, but not a "standard" in some aspects of wild style, is a guarantor of the heart of the hearts of anyone who is proud of the urban model / DJ-based music and the culture of electro-club culture. /> <br /> If I admit that the conversation is somewhat cheesy at times, you can not help, feel for the characters and eventually the start of hip-hop culture in New York City "in the early eighties" in the early eighties. The B-Boy fighting scene at Roxy Nightclub (real-life, theme rock studio crew and real-time competition between NYC breakers) is essential to the archive of the hip-hop fan as a classic album. A B-boy / B-girl's athletic and stylistic skill for a long time really appreciate some of the breakers' movements in slow motion if possible. All praise due to Zulu Nation !!!
