When re-entered in the late 90s, I saw only the first part of the series and it was more likely to see three episodes through Netflix (convenient service by the way). All in all, I liked this lighthearted, sometimes challenging genre, short series. The young man falling for the elderly seems to work and the actors are good. Yes, it may have some romantic clicers running on a rain or train station, but if these characters are Tom or Hanks or similar, it may seem unattainable. Robson Green, sometimes a born-in-born born Scott Bacula, is the one who drives him in love and hesitates with desire and rejection and throws serious watching charges. Personally, I think I could make two episodes of the series, but this was for the talk that I wanted. Clearly, there is a sequel, and it should reach Netflix tomorrow.
