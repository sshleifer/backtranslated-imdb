Cold Blood 1967 is perhaps the "real thing" (Think about it: is we really want to see the real thing?), But it's black and white in the color world, and most people know what it is, and it's possible to remake for television. Plus, if you remade it, you can show some of the things that you did not show in the original. Truman Capote's In In Cold Blood was the first "non-fiction novel". In fact Truman's book is not 100% true for the real story. I thought I would like Canada City to be a pretty good Kansas for a TV movie. Look for sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll: the feminine of Dick, Perry playing an aspirin junk, Perry Blues guitar.
