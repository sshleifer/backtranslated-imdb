I'd say that the film is getting worse than the recent pictorial hood that Hollywood has cooked from her intestines. McCain is a real action film with more violence than most viewers. It contains the classic elements of the early 90s action action film in the late 80s ... unfortunately irreversible torture (ie, going to face drug dealers and staff money rather than taking their money and just taking their money), necks and fire Boys, boys who fly in the buildings, and buildings that are blown off by buildings Nilo the guys. Waking up to such memorable lines is Wacken's best in the movie, "Let's sit and put on .......... deck." And the film will make it available at the local video store to buy the top of the transparent rock. If you have a bloodlust for renting this movie these days for unnecessary random acts of violence and your thirst for satisfaction.
