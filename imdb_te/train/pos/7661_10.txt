Scanners II: The New Order is as good as the classic scanners of David Cromenberg, scanners created in 1980 and Scanners II in 1991, so their two words are eleven years gap. The scanner's style binds the scunter style, which is not the explosion on the head of the scanners, so the Scanners II is the first explosive scene with an upside-down, first scary. Scanners II: The New Order performs some other imaginative gory scenes. The New Order is a new decision in the series because the scanners find that a young scanner named David Kelam is used by him as a police chief and a vigilante for a team of scientists <br /> <br /> Scanners II: New Order is a great sequel to David Cronborg's science fiction classic scanners You should. Check it out. 10/10
