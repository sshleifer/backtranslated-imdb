I said, Clive Barker's Undeading is the best horror game ever made. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Evil Dead and Castlevania games but none of them, the game captured the pure pleasure of fighting its horrors. Barker is good for what he's doing, it's attaching horror to our world and in his hand everywhere is clear in this game. Heck is also in the game as one of his voice's main characters. Rare shots of a rare shoe and a stick of enough weather, Undeading is the best horror title to beat in my books. I wish that this made a consol system but would just want to nipped a poorly poor pc sales bud one.
