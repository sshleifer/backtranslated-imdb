I saw this as a child in the late eighties and I must say that the Galaxy Express is one of those films that are long in your imagination. If you did not understand the appeal of anime, Otaku-town that realizes this movie might be your golden ticket. <br /> <br /> The story is delicate and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. Cell animation, some traditionally, has a vivid style, which portrayed LeeGie Matsumoto's great talent for character design and visual heroism. <br /> <br /> The Wizard of Oz exceeds totally 'family entertainment' status and stands as a classic film in his own words. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this film.
