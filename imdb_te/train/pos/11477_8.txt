In my honest opinion, everyone should watch this movie at least once. This was really in perspective when I viewed it. Though it is fictional, this film is about something that happens to your child. <br /> <br /> How can two children easily hide their hatred for their school and their ideas of murdering innocent students. This movie will not work in any other format. <br /> <br /> April 20, 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Claybold killed 12 students and recalled themselves. It also reminds us of a media storm following it. Everyone wanted to see a rampt video and everyone wanted to see basement tape. <br /> <br /> This film is a fictional version of our dreams. <br /> <br /> The bad thing about this film is that it did not do well on the market, and some know that it exists. If there is a single preview in a blockbuster movie, everyone has seen what's about the big deal, Zero Day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This shooting takes only about an hour and a half minutes, as it focuses more on call and andre and what do they do at the time? <br /> If you still do not see this movie, go to it and see. As soon as I finish, I promise you no speech.
