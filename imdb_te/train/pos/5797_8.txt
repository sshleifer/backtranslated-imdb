<br /> <br /> When I was 6 or 7 years old, I saw the film in the movie. It's magical, beautiful and scary to me and my relatives. <br /> When we leave the theater, Michael does not know us well, even though we do not know him well. <br /> <br /> The film has been broadcast a few times but I have always changed the channel. It's a few seconds, but it makes me feel the magic again and warms my heart. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie only once. I believe that it is a good decision without seeing it. If I see today, I know that I have not helped, but I know MJ's acting, plot (if not) and this and that it criticized. I have this childhood memory, my feelings for a child who came from 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My adult self involves intervention, music, and music in my rating. But for a little boy who had seen awe for 20 years ago, it is definitely worth 10.
