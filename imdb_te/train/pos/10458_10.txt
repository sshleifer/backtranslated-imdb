The film is suffering from a serious panic aging disease. As a person who faces the likelihood of Alzheimer's or the number of families in the structured stages, I suggest that any health care person will recommend this picture to any family who is suffering from the disease. The film is primarily designed to speak to the patient's family and reach into the heart of struggle. The cast is excellent and dramatic description is outstanding with a commanding plot line too.
