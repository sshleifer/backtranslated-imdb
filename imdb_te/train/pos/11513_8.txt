One of my favorite shows was back in the 70's. When I was reminded it was broadcast on Friday (or possibly Saturday) in Nine Network (?) In the night of Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland are great. <br /> Each episode is usually a form of climax. <br /> <br /> "Who came back 'as a city / hospital was a massive electric current that started to kill people.' Last showdown Kolchak The 'power beast' was a short circuit in the middle of the explosion and threw flames.Oh well .... You had to be there but it was a very interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGavin always had a lot of power in his roles <br /> You certainly deserve a place in TV's "Hall of Fame" ... to quote Tony Vincezone ... 'Collachak You on I' ... Or, in the Hall of Fame, '!
