It's great work from the Swedish king, Mats-Helge Olson of the worst. The film of the film, made in rare Sweden, is still one of the most outstanding achievements in the Swedish film until today. Who will pay for these works? <br /> <br /> Russian nuclear scientist Marcov wants to make a mistake in Sweden. But his plans were kidnapped him by the Russian army and would not degrade him that he had come to Sweden. All these trickery continues to work in Markov's nuclear physics and revolutionize energy supply for the entire planet. <br /> <br /> The CIA is bent to bring Markov to the west and send their ninja to deliver him. <br /> <br /> The English-speaking Swedish actors, Mats-Helz, are well done in his next work. This creates a cheap B-image concept that is probably unmatched for performance. But besides this? Well-action live-to-video style is standard. Smashing giant clouds machine guns. Thousands of Russians die. <br /> <br /> People running in snowy ninja suits try to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> Really combat scenes are the most poor way of choreographed. I expect martial arts when they say "ninja" in the title, I expect the fight closer. But there are two or three sequences in this movie that are real martial arts. And they're happy. It's very bad that there is no word to explain it. Stop their hearts if the Ninjas have moved any slowly. <br /> Moreover, the whole movie ends in a bang showing a special-effects budget featuring food stamps and a receipt of McDonald's. <br /> What is the judgment? Instant classic of course. A film that has to be drawn with a large amount of thirty amounts is not built. The ultimate party image. Insert video and smile. It is important to understand that movies like this did nothing. <br /> <br /> This rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
