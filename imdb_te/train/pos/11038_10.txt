I was tied up from beginning to end. Great horror comes from horrific images and organic barriers you do not want to jump, but you go "f * ck I see?" All other commentators gave what little creations about the film, so I would not rehash what I already said. I told others about this film, if it looked me, it still haunted me. Even after seeing I was a bad thing, and I was a true horror fan who was not easily spooed by a trip like "The Grudge" or "Silent Hill". I've given bad dreams and I'm disappointed that I thought about what I was doing if I was in that cell in those guys. What's my personal horror? My subconscious took me there, and it was not fun. What would my friends do to you with a good horror movie! This is the best part of the film. It's not about the bogeymen you are going out, alien invasions, or gore tons. It is the opposite. The horror that creates in your own mind. The sarcasm horror for the four characters comes from the external force that makes it clear the power of energy on them. Simply, men ask for something they want, and they will get it ... but not as they imagined. So on the one hand, they get what they seek from an occult book, but in the end they want to have not. Sometimes it's best to be locked in jail cell!
