Canadian director Vincenzo Natal 90th took the Art House circuit by storm with mysterious and surprisingly clever cube which is my personal favorite SF movie. This is the basic view of a group of strangers who are trapped in a large cube-shaped, fully shot in one set, taking this idea in lovely directions. <br /> <br /> "I'm very eagerly waiting for Natalie's follow-up." <br /> <br /> Cipher is a fascinating exploration of the location of a person in the world, and finds himself in a situation where the logical chain of events is beyond the limits of his control. <br /> I'm very open about it We do not want to do the plot, because one of the sisters joys one takes us down different ways. /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Nordam), one of the man who ever runs on the planet, was employed by Digicarp, Ikard sent him to various parts of the United States. His frustration, they are incredibly boring. <br /> <br /> Morgan waiting for a seminar, he Rita Foster (an open cast Lucy Liu), a walking definition of virgin snow. She gave him off the brush, but she finds something irresistible. <br /> <br /> When Rita arrives at Morgan seminars, she tells her that she does not see her life. I'm not saying anything about the plot. <br /> <br /> "People are taking out what they know, and basically seeing what happens when they are thrust into the unknown. And Cypher follows similar policies, but this is not a copy of Cube's carbon copy, but it has a sense of self. <br /> <br /> Cypriot is a commonly used conspiracy thriller and psychiatric story. <br /> <br /> When Morgan finds a part of his notable recognition of a bigger movement, it's a lot like shock to us. <br /> <br /> One thing that recognizes cipher from the cube is that it's more Whereas the cube is limited to a minimalist arrangement and intelligent budget, the cipher is also in a low budget, but Natalie makes him financially so he has expanded the horizon and started Morgan in an exciting journey through his own identity labyrinth <br /> <br /> An unusual hand with the hand embodied in the direction of Natal is exceptional. The Vigilance of the DigiCorp building is a vast, robust office block that is affiliated to the smallest point standing outside of Morgan, with some excellent camera angles from above. It seems that all the color has gone out of the film, which congratulates the film's perfect tone as a modern day film-noir. <br /> Acting is amazing. Jeremy North is a sympathetic man who questioned his own identity from his love affair. His performance is amazing because it is modulated. He seems to literally change right before our eyes. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett puts in a welcome show on this effect in Cube. He lives in a secret hell that looks borrowed from Men in Black. His scene is fine because it is exercised in carefully calculated suspense and mental disorders. He was considered an expert in identifying double agents and was an excellent writing work, which was brilliantly directed by Hewlett. <br /> He goes to Morgan and his complicated mind is pulled into play. <br /> <br /> Here Lucy Liu steals the scene. Many times she has appeared in films that do not fully influence her work. But in Cipher, finally she was given a role that suited her as a glove. Rita is a farther away, lived with Fleem fatale who lives with Liu's release. <br /> <br /> "Cubic ended up in a vague note as Cube did, but Morgan deserved to be happy with his happy ending. <br /> <br /> This is a definite final moment, because 90 minutes later it is like Ray of Sunshine. <br /> <br /> Cipher sucks on all aspects, Shock, always entertainment It's a refreshing spike to the utmost and different matrix, and now I'm a committed fan of man super stuff!
