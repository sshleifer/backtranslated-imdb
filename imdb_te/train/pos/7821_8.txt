Very rarely Denzil Washington made a bad image and goes for Kevin Klein and in this case, it does not come to think of it to be counted as one of their best films. There's more about the film about how much friendship is more than Steve Biko's story, but there is no corruption and abuse society in South Africa to learn the world and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods's name has been preserved. Directed by David Attenborough belongs to Gandhis, but if there are any criticisms aimed at the length of the film. There is a lot of time to sit through the historical film for two and a half hours .He is amazing how to manage all the extra controls. There are thousands of people in two films. This image is actually open to your eyes what happened before the interval of the altar and you can not fail to move through it. 10 to 8.
