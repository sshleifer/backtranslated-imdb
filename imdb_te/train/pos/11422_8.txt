Claire Denis's chocolate is a beautiful but frustrating image. The film was very interesting in the home of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, who gave the viewer a sense of character in the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often not camouflaged. For example, an important aspect of the story is the inability of younger France to build strong relationships with others. Although this painting is flawlessly implemented, especially in the story of Denis Frames, where the French returns to her childhood home, the lack of girl's intimacy with other characters of the character, makes the viewer more difficult for her development (eg, or lack). The development of the film character makes it difficult to become engaged in loose organized plots that are difficult to stagnate. Characters in this film, especially Amyi and the men in her life, have become increasingly disturbed, but the viewer is dissatisfied, never bothered by these social tensions. The last few scenes are powerful but discouraging. Denis's work is certainly interesting in an intellectual and historical perspective, but if you're looking for a movie with adventure or drama, chocolate is definitely not the best option.
