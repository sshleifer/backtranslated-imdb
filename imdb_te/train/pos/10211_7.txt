Articles ?? Called written, visual or poetic myths? Generally try to remove characters; Readers and spectators, after all, who can accurately track who can make it much easier. This is especially true in the film, I think, because we can not just refresh our memories in a movie. <br /> <br /> A year ago I was introduced to a French actress Audrey Tautu. Amelie Paulen's Fabulous Destiny (2001) and later a very long engagement (2004), both of which are well designed and complicated stories with a large cast of characters. <br /> Now, other directors use these techniques: Robert Altman, The Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others with The Player (1992); Paul Thomas Anderson did the same as Magnolia (1999).
