Director Brian Yezanna has an unparalleled career in the horror style, creating artworks such as "Return of the Living Dead 3" or "Brand of Re-Animator" and "Faust: Love" for "Downtime" or "Medium" </ p> <p> As a director of "The Dentist", it is one of his few works, but the low profile has the advantages of it and its prestige Dr. Alan Feinstein (The Greatest Performance by Corbin Burnsen) tells the story, one day successful dentist finds out his perfect life when he realizes that his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman) has an affair and does not really realize his perfect life perfectly With pool boy. <br /> <br /> This incident has broken his mind and gets revenge on the world for being "dirty". <br /> <br /> After the revenge day of a ride pinstone, This movie is different from what we do not have the victim's perspective, we follow Feinstone because he is the main character. I see how one day we are going to get mental murder from a respectable professional. Yuzna manages to give the exact amount of film suspense but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie. <br /> <br /> The success of the campus is a performance of Bernstein as much as Feinstone. He can be sympathetic and at the same time hating him, and the subtle comedy in his role is another helper. The rest of the cast is not as good, and I feel that their sub-part acting is more harmful than the film. Notable exemption Ken Forne is trying to capture the Detective Feinstone. <br /> <br /> As a murderer, a dentist, ghoomy scenes are predicted, and Brian Yuzhn provides a great SFX with the right amount. It is good to see that he does not come over the top as he normally does, and I'm excited to say that this is the highlight of the film. This is the exact amount of scarcity expected, nothing less and nothing. Yuzhn denied his usual overly extravagant limits and its result was great. <br /> <br /> It is not in Yuzhna's most famous films, and I say it is his best. Sure, his artwork is not as classic material, but it never ends up a movie and never gets tiresome or boring. This is a low budget linear picture, but what it is, I've seen it. 7/10
