I loved Claire Danes, and Kate Beckinsale looks awesome in his role. Two of the accused are in a monastery, like the monks of grass and the hard marshal-arts discipline, because the film is flawed. The spectacular colors of theater and filmography and Thomas are eye-catching, but Claire Dines steals the whole movie, and is unexpected in learning a hard lesson in his life. The real and realistic world of real selflessness is totally unexpected. Errors are minute and I recommend the film, which rarely sings rare TV shows, never sinned. I wanted only a picture of my collection - only "collection" of "10" films. Look at it, you will be very touched.
