I gave the film 10 because it's not a stunning film, but the pure ability to motivate emotions in its audiences. A woman's fighting story against all-inequality is now an old clich√©, but fewer films have been performed with warmth and indulgence with colorful warmth. The African-American experience is shown on the other side - after slave freedom, many have fallen into 'white' ways of hated and misused their own people. <br /> <br /> These acting performances are awesome - especially Oprah i now <br <br /> Well worth looking - but some tissue is good.
