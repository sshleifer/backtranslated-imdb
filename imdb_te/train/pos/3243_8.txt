Remember payment opening days? I will do it, and I almost can remember the number you want to rent the movie on your TV. As a child we always wanted to rent a playboy, but this is actually what somebody called PPV and wanted to rent it. And then you have to make sure it's nerve and your four-hour soft core make any angle worse. Because I was in ppv, I brought it up. And I remember almost every scene in the ad. I've been in one kick in the last few years to get all the great movies I use to be a child and this is one of them. When its its hard to shut it down. All stars try to make a perfect bank fall but nothing is right. There are plenty of spoof bank capers that are very cool and this one will come in a category. It has enough actions and laughs to continue. Check it if you dare!
