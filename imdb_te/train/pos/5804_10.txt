Michael Jackson is not very popular in the USA, but still in Europe (especially in Germany) he is still a fan. <br /> <br /> You can not imagine a plot or a non-cliche. In this kind of movie! Visual effects are fun and the music is perfect. Smooth Criminal Fragment - a great song composed by Moonwalks, band dance acts and the famous "Michael Jackson's Bench-Over" - the film also looks good on one of Jackson's artworks (and white ...) <br /> Jackson Fans and music fans must necessarily have a dance act fans. <br /> <br /> If I'm an MJ fan, I should warn all Michael Jackson's haters out there: do not watch this movie, you'd only make your hate growth ...
