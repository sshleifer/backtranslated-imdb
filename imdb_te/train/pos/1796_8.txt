I made a movie with a lady friend. The evening is a chic movie without any apology with such apologies, but I can say with some relief that it was not excited with estrogen that was painful to see a red-blooded male. Except for a single event at the very end of the film, I'm interested in it and does not turn or turn my eyes on self-pleasing plays. <br /> <br /> The Lord on the side, her elderly, bed-ridden and her two grown up daughters, spending her last few days on earth as soon as possible in her home. Harris: When his last memories are disturbed, suddenly his daughter never calls a man's name. <br /> <br /> Anna and her two daughters - a child, when she and her two daughters are remembered for their unhealthy affairs with this mysterious man and sound the importance of their mother's strong desire. Marriage, a serial "commitment" - both with the central questions Begging. Whether true love is really true, and more importantly, if true love time testes. Have all of us one day to realize that love is everlasting? Do we all realize that the only thing that's incredible is not realistic? In response to these questions she dies, Yan has not yet lost her two daughters. <br /> <br /> Cinematography for Evening is very interesting - she remembers the past, and because of that I am giving everyone a space illumination (and this is very clear that it is not all true, if it is deliberately excessive) . Claire Danes is beautiful (although it is only 5 '5 in reality) is really tall), and his singing talent is ultimately attractive in a climactic scene. You can not talk the worst about the cast, it's run with Claire Danes and leave it out: Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wilson, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close fill the other major and minor characters in the film. br> <br /> <br /> Hugh Dancy's fight brought his character into a single-dimensional dimension but eventually faced a total loss. Great bravery, but does not provide much of a secretly exploring role - he has his orders and is difficult for them. In the end, gentlemen, your lady friend is absolutely crying, and you think it's almost unlikely to have the opportunity, is not a junk for the time spent watching for sure Evening. In theaters catch it or grab it as a rental to trade for points while you're looking for the die hard 4 or the upcoming Rambo Flick. It's your little secret that this view does not really cost you much.
