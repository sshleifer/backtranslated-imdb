I've always been a big cybled shepherd fan, ever since I've seen her series a few years ago !! This film definitely shows her in her best light !! This film is a great act and played !! Every now and again she drops slightly amusing lines, just to make this one the best one I've seen !! Not everyone really makes themselves !! Especially Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Sheppard, they really make this film come true! Also I loved a little where Mavi lost her wig and she almost dies when she falls to the ground !! This film is the best !!
