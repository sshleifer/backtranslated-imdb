Updated from previous comment. The great and unwelcome Marian Davis in this great (1928) silent comedy shows her comic strips, featuring amazing William Hines. Davis plays a hawk role from Germany, who crashes Hollywood with the help of a bit player in Crash Comedy from Heinz. <br /> <br /> Hollywood and its cherished great lampoon. Davis & Hines Best team, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Eleanor Glyn, Norma TellMadge, May Murray, Rod Larku, Lettrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Luella Parsons, Renee Adore, Aileen Pringle, And Marion Davis (you have to watch) is a blind man. Whether for any serious image effect or for anyone interested in Marian Davis who is still abusive! Dell Henderson played the role of father. Pali moron is a maid. <br /> <br /> Gloria Swanson has used the career as its model (I'm close to May Murray). Davis and Swanson friends. But with the film's choreographer Charlie Chaplin, Snellson's rise from a reel mock senet comedies with Charlie Chaplin in parallel to the Chicago B Demil in the late 20s and early 20s. <br /> <br /> Davis and Hines are huge MGM stars and friends. MGM does not mix them in a talkie. They're great together! Hollywood's sweet love and delightful sarcasm. Gret Garbo and BB Daniels are mentioned but not visible.
