My Super X-Girlfriend is an entertaining film no less. <br /> The story is quiet. Matt Sanders (Luke Wilson) encounters Jenny (Uma Thurman) with Subway and attaches it to her. At the beginning of their relationship everything is OK, but Matt learns that she is G-Girl. Matt at first looks really cool but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and poor. So he decides to break up with her and meet with his colleague Hannah (Anna Faris). This G-Girl is very mad and her ex-boyfriend begins to take revenge on himself. <br /> <br /> In this film, I liked the scenes that revenge her on G-Girl Matt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p>
