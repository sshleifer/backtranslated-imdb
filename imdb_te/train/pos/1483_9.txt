A sophisticated contemporary story about the stress that unravel the standards of marriage and eventually unbind work. The main thrust of the narrative arises from a local priest 'meditation', following the wedding of the young Cosmopolitan couple from Milan. In this, the future course of marriage is excluded, bit frames have reduced slightly from the pressures of modern life. In a story, the 'moral' of the story is that in order to work now for marriage, both the past and the family need to make that relationship through family and friends. The film is a relatively blockbuster by domestic Italian scales. It is a terrible shame that this film is not available on DVD or VHS.
