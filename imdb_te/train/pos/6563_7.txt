Jake Speed ​​is a film that does not have an image ?? An attractive lead. Unfortunately, it's really painting the whole movie and it's a worry because it's a witty movie and a movie with an enthusiastic, heroine. Although it is innovative, Indiana Jones can be attributed to the success of the trilogy. The film is a bit more like 'Raging the Stone' though it is reverse. The romantic adventure fiction writer does not play the role of courageous dancer by portraying a role in her roles, which is an adventure fiction character (her own adventures chronicle) leads to a common woman on one of her adventures. /> <br /> When a young woman in Paris was lost, her sister Margaret (portrayed by the charismatic Karin Copins) was a civil war in which the real and most sinister individuals on an expedition to the pulp hero Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) and his sidekick Dennis (Dennis Christopher) Deliciously sinister Sid (John Hurt) and his jazz into the heart of the state finally into the two brothers Sparse camp siblings Maurice (Roy London). This same plot? It's not labyrinth and it's not complicated but it does not need a great depth in the story it says. <br /> <br /> Action sequences are appealing to begin with, and the heroic trilogy's paces are caught in struggles between the government and rebel forces or the lions full of lions) and there are definitely some fun lines. However, the film ends and unfortunately the action sequences start somewhere but eventually a bit blunt and rare. However, it is not a problem that Jake Speed ​​can be liked, but Wayne Crawford's performance is difficult to really care about what's going on. He is a producer and writer in the film, or he is not just a good actor (I can not see him) I do not know whether he is a little bit savvy but he is not really convinced. <br /> <br /> The roguish alloy of Dawoo Savage, Indiana Jones and Jack Colton . <br /> <br /> This is an insult because most of the other characters have played their roles. Karen Copins is funny and convincing and her character shares some nice banter with Jake (unfortunately it never convinces). Dennis Christopher Arctiple Sidekick and John Hurt comprise the role of Camp Release? Almost if he's in Sixty episodes of Batman. He also appeared in another story about some of the scenes that are becoming increasingly funny with cocktail cocktail, which is almost the same as another movie. Sid is not Morgagty (he has demonstrated as Jake's nemesis from many of his previous adventures / books) but he is always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Jake Speed ​​is the same fun B movie Spirit Channel tries 'Night of the Comet' (a crawford-produced film a few years earlier) and will almost succeed if it succeeds? This is a shame because Jake is good to watch some of the adventures and a good television series. <br /> <br /> I would curiously recommend this appeal but ultimately there are a lot of elements to make the bitter taste very clean.
