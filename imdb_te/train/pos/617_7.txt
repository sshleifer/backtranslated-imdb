Thanks again from the darkness. This is compared with "The Princess Bride" and while it measures up to the classic, it's very entertaining and made its own right. <br /> <br /> The story line is a bit odd and the entire wall thing has never really explained, but building up a strong suspense is also fine. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox's wrong girl Miller), and she accepts getting a fallen star ... who happens to be played by the wonderful Claire Danes. What's going to happen in both of these is not very complicated, but a part of the suspense comes with the wicked witch who looks back to the Prince's son of Miss Puffer and King Peter Voulette, who has taken back our "star" ruby ​​necklace. <br /> You will also meet with a majestic pirate (including any from the Caribbean). Robert Deniro captain Shakespeare plays - tough inside, and we shall tell in touch with his woman side. <br /> <br /> In another encounter, Ricky Gervais is the fastest-spoken tutor and is good for a laughing couple. <br /> <br /> The effort of the audience is the role of Matthew Vaughn's cake, rather than your typical chase, age or fantasy film.) The poor marketing campaign will prevent any money from my expectation.
