I saw this movie at the Imagina Festival in Monaco. <br /> <br /> Four years ago I saw the first trailer, from this moment I waited to see the final result. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is a complete 3D movie with very unusual black and white renders. Apparently inspired by some comic books like F. Miller. In this optic, it goes one step further than the amazing "Sin City" simulator from R. Rodriguez. At this point, the color of the gray or anything, but a realistic animated film did not always see a graphic style (never waits for the scanner for the dark) <br /> <br /> Larger use of motion capture Credibility of lives and characters And we will soon forget technology to focus on more classics, such as direction or plot . <br /> The story of the future (Paris 2053) makes it a classic science fiction movie and protects the viewer's interest. Until the end. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere and a few interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of specific companies ...) provide a great interest in a classic base plot (an overpriced trial). It is an animated film, this is clearly not made for kids. You will not find any funny pet or any stupid family moral, just cold reality. It is very close to the good movie Noir. <br /> <br /> I realized that the film is the best thing in the film: We have a very familiar Paris, but it's a lot of mistakes. Montez is sometimes a bit flat, one or two too cliche slow motion effects and some poor dialogues. While technology is excellent, it shows some restrictions on some sex scenes (a bit like "fantasy fantasy"). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not want to be alone, Sorry.
