Laurel & Hardy is surprisingly fun this time in the role of chimney sweepers. <br /> <br /> The film has a subfolot with a fine professor, working on a renaissance principle. This is not really a logical mix of story stories and is absurd, but the plot is perfectly combined towards a memorable ending. This is still a bit odd but it's funny, so it works for the movie. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast of this film is a surprise. Sam Adams is the greatest of stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield nutty professor. <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with incredibly timid and lively-made scenes, and thanks to the way they are all implemented it becomes hilarious to see. This will help Laurel & Hardy make one of the short films "Dirty Work". <br /> <br />
