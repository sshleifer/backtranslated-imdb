It's a movie that has always been over and over and it's always tired, it's smiling, guns, action, crime, good liner, and a good plot, with one above, Donald Sutherland rather than an Assassine character. Tia Kerrara has acted in a way that she has never done and is the most active, Thomas Ian Griffin, the FBI agent played by the main character "Max" DEA Agent Diane Careera, and John Litgo from Frazier on TV, "Livingstone". This plot is trying to capture Livingston around the Max and Diane, when they make money for their companies, to fight and argue with each other, Assassen Sutherland, there is a perfect criminal story, a perfect crime story, with all the best liners for all but different than Carerra and Griffith played. Here are the Russian mafia, Italian Mafia and Chinisy Mafia thrown in mixed, which is shot in Boston, where you have some great shots, locals, great photography and music, the film is the essence of a crime comedy that has everything you can ever want. See the Sunderland toilet in a special scene, very unusual. This film is a riot and you can make real hard 10 plus plus for myself.
