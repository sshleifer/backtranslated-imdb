If I first admit Dundee Warhol's huge fanfare, I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of the film compared to other modern rockumentations is that it's not just about a page of the band's history (about Wilco's "I'm trying to heartbreak"), but the long term of the band's history. Director / producer Andy Timoner followed closely friends with Bryan Jonastown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW) for more than 8 years (1995 - 2003) and shot a 1500-hour raw video, 1:45 hours (in the future DVD release More than the original image). The result is surprising - no filters - this film is 100% pure and genuine archive footage, which seems to have you feel the film that lives with bands these years. <br /> <br /> They promised that their careers would initially "make a revolution" in the making of music, and not to sell their spirits to the "record industry" of the devil. However, their paths were quickly separated - after signing an agreement with Dundee Warhol's Capitol Records and becoming more popular (especially in Europe), the Brian Jonstown Down Massacre (with its self-destruct-resistant leader Anton Neukomb) How was shot). <br /> <br /> The Bryan Jonstown Massacre is in the lower part of the movie which is contrasted with the climb of the Daddy Warhols. <br /> <br /> First, I enjoyed by telling the story of the movie and Anton Newcomb <br /> <br /> I realized that something was wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> First, Anton New Comb is an invisible figure. The project began as a documentary about several developing groups that began in 1995, in which Anton Newcomb and Odd Timoner were equal partners (Ondi Timoner in these two years had no access to the two bands). Anton Newcomb, which brought Dandi Warhols into the project. He was completely overlooked, and he was dropped from the project. Everyone talks about BJM, but he does not participate in the discussion. He did not even know when the group started the last editing process. There are always two sides of the story, where we have only one ... Of course, as expected, Anton's final result is not acceptable and it looks like the betrayal of his former friends. <br /> <Second, the movie is very dandy Warhols-biased. Definitely, the winner takes this all out, but except for the last history of those bands (BJM up to 1997, and DW - 2003), it is impartial to the film, although Courtney Taylor (the DW leader) (which, although it is a good choice - can have a close interaction) not included. <br /> Third, the movie (somewhat) is a story. What do we teach One critic said: "... the film will consider old questions: Is genius in a developed world that can develop and achieve its result or self-elimination to maintain its integrity?" No, it does not examine these questions! <br /> <br /> It portrays the story of a brilliant but successful musician who describes self-promotion and less bright, successful man who sink in the lasting darkness of ego rather than the mountain. <br /> <br /> The film was fun - it's raw, it's fresh, it's beautiful, it's interesting to God, for at least DW or BJM fans. The rest of the group - I do not know ...
