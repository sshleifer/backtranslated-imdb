The best film on the San Antonio Battle of Texas in March 1836 was John Wayne's 1960 epic ALAMO. In a shot as director producer, he proved to be skillful in a film that was temporarily tuned to him, and was cast out of his acting ability like his icon, Wen West. <br /> <br /> I have commented on the film in a review of the other night, and I suggested that Wayne and James Edward Grant (screenwriter) had solved some of the points mentioned in previous films about the war. They got slavery. They eventually discussed the cooperation of local Mexican landowner Juan Seguen in the fight for equality independently with Crockett, Bowie, Travis, Austin, and Houston. <br /> <br /> But a weakness in the film (well hidden). Wayne worked to cast it properly, thinking it was the majority of the main characters. But he did not perform properly with the leader of the enemy forces, General Antonio de Santa. A vague actor Ruben Padilla (on this board, his thread only listed three credits). Paddle has no speech dialogue (also in Spanish). <br /> <br /> When he has one of the final shots in the film, he is shown as just silent cruelty, watching the dead bodies of Americans and their allies. <br /> <br /> The television film (Allamoho: The Heroine for the Third Days) is a very poor choice but it is the best movie for American policymakers to show a popular biogan (from 1836 to 1854). Raul Julia is an amazing stage actor. I was fortunate to see him in ARGS and Manhattan's MAN, a product like Sergius (in the late 1980s). <br /> <br /> Here we see his fascinating ecstasy monster. Nothing suited for Santa Anna's desires or activities is not acceptable. This could be a legitimate failure of the army to bring up some of the fastest requested goods, or "foreign brands" (as he saw the Americans), "Napoleon of Napoleon. <br /> The president of Santa Anna is five or six times in 1830 and 1855 He is the first since the president can not live up to the Constitution of the country He is a prominent Mexican historian in the two decades, until he was able to overturn the political number or military number of Benito Juarez until the end of 1850. He initially referred to great liberal theories, but he Once people in Mexico pop themselves Ince the necessary guidance for a hundred years before he admitted pillalenani (Gilbert Roland, so he was troubled about him, Ferrer). The amazing thing about him is that he managed to keep it coming. His policies disasters. Even though we learned about his attack on Texas (to suppress a rebellion), he also tried to expand into Guatemala (and he saw most of the Middle Central control). He succeeded in the Alamo, but with great cost of lives. The massacre of Colonel Fanny's men at Golid was not the answer (eventually one might cause one to ruin the warring Aleemo's saviors but Fannin surrendered). San Jacinto's disaster (which he failed to see for American troops) was then cleared of his army. He was captured, and insulted, and had to sign the Texas surrender. <br /> <br /> In 1838, he lost his leg in the battle against the French, and he was wounded in his wars. He was forced into Texas's forced surrender, but could not make it militarily wrong. Instead, he led Mexico into a Mexican session against the Americans in the war of 1846-48. Mexico was good enough to pay $ 15,000,000 to Mexico, but Mexico lost half of its territory. In the year 1853, Franklin Peirce's horrendous bad governance, the last time he was president - has sold the border of Ontario and New Mexico ("Gadsden Purchase") to the United States. (Not even Porferario Diaz) has spent much of his country (Diaz sold for foreign business purposes, but he has done Mexico's economic muscles). He was expelled in 1855 and settled on Staten Island. Where he was able to manage his most creative work: he was U.S. And introduced it to the chewing gum. Something success! <br /> <br /> Julia's Santa Anna is a young man who is America's best land buy agent than practical synthesis and schemers. He does not go to the opposition and he jumps into a moment's notice that angrily tears into the notice. For a long time his main assistant, Colonel Black (David Ogden Stairies, a British-born officer) has his tongue - he wants to be in front of the firing squad as he can. But Steyers is secretly less than enchanted by his boss. Eventually, when the newlywed widow of the dead alamo rescuers was alone with the widows, Staisers suggested that they would tell the world how much they like Santa Anna. And they are!
