This indie film is seen in the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in Connecticut. The plot is very thin. The film is the role of characters, especially unknown actors. Stunts in the cast is a high school teacher who faces a marriage problems like Brewster and Weisler as a stripper as a carino dealer. Both actresses work together and work well together. It is an impressive movie for writer Skater and director Setton. The story keeps moving at the next fast clip. The title and poster of the movie indicate that it is something profane, but this is a fantastic little comic-drama.
