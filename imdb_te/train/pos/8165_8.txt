At almost every profession of the dentist was made during the time when it was mental. We are mad police officers, ambulance men, secrets and it's just for starters. <br /> <br /> When the dentist was going to the dentist, the dentist was too late. <br /> <br /> This theme is distorted. The super clean dentist, Dr. Feinstone, lives in his great "White House", a great place to work as a handsome elegant wife and a dentist. Dark clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of a dirty IRS guy (Terminator's Earl Bone), the dirty pool cleaner is "cleaned" by his wife and suddenly everybody's teeth go through a dark filtration. He goes to nutso and in the nasty way people begin to take care of the teeth. <br /> You can not come to his way. <br /> <br /> Crew Professional. Producer / director Brian Euganna produced stylish horror films such as Re-Animator and Beyond. He directed the sequel to the remake animator, and his first film was a good spin from The Society John Carpenter's Their Live. The filmmaker is from films like Pierre David Scanners. The cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really suprised me. I know him from LA Law and Major League, but I think he's new to a mental dentist. He is great in his role and he is a tragic person. Linda Hoffman feels like Feinstein's mistress and nodding. Michael Stadeway does not have many songs, but my future career knows when I see him with neighbors. Ken Forn (from Dawn of the Dead, Beyond) is a policeman in the case. <br /> <br /> Final warning: If you are like me and have a problem with a dentist then you must go through this. But if you want to try more than dark humor and our evil drills will need to prepare yourself.
