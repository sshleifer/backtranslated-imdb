The play drama written by William Mastisimon, played by Ferrara Fawat Marjorie, was attacked by her by rapist Joe (James Russo). She leaves her outside, but the police tell her that they can not do anything. However, Joe finds her bag and finds where she lives. While her housemates pat (Alfred Wudard) and Terry (Diana Scarwood), Joe visits her to complete her opening. After Joe pronounces her and spoils her in many ways, she gets an opportunity to hit him and arrest him. <br /> <br /> When it continues, Marjorie displays such cruelty, as she is her enmity. [edit] </ p> <p style = "text-align =" The faceless set a nice job, but the state that really has the best damage to control the situation is really Russo Director Robert M. Young does not shy away from the tremendous and more exploitative aspects of the situation, the film has become uncomfortable to see at times when it has only two characters on screen, while the film has a very close nature, which makes it even better. <br /> <br /> When Marjorie climbs up, things go up enough It is so easy to encourage her to go for blood, and she hopes that Pat is herself. <br /> <br /> "Extreme", I thought, was a pretty good film, at least interest and very high intensity. Both Udder and Schwarz are good supporters (Scarwood is a great moment Terry reveals himself as a rape victim), and the pace is stable. Of course, the dialogue is not always very sharp, but the material forces every step of the way. <br /> <br />
