Fortunately we have real McCoy fans (all baby boomers in the 50s and 60s), and in the 2000s adult actors / actresses who participated in the reunion program. Tony Martinez and Richard Crennai soon afterwards. Luke, Sugar Babe, and Pepino have been happy to see it again, and it is equally confidential about the full attendance of Lidia Reed and Michael Winelheim. It was my understanding that Little Luke passed away in 1999, but I do not know how. There is no information about Hassie on the Internet, I find it. Very interesting why they are not even mentioned? It is very clear that I do not want Michael, and Lydia's family (whether or not alive) to leave the spotlight and their desire to be granted or 2) suspicious of the Reunion Show. TNN Michael or Lydia (like the rest of us) could not find any trace, they disappeared. Therefore, it is the safest way to leave them out of conversation. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, Walter Brennen's rethinking was excellent. They did not make any bones ... it was the grandfather of success. As a child, I imitate my grandfather's gym walk and my parents are laughing (I've already done one million other children). For a bit irritating to me a bit, Richard Kreena was dominated by debate ... Tony and Kathleen were at times interrupted. In fact, although Tony Martinez was capable of contributing to the conversation, he was not allowed to talk and talk much in the Reunion Show. Unfortunately, I wanted to hear from three even the same. All in all, the Reunion Show is a real treat for me. I saw the DVD several times and enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> <br /> DodgerDude
