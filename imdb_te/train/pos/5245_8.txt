I thought the movie was lol funny. It's a fun, life, love, and ... well, from the bus station skank, a high level deboatante ... to the bus station skank, a movie about the twisted views of a man ... Tim Plains Hugh Hefner-Esquire's Playboy by Playboy -Sylie grew up in the building, with beautiful romantic designs and actresses constantly surrounded by actresses (Leon Phelps). If his "father" kicks him down the street, he must learn to avoid the chubby's perspective in the life that his youth taught him ... It's a sweet, almost mysterious charm and dumb luck. So start hijinx! If you do not see this movie and you enjoy a lightweight, semi-minded, comedy / love story, then I would recommend renting "Lady's Man".
