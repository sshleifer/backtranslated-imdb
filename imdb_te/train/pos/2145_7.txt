"Shall We Dance?", A lightweight movie from Japan, tells a topworked accountant and family man who was attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he would see from the train during his everyday journey. Dancing has lessons in what he sees in the studio, and not for himself. Funny, sharp, and completely lovely, "SWD" is a well-awarded movie worth a look for more mature viewers. (B)
