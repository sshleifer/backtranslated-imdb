Everyone who wants to stay in the braking glass music industry should see more than once. This is a very dark story about the record company anchoring a singer to make their way out of the way and earn as much money as possible. I have always remembered this film in the UK and abroad looking at some of the 'style TV Style TV' for today's star. Although not the expert on this topic, the winners of these shows have a big early hiatus, then down from there. Though the film is predicting these shows, the effect seems to be the same. After getting rid of her manager, Phil Daniels played very brilliantly, the slow but essentially record company puts her in her literature impulses and she is eventually blew out. You see tomorrow potential stars .... See this and beware!
