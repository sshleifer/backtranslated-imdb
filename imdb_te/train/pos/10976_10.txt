I love this website! I saw this movie in British television in 1980. Over the years it was one of the most extraordinary things I've ever seen in my life and I was one with the one I wanted to know more. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike previous commentator makers, I do not recognize this movie as boring or exploitative. On the contrary, abnormal relationships between the mother and daughter are stuck in mind as evidence of great strength, respect and respect. Ionic you may want to take into account their lives. Because I live in Britain, fortunately there is a language established in the lives of old money, where owl is often tested as good evidence of good harvesting; I think it was a rare and distinct character of the immense soul, deep and deep humor, with its entirely fragile and delicate balance of fabric lost and respected. I'm sorry to see it as a 'cult' in a way. Over the years, since it deteriorated in my mind, it was a bright, bright, bright and outstanding television experience. It seems odd to think of becoming a public so it's a deep private exposure, it should be a New York musical. But perhaps somewhere, the daughter is entertaining by such a result. It is she who laugh past the past .. (they made her a musical before you've jockey)
