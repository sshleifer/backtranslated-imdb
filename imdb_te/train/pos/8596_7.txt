Sentinel is going to be a normal movie. I finally saw it, and I got a good surprise.This film is not a great thing but it's a lot of fun and action scenes are very well. This movie reminds me of TV 24 or a series like alias. It is very similar to that series and I also reminded Wolfgang Pietersen's thriller on the fire line. If you are very original and one of the greatest thrillers movies history, you will be disappointed. But if you go with little guesses, you will enjoy Sentinel. <br /> <br />
