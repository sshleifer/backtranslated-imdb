Frank Sinatra and Kelly, and Catherine Gresson are definitely an enjoyable singing and dancing film. <br /> <br /> The film was won and Oscar for the score of George E. Stol, and it won Best Film, Best Actor Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as Best Soma Nomination Sinatra for "I Fall In Love To Easleyly" . <br /> <br /> Kelly is a girl with his little boyfriend Sinatra and she is in love with her to get down. We were confused by the charming Grayson (toast of New Orleans) and we had great songs and dance programs with the artistry of Kelly and Sinatra and the pianist-conductor Jose Ittrabi. <br /> <br /> One classic Hollywood music from an era has gone.
