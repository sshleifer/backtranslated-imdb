Space Camp is pretty good image. The plot is speculative, but the actors do a good job, and special effects are good for a while. <br /> <br /> The film was originally released about the shuttle disaster, how popular it is. <br /> <br /> The shuttle doors open in the open space is just amazing ... on a large screen, ie ... on a TV ... it just looks an average. I must remember this scene in the theater. <br /> <br /> This is really good to see in IMAX, but I'm sure it will never happen.
