I'm with me today 8 years old. I thought it was beautiful. I agree with another poster that it is not like a book I can remember, but we still enjoy it. The kids are all pretty good and all are pretty entertaining. Billy is a new kid who accepts courage through the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day. If he loses, he will have to run the hall in the school with the worms in his pants. At the beginning of the film, Billy was set to show that she was almost as weak as stomach and pucks. Another way to cook pleasure worms is heard with a group. Good message until bullies, of course, is a happy ending.
