After "A Dirty Shame", I did not think I would see another John Waters film. That movie is very bad, and I believe that it's all his movies. But when the DVD of this film was reviewed in a popular magazine and said it was a fantastic movie, I tried anything. Only a few days later shown on television. I've recorded it with curiosity, and this "peeker" is sure to say that what I saw is much better than "dirty shame". <br /> <br /> In this movie we will be the youngest 'no-one' from Baltimore overnight in New York's Art World. He is a sandwich shop employee, portraying his strange family or as a hobby of what he sees on the street. When he puts his first 'Exhibition' at the shop where he works, he sees a gallery owner who loves the pictures of the mess and the whimsical full of images. His photographs were sold at enormous prices, but when he saw his family, friends and strangers react to his success, he no longer decided to go to New York, and they would come to him if they wanted to see him further. <br /> <br /> Why do not I love this movie much more than the eternity shim? "The first reason is that the film is the original story, and this is not meant to shock people as much as they are, but the fact that they think art from art to art is ridiculous is not actually known because it's not funny, it's not true. I imagine that there are many people who enjoy modern art I do not understand why they are doing such a fuss, but obviously we all like it, the second reason I liked this movie is because it has a good acting performance.I do not say that everything you see is great, but like Edward Frolung, Cristina Ricci Some actors have some meaning for performances ... </ p> <p> A great picture No, but thanks to its criticism and thanks to some good jokes - it's never going to go too far - this is an enjoyable movie, it's definitely not the best comedy, but I liked a lot more than "dirty shame." I give this movie 6.5 / 10.
