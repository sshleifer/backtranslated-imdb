One of the best movies out there. Yes maybe cinematography is not great, but wonderful plot and concept. Great for time and amazing and creative ideas. A different thing from simple movies and great entertainment. I would like to be one of my favorite and anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. After World War 3 and heavy robots fighting actors gave a great performance and made it all worth it. The sets are not spectacular, but work for general and overall image look. This film is hard to find on DVD, but also in VHS. I loved it since it came out. Not a main movie and you have never seen it. Take a look and feel like a kid. It is a great scene and a lot of fun.
