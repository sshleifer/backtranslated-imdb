I saw this movie in Santa Barbara. I know my friend who worked on it, so I thought I would check it out. I thought it was a really cute movie and I could not wait to see it again. Actors are really good and I like all the music! At first it was not a little strange about the film. But once I entered it, the story and acting were really emotional and meaningful and I thought it was a lot of imagination. I wanted to see the film again because I forgot so many things, but I knew the theater was thinking about the movie. It is beautifully portrayed and the whole thing is really unique.
