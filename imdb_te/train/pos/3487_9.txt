WrestleMania 14 does not appear to be one of the great WrestleMania, but if I personally am in my Top 5, it may not be the top. It has so many great things and it really is the birth of that attitude era, the best period of WWE, in my opinion. HBK has the heart of the lion, and he made Austin as he did, in his way, a pure class of hiss. This is one of the hottest groups you can ever see, and it has the best time of their announcement of J.R and The King! <br /> <br /> LL.O.D team battle royal loud pop. I'm not a fan of war royal, yet another average. Very speculative, even when you see it, it obviously wins L.O.D. If 8 or more minutes at Sunny, definitely help. <br /> <br /> WWF Light Heavyweight Championship <br /> <br /> Taka Michicho | C | <br /> <br /> Taka gets surprising pop with her entrance. Fast, high-flying, very exciting. If both of these have more time, they must have tied the roof with their belongings. <br /> <br /> WWF European Championships <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Here is a handcuffed to the Owen Heart Testament, the China Slater. Nice pop for oven, mixed reaction for trips. One really, really underestimated match, which is amongst my favorite one for WrestleMania. The two can be combined together, and the oven can go with anyone. Trips wins with Chia intervention. <br /> <br /> The mixed tag matches. Marc Merrow & Sable vs Gould & Luna. Define the pop to listen to the woman at that time and sing. Sable looks really hot, and the crowd is just eating her up! Steady subtitles, and she gets in the ring almost erupted every time. Mixed tag is not bad for the match, it's entertaining entertaining, and the time has passed well. <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamok vs The Rock | C |. Before reviewing the match, The Rock showed her enormous potential with her interview with Jennifer Flowers before her competition. Nice pop for shamrock, hot time for rock. It's a little disappointing, and it's great to see Shamok's snapping shots, but I thought it was too stupid to end and the audience went for nuts. <br /> <br /> Dustster match for the WWF Tag Team Championship, <br /> <br /> Catscott Jack & Terry Funk vs The New Age Outlaws. Outslides are not available at this time. Although Crowd was actually a bit dead, I thought there were some hardcore bits with some sick looking bulbs. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs Kane. Big time courtesy for The Undertaker. WrestleMania 20, and better than there for a big man vs Big Man match, it's very good. Taking the unhealthy bump through the Undertaker table, it is the greatest of all. WWE is hard, watching the ken stronger and getting the defeat. <br /> <br /> When 2 Tombstone kick becomes, the Takeer finally puts him at 3rd. <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Special Guest Infeer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Vs Steve Austin. Big heat for tyson For Crowd, Austin I'm going to AP * Ted, one of the biggest pops I've heard of. Mixed reaction, for HBK. This is really unique among major gladiatorial events in history, and you can tell when JR comes out of breath. The HBK is all that he can do in his final match, and Austin is rarely better. Enmity and power from the crowd is amazing, and it is as exciting as it gets. Austin wins the title with Stunner, with the title defeating Michaels, 3:16. <br /> <br /> It's a surprise to see Austin's celebration success, one of the most distinctive groups you will ever see, they say, they're nuts. <br /> <br /> The line below. WrestleMania 14 is great for Real. It's everything you want in WrestleMania, really start with Era's attitude. <br /> "Austin Era, opened!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2/10
