This image is just great. If you have a chance to see it, you have to run to see it. Although the film is almost nothing with its original since 1932, Pacino does a great job of playing as Tony Montana to get around. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you think Pulp Fiction is good for good words (if you see it), scarface should also see another angle how the actor can tell them. <br /> <br /> Even though the film has taken a lot of action, you should always have your eyes open without any losing time, even though the plot moves very fast without having to keep the true aspect ratio correctly on time. Personally, I found that looking at this movie looks like breeze for three hours, it's really great. <br /> <br /> This film is one of tho movies, you forgot to have done this film in crappy 80 but you really are the source for the bad guy ... "So bad guy to say good night"
