Wooden Horse is one of the first "Great" escape stories from World War II by telling the true story of Eric Williams and others when running out of Stalag-Luftha III in October 1943. I really like this movie, but it's transferred from VAZ to Amazon in England and from the PAL format in the US, when I saw a piece of the film at the beginning of the 60's I read this book when I was in a school of smuggling Escape to escape in the escape There is more realism than rice. The lost image of this film is to be more accessible to American audiences.
