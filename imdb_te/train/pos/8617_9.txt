"GI Samurai" sees Sony Chiba and some other citizens are transported back to feudal Japan for civil warfare, and many carnage slaves for special reasons. It has received some interesting results in the last article of the knife versus machine gun. <br /> <br /> This plot runs along the lines that are expected from the title; Early fish-out-the-water antics ("What is this flying metal box?"), "Here we are not good" talks and finally a huge war. The second is that the samurai army is in the second half of the war as it struggles with Chiba's platoon, proof that the film is not bad at all. One face looks completely from the title, but still covers its innovation and extravagance. <br /> <br /> Chiba is one of the most unique war scenes in its time and does not pull even though its wider length. <br /> <br /> Chiba, in the beginning as a good leader and finally a person who has questioned his morals, will slowly affect him. This is definitely one of his good vehicles from his amazing CV. By the end of the action, two worlds have had such an impact on each other, if the authors are a bit of neuralism, "is not it better to ask us again?" But it is usually entertaining as almost two hours (almost) non stop stop when reading a bit.
