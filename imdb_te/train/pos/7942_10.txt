Fans of Giollo will seek this rare film. It is well written, and full of all kinds of simple low lives that populate these movies. I do not want to give anything away, I'm also accustomed to say anything about the plot. The whole picture creates a very bizarre atmosphere, and you do not know what to expect or suspect. Recommended! The only place I've seen to get this movie in English is from the European Trash Movie to $ 15.
