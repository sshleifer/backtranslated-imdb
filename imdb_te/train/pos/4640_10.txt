This is one of the best films I've seen in the last 2 years (I saw Premier in Tel-Aviv in the summer of 2006, the last war has begun ...) People who have wars have been very interesting for me for a long time, and boys and girls, directly and homosexuals, Jews and Arabs. .. I already saw the bubble 3 times, yet surprising and enthusiastic me - I know I remember the last time between my friend, a Christian Arab, and Israel's Independence Day (how very symbolic I am!) And ... he shouted at the end! !! - if he touched and embarrassed- everyone would have touched the bubble!
