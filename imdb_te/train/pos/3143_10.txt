Any performance that has been used in the past ten years is a rare gem. It allows us to escape from time to time when things are easier and more fun. Filled with heart and smiles, this show keeps you laughing through the difference of three decades. The furniture is ugly, the clothes are colorful, and even the drugs are tolerable. In addition to the hair-winged, musical roller-skates, in the words of Merlie Huggard, "the joint is in bad position". Go back to great time in American history. Fall in love with the characters and the good summary of the small town people enjoyed each other. This classic television is "full house". Do not miss it, and always "shake your grooved thing !!!"
