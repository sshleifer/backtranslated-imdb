This is one of my favorite films for a long time. <br /> <br /> Recently, I enjoyed it on DVD that was relieved from looking at older, grainy VHS versions. <br /> I can not see in years, until the cinematic time. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore received an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore lost to Oscar nomination for "Arthur" (John Gielgud won as Best Supporting Actor). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" does not win any comedian title, the best actor can not get Oscar's proof (another example is "Young Frankenstein" by Jean Wilder). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon gave the film a warm welcome to each character in the film, giving a fine reputation for all. Quite simply, the IMHO film is a rare gem. <br /> <br /> The DVD is available as of 1/2007, so it is only sad when Steve Gordon died just a year later. While the video quality is a leap on older VHS copies, Widescreen version is not available. <br /> <br /> There are some additions to the DVD, but this is not enough. The commentary from the director is an example of how he wanted to include the deleted scenes and scenes (because they are crazy), but he must make tough decisions for the final editing. <br /> <br /> The original "Arthur" is a classic comedy, which is one of the books.
