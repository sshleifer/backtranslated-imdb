The first time I saw this presentation, I laughed again. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is, once again after seeing the show I'm again laughing. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzzard is a man of the world, sharp, sharp, cultivated. He does not speak about politics and yet thinks he does not need to "engage" in political debate. He is on top of that. <br /> <br /> I am contrary to George Carlin, who uses his comedy to persuade people to convince people about his ideas and feel that he is enjoying the fact that he is trying to be entertaining. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
