I saw Jack Frost for Â£ 4:00 at my local store and I thought it was pretty cool for a low budget movie so I bought it and I was good. This film for starters is so funny about a killer snowman and funny as compared to snowman on the cover of the way it looks. Acting is okay and Jack Frost smiles and laughs at me and says, "I'm only smashing for smoke" and "funny peak ** snow summit" In the beginning the story was pretty funny and stupid, "Jack is nimble, Jack is quick, joking smiling eyes-eying eyes". If you're looking for a B-movie comedy horror, it's full, check Jack Frost. 10/10
