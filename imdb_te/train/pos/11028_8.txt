To be honest, I have seen this film very much for the first time. But I guess it's a problem I have not seen in a theater. Big mistake! # 1 thing settings and # 2 cinematography in Cliffhanger. Try to watch this TV in the largest TV and great sound system. Music is good and keeps the film high (and the ability of a business). <br /> <br /> It is one of Renny Harlin's best film. This person knows about action. Die hard 2, long kiss goodbye, etc. Particularly good in this movie. The special effect is great and amazing. Stolen really came back with the success of the film. It's even better to see him!
