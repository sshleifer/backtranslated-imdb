I think the film would be very enjoyable if everyone imagined it as a story rather than a story rather than a Colonial Africa film in the 50s and 60s. There is no real story here. One vignette on top of another is like the low points of light that you do not understand much less enough to paint the images. For the first time I did not see Chocolat for the first time, "get it" until a few days about it. Then I have many things on the topic of "origin", but I do not have a plot around the corner, as Califournism ends. However this is one of my favorite time movies. Seen poetic poetry at the airport with brief shower and beautiful music. If you like "exciting" movies, do not watch it - you'll be bored with tears. But, for some of you ... thank you for recommending it.
