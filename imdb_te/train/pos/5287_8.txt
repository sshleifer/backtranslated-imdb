It is one of the few cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin Martin - and a space dog called K-9 is also included. This looney Tunes episode is very fun, reasonably good cartoon animation (Marvin's animation is very well done) and the plot is well done. The end is rather weird, so preparing for it, it's a little boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin was sent to Earth to seize land and bring it to Mars. With his trusty dog ​​K-9, Marvin directs and immediately finds any other rabbit but the Bugs Bunny's tracks! He greets them gifts, thinking that they are in their costume trick or treaters. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this episode to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny, Marvin Martin and Looney Tunes. In the beginning and center of the episode, you will like it. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
