Definitely it may not be classic but full of classic lines. My friends and I have quoted from all the times in some movies and this fifteen years later (probably it is in the movie Cox!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie - he can figure out how he plays - but he knows how to play this spoof is a wonderful cast Is around. Looking for a movie to get you excited? Not only this, but for rent with friends - it makes it much better.
