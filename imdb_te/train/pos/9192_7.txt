Let's start this review in a positive note - I think Tony is shot and killed and some people are gaining momentum in the recurring season. Actually, opposite the creator and writer David Chase of this episode. We do not know whether Toni is alive or dead. He is in a coma and his chances of recovering are much slick. This episode was slowly moving, and the coma-triggered dream was completely whimsical, as Tony walked out of him, with the mistaken identification of him and the souvenir Asian saints. After 45 minutes I could not grieve everybody, but this episode is not a reason to slam. It is an unnatural and unpredictable episode, but is still well written and intense. Eddie Falco gave an amazing feel to this episode as the controversial wife was dead of her husband. I found myself curling a vendetta against junior which AJ pulled out of school and did not have the balls off the AJ too far off. Silvio now opens up many doors to acting-boss and the next episodes. There are so many great characters in this episode, and I think Vito is 'pole-smoker', if he is an obsessive SOB, it can reach his death <br /> <br /> This is not a great piece, and as Tony will kill people, we worship him as audiences And he was disappointed only because he would feel like our hero of the show. This is a necessary part of the series, although it's a little sad when it triggers the end. Eddie Falco's Kudos to Performance, and David Chase and writers who create this entirely genuine and unpredictable plot twist. This is only in 'The Sopranos' season, where I do not have F * Sucking Clue where it goes. Can not wait for episode next week. <br /> <br /> The best way of episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Let's Go, Van Helsing!"
