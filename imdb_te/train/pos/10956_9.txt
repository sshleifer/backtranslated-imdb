For those who think that it is absolutely insane humor and dissatisfaction, you are really mindless. While the show has intellectual jokes, it has a lot of satirical work and is fun in social issues, ethnic barriers, cliches, stereotypes. <br /> <br /> For those who expect a joke like Friends (I love friends) you can not find it here, instead Sarah uses the conditions and other means to achieve his humor, It's more realistic, we can not walk in this world and there are witty punchlines for everything that's in the most funny scenes, instead of the Sarahman program Isayanlo, as more and more realistic. <br /> <br /> because it is so much more than take the mindless comedy.
