<br /> <br /> When this film comes first, I'm not sure what I've missed, but it's finally happy I'm watching. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in and around Okabasha's red light district in the 19th century, Japan. This tells the story of strong adultery, caste systems and women in a society based on the strength of the Japanese samurai code. <br /> This is specially Akira Kurosawa! Although he died before directing this film, his follow-up to the screenplay shows. His view of the Japanese world and the caste system is well-known and transmits the light on how these systems interact with each other. The characters revolve around each other, but the caste system is intact, each character goes back into the world. Samurai warrior goes back to his life with a good minded and loving lady who is in the caste system, another road with a low level. Samurai has many gifts in the world, but still, it is the lowest caste inhabitants, who support everyone and who can love without restraint. Samurai of the film becomes a weak man, and classless lovers are dignified. <br /> <br /> This film is highly rated. This is the story of women survival in feudal Japan. During this time, people were sacrificed. Strong women and women are considered to be merely a weak and weak asset. <br /> <br /> The film shows Japanese women's strength and their ability to survive, and how to continue their strength in how to continue to Japanese culture. <br /> "Seeing the sea" Akira Kurosawa is a fan and even if they are not a fan. It is a lovely, quiet and self-sustaining image, and one that is ruthless for any movie collection.
