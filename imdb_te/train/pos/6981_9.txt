For all rivals there: After reading the first few pages of a TV series with an episode, the whole book is like a judgment. I'm told, I'm a fan of BSG, it's the best TV drama (not just science fiction) in the air. But it's time to end and the story go forward. <br /> <br /> I liked the BSG sermon "The Plan", but it answered many new questions, so I was eager to "Caprica" ​​and I was disappointed. Be another BSG, and I have something different with "Caprica", and I personally have space battles, explosions and sci-fi special effects (that can not get me wrong, even that matter). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales gave solid performances, and Alessandra was excellent. I can not wait until next week.
