Andy Steitzer is a 40-year-old Kennel, not a 40-year-old Virgin, and Steve Karel gives him one. In the style of Cross "Comedy", the 40-Year-Old Virgin color color cast and a brilliant, heartbreaking script that does not use its main character as a butt-end is a ruthless joker due to lack of humor and attractive characters. Andy is still a young man at the age of forty, not a curiosity. <br /> <br /> Is the veteran of Team Ferrell and the Daily Show cast in Carel, Anchorman, using the concept of film to expand his character? Andy must understand what he is. This is a small thing that works for the film. When Andy's co-worker asked for what he had done on an electronic shop in an electronic shop, Andy recalls that his efforts in cooking failed. When Andy tries to run his bike, he suggests his turns. Does he just adorn his home with action figures ?? He hands them up and speaks to them, and says that some young people in a young age belong to him. Less humor is not focused on all these things. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple? Andy's colleague Pals finds that he never had sex and they made their personal quest to get him into bed with a woman. <br /> <br /> Andy's friends are a complement to his nervous nature: David (Paul Rudd) broke with his girlfriend two years ago but still J (Romal Malco), a female lady and call (Seth Rogen) Sebahlik is a tattoo. <br /> Finally, Andy single mom trish (played by Katherine Keener) and the angry of the pen is not worth it for those who respect his parents' parents, he will fall in love with her. Will they begin a relationship and agree to get sex relations for twenty days ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> Judd Away, directed by 40-year-old Virgin Anchorman and The Cable Guy, and a short-lived cult TV show freaks and geeks. Apatow is famous for the ridiculous humor and script. Co-authored by Karel <br /> In the end, the 40-year-old Virgin's interesting and (indeed surprise) factor is its maturity. I received radiant reviews from critics, and I was surprised by its warm reception. But after watching the movie, it's easy to understand why. We like Andi. We take care of him. Is not he just a few cardboard cutout sex-comedy cliche? He is a real, living, breathing person. He combined his neurological properties with Woody Allen's best kid's simplicity. His friends are not improbable jerks and his romance is confusing and bittersweet. It hit a string with audiences. <br /> <br /> Although it is a perfect image and certainly includes some crude fuels and sexual humor, other genres are because of our love for people on the screen. Will the best sex comedy work this way? American Pie from Risky Business ?? The main difference between 40-year-old Virgin and 40 Days and 40 Nights.
