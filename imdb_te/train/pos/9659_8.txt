'Presque Ryan' is a beautifully observed young French homosexual experience. Both abandon the stereotypes and teaching, the amazingly natural image, the magnificently acted, in the seaside town, shot down, where the actions are always dramatic but often intimidating. If anything, it's almost quite realistic, just a little bit in the way of the traditional plot, just scenes from one's life. But due to the lack of traditional dramatic tensions in the world, it is drawn deep. 'Presque Rin' is not the most exciting movie ever made; But when it is comparable to its usual humanism preceded by anticipated celebration or more thoughtful opinions, this backdrop must often treat treatments. Watch value.
