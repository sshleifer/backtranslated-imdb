The film is as good as any other Bible movie, except Susan Hayward's wooden delivery throughout the film. Henry King maintains an epitome of an epic in all small scenes, and Peck is always impeccable. Alleged Newman sound score, the twenty-third psalm is also unforgettable after many years. The scene with Goliath is a bit of the hockey side, but not all done badly for the era made by this film. Today's short Bible myths, "The Song of Ruth" and "Esther and the King." It is worth looking at, and Raymond Massey is wonderful as the protagonist Nathan. The film is always good as James Robertson, like Abshay and Jane Meadows, divorced Justice Michael, David's first wife.
