Not good. This film is very entertaining. Last night, I saw the girlfriend and had to use the usual use of "I think there is something in my eye". The film is a great combination of comedy and distinctive romance. Jim Carrey is wonderful for her fortune telling reporter to give her the power to change herself and the city she lives in. In fact all the characters are great. The film was not overly funny or delicate, and went to see a good piece with a wife. <br /> All in all 8/10 * I'm not an easy grader. All from Begg and out!
