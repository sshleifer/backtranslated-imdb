When I first saw my first two sisters in 1977 as theatrical, I was eight years old. Apparently it was considered a failure - and is now practically forgotten (pan and scan video cassette - which did not do justice to the film or it was printed out of the prestigious Pinevolution Compositions), the film is very stylized SUBMARINE) and the approval is unequal. Some characters and scenes are sensitive, others are juvenile and negligent. The sad blue camel (shades of the shore) are ignored and his blue song is really cheerful. Joe Raposso's songs are just a lot of fun. Certainly a worthwhile curious possibility (sin) will come into total darkness.
