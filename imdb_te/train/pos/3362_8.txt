'Una Gironata Particular' is a movie that is very popular and I have seen more than once. Now I have finally seen, I am very happy. This is one of the most spectacular performances by Marcelo Maestroani, who plays in other works such as 'La Dolce Vita' and '8 1/2' from the great Federico Fellini. The film directed by Ettore Scholl, will introduce characters and develop a slow story on a particular day, visiting Adolf Hitler on that day. <br /> <br /> Marcelo Maestroini is Gabrielle Antonienetta (Sophia Loren). She is a member of Mussolini party, her ideas are very beautiful, and she is no longer a member. I can not disclose the reason for this. On the day every man from his mansion looks out to see Hitler, with his husband and children, who are still in the building. Antoniate's bird escapes and goes to Gabriela's apartment and how two people met. Before Antonietta went to Gabriel, he thought he had killed me. <br /> <br /> I can not disclose how this story develops from here, but it makes a special day, not the fact that Hitler was in Rome. <br /> As I said, a stunning performance of Maestro. You see someone who wants to be around him, and we do not know why. He may prefer Antonieteta, he is in love with her, and there are other reasons. What does Antonietta feel to us? What does this man want from her? She likes her attention anyway. Let's see how her hair looks attractive to the man. Loren is very good. We understand her questions, but we can not know exactly what her intentions are. The movements that find both their secrets are a great moment if you can call it. From there the story is more interesting to develop, but I do not want to spoil it for you. This is the movie you want to watch. Great performances and a beautiful cinematography, and it still stands today message.
