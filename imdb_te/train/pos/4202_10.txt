Sam Fuller's spectacular picture is Bunch's pick from many of the early 50's low-budget low-budget Nair vehicles on the South Street. The pick-up, tough, sandy, explosive and endless entertaining on South Street with a length of 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Vedar mark stars as McCoy is already a three-time pickpocket attack. McCoy will not be able to keep his wandering fingers uncomfortable - and the difficulty lies when he eats a bag of mango candy (Jean Peters) of Gangster. The microfilm has an invaluable roll for the wand of the Candy's Wallet Communist movement and is her last job for former boyfriend Richard Kiley to deliver. However, when Widmark is lifted, Peters should do anything to get her back (first) she does not know anything about her. <br /> <br /> It is a tasty set with the role of the wizard, dead KISS of Death, unpredictable and rugged, yet interestingly appealing. Do you know what you are going to do when Bogart or Mitchchu is in the role of a movie Noir: a lone leader is a moron-laconic person who allows him to continue his moral integrity and win in the end (Bogart), or a trap (Mitchuch). With Widmark you do not know what you are just going to get, and his amazing modern acting style (his films always hold on) is amazing to see him. Here he is crushed by selling a movie or by handing it to the police and making a big score by fighting "civil" towards civil rights. <br /> <br /> He has never put the Peter to the point of preventing the fourth rap of life on his sheet. <br /> <br /> Peters can not imagine Mol-Widmark's golden candle perhaps his scenes with the best Peters; The cute trump comes quickly (and rather unreliable - the romance perspective is moved rather than the Widmer's spell), and Widmark changes between her kisses or her slapping around. Peeters hard-edge beauty and lack of over-locked Hollywood glamor (Lana Turner does not do well in this role), the film's main asset. Candy is not naive, yet she is very weak, constantly pass between and slap around men. Widmark wraps her cold in the first fraternity and she wakes up by pouring beer on her face, by the ultimate law he is very soft (after she is a hell to hell out of Kile). <br /> <br /> Thelma Ritter is well-suited for her Oscar nomination, as Stooly Mo. Ritter's acting is like all in the picture, sand, true and hearty and honest. Her death scene is amazing. Fuller's camera movements and location settings are especially interesting. Fuller enjoyed a good close-up and filled up the pickup in the street in the south, with stiff shots that promote platinum's tension. Fuller was not afraid to leave a shot for longer than the standard Old Hollywood, and the ratter's death from the scene of the spectators to provide maximum impact. <br /> <br /> Urban areas and exceptional, face camera angles Choose South Brawl, a bold, unbeatable modern look. <br /> <br />
