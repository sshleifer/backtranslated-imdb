Betty Midler is again Divine! In love with humorous burlasque. With the new jokes with new clothes, the ability to bring tears to old lines and with more power and punch than in the past. All songs sing new songs, good old / eternal ones like "the Rose"; "Be with me" and yes, even "wind under my wings". The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M always is the lie - the best thing to do, I have been strongly recommended with a mixture of adult wound-kannid witch and appreciation and a child-friendly desire to carry out all boundaries!
