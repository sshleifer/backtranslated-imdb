Age films are very common these days soon. In 1980, "foxes" really gave the meaning. Jodie Foster plays her role directly. Since she has been a "taxi driver" four years ago, she has a strong role in the film. She is a very high school with Jeanie, and she has survived it from any situation. Scott Boyce plays the Brad Path before Chachi in "Happy Days". He deemed the other girls immature. Cherie Curie all down with the wrong group, her father's father chased. Jeanie and her three friends decide to live in the forest until a party hired a house. Exploring the other side of the tracks can be fun or dangerous. When Jani and Brad wasted at all times, she will save her. The reality of her death in the automobile accident is hard to come back. And marries a big man. Growing up is not easy, sometimes we had to explore life. In fact, be careful about the people around you. For me, I'm my own person, and I'll be that way! Great music, great plot, this movie is a gem! 4 out of 5 stars!
