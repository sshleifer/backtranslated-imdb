Everyone, my name may be weird noise, but nothing else! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I do not see this before it's foolish! In fact this is a good thing. It's a ridiculously interesting movie and my absolute all-time favorite thing is how they interfere with other things into one! As the chicken cheese, the Fish and Pig Ring playing fish as King King, "The Beauty of Twas, who killed the beast", the scene of the worlds war and more. The Walt Disney Company did not lose his touch for this touch. Moreover, how they made a movie, and it was a home movie. <br /> <br /> Some parts are not good enough. Like in the original Lion King, is not Timon and Pumba with Cibola when he defeated Scar? In this movie, they are not! They fought off the back of Heynas. Thor further, the reason why Pumbaa is not so confident and because it is because he is forced to avoid other animals, it's just Timon, Timon, Timon. <br /> <br /> However, anyone knows that Tyman has just told the story.
