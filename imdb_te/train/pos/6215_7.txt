Although I'm not a big fan of musicals, I'm very fond of Fred Astier and Ginger Rogers's movies because they are so much fun. Certainly, they may be a bit of a formula, but even if you know what's going on, they are still very happy to see. However, despite this, I was a bit disappointed in this outing. This movie does not have a fantastic hoop, because you've seen it in TOP HAT or WE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horstone or Eric Blor, the film is not quite a bit - especially in the "fun" section. The silly adversaries of these supporting actors gave you the appeal of other films that did not follow Fletat. Moreover, unlike the normal role played by Asterhare, this is more of a folly - his fat-headed Rogers will again suffer again. And, as a result, it should be very difficult to like him or look at them at the end of the movie. Plus, while the music is by Irving Berlin, the songs do not look just memorable. In fact, no songs are unique and I can not remember any of them though I watch the movie. Although it is still a beautiful and valuable movie, it does not have some shining and magic in their other films. From good but very great.
