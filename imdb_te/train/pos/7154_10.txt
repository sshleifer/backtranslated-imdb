Two children and adults entered the story about the "holes" that I heard from people that I was not a typical Disney. Folks, let me tell you I'm not disappointed. The "Holes" follows Stanley Elnets, a young boy who sent a strange childhood camp on the basis of a novel by Luis Sachar and a deserted childhood camp in the desert. He is friendship with the nickname Zero and put together the adventure of their lives. This is a very interesting, unique, different and funny story. I had a lot of hope when I saw it. It's interesting to see the story as a story pieces. Boys who acted as juvenile offenders are very fun and Jon Voitt is just happy with Mr. Sir. Now I see the movie, I have to read the book. Highly recommended!
