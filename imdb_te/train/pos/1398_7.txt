Another episode from childhood, as an adult, I'm looking back at a different perspective. This is one of my favorite childhood episodes, one that really cemented my worship of this show. However, when looking at the episode after 20 years, I'd say that it is one of the lively and entertaining actors in the earlier and best season, rather than the dramatic and well-constructed story lines in the previous episodes. . Perhaps this episode was written for a little fan R & R! As Mr. Spock says, the story is not just logical, but ultimately the final final of Mr. Spokes, there are some ridiculous lines - he's captain, McCoy and their R & amp; they say, he makes a eyebrow and Mr. Spock is the only "attractive ... "He said. In fact, an amusement park is actually the idea of ​​a ridiculous garden (for instance of Disneyland's fake and often annoying "amusing" entertainment), a person's aspirations actually come. Really, great idea but not well executed. <br /> <br /> How come from the Theodore Sturgeon among the great SF short story writers who used the first season, how awesome was the script to the script? <br /> Now, Trivia I learned at this point: In 1987, James Gonte Theodore Sturgeon was awarded the best short-term science fiction story. And I'll quote the rest from this site: In 1968 he wrote a stereogenic "Joy Machine", a third script that never featured on the Star Trek TV series {Amok Time the Other}. The main reason that is not used in this sequence is that it has very expensive special sequences for their budget. However, the script was published by science fiction writer James Gun (Star Trek # 80, The Original Series) and Pocket Books in 1996. <br /> <br /> This episode is still very pleasant to this album, especially if I do not think much about it. Just laugh and it and the next part we can get back to the serious stuff that protects the universe.
