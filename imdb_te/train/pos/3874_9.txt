And I absolutely adore Isabelle Blues !!! She is so beautiful in the film and is much different from her role in "Quebec-Montreal", where she is like a man-eater. I want to be nominated for a jotra. I mean, Clylio Moree is good, but Isabelle is very good, IMO. Pelletier did his first work well, and found that he had a romance with a couple of friends from Rock and Belles Orilles, Guy A. Elpepage & Andre Ducherm. It's so much fun to see this stuff, I do not know what they're going to look like. <br /> <br /> I saw romantic comedy from Quebec, which I did not like. This is such a pleasure as good as I've had no pleasure. And if you think you're in the states and how you can get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca has delivered me less than a week.
