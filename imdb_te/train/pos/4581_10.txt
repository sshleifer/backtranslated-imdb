A French novelist, his wife hated by community friends, goes for relief to North Africa. Where he meets a delicate & talented Benoist girl living in poverty. <br /> <br /> The fairytale Josephine Baker is a full-fledged French movie title character, though he is his wife, who loves the Maharajah, and he decides to train and educate the girl. With her enormous eyes and infection smile, she will soon be introduced with the heart of the viewer. She made a pure pleasure to see her with a clear bliss of high-sized personality and appearance. Baker will focus on what happens to poor Alvina during our evolution & introduction to European armor. <br /> <br /> Albert is doing well with the Prize Baker's Galleta Pygmalion; George Pellatt is a half-caste servant and Jean Gallant is the secret Maharaja. <br /> <br /> Unlike American films in this period, the PRINCESSE TAM TAM does not have racism, looking at the small memories of the film Busby Berkeley. It should be pointed out that France does not have a Hayce office or production code. Some of the dialogue and actions provoke, but the baker singing and dance to 'under the African Sky', as well as her memorable performance at the Paris Nightclub, are memorable moments of the film. <br /> <br /> Josephine Baker was born in 1906 in a poor family in St. Louis. Her talent and driving ambition, however, soon moved her to the east, and she was a cast member of Ziegfeld Follies for some time. She was able to reach Paris, where she discovered that a great woman had been in the middle of the 1920s, and eventually reached the Folly-Burgers & Le Negri review. The French praised her and she became very famous. For a long time back in the US in 1935 things changed for African-Americans. She returned to France, became a French citizen and worked for Resistance in the early days of the war. Baker has been transferred to Morocco during intervals and the Allied forces have been there. <br /> <br /> After the war, Baker's luck started slowly and she encountered many financial and personal problems. For a while, she was also banned from the United States. In the end, Baker Monaco's princess accepted Grace's offer from the Principality. Josephine Baker returned in 1975 when he died at Stroke at the age of 68. <br /> <br /> In the two good films - jouzou & prince's teem-baker are in danger and become obscure. But she deserves all along with Chevalier, Dietrich & Robeson, one of the truly legendary performers on her behalf.
