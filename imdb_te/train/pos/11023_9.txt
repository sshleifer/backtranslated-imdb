A stylized and alert man who had previously provided the most versatile glow to the roles of Raleigh Balboo and Rambo was such a stallon because Sylvester Stallone was the best choice to play the lead role by Renny Harlin. Compared to Cliffhanger's Die Hard series is a very far-off concept. <br /> <br /> The wonderfully engraved opening scene introduces the audience to thrill, suspense and intrigue. Cope with the expatriates. <br /> <br /> The snow storm makes a chill shaking the dirt of the cold Alps and the difference between the open maestro and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Playful movies and brutal murders play until the end of play. <br /> <br /> Good films are not made every year and people do not always have dinner every now and then. In some scenes, the brilliant enthusiasm of dirty language / prayer, even after several years of the film, has not been used to appealing appeal.
