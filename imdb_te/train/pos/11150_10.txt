I look and sit and think "Midnight Cowboy" is another overtress '60s /' 70s film. Midnight Cowboy "(" Taxi Driver, "" Mein Streets, "" Panic in Needle Park "), as well as many favorites.They have a strong reputation among the most sensational criticisms - unfortunately most of them do not hold today as well. Easy rider. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " "Leni" / "The Simpsons" is probably a bit funny at times - he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks), but Hoffman is completely convincing - Enrico "Rasso" Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman gives her the best one, in the budget of the film that was just a major actor in Hollywood "Cowboy" is the second Josef Jon votil as Joe Buck, who travels north to Big Apple, hoping to be a male prostitute, and shortly afterwards his innocent ways are troubling him, and with his disable scam artist named "Rosto" - Jose's "manager" to a certain percentage of gains offers. <br /> <br /> This film is for a long time at two o'clock but is really too long. Some films, such as pulling up some of the films produced in the '70s, especially because they were (in the easy riders, ragging bulls), the directors in the 1970s were the stars of the films, and occasionally they bit too much of their content, as long as the characters / scenes / That's not important. It looks very old about the movie just about the film and it's about the only scene I thought was a bit too long and unnecessary drug party - it looks very old on the movie (like the drug odysseys in "Easy Rider") and really does not hurt its flow because it does not need to. Other than that, "Midnight Cowboy" is almost flawless film. I was pleasantly surprised. It's a bit complicated (such as gay movie theater sequence) but you have its content "Midnight Cowboy" really a great movie, the late 60s / early on (but not always used, as the flashbacks were a bit tacky and they were never used) The unyielding test of life in the streets of the 70s. It may be huge in a generous perspective of a discouraging film, yes, and a bit old and huge "Life Terrible, etc." by today's standards ... but I still have to stay with me for love and especially for a very touching ending <br /> <br /> Most recommended. One of the best films of the 70s. (It was technically released in late 1969, but I still classified it as a 1970s film.It won the Best Picture Oscar as the first and only X-rated motion picture. It was later re-rated on the appeal R. 5
