Yesterday I saw this picture and enjoyed it very much. I have interrupted the student's screen writing and a small scene in a scene where something crucial / atmosphere happens. <br /> <br /> I think the dialogue is very sharp and the pledge of the story is just shocking - at a particular time Barbara Stanwick publicly flirt with his daughter's boyfriend; And rebuilding some feelings of her husband who had not seen her in ten years; And the hoolock signal 'Two shots and then' she hooks up with her old Shang colleague Dutch (the reason she left town in the first place!)! <br /> <br /> The moral majority is totally angry to see just Barbara Stanwick and Ko 'Bunni' - love directly from clothes and cinematography and hip conversations. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film for a long time since then one of the best movies ever.
