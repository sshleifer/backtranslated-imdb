When I rented Domino I thought it would be too late. I really hate the elegant editing and cinematography and Domino movies. On other occasions I saw Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott because I saw. I actually enjoy the basis of adventure stories. Yes editing and cinematography are insane, the story is weak, and acting is average, but I still loved this movie for some bizarre reason. Domino is very entertaining and often very funny. This was horrifically underestimated when everyone came to love it, because everyone else had more emotional travel like Scots on the previous film Man on Fire and got an amazing spectacle instead. I really understood that many people hated Domino, I loved it and recommended it.
