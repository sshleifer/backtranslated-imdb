John Water's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Peker" is the best film I have seen for a while. This gives life surreal image to the viewer with a Warhol-colored, exaggerated movements and emotions in Balearmore (I live in Washington DC). Peaker becomes bigger than his town, and is separated from his beloved (including sexy rick) by his human-loving artist. A hot summer day is kind of like fresh strawberry ice cream - and this flavor is rather flat and simpler, and the whole thing made it even more profound and complex - the film leaves a refreshing flavor in my mouth. It's the right to endure life, freedom, and weapons ... a celebration and everything in this country. -Juva Piagazzi (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
