Sixty-people are not talking about half-blind (or half-blind) polished films. I do not have to do it anymore. But this film is a rush of adrenaline! Yes, that's right - it's quite accurate - when history goes - but it does not remove any punches when walking beyond the usual Portuguese-film territory: use real locations in the traffic-traffic Lisbon and hire a real audience about 30 years ago. And by God they got it right! Well, to sum it up: It's very exciting if you live by it, but there are small improvements that you can do as well as platform requirements. If you're just looking at random, you're only for the history of good history, a little more thought-proof than a recent history and general. Even by European standards, yes.
