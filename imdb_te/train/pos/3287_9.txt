My friend and I have chosen the "Paperhouse" out of a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion on the horror section - for us it is heard, but the blurb in the box really promises. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 11-year-old Anna Madden has dreamed of a home and is looking at her dreams. She is sleepy when she finds her house, but it is completely in the sense of a different reality reality. Whatever, then in the view of the events, does not seem far to be true from the truth. However, she finds that she can add her home and its surroundings and her surroundings into the film. <br /> While this is happening, Anna is worse with the fever and is completely engrossed in her home and her drawing. On top of that, she and her mother also deal with her father; <br /> <br /> Okay, drawing things will sound adequately - but obviously something really exists. It's terrible. Dreamworld is amazingly surreal - for example, the house is just a gray block in the middle of an empty garden. In this alternate world / continuing dream we have done a lot of trouble for this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the things that Anna adds to the house is that she keeps talking to her to be the same doctor (I do not give up, you know from the moment she's the same kid). In fact, Mark could not walk because of illness; In Anna's drawing-world, he could not get any legs because he could not walk. She blames herself for her real life illness and tries to correct the situation, but everything starts out really luckily. She also brings her father in drawing with accidental consequences. <br /> <br /> I would like to give you anything away, so I will stop there ... There are so many characters in this movie. I'm sure you have a ball that explores this thing to death with your pals after seeing you - is it a simple story or actually layered? I do not know, but it's so lovely. "Elm Street Nightmare on Elm Street" -the quality of it, in a particular topic and dreams. <br /> <br /> "My only complaint is that it has ended many times, but it does not, and I am satisfied with the ending (some of you may have some sensitive types of clnex!), which really has different conclusions. <br /> <br /> It really does not get right after the end of it, but when you look at it and it falls back to fading, <br /> <br /> Still, "paparazz" is a good film, and it is acting - Anna, particularly Charlotte Burke - the top lyricist, Burke, a real gem that never appeared in earlier or earlier film. /> <br /> "Paperhouse" is not exactly a horror movie, it's a fantasy / certain precise horoscope moments with suspense / something else - but you can still see with your family and your little brother Or grandmother, or a splash of blood would not be afraid to charge either. <br /> <br /> Give it a chance, you will not regret it! And maybe you should read the book ...
