Surprisingly thriller with more turns and double crosses than a doodle pad. It's a great cast with a striking story to watch a Twin Peaks-Ish effect in director Dal. Nicholas Cage shows a great role of the man in a tailor-made actor and a well-to-do performance. J.T. Like Dennis Hopper Walsh (RIP for great actor) is always an amazing villain. It is a shame that he has never been a high profile in the biz. I'm sure he has his followers. For all, it's a great picture to show you that you do not need a commercial soundtrack for big bangs or a fun movie.
