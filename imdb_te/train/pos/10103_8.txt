I spent years looking for a copy of this movie (16mm, dvd, vhs), so I showed my children. The film is funny, and Spike and his band members are why they are the best musicians in the business. They should be that good to play that slowly. <br /> <br /> The film's turn of the century is turning, firefighters and department band (when fires are struggling)). Common running clothes, plus Spike Jones and his orchestra turbulence. Moreover, the comedy relief provided by comedian Buddy Hackett and straight-person Hugh O'Brien.
