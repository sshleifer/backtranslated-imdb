Eddie Murphy portrays Chandler Jarrell, allowing her to find lost children. When the beautiful key Nang [Charlotte Lewis} enters his life, he tells the person he has chosen and must see the Golden Child. Going through the greed and intrigue, Jarrell takes part in a fairy-tale journey, all of which are dangerous and worse goddess Sardo Nampa. <br /> <br /> The Golden Child A is the product of its time, I mean, the popularity of Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child is unique to the audience in the late 1980s. In the decade, the movie may be reminiscent of folk entertainment, at the box office at 79,817,937 dollars, earning 8th biggest revenue in 1986, but Eddie Murphy's rejection of the films after the 80s was a remake of the comic speeches they really had. The Golden Child is not with the Murphy portraits of the 80 Murphy Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, which is not much accepted, but recently renewed the film and Murphy is my cinematographer, quipping and lovely excellence! Seriously! <br /> <br /> In 1981, the Golden Child touched all the required genre buttons, caching in a fantasy action formula renewed and temporarily called by the Lost Ark's Raiders. Pretty girl, a racist with a quip in his arsenal, the villain {Charles Dancing English I can not kiss him}, amazing color, and a beautiful kid with spiritual energies, the film asks to take part in the fun, the image of a crap fantasy can not break its value and get up . Yes CGI Spectrum now looks creaky, and yes if the art 80s, 90s and beyond have very good pictures, but if you really agree with this insulting rating of 5 here then this genre is just a little too intense, seriously. 7/10
