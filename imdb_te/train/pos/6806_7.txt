Ernest Maurissa, at the time, was awarded with the most respected Austrian directors, beautiful scenes, delicate love and all the valuable things in life. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, if people do not hear about him, they have linked Marischka with the SISSI trilogy (1955, 1956, 1957). Nevertheless, he was Das Dreamedlerus (1958), EMBEZZLED Heaven (1958), and certainly a magnificent and sophisticated coin, Madsenjäärner Ainer Konigin, who shows young Queen of Queen Victoria. Despite the slightly different theme than the SISSI movies, I do not see much difference between the film and the SISSI. <br /> <br /> The film is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the staff are almost the same. <br /> Cast ... Romei Schneider is one of the first major characters. This film was a lovely introduction to Sissi's role a year before the first part of the trilogy about the Austrian Empire. Romi is also a film with her mother Magda Schneider. But Ernest Maurice is not the first director to play Romini to play with her mum. Romei's debut, Wenn der Wisse Fleuder Wieder Blan (1953) also had her performance with her mother. Hence, there are some voices that Austrian Career has started on her mother's fame. In fact, there is some truth in it. <br /> <br /> Again, in SISSI, the film is very romantic with love. Victoria joins Prince Albert in a small insert in Dowr. Their sympathy depends on the pure majesty of dance and delicate smiles. And now ...? How was it displayed? Sexual relationship ... but what is love? <br /> <br /> I am grateful to Ernest Maurice for these films. They have a soul and a message. Some people call them kitchi, but I can not give these pictures. They are Impressionist !!! Unusually, highly UNDERRATED!
