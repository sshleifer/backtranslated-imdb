Although I have not seen this short-series in twenty years, I still remember the balance between the story, the story and the story of the fantastic adventures. The use of special effects is more compelling to make poetic than telling the story of the story. Two versions I've seen (English and French) have been translated, but there is a sync problem because actors are not just Italian to speak their own language. It does not spoil the story. Penelope Cast Irene Papas is the most recognizable to North America. Recommended for all followers of Odysseus.
