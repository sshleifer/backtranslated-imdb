<br /> First, I'm a senior high school senior in Shakespeare classroom, I really do not even like it, half a little less! <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> Second, it is 4 hours long! <br /> <br /> I never thought that it was a good thing. This image is very beautiful, very beautiful and I really understand all the languages ​​because it's being displayed. Now, the script was followed by the script, a script that I do not understand in Shakespeare's classroom. And here I opened my mind and understand me. I suspect myself when looking at the picture! But be less and behold ... when performing, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare really was a master who wrote great stories. When I look on the big screen, especially the high budget is the main motion picture style (with beautiful cinematography and photography), and brilliantly and casting out of the cast, something ... I understand what's going on. What is said. The language is wonderful and passionate. <br /> <br /> Whenever a nominal word does not describe, perhaps Shakespeare can do it. <br /> <br /> The North Star's fist (animated, English dub) is a great movie ever made. No movie offers more fun entertainment. But the dethroning of dramatic dethroning from the location for an image (which hamlet scored - it came close) is truly amazing ... wonderfully inspiring. That's not the movie. This is an event. <br /> <br /> The more exciting it is to congratulate Shakespeare on me. Wow. Powerful. Powerful word. <br /> <br /> You will receive 2 hundred trillion stars from these infinite stars. Yes yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, you can outdo all children in the Shakespeare classroom ... forget it. You have time. You should see the plays you have performed. Only then will justice be done to them.
