Diane Keaton has played some "heavy" roles in her years on the big screen, but she is more famous for "light and soft" stuff with Woody Allen as "Annie Hall". She deserves the role of Oscar as the best actress in a play for this effort, and the contest which was first shown was not really clear. Try and find out what she does not see. And with it at full speed at all speed, its speed and retails, action, all the huge drama. This make-up made her the youngest girl ever and she was close to her at the age of 30, but she was playing at half and was fast. The film is well done, performed well and filmed well with strong support cast but Keaton takes up load.
