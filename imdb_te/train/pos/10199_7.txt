As a child, I liked this game. In 1993, I played a Jillian game with my friend Andrew Spring. I used to play Axel or Blaze and he will never get bored with Adam and we will no matter how often we do it. Then the Rage 2 Streets came out. <br /> <br /> We quickly forgot that the former cops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who left the power to take the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels of a run down and corruption thru city thru led by the evil Mr. X. Beating and end-level boss of all the bad guys is very fun. Level 4 (bridge) You could chuck evils down the holes in the river because there was my faeve. At the end of the game (at the price) you also have the opportunity to become the right hand man of Mr. X. This will lead to the 'bad end' that you become the 'syndicate owner'. <br /> <br /> If you destroy the Syndicate on your way to Mr. X, it's no mystery. <br /> <br /> In the Streets of Rage there is also amazing music. Composer Yozo Koshiro has done wonders with Sega Genesis's limited technology. Main Background, Level One, Level 4 and Final Basses standout tunes. <br /> <br /> As a Wii owner, I am proud to have this in my consoles. <br /> <br /> It is also available with Streets of Rates 2. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you do not know what to do, <br /> <br /> Rage 2 is the most infinite number of infinite more intrepid streams. <br /> <br /> Poor enemy AI batsmen often come out of you instead of participating in battle, especially angry with the level 5 boss <br /> <br /> The absence of combo movements <br /> <br /> The absence of good firearms <br /> <br /> Graphics B-sound A-game B- B- lasting appeal of the game
