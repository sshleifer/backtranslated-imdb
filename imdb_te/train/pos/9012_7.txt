Think of Richard's misfortune, a painter, whose real hobby will fly. When we met him for the first time, he appeared on a mansion in London where he wore his wings. He wore his canvases and other works at his disappointment, and wore a flying instrument for his jump. When he comes in a protective police garment, he will feel a scratch, but he meets him before a judge. The relationship with Richard and Anne is clear, and he decides to use a plan to build his own airplane to a rural area where he finds a place in the country. <br /> <br /> Richard Jane Harcard is reluctant to help. She is A.L.S. Or a young woman suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease and a wheelchair chair. Jane is very clever, but there is a dark side and a tangy vocabulary. Sometimes she uses a hand-held device to talk, because her speech is not clear. Jen prefers to lose his virginity at any cost. <br /> <br /> Jean, who finds porn in her computer, finds someone like Richard Gear and "American Zigolo", who has a fees and sex with her.When Richard takes her to London, her fee is unjust, But they agree, because they do not have money, Richard decides to loot the big bank. By the way, Richard Jane takes a ride on a breathtaking aircraft in his life and takes them to a person who brings them closer when they find an alliance. <br /> <br /> Peter Greengrass Related image She is not a romantic heroine in the films, and she has such a sweetness that she does not feel for her and is not trying to achieve her. This film is not beautiful or does not give a rosy picture of a teenager suffering from a miraculous disease. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter is the main reason to watch the movie. She makes an amazing Jane. On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh may not be perfect for this kind of comedy. He has his own problems as he describes Richard. Anne, Gemma Jones has some good moments as Richard's former love. <br /> <br /> "The Theory of Flight" seems to be a good director. No doubt Peter Greengrass will go big and good things.
