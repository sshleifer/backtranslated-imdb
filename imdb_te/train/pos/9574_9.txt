It should be one of the best films to come out of HK for a long time, I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing my hands in the movie. The program loaded with amazing actors and I was particularly impressed with Sam Lee's inexorable incredible mad behavior and Edison's role as a killer machine, which completely changed his usual iconography. I would definitely recommend those looking for a beautiful and action pack movie. Nevertheless, I should warn you, it is also an equally frustrating film, because every character in the movie fights dead end and struggles to breathe and breathe. Really, life is a matter of life.
