It was a success at Southwest South West (SXSD) Film Festival in Austin last year, and E.R. Gloria Reuben, and scenery-chewing is the best cast led by John Glover. Though filmed in a small budget in NYC, the film looks and looks awesome, and the actors felt that the oldest curse of the "Macbeth" game, known as "The Scottish Play" by Richardsal and the Whirlwind. The actress displays all the emotions of a bit of drama, emotion, jealousy, excitement, suspicion and fun. These games start when a well-known actor (in the lead role) is replaced by a famous "pretty face" to attract large crowds from the TV soap opera scene. The green-eyed monster takes off from there, and the play is good. Good soundtrack, and all good performances. DVD Director's commentary and some deleted scenes.
