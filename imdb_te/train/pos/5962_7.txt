"Something I've managed to put off this one, which is strange because it's probably the most popular and well-received because I've seen a slew of" 80 rocker horror "over the years, as ridiculous fun gems like" Slumber Party Slaughter 2 "are as rubbish as" Terror in Tour " , I was finally caught up with it and it's easily the most awful this best (but almost always lovely!) Subtitle. (The film is pretty much abandoned in the "Black Roses") for Eddie's radish masculinity, making fun of his taste in music at his high school, he loves the 80s metal, specifically his statue Sammy Carr (who plays the last great Tony Fields) After Sammy's killing, the Eddie fan Radio DJ will give him the final recording of Sumy. After the kay record, he realizes that he is a bit stronger, and the bad things happen to those who strangle him. "Trick or Treat" is well made and total owls, with special 80s laser beams. When I grew up in the 80s, and when I was not a fan of heavy metal, I should remember the urban myth that the record of Satan's worship sounds behind. Haha! Both KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan as I also told my older siblings and neighbors, so both were fun to make comos as a comedy radio DJ and anti rock rock priest. If I see this film as a child! Why the audience really can not find why the film is ruined by demolition from dead creation and killing those who are on his way, as the film is hit by a fun between the devil worship and heavy metal in the 80s. This is a weak point of the film, but if you overlook that, it's loaded with fun.
