The lovely piece of good cinema. It's one of those movies you're laughing and why you do not know. One of the most surprising directors today is ours and he is able to portray emotions. <br /> When you look at the film, Mr. Straitt felt he was determined to go to visit his brother with his "brother" John Deere. <br /> What has changed in your mind when looking at this picture? <br /> <br /> A beautiful brotherhood love story.
