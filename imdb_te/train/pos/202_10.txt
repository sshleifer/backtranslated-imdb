Give this movie a 10/10 because it deserves a 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time have been cast with Walter Mottau & George Burns Neil Simon and other actors are working with director Herbert Ross in the film, and everything is simulated in this stage. Sunshine is one of the best films of boys 70. <br /> <br /> I got this movie in VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS is only $ 3) because I loved the kind of humor in this movie. As soon as I got home, I saw it, but I had to look again because I did not lose some of the first time. The second time I saw it, that's great, and I worked a lot. <br /> <br /> It is definitely going to be back on DVD to see these special features. <br /> This is how fun it happened. Two people work together as entertainment / actors / performers. They mix well on stage, but they really argue the venue, they can not survive from another minute, and then 15 years later, you want to get them back for a particular TV. You can see it in this picture. Matthew & Burns are fantastic in this movie. It is a damn shame that they have died. George Burns qualifies for that Oscar. He gave a strong comedy show. He is 78 when he filmed the film. So far, he was the oldest actor to receive an Academy Award at the age of eight. Jessica Tandi breaks the record into an ancient actress. Richard Benjamin is also excellent in this. He won the Golden Globe as Best Supporting Actor. He deserves a Golden Globe. Although many people did not agree with what I was saying, everyone in the film gave a strong performance. This comedy is an instant classic. I highly recommend it. Another thing: Who hates the movie is "Putz"
