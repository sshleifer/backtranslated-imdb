We stumbled on last Sunday's documentary, Gray Gardens and "sucked" without warning. Everybody who enters the room is seen on television, as well as Eddie and Eddie's haunting paintings, living on a bed of a large slum building on the beach, cooked in bed) and cat urination on edited bed and her unbelievable words, "I am developing a smell [of smell]." We did not see at the beginning and were surprised at what we were looking for, and they were surprised to see how the elite women were. Must see !!!!
