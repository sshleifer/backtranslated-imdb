Ever since I remember, I loved airplanes and flying. I'm now in college with a private pilot license and want to see commercially. I did not remember why I was engaged to this subject until I came across my old tile spin tapes in my basement at home, which hit me. My parents bought each tape they have and this is the only show I can see as a kid. I grew up with a theme I remembered and I can still cite it again. It's absolutely amazing and I plan to buy DVD's soon! This is really good for kids and adults and is completely over time. I can not get this presentation enough.
