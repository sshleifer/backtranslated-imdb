My selection for the great feature film Lagharton's use as "Night of the Hunter" is amazing in my canon. But, it may have been replaced by a very artistically Daoist film "Shower" I saw. The way to care for others is the flow of water, water stimulation, and soothing, and cleansing, and so on. It is possible to argue that NOFTH and Shower Themes are the same, and the former's Lion's Gish denotes the pure look of Darwana in the bathroom's organizers referring to the pure form of the graduate. I can not argue against such a comment. Two films are visual joys in the idea and image integration. And yet, such an unstylized view of chastity in the daily life of the shower is what I consent to. I respect both.
