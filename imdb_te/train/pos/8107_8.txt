How can you make mistakes with actors like Ralph Richardson, Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwick, and Margaret Scott? Very unusual scenes, especially modern ones. The reality of modern machines is very effective. Here you have ray gun explosions from building vehicles to help clear the area, so new constructions can be made. Although she is very young in the film, who is in the future who is from the BBC series Mrs. Pumphrey is not difficult to find who all the Creatures are Great and Small! Raymond Massie and Ralph Richardson are both really effective "reunions". Musical score is the famous Swiss composer, Artur Honerger and it is exceptional. By time (1936) they seem to have really been used, big sets or effects may seem like that. Finally, it's a good story.
