The first true "Mike" film was about Shinzo's story about a Triad Society and I thought this description would be a clich√©. But, like all the clues, it's based on the truth. All Mike trademarks are here, violence, black humor, homosexuality, taboo testing, and central character are difficult. Yet Shinju was one of Michek's most complete films. If he does it again in an interview it is different, but not necessarily good. He understands that the film's realistic attractive fuel and raw edge mean he can not even improve or improve the purity of the film, even if he is able to capture a more visual or technically complicated film. <br /> As you might expect, violence is totally visceral, blood and serious blows, a lady is replaced by a chair that is sitting on a face. (A Michael film allows you to stay away from such a sentence.) The film starts off, not like a dead or alive, but hard and close in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with these factors, and Michael is clearly concerned about the relationship between Japanese and Chinese during the postwar period, and the emotional content is maintained here, and when you start to understand his past, the main character goes to life. <br /> <br /> I can not sing the praises of Shinju. I do not give too much away. Before he starts using CGI to animate his pictures, it is almost as memorable as the sonataine of kitano. The central characters are greatly recognized and the film will be completed as soon as the last twist is satisfied and we'll pop it over and over again.
