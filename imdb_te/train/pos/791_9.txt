I realized that it was a fun, sharp and rich film because it did not have any idea about the film before seeing in Realta Channel. <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent. I loved all the characters, they were a little exaggerated to the places, (but this was a movie). It's a happy ride and the main character takes it when it becomes bad, in real life and does. Yes, I thought Andy MacDouble was great. <br /> <br /> "Andy's role is the conclusion that I think he's never been here", it's totally (I can personally recognize it) <br /> <br /> I think by Chopin, it's a beautiful way to end (ultimately light comedy is unnecessary). "Well done" to the producers - I am 1,000 worst films!
