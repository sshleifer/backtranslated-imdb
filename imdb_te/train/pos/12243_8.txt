Kate Beckinsale is not better than Emma Gwyneth Paltrow in the film, and I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the Emma version. They're good in two different ways. Kate Beckinsale, like Emma, ​​is almost curious. I also liked the woman who played the role of Harriet Smith in this film ... she is more believable sweet and sophisticated. However, there are some elements that are good about Gwyneth Paltrow's version, however, how humorous side is more apparent.
