When I first saw it in 1983 or 1984, I was electrified. Steven Bicco had gone half way through the film but did not forget the resonance of his courage and wisdom. I did not do it in South Africa in 1993. It's also a story about friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa when I saw audiences in Natalie Sikal 'Aferika dancing in the natal, my hair stood in the end. All people should learn a lot from this story.
