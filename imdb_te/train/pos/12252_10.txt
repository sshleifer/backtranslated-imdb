I really enjoyed this adaptation of "Emma" .I have seen it many times and always look forward to seeing it again. Although it was only 107 minutes, the novel plot and sub-plot were developed very satisfactorily. All characters are well shot. Many dialogues come from the novel with the most ridiculous novels included in Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility. <br /> <br /> As a foreigner, I particularly appreciate the defining description of the actors. The arrangement and the dress are beautiful. I have found this version with the "Pride and Prejudice" of the late 1995s, but then the producer and story writer are the same. Kate Beckinsale played the role of her "Emma", Jane Austen told her that she did not create heroin, but she would love her. Even though she is a snubby, it's just adequate to youth and experience. Mark Strong is very good, although Mr Knightley is not an easy part, even if there is no charm shown by Colin Firth's Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice. Emma is also cool and frank chawl to the ending sequence in the novel, but she is completely uncomfortable in the novel and she is also fake and she is in a situation. A strange departure from reliability is shown throughout the movie. I have found the most beautiful and elaborate outfits than other applications from Jane Austen's novels.
