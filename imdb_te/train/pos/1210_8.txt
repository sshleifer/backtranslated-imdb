And my kids love it now! Granted, I can now see and realize the animation is not great, and the plot is trite. <br /> Hey, every villian said, "I think I'm laughed if I say" ammmmm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT ", but it's a moral tale for young children. I've remembered this film after twenty years. I will definitely suggest this one for younger children.
