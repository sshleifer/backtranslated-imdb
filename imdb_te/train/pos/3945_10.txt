A movie used by good acting and directing (or at least for music!) Because the rating is only 5. However, it is worthy of 10 in Walt Whitman's achievements. The previous poster image calls to the cheesy, however, I think it's a common case for the forest not seen. Motion picture producers are clearly interested in getting the story more than the Hollywood glitter film. And for this, I applaud them - it is the main but the fact that reflects Whitman's life as well. This film is more documentary than acting. To be attracted to this story, it is the most important thing you rarely hear of rare stories that shape current mental health. I saw the most enjoyable in history.
