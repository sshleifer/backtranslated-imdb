This was my favorite movie in 1948. Betty Grable's costumes were so ravishing that I wanted her to stay and dress up like that. Douglas Fairbanks junior can not handle the Hungarian officer. The silly and fluffy first look at the film could be the first, when I was eight years old when I felt it was important to say about relationships between men and women. The next day I saw again. I am still surprised.
