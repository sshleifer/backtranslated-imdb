Despite the feelings of many "Star Wars" fans, in my opinion "Jedi Return Off" is the biggest film ever created. From the first time I saw it, it depth, depth, intensity, special effects and moving story overwhelmed me. The film is well-connected to the test in the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The Film Summary (which contains spoilers for the movie) <br /> <br /> "Empire Strikes Back" hangs us for 3 years. We finally found the last story in "The Return of the Jedi". Darth Vader makes a surprising visit to a new incomplete Death Star to oversee the structure of the structure in the emotional crisis. The first emperor appeared in the film because he had an ultimate plan to destroy the Rebel Alliance and bring the young Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side. To protect frozen honey solos from crime, by Luke, Lando, Leah, Doing, and Droids traveling to Tottenine; Jabba the Hut. Han was rescued, and Jabba was defeated, returning to Dugabah to find Yoda to die, where he learned the terrible truth; Darth Vader is actually his father. Rebel leaders have been reconstructed with Rebel Fleet. Other species and species, including Moab Kalamari, have also come up with an all-or-nothing plan for the rebels to destroy before the star is completed. Although Lando was attacked by Space at the Millennium Falcon, Rebel Heroes will launch Death Star's Shield generator in Endor Forest Moon. The rebels were on the fur, but powerful Ewox. When the fierce battle in the two episodes takes place, the third battle is essential, because Luke likes Vader in an effort to persuade him to leave the Darda side. In emotionally sequential scenes, Luka must face his father as the emperor bans his dark emotions. While the young skylarker is going to die in the hands of the Palpatine, Wader turns his wicked teacher to save his son's life. <br /> <br /> A wonderful, emotional film filled with the story of a good negative hero "Return of the Jedi" is good for all of us.
