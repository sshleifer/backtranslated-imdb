A brilliant, undeniably entertaining performance starring Peter Ustinov as his career cheated in a career in a US conglomerate in London. He is fascinated by Foxy (and fraudulent) Maggie Smith and threatened to disclose by jealous man Bob Newhart. This is a heist movie with many brains. Ustinov is exceptional as Smith and Newhart is very fun. Karl Malden is a real surprise that he is popping up the "Executive Vice President". Maldon is very rare. Caesar Romero and Robert Morley pop in some funny characters. Excellent music score Larry Johnson. Eric Til is good to direct and the script written by Ustinov and Ira Wallach is first-rate & very smart. A good time to swing!
