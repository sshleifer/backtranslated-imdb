A beautiful new print of "Jabrisky Point" is displayed in Paris and is doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for the completion of the movie. <br /> <br /> Let us hope that a new DVD is a DVD with some brilliant "extras" in the near future. <br /> When it comes out I have to look at the ZP and remember that it is crashing. At this point I was totally amazed and classed the "miss near" masterpiece. The first part of the film was the last 60's Los Angeles time capsule, where I lived there, and Antonioni made an amazing work to capture the essence of space. Kudos to product designer Dean Tavoularis discovered some amazing positions and unusual work. <br /> <br /> Print I saw it runs for 1 hour 50 minutes. It is forbidden under 16 (or 18, if I can not remember). I suspect a part of the restored footage in this print. Spoiler - I'm surprised that the desert sex scene was initially cut. <br /> The soundtrack music is not available for about 1 hour. Before listening to additional sound like radio broadcasts, etc. Antonioni can be very bold. But remember that the actors do not have Mark Frauret and Daria Halpin's performance skills. This time, Frechet did not bother me. <br /> <br /> Student riot footage seems to me very much like stock footage. One shot is in a different aspect ratio and is distorted by a wide screen. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to figure out how I did some of Frechett's shots flying at Antonion's plane. <br /> He is like some really flying - in some shots there is no blue screen or double. <br /> <br /> I hope to return this movie for the second time. Highly recommended for all Antonioni fans.
