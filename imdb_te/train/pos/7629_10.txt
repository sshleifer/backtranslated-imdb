Kurt Russell IS Elvis, plain and simple. His dedication to this role is the best film bio I think of. <br /> <br /> Television is made after two years of Elvis's death. <br /> <br /> There are two versions - one of the 180 minutes and 117 minutes. The only one to see is the longest one. The footage has been modified for more than one hour. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece will take you from Elvis Childhood's greatest actor of entertainment. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurt's Real Dad) are great as Elvis's parents. Pat Hingle offers a very effective Colonel Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> The King Long Live!
