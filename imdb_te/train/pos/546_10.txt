I thought it was one of the best sequels I had seen for a while. Sometimes I thought I'd like to die, killing Stanley's annoying characters well. It's a very good movie that you're happy with when you die. My house seems to have been filmed with only one home camera and is in some scenes which are considered to be unrealistic. Jade Nelson is at least beautiful in my opinion, he is wonderful as Stanley Caldwell. Wonderful picture.
