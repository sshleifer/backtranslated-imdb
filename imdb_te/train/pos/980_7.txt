James Cloud (Robert Preston) is a summary of his brother Tom (Robert Sterling), which says all of this. Jim, AKA Kid Wichita, there is a way to get things done, only trouble, he usually leaves the bodies where he lives. <br /> <br /> Tom guides are not guided by the younger brother Jeff, who loves the likes he is looking for in the gym, especially when protecting their ranches of native Texas cattle. <br /> <br /> Early credits John Barrymore Jr. was the youngest brother, 'which was his first screen appearance. It was odd to me since it was mentioned as soon as Jeff was in that story. At eighteen at the time of the film, he had a similarity to Sean Penn. I was surprised if his daughter Drew Barrymore could ever see this film to be contrary to personal and legal issues in his career, as well as his family. <br /> <br /> I thought Robert Sterling looked a bit like Roy Rogers in his career. Earlier only in the 1950's TV series 'Tapper', George Kerbie learned Sterling from his role, I thought he was looking out of place in a Western, but it could just be me. His character has created difficulties with his brother's efficacy, and some discourage for such a distinct story. There are small subdivisions, including the younger son Sheriff (Kid Wichita killed) and Kathleen Boyce (Kathy Downs) and her husband Erl (Kid Wichita killing the killer), with Ranger John Gaul (John Litell), who is related to troubled marriage. Chill Wills's main cast is one of Tom Cloud's appointed hands and is one of the most speculative figures in the final stage. <br /> <br /> Many things are not predictable, the principle is a plot like earning points after a short fly, and hence a very good brother / bad brother Westerns do. In addition to the performing actors of the preparations, I would recommend one, the jump cuts I encountered, and some of the typhoid editing.
