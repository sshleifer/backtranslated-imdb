In the first three films of Frank Sinatra, he is a complete action: as he sees himself, he only shows a song in the nightclub sequence in the film of others. In his fourth film, the most enjoyable 'Higher and Higher', Young Blue Eyes transformed into acting life by playing a real role ... He made it easier for him to play himself in a fictional story, because he had a chance to get a fairy tale <br /> <br Sinatra entrance is very fun. Michael Morgan heard a knock at the door, and asks who is there. From outside, Hoboken-tone voice answers 'Frank Sinatra'. <br /> <br /> Early credits of 'Higher and Higher' will confuse some audiences because Rodgers and Hart are popularly listed as songwriters. In fact, they only gave a song to this song: 'The Ridiculous Rich', this cast is a sort of boring experience for the 'I'm a Debut' in a different song altogether. Interestingly, the Rodgers & Heart song - one of their weakest - is probably the least enjoyable song in this film score; <br /> <br /> In this film, he will perform better (and better equipment) elsewhere. The real merit of 'Higher and Higher' is rarely delighted by some of the performers who have made films. Paul and Grace Hartman are many prominent husband and wife dance groups who have starred in several Broadway reverse: the real sleek ballroom dancers, who have plenty of physical comedy in their dance material. Grace Hartman, who died of cancer at age 48, has done almost no film, so she listens to her beautiful singer who gives us a rare opportunity to see us and her maid's uniform See how sexy looks. After Grace Hartmann's death, her husband had a long life as an actor, and only occasionally danced alone. <br /> <br /> In the 'Higher and Higher', the maid of the maid is very uniform, discrete young singer Marcy McGrey. Why did not this talented girl make more movies? Perhaps she is very small in personality for Betty Hutton. I enjoy Hutton's performances, but I also liked Mercy McGuire. 'Higher and Higher' eventually has a fun bit like McGuire and Waitresses with Mary Wickes, which will move from table to tablecloth to nightclub. Alternate stairs of the little McGuire and the longest Jackie Vickey are happy! Regretfully, Leon Errol did not play a big role in 'Higher and Higher', but did not give him a comedy business: once he did not dance his rubber legs. Jack Haley, despite his famous billing, is also ruined. <br /> <br /> Doolie Wilson, who represents the very best here, reminisces from Casablanca. In the film, Wilson made his own song, but 'As Time Goes By' cheated his keyboard performance. (In real life, Wilson was unable to play the piano.) Here in 'Higher and Higher', he was delighted and gave some fun to other players. Less enjoyable is Mel Odious, I mean Mel Torme. Victor Borzau gave a rare film performance here, deftly maintained his conversation but did not make keyboard comedy ever, and then successfully made his career performances. <br /> The plot? Forget this. 'Higher and Higher' is not known for 'great' music, but it is a joyful pleasure, and I rate it from 8 to 8. Director Tim Whelan, who works in Britain and Hollywood, is well-known.
