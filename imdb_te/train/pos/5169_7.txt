I saw in the last five or ten minutes of the film in 1998 or 1999, when I had a channel-surfing before I got to bed, I really liked what I saw. Since then, I have not found a copy of the recently discovered when I discovered that some internet stores were sold, as I scanned TV lists and moved through the DVD / VHS racks in the stores. Then, being a world-class procrastinator, I still do not order it. Finally, on a visit to Portland, or a few weeks ago I found a DVD copy in a circuit city. <br /> <br /> When I was sitting and saw it, it took me only one month after returning home. <br /> What do I think about this film? It's nice. I remember it, not as much as I expected, but it's still worth a $ 999 value for me. For the first time since seeing the first time I rated it 7/10, it's likely to be 8/10. I have a good sound system to avoid rewinding then to be less sleepy, and catch some dialogs.
