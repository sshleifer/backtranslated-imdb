Michael Powell and Emerick Presberger's great talents can be seen in the spectacular "A Matter of Life and Death". It is part of a recent tribute to Mr Powell, played in Walter Ridge in New York. <br /> <br /> Jack Cardiff, a wonderful cinematography called "A Matter of Life and Death", is a work of miracles with a camera. Monochromatic tones and actions given to the scenes playing in heaven are different from the colorful when it comes back to Earth. It is very rebellious, and is before its time. The black and white sequence in the long line of chattering Peter and conductor is one of the most amazing things in any film. <br /> <br /> David Niven, Peter, whose plane hit and his best. The friend dies as a result of it. The film is regarded as one of the highlights of Mr. Nine's career. He is an amazing actor who has shown us in this movie. Kim Hunter is surprised by June, his plane is falling from the skies she talks to Peter. With the task, Peter and June fall in love first. <br /> <br /> Some of the British film stars have their role in this role. Robert Coot, Bob, is a person who has joined heaven, but he is surprised that his friend Peter never traveled with him. Maurice Maurice Goring is an excellent star turn as conductor 71. Mr. Goring, who worked with the directors, is the best in the film. <br /> <br /> Roger Livessy, one of the best performances of his career, as well as Raymond Massey as Abraham Fargan as Doctor Frank Reeves. <br /> <br /> "A Matter of Life and Death" is a timeless film that always looks grateful to its creators.
