At the height of racism (involving Shilpa Shetty and the late Jade Goody) in 2007, 'Celebrity Big Brother', I am 'C.B.B.' The show was praised after years of confusing 'racist' '70' sitcoms like 'Kari & Chips' and 'Love Thy Neighbors'. I thought they were hypocritical, and I said so. 'It's hat hot mum' was then thrown into argument, some portrayed as an English actor blacked-up. Well, yes, but Michael Bates lived in India as a boy and Urdu spoke fluently. The show's critique described his reality as "rambi ram". In 1995 in the documentary 'Perry & Craft: The Sitcoms', prominent journalist Rena Setana said that Bates was upset when he heard that Bates lost this role: "No Indian actor can play and play the role." <br /> <br /> There is 'mum' to fellow 'dad army' of Perry and Craft; Set in warfare, the silent English town of Validon-On-Seed has replaced India's hot and fast forests, especially in the area of ​​Deolali, an army exhibiting performances for concert party forces, including the Bombardier Solomons ('Doctor in Charge'), camp gunner ' Gloria 'Beamont (Melvin Hays), the little gunner' Lofty 'Sugden,' Lah ID-mother 'Gunner Graham (John Clegg) and Gunner parkins (the late Christopher Mitchell). The gang is headed by the gang, all of whom are known as 'Poonus' -Major Williams (Wonderful Windsor Davis). His frustration was bitter and intimidating when he could not lead his men into the forest to take part in the fight (although Parkins was good for him as he considered his illegitimate son). By then there was little in English Colonel Reynolds (Donald Hewlett) and Captain Ashwood (Michael Nobles). Rangi is a brilliant old sage, opening every show, talking to the camera, and closing them by saying vulgar Hindu proverbs. He feels he is practically British because he is a barrage. His friends were making tea charlaas (at the end of Dino Shafiq, 'Mind Your Language') and a rope pulled (Babur Bhatti). So real Indians participated in the show - another point to ignore its detractors. Shafiq is also described in credits as' vocal disruptions' (like '40 songs used by random music in' Dads army '). Each edition closed him up with the 'Land of Hope & Glory'. From Williams. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> In 1975, <br /> <br /> Three years later, the show hit the crisis when they died of bets cancer. Unlike the character of 'Rangi', the authors forgot him silently. When George Leyton left, the role of 'Gloria' took her role as 'Bommidier', which provided another source of comedy. <br /> <br /> The last edition of the 1981 soldiers were Blighty, Char. <br /> <br /> The repetitions are relatively small (mainly UK Gold) due to the repetitive 'dogie' fame. It's amazing. For one thing, the show is not particularly about racism. If white whites are wrong, why is David Lean's 1984 film 'A Passage to India' shown on television? (In which Alec Guinness has acted as an Indian and has won two Oscars!). It emerged from Jimmy Perry's own experiences. Some characters are based on real people (Sergeant-Major really referred to his people as 'poofs'). If you keep history on television, I think it's right. Previously refinement is not fundamentally honest, regardless of how it looks to modern audiences. 'Mum' was funny and honest, and viewers looked at it. D.V.D. I thank the heavens. Time to stop this review. Williams says: "I do not get any gossip in this forest!"
