It just lost the first half hour of the sky watching TV. I was surprised if it was a real story, so it finally watched. There is nothing brief at the end to say what happened to everyone. It remembered me about the speed but at the end of the day I saw the error and did not think it was released in the movie. The goof we saw was removed by the bonnet (hood) and the two cars were in the car in a slow-moving car when the bonnet was returned. When the bridge is not reduced, it is thought to hit the baby bridge and of course, especially if I had the edge of my seat. I'm afraid I'm not burst into tears so I'm not that bad !!!!
