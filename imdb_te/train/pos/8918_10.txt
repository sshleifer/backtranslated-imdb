No hidden agenda. Pure Stepfi. <br /> <br /> I saw in the original TV and was very scared. <br /> <br /> The original can be more appreciated compared to the newly seen and forgotten ones. The original, good and only version of the great actor Steve McQueen (BULLET) has to watch. <br /> <br /> The film is up to date, but the blob stands time test up. I believe that the matter is moving in its own accord. <br /> <br /> <br />
