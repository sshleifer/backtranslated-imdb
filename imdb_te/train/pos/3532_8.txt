When Scott Henderson, the engineer, employed by Carol Richmond, and his assistant, called him "speaking Kansas" when he was talking to her. This shows us that Carroll, who played Carl for Ella Rhines, to a 40-year-old Manhattan, is considered a child in the woods. A woman outside the town is a shadow to the solitary artificial subway. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the innocent girl can only experience an adventure. <br /> <br /> Robert Sioux has directed the film Nair very well. He shows a flair for those days of surprising those raw sex combining a lot of story. How else can we make an open pass at a woman at a date, justifying the drummer path in the music, orchestra, where Scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat? A drummer playing a high voltage by Elisha Cook Jr. does not hide his wishes for the ladies who sit in the front row of the hit music. The story of the "Phantom woman" is the first, a real clear invitation to Fay Helm. Later, the cliff drummer inspired the Ella Rhyses, who was going to the changing theater as a dame for her boss. <br /> <br /> It is a movie that hooks any audience in the beginning. It contains things that are described, but it has one's interest. The killer is not known until the end. <br /> <br /> Ella Rhysus is an actress who has predicted in her personalized eyes. She has herself against most experienced actors. Francontone, a New York theater actor working in Hollywood, is not credited in this medium. He is the best friend of the alleged man's best friend. Alan Curtis, on the other hand, looks like a man, when he creates, accepts his luck and secretly preserves only the feminine love of his beloved. <br /> <br /> Thomas Gomes, as Inspector Burgess, is an asset in the film as a film producer, and has suspected that the culprit was caught by the police. <br /> <br /> This film is not disappointing.
