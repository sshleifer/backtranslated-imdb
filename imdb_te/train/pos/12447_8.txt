Modesty Blaze is a great thing from comics and novels, it's great in a movie. Unfortunately, there have been many attempts and they have fallen great in the role. So, no, modesty you do not know from the comic strip (now reprinted in good editions from Titan Books). <br /> <br /> Modesty is 5 to 6 years before the first story, and she is sure to do what you can do with her back story. <br /> <br /> Miramax has rights to the role, Quentin Tarantino has acted as an advocate and technical adviser. The first draft of the Miramax Project attempted to receive one of the best novels, but always left some key points. Tarantino was not happy with any of them and proposed to remove his name from the project, so they continued. To the studio's credit, they wanted to keep him in the process, because he knew the character and her "got" of the world. With the expired film rights, they decided to try a very different approach. <br /> <br /> The film does not introduce Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald. These characters are important for Blaze's adventures in many of the articles published. She shows the strength of her character as to what this film does. She does not lose courage, and you do not suspect that she will be unarmed in the entire room of gangsters with guns. This film is done in a lot of casino, which undoubtedly saved money on the product. It does not matter. The film is not cheap. Instead, it gives a very comprehensive (and believable) back story to the character and displays how much she thinks forward. If Miramax now has to do comic stories or novels, they are well-built with the background of the character and do not need to spend much time on her "origin". I realized that I did not dramatically influence the terms "direct-to-video", but the film is very valuable.
