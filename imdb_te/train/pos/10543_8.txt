A light humor, Nothing shows us the world that sometimes we want to escape: nothing world. Anything you do not like, it does not disappear bills, bad memory, or hunger in your desire. They are very good at the film, and with an enjoyable actor duo, there are some things I do not like about Nothing, and they are not part of the main movie <br /> <br /> First, post credits view (and yes, one): a Good for stew, but what are they trying to accomplish with? I'm confused and nothing interested to see something back after the whole movie. Instead, we just hear a random assortment of sounds and they scream. <br /> <br /> Second, the trailer: I saw the trailer on the DVD. This is a continuation of my opinion and is not really needed, and as others have already said, it encourages the horror film that ever came. <br /> If you see this in your movie rental shop, look and see because the great image that has not seen anything. If you have a big screen, wear shades.
