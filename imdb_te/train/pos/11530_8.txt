A group of friends decides to take a camping trip in the desert and it seems that a black pickup truck was hit and murdered by a mysterious murderer. "Mirage" Spielberg's "Dual" and Craven's "Hills Have Eyes" still offers this slasher yarn nasty violence and gore plenty. The highlight of the film highlighted an order that holds his hand and leg together around a tree and then pulls it through a truck in the chain and cuts his limbs. There are also suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash sequences. Acting is very dull and the script is very weak, but the film is fast and surprising. BGSteers who play the role of the villain are very intimidated. Desert positions provide some atmosphere and the gore is strong. If you like low-budget horror movies, see it in 10 rupees.
