One of the best "Amitabh Reboots" films I liked. This is a step taken by Govinda Dhawan. The songs are awesome and totally "masti" type. An evergreen artist with multiple portraits of Anupam Kher. There are many happy twists and twists for David Dhawan's Pat Boards for the storytelling series. Mrs.Madhuri "I'm" by Dixit, but it is ultimately full riot. After a long exile, Amit is looking to work with such energy and comedy. Though some people think this is a "Bollywood Masala", I can see it on any day. I'm just 10 to 8 to be pure Bollywood.
