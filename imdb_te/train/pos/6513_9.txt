I do not have any reason to go to the theaters, when the fatalities in the film are fantastic when FX is awesome, there are some frustrating moments after the story of the little girl but all in all this I'm someday I kill a little kid The first part of the movie is why it must have come to hope It's a good movie but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who has tried to become a writer, who lives in Witch (Tooth Fairy) and whoever lives in her house will have a great risk of going to property or her property. If you want to see this movie Give away a little away info Then it's not worth the rental price alani
