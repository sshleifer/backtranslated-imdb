I liked the movie. Two families cross paths in history. If Sam's killing, how does the question just follow the line of his family? Did he mention Maden Zero's son and Zero but what other children did they mention? Hmmmmmmmmm. Never fall in love with the teacher and never mention any other children or wife before talking about it? Did not she have a baby before kissing kate bandit? There are also mistakes in the film. Just loved it. Acting was great. When the story ends, the story with Mr. Sir is a woman, but it makes her character even more ridiculous. The other "counselor" is not worry for kids but maybe not quite of course. Poor warden must have a baby that is really chaotic when she grows up.
