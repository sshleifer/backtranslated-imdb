The playback singer Sidney Br√ºhl (Michael Caine) has a series of flap plays after a massive success. He received a drama written by his student, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), which is amazing. It says good Sydney would kill him. <br /> <br /> An idea is a thriller of man. It's actually a play ... and it shows. It's a set and all talk is high but I'm never bored. It is well written with a good cast of plenty of turns and full power work. Cain is great as a bean - one of his great performances. Reeve is surprisingly good. I never thought of him as an actor, but he was good in this role. Dean connoisseurs Conan Bruhel's wondrous role as underwriting. Irene Worth also has a good (and very funny) as a supernatural drop of ten as hell. However, her voice came on my nerves. Director Sidney Lettette makes a great deal with his one set. The camera is always moving and keeps your attention. <br /> When the spoiler is dead !!!!! My only complaint is that the two gay characters in this movie turn out the tension scene and it has one of the most ineffective kisses I have seen - but these are mild complaints. <br /> <br /> <br /> Critics hate this movie (for some reason) and since it was performed in 1982 it was completely disappeared. It's very bad - it's good.
