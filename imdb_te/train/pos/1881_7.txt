Like a drunken Millionaire Playboy Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is the perfect man who is trapped in childhood. As it turned out, Moore is perfectly suited for the role, which also caught him as an actor. Many disappointments soon followed (including the film's pale sequel), but did not reduce the attraction or attractiveness of the film, which was intelligently written and directed. Some of Moore's anesthetic scenes are forced, parts of the film are wobbly, but the cast is a complex picture to resist it with much flavor. It has a very big heart and gives Oscar winner John Geelgood a fun role to play as Arthur's worthy, hawson; His relationship with Arthur is well-known and they have a wonderful understanding. Liza Minnelli (blue-collar love-interest) is a little sauce with a low key and has a moor brush, but nasty and lively; He never accepted Arthur's shadow, but we have a high level circular narrative in this profession. **** from
