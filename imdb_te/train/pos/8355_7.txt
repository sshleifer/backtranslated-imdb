The film has a distinct (brutal and tough) humanity for its boundary eccentricity - the zippy / lyrical score represents their unfortunate comic part, and when they are in their most dirty (fearing a woman on the train), a partial pitfalls will always hide away (like a baby Sucks on his chest). Blair cuts off from the scene where DePardy is raising the Devere, so it is not clear how to read the manifest homocractic factor of their relationship - however, that event is the beginning of their respective humanity (so the film can be read as Pro-Gay, though it is readable as you want). The film has a lot of objectionable scenes and sex politics, and it takes the best cartoon on the laugh of the two sexes, which can spur the whole concept of sensitivity and honesty, and many evidence will be possible if some of you shoot down enough shots, some of them are hit.
