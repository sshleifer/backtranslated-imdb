My wife and I took a 13-year-old son to watch this film and enjoyed the movie's best fun. It has extra appeal to boys and men recalling their childhood, but women also get the image and especially the likeness of Haley Kate Eisenberg, "Boys are very strange." It is refreshing to watch a movie that shows unapologetically that the boy and girls are different in their emotional and social makeup. Boys really do these kinds of strange things and usually tell the story and survive to frighten their moms crazy! We are very happy with my son and an 11-year-old friend, me and my daughters 23-year-old boyfriend went to see the film today. We've been a second time and have come to all about it. It was a clean and enjoyable performance by the pre-televised cast of TV classic "Freaks and Geeks". Unlike "Flex & Geeks", it did not survive in its first season, but we believe it would be a sleeper hit rather than selling its DVD release. Especially if you're with the boys, it promotes conversation about entertainment and security! Girls love it because they love it, "boys are so weird!" Do not miss it ...
