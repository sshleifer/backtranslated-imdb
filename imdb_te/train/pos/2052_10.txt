My essence is not much for me, the film is with the best gun ever, one of the most humorous movies ever made. <br /> <br /> In the case of Michael Ironside, he said, "I refused, Pulp Fiction brought him to sleep and asleep. Some great films, but did not try to make serious films.The whole recall, top gun, the film is the best of the budget, the scenes and the actors and the explosions are very clear. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for information on McCain (and I suspect that it's too much), it's a hilarious movie if it's read Smile on your face!
