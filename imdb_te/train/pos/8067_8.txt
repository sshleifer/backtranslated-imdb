If anyone mentioned Viktor McLoglin, the response is mostly "who?" Or perhaps "why?" Not well, or not, Victor McLaughlin won the Academy Award for Best Actor in the film, which is ready to sell his best friend for "Carferre" to the United States about a poor and desperate man. It's a very interesting picture that shows very well how Shnooks just goes for a few bucks. The film takes place in British-dominated Ireland and all other characters are directly or indirectly struggling for Ireland's political independence, Mr. McLaglenen's role is to make money and drink alcohol. It is surprising that political activists suffer from all the problems, as the activist struggles to make a point, while most others do not care, they do not even know about the fuss. The film's courage is: Look for a friend, he can sell you for Doom.
