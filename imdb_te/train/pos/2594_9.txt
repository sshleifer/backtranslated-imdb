The film took the super-human power of Jerry Springer's approach. "Wilder Napalm" is the theme-based movie I love, and the idea that immigrants in America are defined by their gifts or attempts to hide them. At the same time, the picture pointed out that every prodigy was only human, and no longer feared or worshiped than any other man. This is a great comedy, fun and human short satirical edge.
