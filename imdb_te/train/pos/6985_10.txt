I say, I'm not sure I think of this program as a BSG fan. I saw Ariellight Film Tonight (as part of the Palle Center shows) on the big screen and the cast and filmmakers talked about wards later. <br /> <br /> Ron Moore wanted them to take a break from the Battlestar, and to do something else, and yes they would lose some fans, but they were hopeful that they would like to receive the others. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do with this. I want to see it a real science fiction (or 'syphy <br /> <br /> It's a strong and great story and I've kept my interest. <br /> <br /> It's a small "bun "The actor who has played a glimpse into his serious beliefs, the actress playing" Joe " But if she had hoped that if this was a new bomber / heelper / park, they might want to rethink it and captured the attention of the audience <br /> <br /> Eric Stolts plays Daniel Graystone, his family tragedy Nato him being carried away, grief and do not let it. He and his daughter, the young man is a web cocks, her execution, her dismissal, release, especially computers and people's inner world, his character's intelligence shows that in the chilling and exciting job. <br /> <br /> As never before, Paula Malkamon is his wife Amanda Graystone. She is well-written and well-written and beautifully portrayed as Smoltz's character, and I rarely imagine that they are a couple, and a pair of forever and a strong relationship. I look forward to seeing what has happened to this family, and I hope to give her a lot more like Roslyn in BSG- she is strong and intelligent and when she is on her edge at her boy, I'm scared, it's great. She did not tell her eyes that had magical powers, how severe it was. <br /> <br /> She's taken on a government agent - a very small scene but beautifully played - really gives a thought to his power. <br /> <br /> For me 100% Issa Morales and his Mafia family line. He did a good job overall, but I did not trust in this group, and their threats were not threatened. I found myself wishing to be a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out this whole story line; The way it presented is almost a tribute to the godfather, they kind of hit you on a bit head. But given the time, I see how it looks like an interesting 'upstairs / stellar' kind of thing, with the great minorities (Morales et al), the great folk that govern the planet (Stolz et al). To be honest, he enjoyed talking about his name with his son - it's a well-played scene. <br /> <br /> For BSG fans, 'Willie Adama' really does not look like Olmos, but he is a child. Who knows whether he is in this film or not? I can not say for sure. <br /> <br /> Polly walker plays the role of 'sister Claris', and she is cool and odd in every scene. I'm not sure where to go with her or who she ends up with, but I'm impressed with her performance. In the film she was side by side, but was later set up to play in a very important part. <br /> <br /> She has nothing to do with her role in "Rome", and I am always impressed by the actors. <br /> <br /> A good surprise - even if the music is the same thing, it's better than BSG and less obvious. , Bear McCreary. This is a horrific and unusual way of surprise to me, and if I have a chance I will buy this score. <br /> <br /> After the show 'panel discussion', Seth Green. Ron Moore is very clever and inspiring, as David Eck crashed into his video diary, Esa Morals told how long he was about the cast and Eric Stolts was a lot of fun and really did not answer the questions (but I always had one thing). Paula Malcolmson was strict (she took Seth Green for misinterpreting her '24'), and two darling girls playing Zoe and Lacy. Grace Park and Tricia Helper were also there, who asked the scenes they worked with at BSG. <br /> <br /> "I've just seen this second time and really hope they'll explore what's really prepared for the hobbled reality. It attracts me a lot.
