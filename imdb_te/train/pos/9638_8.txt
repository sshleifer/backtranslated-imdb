The film is a homosexual and has a large part of how to deal with each other. His mother was discouraged, and his younger sister was a pain and his older sister. The relationship is nice with her boyfriend / exhooker and he left his family to try life with this first person. Unfortunately, the new person rolls around him and it does not really mean anything. Our young gay men goes to the bonkers and ends up on the Looney bin and eventually dumping and starting his new lover. We're not happy with it. So maybe things will go good for him in the future. The ending is a downer but the whole picture is totally realistic and I'll let you know this true ending slip by a higher rating.
