I chose this as unexpected from the library and was very surprised. Stiff, expressive camera work, an equally tight script, and two amazing actors all meld together to make a good picture piece together. Not a replicant multiplex is a true fan of the cinema, not the brain. If Hollywood always gets giant hands on it, I'm sure it will destroy it. The choice is treated around all the way. Other posters here have sung their appreciation, so I do not want to duplicate their prayers; Take their advice, and mine, and do not miss this gem. Call what you like; I spent two hours doing well. Read my lips: do not miss.
