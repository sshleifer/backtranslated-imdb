"Batman: The Mystery of the Bat Woman" is like entertaining in animated Batman movies. <br /> <br /> The concept of comic books is still true but animated series. Bruce Wayne appears to be in front of him, but now he seems somewhat less serious. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy, as always, prompted Batman's voice more than most live actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa has done a much better voice-acting job than I expected. <br /> <br /> As in Live Action Batman films, the film will live or die for the quality of the villains. My time favorite, penguin, is here. His design is much better than it was before, with the attention of Damon DeVito's role to the 60th film's Burgess Meredith rather than the "Batman Returns". David Ogden Stairs is the right choice for the penguin's voice. Penguins are finally a comic innovative, as he usually appears in comics. Hector creates Elizondo's Voice Bane, much more memorable than the unforgettable version of Batman & Robin. In the end, Batman has a descent secret to fix "detective" in the "detective comics" ("DC"), which means "retrieve" the "detective".) The revolution to mystery is a delightful false twist. <br /> The score for the mysterious atmosphere of this score is to score from "Poirot" and score from "Mission: Impossible" Overall, it's more fun than your average cartoon.
