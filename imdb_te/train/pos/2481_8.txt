I've seen only about Shakespeare's three plays (Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth, & Course Hamlet) about me, I found someone else (Macbeth), and Hamlet I found a masterpiece. I'm happy to say that this adaptation is every bit as good as a serious and dramatic play. Their infamous lines tell me directly from the script that the character is strong enough (how can you lose Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams, and Billy Crystal?) And change from time to time (somewhere between 17 and 1800) and from any fan of Shakespeare's play. If you're in this popular play I'm asking you to see this powerful 1996 adaptation from Shakespeare's fan Kenneth Branagh.
