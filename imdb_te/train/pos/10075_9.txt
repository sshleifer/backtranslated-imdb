"Masks" is a moving picture that works in many stages. Its simpler, this is a haunting story of a street artist who has a bond when trying to travel to the next generation with a young boy, his creative art (masks). However, sometimes this story makes the old man a job, which is well-formed (writing, acting, directing, and excellent production values), easily crossing his plight. And, if you hang it with it, the film is ultimately too sweet and uplifting. All around the glory. This is a wonderful picture for kids and adults. How the trick is to get Americans who do not want to see foreign language movies!
