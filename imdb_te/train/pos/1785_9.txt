If you can not enjoy a chick flick, stop now. However, if you enjoy the characters that describe the complex characters and enjoy the unusual acting movies, read on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Her two daughters are at her bed. Even if the daughters do not know, she begins to talk about people in the past, and begins to question whether these lost acquaintances are genuine or predictable. <br /> <br /> In reality, between 1953 and 2000, the story changes with a few moments in Anne's life of that year. It met On the Life of Love in 1953 and experienced the greatest tragedies of her life. <br /> <br /> Ans from college and leila are married to two best friends. Ann's other good friend is brother of Lila, Buddy. Leila and Buddy are children of the great Newport family, while An Ann Cabaret singer lives in Greenwich Village, who wants to have a sense of freedom but is still committed to many of the 1950's conventions. <br /> <br /> Lee arrives as a maid of honor at the wedding of Lila, who meets a man who plays a key role in three lives - Harris. He grew up with Leila and Buddy and a former son of a family member who went to become a doctor in a small New England town. On Harris attracts Harris immediately, which adds a problem to the fact that Leila has always been in love with Harris and continues. Buddy is also in love with Harris, but in 1953 he diverted homosexuality to Harris that his good friend Yan did not agree that he had sexual desire for another person. <br /> <br /> A budding, clever-cracked evil boy of Buddy's family exhibits his outrageous disappointment - most of his most appropriate and superior parental anger. <br /> Now, the daughters of N are distanced from their mother and are experiencing their own life experiences and doubts. Constance strives to emotionally wound up trying to keep her roll a perfect mother and wife. <br /> <br /> All of these activities are good, but there are exceptional performances and sequences - with two distinct family relationships - <br /> <br /> Claire Danes plays the role of Anne's 1950s, and what she's doing in her style is what she wants to do Contrary to what is controversial is the controversial woman. Her performance is not easy to forget. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays all of the dying, now from the mind to past, past, up to Fantasy's fleet, and redgrave sterling style. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - Redgrave's real daughter - plays the daughter of Constance in the film. <br /> <br /> In this real life mom and daughter are a wise way to see scenes between fictional mom and daughter. <br /> <br /> Tony Colete plays Nina's other daughter Nina. Nina decides to forgive her when she closes a good man who loves her mother and sister. Colette was perfect for a piece like this, but I did not ever see that she did not act as bad or reliable as part of her role. <br /> <br /> Mamie Gummer played the role of the 1950s Leila, her best friend, her role in life rather than an un. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Zimmer's Mother - plays Leila the current day. <br /> <br /> What about Melle Streep saying that director Lazos Coltai is in DVDs? He wanted Glenn Kloss to play a small part of Lila's mother, who felt he was the only actress to play a scene in the film. He is absolutely right, and the scene's performance in one scene puts it in your mind. <br /> <br /> There are three other scenes in the film, including the one with the above-mentioned closure, the overall picture is worth watching. On Leila's wedding day, Ann goes into her room and makes her sleep with her friend, she is not clear about Laila's misunderstanding about her upcoming marriage. The scene repeats fifty years later, when she comes to Leila and crawls on her dead friend, Anto's bed, to talk about the dead life. In this second scene, both Streep and Redgrave are the longest. <br /> <br /> Other memorable scenes - at least me - when Buddy announces his love for Ann. Hugh Dansi as Budgi moves the heart of a young man who is crushed by our controversial sexual feelings. <br /> <br /> Chick film? Yes. A very special film with reliable acting, directing and scene? Sure. I can not recommend it very evening.
