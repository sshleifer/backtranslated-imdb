I saw Starrreck every episode at least twice, and I do not think I was a trekker or trek. People and concerts in their parents' dungeon attend the attire of worn clothes with rubber earrings. I have given seven actors to the film by removing the historical flaws of fiction. Acting is better than average, but this plot is no surprise. They tried hard to reverse engineer technology, but still the only special effects are just a great temptation. Now for historical faults, if you're calling, the first up captain's captain pilot commander is April, then Captain Pick, Jim Kirk, etc. According to a statement by Ricker and Kirk, we were educated and educated by Klingons and gave them the technology (the reason for the main viewer), but this is no reason to defile these best sequences. I hope the plot gets deeper, and then the special effects are back.
