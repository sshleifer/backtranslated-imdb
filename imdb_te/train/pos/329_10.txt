In all versions of the Odyssey (or Greek mythology of the subject), in my opinion, it is the best of all. The truth is almost true of the original story - some minor variations and errors, e.g. The absence of Scylla & Charibidis and the fact that Eminas Swainhead is a real Hollywood knife and Sandal B-Flick is not really a remake of his disguise realistic performance and authentic scenery and costumes in Odysseus. If the dialogue and subtitles are fully Italian, if you know a storyline, what he still says about heads and tails and actors (you have the Odyssey's good hanging text hand). At least I did, and it inspired me to study the Italian language to understand the film more intelligently.
