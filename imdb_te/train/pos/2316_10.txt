I watched this movie very quickly, and I was interested in the trailer on TV. I like when I find movies like this, a little bit about the general public, tender stories. Although the ending is tragic, "The Man in the Moon" has some funny moments, particularly in Dani's first role, with her innocent and pure love affair with the Court. It's really a beautiful, moving love story with 3 high points: Reese Witherspoon's performance, her promises in the world, beautiful cinematography by "Old Lion" Freddy Francis and James Newton Howard's fantastic score is really cinematic spirit. His themes (which do not qualify for the Oscar nomination) are the closest and the song appears to have changed the screenplay in music.
