I voted for the film 8 because of the small children's shortcomings. Besides, this film is my favorite one! It is fun to say the least. Shooting scenes are ridiculous, and I'm gut very small for his "Matrix Siege". Their enemies seem to be standing ... waiting to be shot. However, this film is touching and it always makes me cry. It has a lot of great humor, so it makes me laugh. Gate is a wonderful actor I should say .. she shows a lot of emotion. This is Hyde's first acting and he's okay. The character fits him. Wang Lee Ho is absolutely cool. The whole cast I have said perfectly to this movie. Do not miss! You turn it on!
