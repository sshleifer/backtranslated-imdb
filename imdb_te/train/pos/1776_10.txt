I hate the first episode of this show ('Protesting Hippies') in 1999, and I disregard the rest. However, when I came across 'The Paramount Comedy Channel', I saw it totally and it was absolutely delightful to my surprise (MOTTO: Never Suggested a Comedy Series in the First Week)! <br /> <br /> 'Huppes' Stars' Simon Pegg' Ray Perbubs', 1969 'Oz' is the editor of the 'Underground' magazine. His friends were Jill, the back-back Alex and half-wit Hugo. At the end of the 60s, young people were able to enjoy amazing optimism, they could not change the world by printing magazines, no one could read it. Apart from the "simplicity" of hippies, love for 'hippes' Sutras of Arthur Matthews are the names of the ages - 'Hair', 'Woodstock', 'The Graduate', and even in the early '70s, even the infamous' Oz' pornography. Excellent performances from cast; Julian Rhind-That's 'Alex' is reminiscent of Richard Oswallan's 'Man About the House'. I was never ashamed because I never had the second rank. If you missed 'hippies', try it out. After you've had a terrible opener, you're up for a treat!
