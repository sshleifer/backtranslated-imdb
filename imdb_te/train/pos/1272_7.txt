Even though it is an enjoyable film, I think it's even better if it's more deep. This film is half the film through which Ellie can understand why such a nun. Then, when we finally returned to her childhood, she was not yet detailed. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a good movie that I see again. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br />
