I liked this movie. When I was 20 (I was only four years ago) I first saw it and I enjoyed it, and I brought my own copy the following day. The comedy is well played through good participation. I want to rewind the scenes that Mr. Sanders describes as to why I found the water 6 feet and 227 feet per area. See for Jason Robards dad who also stars Mr. Retch. Talent ran in the family.
