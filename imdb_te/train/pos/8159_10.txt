Okay. This movie is Pure joy. There is a violent horror from time to time with a little so-suspense and black comedy lads. Dentist Really starts to lose his Mind and is happy to see him. This movie is a few people, though. But you absolutely love it or you absolutely hate it. Rent a good movie and watch when you can not do anything else. Also recommended: Psycho III
