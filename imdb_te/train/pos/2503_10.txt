I'm very picky about the movies I see. I heard about the full moon about the moon child. <br /> <br /> Recently I've been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for a while and recently as a Gackt and Mizer fan. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the film was re-released and the second thought. <br /> <br /> I am a critic for films, I agree, action scenes may be some hockey at times ... but they are just as another user suggested that Gary's older man from Leon was quoting from Lyon ... before the storm philosopher calm This film was very difficult for me to go into spoilers because the boundaries of friendship were limo Tles and they often mentioned, loyalty and true friendship /> <br /> Hyde and gyakt their songs and literature <br such as the depth of the display to show why nimparo, their passion for music and the process takes place on the big screen. <br /> It reaches a person's soul and creates elaborate images that can motivate emotional response. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I realized that until my collection goes, it will be in a huge spate. I would like to encourage anyone to read this movie for reading this film and wanting to stay away from the current Hollywood trend in this film ... It takes a completely new direction using Classic Yakuza Film Elements and how I can not say enough about this film But here I will stop. <Br>. /> 10/10
