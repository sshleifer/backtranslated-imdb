I saw this movie again at the College Film Festival in the 70s - I watched the movie in the video (which ended in the end) when I was waiting forever. It was made in Brazil, so I thought it was not for video yet. For the best film I've been checking video stores for the last 15 years! <br /> <br /> This is my first time in the film. But as Werner Herzog is weird, its inequality comes from its super reality. Centuries ago, during colonial times, Europeans first encountered tribes in the Amazon. Cannibalists were mistaken for a white cross as a white foe, so they intended to kill him. Before they send him, however, they will be part of his tribe (their custom). The whole race is to see his national geographic documentary, he is a member of his tribe. That's it. Cosmic platinum? What is the different insight of human life? <br /> Oh yes ... alert ... This film has a definite nudity - it's not a few hollywood songs about good cruelty ... as it reads on the top: National Geographic, Super Realism) <br /> <br />
