The film that was originally seen does not seem to be a special one. Betty Davies in the IMDb 166 votes, and ratings of 6.5 ratings should be a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The film is a normal average 30th film, which began with a formal love story, but the film is surprisingly well-built and has an unusual and original story, which also helps to see the film more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The story is played by two main characters played alongside Bette Davis and George Brent. Most of them have played entertaining roles, but the film is primarily two of them. Their role is part of a humorous and brilliant written story. <br /> <br /> This film is very small (just over an hour), which means that the plot is not wasted at any time. It also makes the film even faster speeds, this film also helps to make an absolutely watchable one by today's standards. This will probably make it simpler at times, but it will never go with the cost of entertainment or entertainment. <br /> You can see more pleasant romantic comedy! <br /> 8/10
