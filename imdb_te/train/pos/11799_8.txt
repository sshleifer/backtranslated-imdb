Well-cast summary of the real event! Well, actually, I'm not there, but I think how it looks. There are usually two American Stamp Points in the film: 'Communistphobia' and Adolf Hitler parallel. These very independent observers must be clear. Anyway, Boothe makes a great presentation, and a lot of other well-known actors do. The film is unbearable for the last twenty minutes - and I mean! Anyone who sleeps after them is unusual. (Why it was so terrible - it all happened, and it probably looked like that). But, in fact, the last scenario in the air station really takes place?
