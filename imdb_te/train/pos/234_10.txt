I have always been Anne Desalowo a great actor, and now I know her great writer / director. I first saw "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Star Dust Memories". <br /> Lee Grant anything these days. She has been missing from the screen for a long time. It's also amazing to see Cloris Lechmann's other than sit-com. This is her best work from "The Last Picture Show". If you grew up in an Italian-American family you will love this film. When I start watching this film, I do not expect much, I'm surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you get a chance, look at it.
