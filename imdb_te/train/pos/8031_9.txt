This is a military drama I like the most! Tom Berenger played the role of military murderer Thomas Beckett. This Marine asked your face, no nonsense, and the kind of person who worked with any questions. Richard Miller, former SWAT Form D.C., starring Billy Jen ("The Phantom" and others) will serve you to the government and take orders only from them. Who needs the officers? I will not! When these two are in pairs, sparks must be flying. How is it? However, Becket teaches a young man about how it works. When the other sniper is hit, it's humor vs. Wits, Cat vs Mouse, Gunman vs Gunman. And when a seasoned sniper is found, it is up to miller to keep politics and save him. You do not have to be politicized when you want to encourage Becket, but no one has taken him out of command, but that does not play through the rules, and the politics of mutual respect remain. This film is a direct hit. Look. Rating 5 out of 5 stars.
