You can choose Prince's acting talent, or parody in this movie. Do not talk about his musical talent then or now. He looks like a shadow twenty years later, but the music is relative and fantastic. <br /> <br /> When I live by the hype of this movie (graduated in high school), I tell you that there is nothing big at that time. When Tipper Gore (All-Wife), who is trying to appear as Prince every single "Air Band" by "Little Nikki" and PNRC (Parent's Music Resource Center), is the perfect hottest thing when dealing with Prince. For at least a few weeks, Prince is bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> We are waiting for all the movies and are very happy when it first shows. It is not disappointing. Everyone was caught. At that time I played an MTV Junkyya (when they really played music .... at all times) Prince played at least once or twice a hour. Punk / New Wave Style 'At that time, my favorite was Billy Idol, Ongo Boing, The Fixx, Segels of Floor and others' Prince of Music over all types and styles. It seems that some are so cheesy and now it seems to be misleading, which is then SOOOOOOOO big. All the things you remember for the 80s are iconic. It is mainstream and now looks like a cliche. It is very popular, it's ridiculous. It's like the Rippin 'Granny trade for Wendy's hamburgers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know what you want,
