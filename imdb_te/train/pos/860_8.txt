Auditor made a very interesting movie. With an explanation of almost the deaf young woman, its work begins as a secretary in the universe; She was neglected, frustrated, denied ... an internship as an assistant will find a way for her to find someone in her life: but the guy is just coming out of jail. By rejecting both of them by community, they are gradually returning. The characters' explanation, is deep, goes into detail ... the two start to help each other; She can read on her lips that she can be very useful to her ... She is progressively progressing more than she was first. <br /> It is pretty portrayed; Even though the film became Nair, the whole persuaded. The gesture is pretty noticeable in the filming of Achard. Emmanuel Devos should be nominated for Best Accession Caesar Awards for his magistrate game. At the end of the film, action will prevent a simple "Eduard de Moiers". It's actually surprisingly entertaining: 8/10.
