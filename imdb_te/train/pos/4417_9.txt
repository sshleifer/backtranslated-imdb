The film is a lyrical and romantic memoir by an eleven year old boy living in a rural Cuban town of Castro Revolution. This is real realistic labor for love. <br /> <br /> The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD have been attempted to be sold as just an action film. Julia's combination makes a greater sense. It is much more common with European cinemas than RAMBO, and the revolution is simply discomfort for people's daily lives and achievements. <br /> <br /> The overwhelming use of voice over commentator suppresses the story, but the film does not deserve it. <br /> <br /> The waxed mood of movies about cinemas is paradoxical and affordable, but the underlying pain of loss is a lifestyle that exceeds the lost love. <br /> <br /> The Revolution, the film is like Julie, seems to have seemed to be so long.
