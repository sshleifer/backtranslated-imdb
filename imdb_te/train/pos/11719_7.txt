Elvira, The Dark Mistress, a fun, camp horror comedy, in which the fourth wall breaks twice, jokes are often under the knife. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) stacked the horror show hostess, and she was reported to have inherited her aunt Morgan. So she goes to a small town in Palwell, which is ruled by the most horrifying monster to embrace the earth: morality fiction. The Elviras horror show is, of course, a lot for Prunes, but the town's kids get a kick from her different kind of life in life. Furthermore, Elvis's mother's book is her enmity Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), an even more nasty evil. Look, Elvira is actually a real witch, she just does not know it. <br /> <br /> This is because Elvara is a lot of fun, though the script leaves a lot of room for development. Very laughing came from the difference between Elvira and good people, but there are some visual scraps too. It's okay in all directions, but it never seems to be more than ever. In all, a good, intentional campy, comedy. If you like this kind of thing, that's it.
