Once a time, there are different types of movies. <br /> This is clearly visible, but in this review I suggested it because some people forgot. It's a pleasant movie for Pavarotti fans. That's it. It does not say anything or anything great. People who make fun of it as low as the promise dropped will not see the whole picture - literally. After all, people are shameless vehicles for Hollywood movies (Bodyguard or The Precher's wife w / Whitney Houston 2 will be remembered). <br /> <br /> I first portrayed as a vehicle for pavaratti. The worst things in this world are - and the worst films. The singing is amazing and the Arias choice is fun. The film starts with Schubert's Ave Maria and later in Madonatta of Leovacu. "I left my heart in San Francisco" and music by John John Williams & lyrics by Oscar & Golden Globe "I Wish In Love" w / Alan & Merlin Bergman - all 3 previous Oscar winners. <br /> The story is not bad. It was built for Pavarotti, so it would not be as deep or universal as the average movie viewer. This is the story of the famous opera singer who wounded a bad night of opera years ago. When asked to sing again in the same place, "MET" in NYC, he loses his voice from fear. Dr. Pamela (or Italian :) Pah-May-La), played by Catherine Harold, gives her a shot to heal his mental reaction. <br /> They promise to marry him, not to fall in love with him, that he has love and another woman. For all, they fell in love (i.e., "I'm in love") and with her help he overcame her fear and he will go back to MET to achieve success. I can not tell you how it ends, but this is very predictable. This is not always a bad thing. <br /> These performances are not that bad. Pavarotti (Giorgio Finini plays) is not an actor, so if you look forward to the Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks performance, you will not cheat or cheat. He knows he's not a tribe. He is beautiful, lovely & attractive. He's fun, and even if you're enjoying it, it's not too bad. There is a funny way when he tells you that Finni will give you water for Pamela (Haroldd) "a thirsty plant". And of course, she said, "I do not want to be watered by Fini!" Catherine Harold is very sweet and she does a good job as a semi-upright tied girl who has learned to live a little bit from this eccentric man. One of my favorite lines in the film is: "Life should always be life-sized." And Eddie Albert makes his usual good job as a fanny manager. Real conductors, singers, etc. There are many "themselves" comos and it is filmed in the city at the Metropolitan Opera in the Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like the opera, if you like to watch, or if you can make a "little quick" go as you propose in the movie. I know- every time. <br /> <br />
