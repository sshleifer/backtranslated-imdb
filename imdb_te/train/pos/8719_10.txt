I was surprised at the improved improvements in the animated film. If you are sitting close to the screen, you will see details on grass and surface structures. Details, colors, and shading are better than the Toy Story. How could they pull off shading, I will never. I hope the picture will provide the documentary about how this image has been built, so I'll learn how it has been achieved. I think the future animated films will be taken based on this movie.
