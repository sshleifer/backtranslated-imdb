I've always enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's versions of Shakespeare classics, who always did a very good job, but in the film, he was the one who made the whole movie, "The Elle-great-actor" Lawrence Fishburn. Although he was an outstanding actor, he made some poor choices in the movies, but as we gave it in true othello, we really gave a real Othello: love, fishburn, with strong feelings, and more . <br /> <br /> I do not think they chose the good Othello. If sympathy / hatred, love / hatred to others, do not forget the fiery eyes ... Brahegg is always good, but at his peak, Iren Jacob's Desdemona is great but a bit dark, Lawrence Fishburn really removes it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. See this.
