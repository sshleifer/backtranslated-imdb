Brutal and emotionless Michael Myers killed his sister in 1963 at the age of six on Halloween night; On October 30, 1978, he flew from a mental institution and established a new terrorist organization in his birthplace, Headfield, Illinois. <br /> It opens with a bang, which actually creates a genuine zeal and atmospheric cooling that feels original. This helped to stimulate many slazer films. Many of the subsequent films were subtle compared to the evil blood group; Sensitive, and scary. It also has the ability to jump me after recurring views. How many really movies are there, how can those who have seen it continue to be scary? Not much. <br /> <br /> Jamie Lee Curtis, in her motion picture, starred in "Halloween", and after starring in some of the next slazer films, was a valuable victim of her career . -Writer / director John Carpenter works in the film, making amazing use of shadows and dark skies; Note how much of the film is taking place overnight. In the film, he and his former collaborator Debra Hill created seven sequels, a number of simulators, and a franchise called "re-imaginable". <br /> <br /> It is very fun - Lewis' (Plainsense) speech mentions Michael Myers to Sheriff (Charles Cybers, a reliable reporter of the previous works of Carpenter). <br /> <br /> It's wonderful, and valuable. <br /> It's my favorite John Carpenter movie. <br /> This is not entirely irrelevant - there are script holes, but overall it has a solid effect. <br /> <br /> 9/10
