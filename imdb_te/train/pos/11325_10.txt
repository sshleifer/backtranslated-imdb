When I initially heard about the series Worm TV, I told you all about the events I had seen. I had to watch this show and I did what I really did. This is the best when I get the first volume of this show. I really liked the animation, and all the fighting scenes were amazing. I have to say that my favorite characters in the show saber, and the archer and of course I also like Illya. And in fact, all the episodes of the volume are interesting and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnie (known for Transformers, and others) to play Berkster's voice. He had a cool role. Before seeing the final volume, I saw the whole series again. If you look for something good, then look at this show, it is best.
