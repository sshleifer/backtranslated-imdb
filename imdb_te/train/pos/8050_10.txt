This is again the most active fat man in martial arts. The hero of his character, an opening sammo movie that simulates Bruce Lee, is Sammy's magical Lee, his actions and fighting. He can come to the style of Bruce and see how his own and well-known Kung Fu can be accomplished and worthy in his art. This kind of movie of the movie will throw in a bit of humorous humor in the film and it all - comedy (like a fake black guy, some unexpected), action and some fantastic action sequences. An hour and a half worth someone's time is a great beer and buddy image.
