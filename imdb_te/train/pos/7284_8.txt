When I was young, I saw very few films. My parents rent this in their knowledge. I was very careful about the film, and actually did not even allow me to see. My brother and sister came of course and this made me very angry. What am I doing? At night I have trashed the VCR! The TV's screen kicked and the police were called and Vandals reported. I was arrested by the police and the police could not get my foot from the TV set before coming. I only speak a tough and sent home. My parents stared at me and worked for me to pay a loan for TV and VCR. It kills me differently, the slave workers really believe me, but I have to do it. All home bandages. What happened in the end? My work came with big screen TV, dvd player and surround sound system. How did you get money Easy I made my own movies and sold them on Disney! Remember to find out? Well I wrote that movie and my goldfish were filmed in their fishing tanks! They rewrote the course of course and did it in CGI because it did not make real life action as I did! In the end I never saw The Head of the Dead film, and the rating I gave was my life rating! It's great!
