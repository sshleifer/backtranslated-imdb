Our modern day is a normal 90 comedy, situational comedy similar to "My Family". Thatcher accuses Thatcher of being too much political jokes, as Bill is the height of the Bill (Belinda Lang). "Bloody Thatcher" can share with most of us. David is an ordinary young man, bread knives, jenny, moody creeping brains with old teens child, only boys and boys. Bill and Ben work as much as possible to keep their family back in struggling in the economic environment of the early 90's. But since the first two series are not successful, after the series 3 I will smile more and I want to calculate it. Overall this performance did not get the best viewing times and they should have a bit longer. Apparently they could not continue after Gary Olsen's death but I think they get rid of "small Britain" and "back to the" office "Catherine Tate" and bring back the classic!
