I reviewed some old VHS tapes and came across TV Show John Denver & The Muppets a Christmas Together. This is the way I went to my computer to see if I could buy a DVD version of this presentation. I can not find it on DVD yet. The show was aired and released in 1979. I have a record and a CD but I love to buy the DVD version of this presentation. The old and tape quality of the tape is pretty good but fading, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are a few more songs on the CD. Like a fan of John Denver and Muppets, the show's DVD is really a good seller. If you do not have a CD, it's a collection of amazing songs from that show. If you can find it, the album is good if there is a record player to play.
