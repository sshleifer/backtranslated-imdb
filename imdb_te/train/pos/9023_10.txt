Nobody in America has ever thought of a very sunny, fuzzy character that is part of World War 2 history. I like it in the video. It's just t.v. Once I know, I'm in 89th cms once. I came around for this movie, and most video stores do not even know about it. Wonderful actresses all around, Wish that I can see again. Top Top Stripe Series.
