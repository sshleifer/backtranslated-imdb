It was premiered at our theater in Amsterdam and the film we wanted to be sold, so this was no other than a documentary about the planet. We are very happy with our misfortune because we have a very strong picture about this life and a smoother balance with all the inhabitants of the earth. The film features the most breathtaking photography I have ever seen in a movie and has shown me the rain forests from the desert to the rainforest and the things I have never seen in a movie, TV or book! "Earth" is the image that every student sees before they escape. I encourage my niece to see this film because I will take over the planet I left behind. It is also a film to watch on a theater screen or on a very large television, as photography is very powerful and exotic.
