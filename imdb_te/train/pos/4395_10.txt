One of my favorite movies was that many directors ignored my opinion. Besides the acclaimed Ang Lee, many young actors became mainstream stars, eg: Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rice Meyers (before Tudors), James Cavizel, Simon Baker, Marc Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright , Tom Wilkinson, and Jewel. All of the acting performances of each of the spectacular and well-known actors gave each memorable performance, particularly the role of a nasty villain who killed killing the mayors. <br /> <br /> The director's biographies and accomplishments have been awarded an Academy Award) and actors are listed, the film is usually removed from their past performances. I found the film accidentally on DVD and it became one of my most frequent movies. However, this is rarely seen in the cab. The reasons why this film is not well known is what I look forward to reading about others.
