Oscar lost Oscar as Best Supporting Actor for his role in Robert Stoke "Can On the Wind", in Antoine Quinn's 12-minute performance "LIFE for Life." The stock is a deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil giant. He lived in the shadow of a friend who lived his life, and played Mitch, Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Maryle (Dorothy Malone), is a morality in love with Mitch. Douglas Circk's best direction, which is dominated by the play field with some striking images including "Life Imitation", "All That Heaven Alles," "Magnificent Obsession," and many others. /> <br /> What is wrong - this is a potboiler, And Stoke and Dorothy Malone make a lot of their roles, Malone has won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. There is a striking scene mentioned in other interpretations, where her father collapses and dancing with loud music while dying on the stairs. We believe that Marley is sleeping with everyone, including gas to gas, she fell in love with Mitch. Mitch should not do anything with her. He was in love with Lucy, from Kyle's loyalty, and he wanted to work in Iran to prevent trouble. <br /> <br /> Hudson and Bacall have less exciting characters here - a good guy who is Hudson's Mitch Kyle. His whole life was confused, and the wife of Baal Mitch, who was sleeping after a year after her husband was in a persecution while her husband was lying in a flask. <br /> <br /> In the hands of the circus, "On the Wind on the Wind" is an effective film, and the big scene in the building is particularly exciting. The director gave a gift to these films, and although he had many followers, he was not equal.
