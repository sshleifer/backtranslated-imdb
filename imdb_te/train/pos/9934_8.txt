"Domino" is widely condemned on this site for its insane style and "skiing" photography. It cites its surface and criticized the expansion of "style on substance", and I could not distinguish more. "Domino" refers to the absolute height of Tony Scott's motion picture production career. <br /> <br /> When Tony Scott created the dominant Hollywood action movie style of the eighties and early nineties, it became closer to a more subjective film. Initially, "Crimson Tide" Scott used his stylistic talent to describe the interior world of his characters - a nuclear submarine at the Claudrophia and Drama conflicts with a long lens combined with a delicate lens frame with a nuclear submarine. This is followed by "Enemy of the State" and "Spy Game", which represents the world of surveillance and espionage respectively. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is a serious exit, becoming more and more painstaking for the expressionist. Where Scott used an antique hand crank camera and flash frames to express the anger of the explosion of his character. <br /> <br /> In an FBI investigation, she provided the life of an innocent criminal who has linked the device connected to the "Domino" framework. Confused fragments of memory. She was caught up in her memoir while we were doing all - fragments, fleshes, and brief addresses. Domino Relays shows her storytelling as Scott Relays, which explains the notion of the events that she describes, but also the way they guide them. She has "traces of mascalin" in her system, but her personal vision is unusual - a woman who left luxury life for bounty hunting. <br /> <br /> Domino really begins to relate to the events that bring her into captivity. Cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson, Williams Scott, accompanied a post-modern modern canvas in contemporary America. Gradually we begin to spot that extraordinary even though she is more confused than the "90210" culture she declined with her Domino. As she filtered through this cultural melancholy Scott, her viewer was more aware of the innocence of the poor child that the protagonist had introduced. In the end, Scott described their salvation as the only defense to escape from this surreal trip. <br /> <br /> It is like being too overly stylized to criticize the film, criticizing Picasso or a Pollock. There is everything on the surface and the surface that means "domino" as any great painting. <br /> <br /> I have not had anything to do with Scott Free, but I've always been and is a great fan of Tony Scott's work
