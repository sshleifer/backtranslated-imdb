I've seen so many TV movies in my time as a student, the majority of the usual throws in the US television is waste of time. However, it is a good form and has a very good twist in plot and at the end. When Richard Dean Anderson saw only MacGyver and Stargate I, he was surprised by his magnificent performance, rather than the ordinary expressions of A-B. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne juni after a long time of Fly II. Once again, Robert Gaimmum is again seen in a prominent role. I can not tell Jen Leaves seriously after Benny Hill days but she was able to withstand her role. All in all highly recommended image.
