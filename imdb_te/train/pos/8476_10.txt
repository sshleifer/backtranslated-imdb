<br /> <br /> When my father was 3, he recorded this movie for me. At age 5 I saw 400 times. I have seen and viewed it. I will still work today! It is a terrible storyline, a sheep mother is killed by a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to be a wolf like him. After years of training, the lamb was really made into really bad looking stuff. He and the wolf travel to his old cattle, but he can not kill the sheep, how much he likes. He kills wolves, but does not see his former friends lamb and can not return to his previous life. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful artwork. <br /> <br /> This is a very difficult day. <br /> <br />
