In the past, I wrote that I love the "Titanic", at the end of it (several times), and I'm at the age of 60. <br /> <br /> I've wondered how many awards have been won and this great movie that has been appreciated by many critics is why a 7.0 rating was made by imdb.com users. <br /> Well, user ratings. 29.0% of all votes gave it a rating of 10.7%, which gave it a rating. As a result, 10.7% of these irrational IMDb consumers reduced the overall rating to 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I blamed this unusual voting system (hate rating for 1 rating, gradual falling and suddenly reverse course and 1 rating level) for Leonardo DiCaprio. I believe, I have tuned into chat rooms forbidding young people (mostly young people), and blamed him to the left and right. They absolutely hate the man, and they have no share of giving him any credit in "Titanic". (I answer another user: I really do not like that image and it is everyone who does not speak about someone who has given a 5 or a 6, etc, and is his / her own taste, but none of the only 7.0's for "Titanic" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />> Let's display my point by comparing the IMDB user's voting model of "Titanic" to the box office and complicated "bombs" (which are quite a lot, but this 5 will prove my point). "Heaven's Get" (1980) very short after a box office performance Removed from theaters, and IMDB voters ratings: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (total rating "Big Top Pie-Whee" (1988) 4.3% Received 10 Ratings and 9.9% 1 Ratings (4.5 ratings) "Cat People" (1982) 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 Ratings (5.8 out of 5) ) "Blind Date" (1987) received 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (total rating 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) received 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (total rating 5.2). What do you say about all these films? Their 1 percent rate is low! "Titanic", and none of these stickers have always been chosen for the same award. Again, "Titanic" got 10.7% 1 ratings! <br /> <br /> Compare with the other 5 films I mentioned. <br /> <br /> Is there any explanation rather than the hatred of Leo Factor?
