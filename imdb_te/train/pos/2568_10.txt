The 1989 action-comedy classic K-9, Detective Dooley [James Balloons] and his dog returned to fight crime against Jerry Lee, during which time they were named Jus, another detective [Christine Tookie] and her partner, Derburn Jerry Lee. Dooley is not very much with his new partner. The picture goes along with all the changes. The film is serious for both of them, who wanted to kill Dully in the past for his treatment. Some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Doolie's wife do not appear to be in the tone of the film because the rest of the movie is a certain area when action games are on the action scenes, dog pope jokes, fart jokes and jokes about dogs. I know there is very little humor, but some are actually very funny. I did not see this movie for humor, I saw for two reasons. For the first time I'm a big James balloon fan and the second is action scenes. James Belushi is more ridiculous than he is in K-9 and has well done action sequences at. It's nice to see more characters from K-9, but this is still a fun movie. If you're a fan of James Balloons, you'll love this movie.
