Children's Picture: You should be thinking about the genre to rate this movie. There are more guides to make this movie more fun and enjoyable in the film (lacking some humor and language from the movie). Sequels usually make me nervous, but this is pretty much the same. I believe that Ferrar's star power is not like George, they have made capitals on humor and Shameman has done a great job. If you want to watch for a movie and hope for the Academy Award honors, but if you want to see a simple, fun, energy-filled movie, the plot is easy to follow and perhaps campy fits well for a young audience you make this a good choice.
