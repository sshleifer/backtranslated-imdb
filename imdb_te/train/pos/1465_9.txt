His selection of films, the basic 'passionate' of the product (commenting on him in sets or films) and his delivery is fantastic! But if you need a freud, know that you have received the Zizek version of Lacon, which should not be confused with Lacon. As always, Zizek offers complex ideas with pleasure and in a contractual manner. The rub he is also very mercurial and therefore may be more in his pleasure than the original content. Cinematic, it's a gem. Mentally, it is the same for people of all contracts (Freudian, Laconian and Jangians) scratching their heads but for popcorn. Zizek himself is a phenomenon and pop icon.
