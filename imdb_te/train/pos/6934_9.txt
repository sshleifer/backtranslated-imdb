Winchester '73 is a great story, and I like it. It's not your everyday Western - it uses a rifle that goes from different characters to the hands - a way to tell the story about these people. Rock Hudson plays the Indian chief role, while Jimmy Stewart is a great celebrity with the heart and power, while Shelley Winters plays a gas that has to cope with the facts of her husband and Wild West. Political politics need to be properly observed - they are killing many Indians in the film without repentance. According to today's standards, it is still very violent. But it's great story and worth watching. Have fun!
