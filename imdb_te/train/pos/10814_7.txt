We have a black president who has a reality in 2009 with the opposite, which has a very powerful historical significance. For entertainment value I must be both engaging and repugnant this film. I've been ruthlessly racist, but music and dance are wonderful. This is a good thing to watch Sami Davis Jr. as a very young child actor. He plays the role of Rufus Jones, who is a young boy who has comforted his mummy. He was told, 'Why can you be a president?' It was ridiculed in 1933, it was mocked and considered to be lovely and funny. Its huge fantasy sequence is that the government can be profitable if it is driven by blacks. <br /> <br /> One day in this film, I was attracted to myself. It's very well done and very fun. If we can see beyond racism, let's look at this film. In fact, it's not fraudulent to have a black president, but it's normal, making this movie more relevant. This represents some time for our collective consciousness.
