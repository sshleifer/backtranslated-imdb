This is what "increases Victor Vargas" is near the perfection of the movie. From a fledgling film or one of each lucky mixes (some of them), this small piece of town-life-first love is the first love you can read with its young characters such as depths of their mind. The film begins with a strong taste of the movie "Street" but the latino enters into the family affairs and then speaks volumes about the natural desire of young people's uncertainty and love. In my experience, never did so much (Tyros, novice director, etc.). Critically acclaimed but not for everyone, "raising Victor Vargas" is recommended for indie lovers and genuine stories of humanity for indie lovers and realities. (A)
