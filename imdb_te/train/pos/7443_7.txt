An old saying goes "If you think you have problems, visit the hospital." It has been updated in recent years, "If you want to have problems, watch a TV talk show ... especially Jerry Springer!" This image is very bad, it's fine! That is why I gave seven - that's right, but not great. Daily talk show "You will never come back for an hour in your life!" When promoting it, it's a great way to remove 95 minutes of waste. All obedient themes are here ... unbelieving husbands / boyfriends, a ruthless audience on television, and women who are joking with Jerry. Shakir is generally watching Molly Hogan playing sweet characters ("Seinfeld" and "Hermann's Head"), a trailer-trash mom and Jaime Presley ("My Name Is Earl"), who acted as the worst daughter in the sex scandal, Including the creator of the crew) presented as the lunkheads at the top of what they got. I do not like everything to spoil or disclose but the movie is like a daily presentation. Here in Phoenix, every morning is shown back two hours back and later, the rest will appear lighter. Again, I give this film seven ... It's nice but not great. Jerry Springer is best taken at an hourly dose.
