In fact ... the "video camera" effect, it's an effect, is good .. the film is actually shot as a beater. It's great fun to watch, make for TV, do not need to follow any rules. I look hard to see No 1 number because he was the first girl, how to murder her upset. And we've been diverted at all times to avoid Jade Nelson, and the audience is on his side. I'll see a 3 cabin by the lake one day but I doubt it. Watching this movie can mean how you make true movies because it's like a movie in the movie. Judd is one of the most terrible villains ever, and he is more realistic, and he does not chop the ax as illiterate as other horrific people.
