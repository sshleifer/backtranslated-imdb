"Le Locataire" ("The Tenant") is one of the most important horror films ever produced. Like a Trekolovski living in Poland, the stars of Poland, a vulnerable file clerk living in Paris, tried to commit suicide by leaping out of the apartment window of the previous renter. Trelkovsky forced her to visit the hospital and where he meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani) .Trelkovsky immediately dies the previous tenant and, at first, found a good apartment. His joy will soon replace the mysterious feelings of his nineties, causing his neighbors to be suspicious, and the previous tenant attempts to induce Trellowski to repeat suicide. This movie is great. A surrealist Trekovsky wall finds the plate of the previous tenant in the hole in the soles of Poland, or the fever he goes into the building, where the terrible and terrible atmosphere, such as the amazing movements. It has a bathroom to find walls covered with vocal idols. The photography made by Sven Nyikki is really beautiful. "The Tenant" is a neglected gem. This is hard to track, but it is more than worth the effort.
