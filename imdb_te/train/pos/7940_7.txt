The eye in Labyrinth is not your average Giovanni ... and to be honest, I'm not really sure that I really am a Gioy; But in Giovil or not, despite some problems, it's definitely a very interesting little picture. Most of the films they do not have any of these pictures is because I doubt it to call a guy; But most genres break up the mold and it looks like one of them. The film does not show the most brutal killings in jail, but it is made up of a surreal atmosphere and a plot that is confusing to be curious about the time frame. This plot was put to the attention of Julie's murder physician, and for some reason she was seen as her boyfriend and father and was walking on her. We are moving to a big house, many people live, but there are so many secrets surrounding various events that occur before the arrival of Julie. <br /> The mind is advertising something about how it looks like a labyrinth. This really comes off, and I enjoy sitting on the back and worrying about trying to make any point (if any) image. A few years ago, he directed The Eye of the Doom, directed by Mario Kano, directed by the eye in Labyrinth. He did not create the atmosphere in the film as he did before; But surrealistic elements of the story are good, and the film will always stop being boring. The film Rosemary Dexter offers eye candy and provides good performance. The rest of the cast did not mention much, with Adolfo Seli's exceptions, the villain of the pigeon and Alida Valli, Cult fans remember from the entire Cult Flux overall host. The film is at the end; I am lucky not to be the only one who was occasionally confused! Overall, this is not classic stuff; But its good enough and worth seeing.
