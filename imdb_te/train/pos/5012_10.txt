In April 1965, CBS was first broadcast on Barbara Streisand's memorial television specials. The show was not only a runaway success, but earned 5 Emmy Awards. It is one of the 1960's most memorable moments in the 1960s and (unfortunately) they do not produce the television special type anymore. With amazing songs and amazing performance by Barbra, you must watch for any particular stream fan and those interested in early televised.
