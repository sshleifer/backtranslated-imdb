A 14-year-old girl likens her first serious love to a 17-year-old boy who lives near her, while trying to surpass her risk when compared to her older sister. This is the typical motion of this beautiful, poetic era film from director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan has previously been known for his role in The Summer of '42 in 1971 and directed by To Kill a Mockingbird in 1971, the upcoming two Giants. Where he plays a major role in the lead roles: Reese Witherspoon, at the start of her film, as a 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield, an older sister; Jason London, court, the 17 year old boy. Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good in her film career, displaying each emotion, a 14-year-old girl feels enjoying a young love and never hit a wrong note. Both Warfield and London are equally good. Heartfelt sensitivity accurately depicts the thoughts or feelings of each child in love, once it overwhelms Moudlin. Glory to a screenplay related to Genie Wingfield; It is one of the few films about the honest and stable young love of the tone without the emotional fraud or sensationalist. From the scene to the scene to the tone and mental perspective, the music is simpler, but unexpected. Beautiful cinematography is the famed horror director Freddie Francis, which was filmed in his 70-year-old film. Tes Harper and Sam Watersen have had a targeted accuracy for the girls' killing of 1957, a tough and emotional pattern. Gay Strickland is good as a mother of a boy. There are facts to reveal feelings, lessons to learn, and the fact that this sweet-tempered movie damages an emotional loss. To this day, it is the last film of Robert Mulligan. This is one of the best films of 1991. **** 4 stars.
