For those who commented as the Patriot's perfect, (which was basically inspired in English), it was interesting to watch the film. According to all accounts, it is the bloodiest war ever involving Americans, and they are the only nationality. It is very refreshing to see something similar to the historic accuracy from that side of the Atlantic, which did not paint America as martyrs or rescuers. The real horror stories of any controversy, and all the wars in all the wars have brought to the house that the innocent is suffering. It's not a movie you're enjoying, but both have repented and hated everyone.
