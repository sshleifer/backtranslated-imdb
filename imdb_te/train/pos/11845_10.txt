I really do not like the shark images. <br /> <br /> "The Spirit: The Simoron's Stallion" I saw the first of last month, *** forward Spoilers *** "Spirit: The Stalin of Cimarron," is born a horse fall and eventually becomes his hearer leader.One night, he had a strange And he is off to him.This action eventually leads to his compilation, and many more things we hear a story through Spirit's Thoughts and Horses do not speak, Gooiani makes them (filmmakers) made horses The real horses to make sounds; <br /> Spirit rain, a beautiful mare, and rye Little Creek is a native American who happened to own. Little Creek Spirit and Rain leaves later, they walk home. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Bryan Adams, but would like to purchase in the near future, the film Soundtrack. <br /> Watch this movie, and you will not regret it. My score: 10/10
