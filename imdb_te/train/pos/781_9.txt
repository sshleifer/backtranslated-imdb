"Crush" examines the female friendship, avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many movies with the same theme (eg, "Steel Magnolias"). At the same time, it covers and reveals the power of surprise passion. The pictorial events are highly unlikely, but the underlying emotional truth seems to me very real. Not a picture of a fast vehicle and explosive audiences, but adult women respond with laughter and tears.
