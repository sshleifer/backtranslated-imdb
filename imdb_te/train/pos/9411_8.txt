The problem in Sydney Strapton Textile Laboratories is that it has a problem in carrying out jobs in various textile mill mainly due to its experiments. Stratone experimenting on a formula for a new fabric that creates the ultimate robe, never dirty, ever wrinkles, or wears. When Stratone finally creates a fabric, he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who lose their jobs) and employers (who lose money with a mill privilege), so in his white suit Stratton is the most hunter in England. The film is ideal and eeling is only done in this way. (And a great supporting cast like Greenwood, Thezger, and Parker) and Mackentric Directed the film, but the original storyline, good play, drama, romance, and suspense in the business and industry. Rating, 8.
