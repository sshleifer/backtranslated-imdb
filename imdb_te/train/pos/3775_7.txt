My Take: A Goofy, and Intuitive Mess. <br /> <br /> Kauve Reeves (Yes! That Key Rives) and Alex Winter have come back as two punk-rock idiots in the two sequels, which is now a cult classic of adventure adventure comedy Bill and Ted, now a cult classic. In this sequel, Bill and Ted is given more time to do more than travel time. They can also travel to Heaven and Hell! At the beginning of the sequel, Bill and Ted "Band of the Bands" is preparing for the competition, which is more popular than ever before. Meanwhile, the university runs for many years in the futuristic civilization, praising Bill-and-Ted names from the first film (always-viewable George Carlin). There, an evil tyrant (Jaws Ackland, HUNT FOR RED since October) to get rid of idiot rock-stars once and for all. <br /> There are two types of mechanical counterparts (in the words of Bill and Ted: Robot Us): to experience the Bill and Ted experience there and find their way through hell. The dwellers who have been included in the worst memories of the duo by Heaven in an attempt to get back the land in order to save their friends, and their appearance. In this frail-out voyage, the 1957 Foreign Film Classic The Seventh Seal is a similar memoir Death Apart (William Sadler, from DIE HARD 2), and more. <br /> <br /> The BOGUS Journey of Exotic Special Effects Gymnas is not the standard of standards, and some feel humor and a time-consuming look and feel to be somewhat honest, it seems to be released for the wrong year, even for the 90s). But it's both fun and imaginable by both performance and direction, Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is fun, fiction, and yes, bogus. <br /> Rating: *** From 1/2 to 5.
