A true story in Amazon because I liked this movie too much, and a part of the world has always been very interesting to me. <br /> I was a "baby boomer," character and actress my contemporaries, and "Reader's Digest". I am responsible for this film. The director believes that the film is valuable to teach the ability to survive the role of streams that lead to the river and if it follows other survival techniques in coastal areas where she can help. It is very important to protect her favorable attitude and to protect her. <br /> <br /> In the end, the audience learn something from it and are looking for entertainment. <br /> <br /> I would like to release this film on VHS and DVDs as soon as possible to add to my video collection. It should also be shown more frequently on satellite movie channels.
