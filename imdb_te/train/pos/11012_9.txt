I'm not sure if I see a documentary, promotional film or dramatic presentation. <br /> <br /> The dramatic storyline is somewhat predictable. But you know that the film has many interesting scenes. <br /> <br /> The film is close to me. The scenes were realistic (at least I realized) I did not often encounter. You can keep yourself in action and imagine the ideas of younger struggles. <br /> <br /> It has been combined with the common problems of Japanese soldiers who play the role of real Japanese actors when you think it's a bit harder. <br /> <br /> The film is supposed to be a source of American opinion. War was fought in Japan in 1943. Japan is also interested in Japan's relief assistance in past years.
