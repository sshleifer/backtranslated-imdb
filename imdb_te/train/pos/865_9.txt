Vincent Cassel Paul, a former worker who was assigned to work as a worker, would meet Carla, who had a deaf who had a deaf when she had deaf hearing aid? When (Emmanuel Devos played) is not. <br /> <br /> What is the complexity of characters that are especially interesting about this film? No clear stereotypes are fitted. Paul displays inconvenience in the workplace, is not he just cut for work? <br /> <br /> The movie has an outward behavior, which I found refreshing and hoped that it was not harmful, and lastly, it's a great movie "moments" touching and joking. Carla tries to comfort a baby while the baby is in the casing. She continues to squeeze it ?? But she will help her listen for her own convenience.
