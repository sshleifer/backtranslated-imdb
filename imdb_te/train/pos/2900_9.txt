If I want an American movie, I will rate 7: as we have seen before. This is Argentine film, and since I'm the Argentine, I think I want to give a 10, which I'd expect from the kind of quality-so much more than expecting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Image. I feel the main moment of the film, is not surprising, the original is not original. The real action starts. <br /> <br /> Before I watch the movie, I try to collect the information. This is a major, cathical, commercial one, I can say "the best" state of mind to enjoy the movies like this, to press "Play" and make a suspension of reality and logic. The ability of the whole plot is not to be discussed, and it is reliable in a certain way. <br /> I could not stop smiling every joke and commentary - "Soos Malo" ("You mean"). > I'm tired of watching movies for Paretti. I know he is an outstanding actor, but sometimes I feel Luis Luc's role in this role is unfair to feel the rest of his characters. I do not like Argentine television, so I do not see much work from the Lou, but he looks beautiful as an amazing actress. His physical character, his moods, and his love of attitudes in this film fell in love with me. <br /> <br /> I know that he can not do it if he follows the rule that "the second parts are never better" <br /> <br /> In the future, I think Perretti's colleagues will take into consideration the opportunity to give them the same opportunities to develop their roles. Ours around and laugh!
