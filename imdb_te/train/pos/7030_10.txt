When it was broadcast on TV in 1995 we recorded it and waited all year long for its release because it became one of our family favorites. The kids are now teens and they have to look at a ba-jillian times, and they'll still see friends with friends. This is a timeless appeal that reaches the ages of all ages - equivalent to "grease". <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is wonderful. Jason Alexander sees his feet happier and lively. I saw that other commentators on this site are pretty hard on him, but our family gives him the best ratings. (We liked his 'Giant Step' number). Mark Kudisk (like Conrad) gave us comic relief and excellent music numbers. And Brigitte Day (as in the era) just stole the show. <br /> <br /> Kim's Chinna Phillip's performance was a disappointment. That part is required to be done with the writing. Kim's character is completely one-dimensional. Philip's delivery is flat, unexpected, unbelievable and plain terrible. The director should look and fix it. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is delightful and I recommend it to families of all ages.
