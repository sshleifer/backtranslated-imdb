At the Toronto International Film Festival I saw Fido World Premiere and enjoyed it very much. George Romero has a well-known work of a genre that is widely thought to be here (definitely 'widespread and blossom'). But it's a Canadian film by a Canadian director and it's a joke! And, yes, I really feel better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and the young actor K'sun Ray, very nice, especially the more joyful performances, I suspect we'll see more features in the future. However, I have complimented Mr. Tim Blake Nelson to be the most memorable part of the animated version of Mr. Billy Connolly (or, Scott Billy Connolly, in his least animated, and yet deeply moving role) from neighboring Mr. Theophilos, especially the Corps bride. I think, he is the character of Prison Br Q. Peter Stormare is not for the commitments (as Q & A has revealed in the following Thursday night show) I can not help but suppose that the screenwriters were very inspired by DeadBeard's Dead, and I have never been able to disclose plot details in a comment and I Fido is not one of those tastes, you're from Romero But it is a film that has a continuously chuckling film (and I definitely need to think) a blood-dying and affordable dose of violence, lovely humor, as well as a great surreal atmosphere directory created by Cure and his co-authors, which PG -13 To avoid appearing as a feature rated Ndi. I'm asking you to see this little canak gem. Immediately after the release of the summer, I'll definitely buy the DVD.
