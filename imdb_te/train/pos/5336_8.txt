In this film I really like, because in Australia, Chinese movies like this do not always show up at the moment. This is one of the best movies I can say about the difference between the Hong Kong people and the mainland. It really shows that there is a discomfort between the two, but only when HK Mandarin is learning. It showed me how main China china is in indie rock scene, and the Chinese people know how to guitar stram and house funking! Who said that China was not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely fantastic with her gentle and crisp voice, honest acting and overall chic magnet. I recommend this movie from Asian citizens who are not familiar with simple western stereotypes, and most people do not want to clean themselves from people who like Chinese / Asian film like me. Check it out!
