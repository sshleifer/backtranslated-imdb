I call it a more awakening, and many of us are based on the media that we have seen, heard, read and thinking about many. This example is for high-level spin doctors trying to control people through controlled information. This is an excellent example of people who have a constitution that they bought freely, can not be misinterpreted by this media control or any attempts. Once again, the needs of many people at the end of this day are in fact overcome some needs. Democracy is not a tough thing to implement when a country does not have a civil war in any country.
