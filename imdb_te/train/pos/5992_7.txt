I admit I do not know what to expect before seeing this the most beautiful piece. It was a zombie virus or cure for all the cooler for all I know. It opened great scenes, small snippets are the reason to catch your attention and run your imagination wild. As I continued, I learned quickly through voice over what was going on. A good little Neo Nair story that I thought would not waive a few minutes of my time. Initially the visuals given to the viewers by visuals make them succeeded by plotting the plot. In addition to a cool package with a good twist in the end. Score, but not bad, the film gave almost a music video feel. It does not add anything to the storyline for a while, just having a date. Some of the exhibits seemed to be overly dramatic, but not all of them fit perfectly with the feelings of the pieces. I walk away from this very satisfied. I have been given a lot of information in very short time but it does not move or feel forward through great compilation and voice-over work. Great work!
