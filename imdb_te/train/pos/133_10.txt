A few years ago, a friend of one of his other friends got a video with Michael Mann's film 'Heat'. After the film was finished, after watching the story, we saw another story, the owner did not leave it on the cassette's cover. <br /> <br /> I am surprised a few weeks later: How can I not hear this masterpiece first? <br /> <br /> This film is Europa. Lars von Trier woke up to film Noir from the dead, consciously reconstructed reality with clear set of terms, and even more often post-war German photographs. Then tricky cuts! <br /> <br /> The story also takes a moral odyssey that is not a happy ending. A young American pacifist from Germany's descendant came to Germany after the war, and some of its citizens have fallen to some extent to pay bombs. But he meets mostly distrust and self-destructive contempt. He hires a dining and sleeping-car company with a jintropra (in the mitochrome model), one of whose owner is one of the Nazi collaborators, one of the Whitesaw Whitewash. Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who is then a member of the Nazi postwar terrorists. <br /> When he does not understand the world (or just Europeans), he kills a railroad bridge underneath the train. <br /> <br /> As a final note, the real world and Versailles are portrayed as something important, they are mostly the last Nazi propaganda rebel. After an SS unit heavily damaged in the Allied Occupied Aachen, two months before the attacks, the Nazis announced the creation of entire army and terrorists, who are ready to fight behind Werewolf and Verellff. But hundreds of thousands have trained Hitler Youth, and two or three times Hitler's death and slave death, Communists suspected in slave villages or forced aliens to be murdered for the frightening of the inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The Werewolf publishers have had a profound effect on the invaders. They feared Verroll everywhere, suspecting any serious accident - but it was found to be for another reason without exception (recently by some fake-historians). For example, a gas core exploded in Blume bomb blasts police HQ, or when a Soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in Berlin. The impact on the Soviets was very strong, and thousands of suspects (early in the age of childhood) were suspected of having been voracious and arrested in advance of many dead prison camps.
