I am a fan of two actors / singers, and especially when I find this movie and watch the trailer, I think it's a crazy one. <br /> <br /> Whenever I know the storyline and do not mention it, I'm going to take my first appreciation performance, usually Japanese Movies are not intelligent and acting.So in all of Chan's castings, it's just fantastic and came into play, especially with Gatkt's characters I love both scenes and humorous scenes, for HYDE, his performance is good but he is deliberately in the background as an actor, his role throughout the film. I did not like some cinematography, especially lighting and some colors, but due to the small budget, it still has amazing movements, but the true story of the film is the story. It's okay for me some cheesy moments, the cinematic theme of the movie is really well developed and sometimes touching, on the other hand the brutal world of the story is reflected in this theme that visualizes it with no life guarantee and some memorable death scenes. Interesting note, the film has some similarities to the fantastic vampire movie film Interview with the Vampire, which is featured in the American film's most beautiful (pretty, pretty) actors, in fact the moon's child can be seen as one of the brothers in the interview, and the original on its own. Chandra Child is slowly slow, I am a Japanese cinema fan and I have used it but Moon Chilad does not have some useless scenes or characters. But everything is very good and very emotional, the actors / singers want to see their other films in the future, And Vampire-Action-Cycle Fix And erotic images from 8/10
