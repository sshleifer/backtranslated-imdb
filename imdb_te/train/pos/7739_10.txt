Have you ever read Jim Thompson? He was the hard-broth nair with the most serious fatalism and misanthropy I had encountered. There are hardly private detectives in his work- just losing, mental and short time con artists. Thompson hangs on the film - "If we make any real mistakes in this world, we have a commitment to live when we do not have any need." Each character in the film is on the edge of the razor between surreal and creepy reality. Uncle Bad featuring a well-intended Dr. Goldman, played by Bruce Dern and George Dickerson. Jason Patrick gives Kid Collins an incredible, often heart-wrenching performance like no one-too-bright, cowardly former warrior who feared far more than anyone. Rachel Ward Fay, Sexy Femeam Fatale We can not find too much ... This is not your standard film Noir, or intended. After Dark My Sweet, along with The Garfield's, two good simulations of one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson's novels.
