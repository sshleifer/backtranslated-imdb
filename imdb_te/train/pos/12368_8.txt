I have a TV for the White Noise Companion and have heard "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment." So I got into the TV set of another 70s and got into the TV room too. Fortunately, I was initially able to rewind (DVR buffer) and see the record button completely. Apart from some holes in the story and unquestionable dialogue / events, this is a valuable thriller to see it's effective. Pretty creepy and progressive: Before Beverly D'Angelo's character Alison Parker, she played Christina Raina, Parker Strabs, a very tragic scene with a very ghost fashion, her father, a clear quest. Watch) The film is full of 70 outfits with bad costumes (polyester suits and solid ascots) and shape, bad hair, bloated musical score and familiar cinematography. The cast is good, take a second to check it on the home page of this film. It is surprising to see Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Gold Blum. Silvia Miles- Always Creepy Creepy! Have fun!
