This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. The film is not perfect enough to grasp the subtle humor that you give this movie to the whole. This shows us that it can create a winning combination of real life and "fantasy" action. Also, as a romantic comedy, this is one of the most intelligent ways for two people to find each other. Rename another movie you can see, and Donald Sutherland "they're going to find your sin in a mountain on Mars."
