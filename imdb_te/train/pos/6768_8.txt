One of my favorite shows in the 80s. After the first season, when they decided to join Jean Bruce Scott, he fell down. Deborah Pratt is fantastic and it's fun watching her and the role of Ernest Borgnine go at it with each other. The last episode she played was my favorite one in the second season. Unfortunately in those days, blacks did not last long on television programming. Some of the episodes of the second season are much more common than the third season airweeper, and it has not been shown until almost the end of the show. When it went to the USA, it was frustrating!
