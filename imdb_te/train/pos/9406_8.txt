Other commentators explain the plot and social parables and commentary (or better) as well, but I would like to join my admiration for this small gem of this film. Screenplay, acting, photography, set design, sound design ... It really is a classic - in every category 50 years later it has very well actually. This is my first exposure to "young" Alec Guinness, and it's obvious from the first frames that made him special to finally receive a knighthood. <br /> It certainly costs to "8" because it examines human nature, but does not really waver. And the end of the platform will be easy at the end because the creator and mill workers and the entrepreneurs who chase him throughout the city do not solve the problem. Furthermore, two minutes of thinking reveal the fundamental flaw in the logic of the screenplay - not a decision to buy clothing and tears new clothes (especially dressed clothes); Children grow up, change people's sizes, gain and lose weight, and the latest fashions go all the time, and long loom cloth. And in any case, the manufacturer makes a fortune to provide goods that can not be destroyed by the armed forces (particularly BDUs). <br /> Still, this is a great movie. If you have the chance to see the classic movie channel, you must.
