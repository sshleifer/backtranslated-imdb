I saw the recent Region 2 DVD of this film which featured in the "Horror" section of Oxford Street Store and promoted as "Classic Thriller". <br /> In fact, almost four decades, a vehicle known as Arthur Aske in British comedy and light entertainment is almost a vehicle. <br /> <br /> He is constantly coming up with a delightful, fast, and especially good-natured comedy. Over the last twenty-five years, a bit of a culture shock for many of the sour and cynical flavor of British comedy. But there are still those who appreciate his cheerful and cheery man and total avoidance of sadness. Aski has a lot of Tommy Cooper statue, and he often adopts a "self-esteemed" gag, which Arthur tries to entertain passengers alone. <br /> <br /> Under-rated Lyndon is a mysterious jelly-influencing traverse.
