Suppose I'm messing up your release date-time table with the ultimate curse to attend the Toronto Film Festival. Very frankly, I'm happy Fido picked up for delivering the US. In any case <br /> <br /> Have you seen Shaun of the Dead? Good. How about lacy? Can you coordinate both of these? Well, you could be your name Andrew Cure, Canadian Helmer's first family zombie comedy, or Jomdi. Although Dion of Shawn is not violent, dry or british, Fido is real to its roots: in Lassie and Lassie and both are devoted to the old 50-year old black and white television <br /> <br /> Fido's talented titles (Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connelly , Dylan Baker, and Tim Blake Nelson) scripted the script. The film analyzes all the implications of its motion: A whole world has changed services as many servants of them, due to a strange accident. What should you use for your new death without a servant? A butler? Can it be difficult? Pet? Unexplained actions? Fido uses these opportunities as a sweet and surprisingly classy, ​​with Connelly's gratitude (as told by zombies) and young TV actor Kusun Ray, a good young Elijah Wood <br /> If you look forward to another shawn of the Dead, Do not waste time. There is enough gour and you pokes at the genre satisfied and you'll just leave the bitter and frustrating theater. But when you flock across the lake, if you're ready to observe what happened to Shaun of the Dead, you're doing it for a treat. Think of sensitive, often often small brother Fidon, to shun the deadly defeat of the Dead, and you start to motion. If you want (or at least tolerate) loads of zombies, little kids, and dean satire, the image of Fido. That's not the case .... well, you know the drill. Just hit the 'em square between the eyes.
