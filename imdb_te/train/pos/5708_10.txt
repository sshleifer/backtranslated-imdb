It's so exciting! After watching "La Roue" this afternoon, a small, light little picture, I consider this a real treat! This is definitely the happiest and one of the most beautiful pictures I have seen this year. It's great because it is an opening talkie and some of the greatest images in the 30s are shy because of the innovative use of the sound in the film. It's just music and really upbeat and the bottom line, it's filled with an adorable mood that made me happy! Fortunately, it's not hard to get back the ticket, but the pace is very happy and the film is very fun and I never even thought twice. The comedy is a lot of fun and I think it's better for Marx Brothers, which may be the biggest joke of the time. This is accurate.
