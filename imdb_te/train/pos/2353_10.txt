Certainly "Pushing Daisies" is one of the best TV shows of its style in the past 5 years, or you agree. Creator Bryan Fuller has an amazing creative mind. He is not as great as "Dead Like Me" (2003), "Wonderfuls" (2004) and other "Heroes" (2006) also behind the other great TV shows. It is a mixture of brilliant worlds Brian Fuller created in the previous TV shows, always mixing in a fantastic fantasy world with a true variety of people, disguised in colorful pictures and exaggerated emotions. So, being a kind of fairytale, you can not expect more than a dubious world and unexpected situations, or predict a lot of situations but it's not as commonly said. <br /> <br /> The gift always comes with a curse, and the sweet will also be bitter. Hence, Ned (Lee Pace), the Piemaker, is a simple person with an interesting gift other than an amazing chef: he just gives life to death with just one touch. It will die for everyone - or live - not just another simple and very tragic thing: he will die forever if he touches it again. The curse of this magnificent gift does not stop there ... Everything has to be compensated and if he brings anything to life for more than one minute, another fake instantly dies. He is a man who lives full of unfortunate events in life, always fearing that he loves each other and always loses one another. Even until the day that she was close to Chick (Anna Priel) for his little girl's love, she was not dead yet. He gave his life again and he loved him very much, but this love is untouchable. True kiss of death. <br /> When I heard about "daisies" for the first time, Tim Burton was promoted as something very familiar (or perhaps some appreciation). "Big Fish" (2003) and "Charlie and the Cholot Factory" (2005) from "The Big Adventure of Pee-Vee" (2005). The results are not good. The world around the hole is wonderful. Stories surrounding Nude and Detective Cod (Chi McBride) may be more common on TV, but it is simply a wonderful way to guide people with amazing stories around the fabulous characters such as Chuck and Olive (Kristine Chenauvet). Beautiful and dreamy pictures can absorb almost the colorful taste. Moreover, you are a group of amazing and attractive delicate characters, even those who have a very deep dark humor. <br /> Murders and unsolved crimes, performance Brights and other things are very successful. The actors here are noticeable. Lee pace is tender, soft and charactery. Muse of the show like Anna Friel was supposed to play the role of her character. But there are always striking roles with supporting actors such as Chi McBride (Detective Emerson Code), Swazzie Kurtz (Lilly Charles), Ellen Green (Vivian Charles) and Kristine Chenauvaut (Olive Snook). Swoozie Kurtz shines dried character performance so that a clown sank in an impossible dark humor to frighten, certainly she has the best conversations and mesmerizing her expressions and body tongues. But if best dialogues are given by Swoozie and her character, the best funny moments are given to Kristin Chenoweth. She seems to improve all the time, she is naturally fun as a show next to every single scene. Kristin shines at a fully bright and fit show at the 2009 Emmy winning show for her supporting role in the show. <br /> <br /> This TV show is really no and there are no words to express what's meant by it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you are saying, Never been so brave in a TV show with a. "Pushing Daisies" went ahead with great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was disrespectful. It is true that TV does not respect Bryan Fuller's creation of great TV programs - except "Heroes" in the air, and not so much of the other.
