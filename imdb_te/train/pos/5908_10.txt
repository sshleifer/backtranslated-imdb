This is one of the most amazing films I've seen in recent times. No reputation will go on any international film. I was really surprised why it did not get this well-deserved recognition. Sonali Kulkarni will win the national award, which is just a comfort fact. She speaks volumes through her eyes to Rena Daddardar just surprised. There are some scenes standing: when Gauri comes from the city on the dark wedding, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna is a change in Gauri, but not a single line of dialog. The whole body of emotions is notified through subtle habits and eyes. Krishna prayed to Abui Kulkarni to marry Gauhini. If you move to the scene, you do not have the heart. <br /> Watch this movie for the film's production and acting abilities.
