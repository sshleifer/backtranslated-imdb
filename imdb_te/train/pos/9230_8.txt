This is a lot about the film. This is not your normal monk. <br /> <br /> The 15th Century was held in Italy during the 800 Martyr's death in Aetronto. The film takes a good part in the fight between Muslims and Christians. Everybody is interesting when walking from Muslim ministers, the mother's superiors say, "Why are you scared of Muslims, what does the Christians do to you?" <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florenda Bolcano) was sent to the convent to deny her father. In this process, she achieves many testimonies: a Stalin, a local duke, a local woman's rape, a monk's torture surpassed during a visit to Tarantula sect, and when she hit her with a Jew. <br /> <br /> Brother Flavia needs to face difficulties when questioning her surviving male-dominated society. . <br /> Finally she became a leader of the Muslims as her girlfriend and they removed the convent. Here's where you're looking for more meat than you can enjoy at the same time. But the tragedy is coming. She finds the perfect sweetness of all things, including the Duke and her father, but the Muslim lover finds herself the same way. <br /> <br /> I do not describe what the sacred men of her church eventually did to this religious person, but it was Saa or Hostel for decades. <br /> <br /> Unsuplation fans are satisfied with treats, but film lovers digest a lot of meat.
