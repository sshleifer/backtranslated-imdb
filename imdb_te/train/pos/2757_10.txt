If you want to see a different kind of picture, if you feel love in your heart, even if the Lord miss you, you can think of it. Although Georges is mentally handicapped, you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end, and love gives you the brain. I'm not emotional, but this film treats you as human. The film is as good as Forest Gump with my belief. Overseas movies are sometimes more interesting, yet there is not enough advertising to get popularity. "Rang-A Khoda" (The Color of the God) by Majid Majidi is another example of such foreign films.
