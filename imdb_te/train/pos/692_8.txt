I first saw this festival. There were many good movies, but after a while I thought about myself, and Insomnac's Nightmare is definitely one of them. Tes is definitely an amazing filmmaker. The shots are great. The cast is perfect. Dominic has done well in her role. She does not know much about her role, but she thinks about herself. And Ellen - I can not wait to see her end! She shows a lot of talent and I hope I'll do some more movies. With all the million dollar budgets trying to get less thrill, Tess shows that it does not require long story and long time actors. Kudos to everyone involved in this film. And thank you for Tess and co. For distribution on DVD!
