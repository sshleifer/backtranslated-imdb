This is a fantastic classic monster image from the 50s! I love the look of the 50s, usually like cars and music. Anyway, I love the bold look. When everyone was in the theater at night in the theatrical horror movie, I loved it and blobed and crashed the party. <br /> When Steve and Jane are out, they will see an asteroid fall from space. Blob inside the meteor shower. When the blob uses a person, it grows larger and larger. They try to convince the urban people about the Blobby monster, but no one will trust them until later. Can anything stop this blobby creature? I highly recommend BLOB !!!
