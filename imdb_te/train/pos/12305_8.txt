Outside of the uniform positive reviews I read, I'm not quite sure what to expect with this. It turns out, I could never have imagined this movie, because it is very close to "Female with White Hair" operac and deals with excellent. This runs a fine line between telling a farce, comedy, and plain good old fashion ghost story. There's nothing scary about it, it's not a theme, it's a love story that really deals with a male guy who meets a cute ghost who is a lot of difficulties with other ghosts. So the main theme is the person trying to save the beautiful ghost. It is the oldest in China, the wild Kung Fu exhibitions, and the tour of hell (more or less). Some of the stop-action ghosts are very good, and the visual effects are rated all the way to the top. They were able to see Chinese movies all day, because they were very entertaining, great visuals and pretty much tongue cheeks. And I'm looking forward to watching this movie's first sequel. Highly recommended.
