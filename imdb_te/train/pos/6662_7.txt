Gandhi is my father's good film. It portrays the life of Mahatma Gandhi's Eldest Son Harilal. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand on his own, his failure and his ego .. Akshay Khanna fully defends Harilal. He was not, everyone did well in the roles they played. Gandhi is the best I have seen in the past. <br /> <br /> First, fifteen and twenty minutes longer than the film is required. Secondly, the film needs more research into the role of Harilal. Somewhere, the character is incomplete. Also, his relationship with his brothers was not shown. There is no mention of Gandhi's other children in the whole film. <br /> <br /> I believe that at least some people are different from his brothers if the character Harilal takes into consideration the narrative nature of Harilal. <br /> <br /> Some of the bugs have happened.
