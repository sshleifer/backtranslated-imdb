Yaitate !! Japan is a really fun performance and I really like it! This is shown in 5:30 every time in our country, the Hero TV and ABS-CBN. It is about Azuma Kazuma who is trying to fulfill his dream of making Japanese bread, representing his country. He is working in the South Taoist branch of Pantasia and his friend (Sukino Azuzagaawa) also helps with other loaves (such as Kawasaki Kiyuyuuk and Kumuri Shigeru) to defeat St. Pierre and take control of the Pantisia. They fight with other skilled bread makers from many other countries and learn to make different kinds of bread, but learn to cook other food. This is really funny and unique because they imitate the characters from other anime (such as Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and characters from famous people in real life. It is one of the best works of Takashi Huschieguchi and must be seen by people of different ages.
