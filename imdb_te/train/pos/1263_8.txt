I enjoyed this movie because I enjoyed seeing the Sean Canary Act, and this one is also grant the additional bonus that includes Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne. The story was a bonus for Connery's help because her grandson was in jail and was wrongly convicted. Firstly, there seems to be some racist elements in the case, although the main officer in the case was then blacked out and the boy did some bad things to get out of the way. The same boy is trying to tell another killer who is in the same prison. He is a particularly evil person who takes pleasure in what he has done, writes the relatives of his victims and tries to send people to mail. There is a lot of slight turns and turns this being somewhat unexpected. I experienced the role of Sean Connery, who tried to get to know all the experience. And when I finally realized what happened, the film made me mad. Connery and Harris and Conner and Fishburn have a good deal of mutual respect. In the end this makes for a good suspense / thriller.
