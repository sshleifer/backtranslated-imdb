Wow, this film is absolutely cool. I'm not really sure why everyone said slowly. I thought the pace was perfect. A film by Tom Sawney (Tom Newman) who is working for Tom Hanks, a hitman / killer, Rooney will pay her home and help him financially because he will miss this job. He did nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But, he does not know that his children are his job, and when he kills him, he puts him in a difficult position. And if an infamous occasion happens, he will go with his son and take revenge. They abducted slaves and formed more bonds. They are perfect team. Hanks has always worked great as a Jude Law that plays his greatest song role. This shows a beautiful storyline and this play is well-received in the 1930s.
