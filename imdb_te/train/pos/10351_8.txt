When Chamberlain's family is camping near Ayers Rock in Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) appears to have brought his baby out by a dingo and begins to feel no one to experience. Dingo's story is not believed by people or presses, and the whole thing will change into circuses. She does not play for jury or court because Lindy does not help matters, she is herself, and she has a tough nut to crush herself, so there is evidence that she is convicted for everyone. Sam Neal Michael Chamberlain, pastor of Seventh-Day Arabs, had doubts about his faith and possibly his wife. Since the story of the Australian people and the media is not only believable by Flames, others are also bad and stupid (or bad) because people are in the states. Finally, Lindy was a criminal and sent to jail for the hardest life, but a few years later, a missing evidence appeared and she was liberated, but the family's life was not primarily ruined. The heartbreaking story is very well made, a bit long but well worth seeing. 10 to 8.
