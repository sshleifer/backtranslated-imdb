I saw this film when I was sleeping in the morning. It is evidence that Deliverance is a spell-binding film. I think Boorman has done a wonderful job to direct this film. How did the opening scene and duo ban with a hill folk? It is well presented and presented on how the people of the region are naturally reserved and simple. In the point of the case - near the end of "Dual", a banjo-playing boy (who loves his banjo) laughs, but when Drew "ducks" tried to move the boy's hand, the kid was reserved for responding. River tour you certainly did not get bored. The scene of this rape is cruel, but there is no need to show any resistance to these backward regions in Georgia. I think Batty's after the painful shock has done well. Some people did not look pretty through the test. I disagree - if you really care, he does not react immediately after taking action, in which Reynolds kill the assaulted arrow and they chase the useless guy. It was confusing when Ed was killed on the hill and killed another person. <br /> <br /> The arrow appears to have been shot down while waiting to be curled up and dead. However, you know that he has finally put an end to the arrow. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the great movie, the distance between 8 and 9 in my vote, but after reading a message from an unsatisfactory voter who gave a "1", I gave "10". This person's reasoning is not based on personal bias, but rather than a targeted perspective, his vote did not attempt to reduce the rating apparently.
