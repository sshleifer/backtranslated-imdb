This is very memorable spaghetti Western. It's a great storyline, interesting characters and some very good acting, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her character is really classic in the role of the evil villain in the film. She steals every scene, even though she does not speak with her face and eyes, she is very expressive. Her performance is very believable. She has a lot of mesmerizing (not being at the top) without being on top. Marc Damon is surprisingly good in the film. <br /> <br /> Music score is amazing, and the theme song is the kind of playing on your head or not for a few days after watching the movie. There are many fun parts. I especially like the part that needs to be in front of Russell Garlic. <br /> If I did not do two things, I gave 8 or 9 stars to the film. For the first time 25 minutes of silly bar room clash in the movie. This is one of the most ridiculous struggles I have ever seen in this film. This is a very poorly directed dance, and looks more like a dance number from bad music than any kind of a real fight. If this is a Terence Hill / Bud Spencer comedy, this may not be considered, but it is more serious Western, and the confrontation must be really realistic. Another thing that angered me about this film is Yuma's coward Mexican sidekick. I thought it was comedy relief or something, but the role was plain stupid and unnecessary in this movie, and he was not funny for all. Where is Tuco if I'd like him? <br /> <br /> I would guarantee everyone that I read that Johnny Uma is a Western spaghetti brandy despite all the errors I mentioned, and all the fans of this genre have to watch the film.
