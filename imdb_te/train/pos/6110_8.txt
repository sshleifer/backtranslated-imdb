Similar to "My Sauce Girl", the film is based on a true story posted from the Internet, but the similarities end here. The story is still about the rebellion, named Ji-hoon (Quan Sung Wu), about the Jim-Hoon (Quan Sung Woo), who is trying to complete a high school whose names are Parents Su-von (Kim Ha Neal), but his age age. Some barriers, martial arts (vulgarities are always after je-hoon for vengeance), an after-embarrassment, overwhelming love-sick girl, his practice to repel texts, and you can usually imagine the entire story. Did I mention a romantic comedy? Thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Neul and Quan Sung Wool, the film has a lot of power for the film, it has good fighting scenes, great visual humor and a lot of throat. For that reason, sex elements also work. And, I must say, I want a girlfriend like Kim Ha Neuel than the girl from "My Sauce Girl" (personally, at least). She has a slight throat, but it's beautiful, sweet, and in good mind. The characters are already very popular (and so little a bit more than "My Sauce Girl" - the barrier to the film for its credit), and the film is very clever and very interesting. The 2/3 story of the route (about the standard, standard fare that knows something that's really interesting somewhere), but eventually gets slightly close. Overall, a fun, beautiful picture. 8/10
