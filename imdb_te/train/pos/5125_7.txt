I was bellied up to the bar expecting it to be a hot beer on a sweltering Texas day but was pleasantly surprised. After suffering from "Saturday Night Foolishness" I wanted to make some reassemble at the Texas Bane Yard in the south ... and I did not. John Revalta's jealous red neck is good, Scott Glenn stars as a taaggy ex-can, and Debra Winger, as always, is a pleasure. * Love the woman * plus, soundtrack dinium [comes from a man who does not retain the sound of national music]. A fun picture all the way.
