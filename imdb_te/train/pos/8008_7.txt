As far as I know, the show has not been repeated at the start of the late 60s / 70s on UK Television and many episodes are now unfortunately "unexpectedly wiped out". <br /> <br /> It is still in existence since 1971 that still exists. I had the chance to see the best part of 4 decades. <br /> After rushing home from school, my contemporaries are back in the halcyon days of stained pants, slad and Chic Tip. <br /> <br /> The bad / hammy acting, unwanted amusing combat scenes, the big sea ships to the pilot, and the "scary, scary" main characters of the main players. <br /> <br /> No - because freewheelers show during the daytime ("golden") shows children at the age of TV drama, because the shows are just a tearing fun and do not mind. <br /> <br /> Previously, two of the spectators had their relationships, pregnancy, drugs, STTIs. "A modern viewer is" the modern political viewer of all forms of the day, the owner is a black woman, one of the younger male heroes, a white woman who is confused about his sexuality, from a defenderial, ankle-blasted washer-top from another million words Removed - forever, get out of franchises out of scrapes and make them look crazy Vvalanukunte all the action with IQ level go-getter. <br /> It's a long time, "its time" is a program that. But it's bad? I do not think so.
