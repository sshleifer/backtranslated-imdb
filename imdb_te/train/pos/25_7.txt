I have never seen it when I was a child, so it was seen with fresh eyes. I have not heard about it for my 5 year old daughter. Plus, Christopher Walken's singing and dance idea made me curious. Special FX cheesy and singing and dance are mediocre. But the story is very good. My daughter was admitted. I liked watching Wacken in this role, thinking of what happened to him in the future. His dance is very fun to see! And while the songs are not great, at least they are not the most productive Disney cartoons. Initially the Ogre scene was a little scary to her, and eventually when we saw him she was a little nervous, but it was too late. Interestingly, we have recently read "Puss in Boots", and I've wondered about the story's implausibility. But when it's true for almost every item, Walken's performance has made it incredible. So much happiness. I can see again with my daughter.
