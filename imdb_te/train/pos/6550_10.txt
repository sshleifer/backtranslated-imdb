See, if you're interested in Nancy Drew's book, what I will do is to pick a book and read it. I'm not. Since I do not like the book, I can read the book that is going to disturb the movies. We're sorry - we can not see movies on the flip books in the digital age, but I'm sure you can still find some minor specs in the book. When the Lord of the Rings came, the people complained. When the third person won an Oscar - "the book is good." I saw a killing a Mockingbird, "The book is good." Some people are upset now because Nancy Drew does not like this book. I do not say Nancy Drew is going to win any Oscars - if any it is one of those Nickelodean Blimps or Kids Choice Awards. I am telling you to give the film a break. It's not a movie not a movie. Nancy Drew, who supports Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (Hebrew Hummer) and Tate Donovan (GA Cooper on the OC) and Rachel Lee Cook (her all that), is very entertaining. This was the first time I saw Emma Roberts in a movie, and frankly, I enjoyed much more than Julia and Eric's work; Her role is consistent throughout the film and has responded well with conflict. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> Release.
