All dogs go to heaven and play on the criminal underworld of dogs. The film is delighted with a funny and dark-but satisfying and happy-end storyline with plenty of film and dance. Charlie killed, a fellow cookie who has been killed, comes back from the dead. He meets the man who finds him, and through this relationship he learns the meaning of life and self sacrifice. This is a beautiful animation is very loved by my eyes as a child. I will recommend children for this film. I'm not sure how adults respond. (I've tried to look at the VHS a few years ago, but the recordings do not last long, what do they do?)
