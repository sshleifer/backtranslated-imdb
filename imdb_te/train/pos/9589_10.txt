I personally say that one of the most important documentaries to cover the site, growing up in NYC in the club scene at the beginning of the 80s / early 90s. No Madonna did not come to Voguing idea but this is where she came from! Instead of harassing each other or bitchi's cat struggles, people are allowed to "fight" everything (ie, guaranteeing an automatic disqualification) for everyone who touches each other. It is not surprising that exceptionally talented / spectacular "throwing" clubs are in the club and all the big names come back from the day ... Pepper La BÃ©ja, Paris DuPray, Extractagann, etc. ... All Malakra McLaren's song "Vogue in Vogue" Such as time frames ... you do not care about it or where you come from Because you have these "magical empire" types through those doors, you become a part of yourself, you are important / and especially your own moves and imaginations ... and can be in any case (or queen) from anywhere. Movements and intelligence on the floor are just sharp. The tension, excitement and magic of urban NYC power are all bound in this film. BRILLIANT !!! Release the DVD to see the world !!! Thank you!
