Mitchell Rodriguez is a well-established high-profile superior senior, who learns that she will start a powerful punch and amateur training at a Brooklyn gym. Santiago Douglas is a beautiful young man, older than she is, he trains there too. They meet after class, talk, and feel attracted to each other. No sex. <br /> <br /> Both the participants of the "gender-blind" athletic program have no differences between men and women, the athletic play field <br /> <br /> A Conservative radio commentator recently declared - and I did not do this It's okay - "Let's face it, the president is black." I'm here to make equitable observation - "men and women are different." Now, in 99 cases of 100 cases, there is no variation in physical performance. But the top one percent - trained athletes whose skills have been improved to the fine edge - men usually have the benefit. With their narrow hips they can run faster. And they have more muscle mass and upper torso strength. These variations in bodybuilding can give birth to women and raise children and to catch and kill them for food for men. This sexual division is the result of a complete general process of natural selection. Without it, no human beings. And that's, boys and girls, why they have men's events and women's events in the Olympics. I will speak to you as your anthropologist. <br /> <br /> I called this gulf-blind program to mislead. <br /> <br /> When a skilled boxer like Rodriguez, when she reached the highest level of the game, she finally lost a male. <br /> <br /> There are difficulties in this film. Rodriguez finally fits her boyfriend, Douglas. Not wanting to loose any other anger, not to mention the rights to the roundhouse, but the pride of the two is stake, and the proud is both personal and gender. Douglas refused to fight with a woman in the ring. And Rodriguez is obsessed with her fascinating viewpoint. It will be happy. <br /> I really do not expect much from the movie. As long as I realized I was released this year, I thought Clint Eastwood's "million dollar baby" was a split. I never heard of the director or exhibitors. That kind of opacity usually hurts for television and so forth. <br /> <br /> But I was amazed at how well this was done. The complete lack of bows opened to me. Such frightened ropes, blood, swelling, damaged post-boxing faces, "kill him!" Shaking the bacterial clocks, slow motion land nozzle, spray of sweat from the head of moult, the long-awaited godliness of the winner's signaling heroic music. No one here - well, almost none. The entire plot is considered principle. <br /> <br /> It's probably pretty much like you're feeling like you're staying in these enthusiastic tournaments. We are different from those on TV and in regular films. For example, a dancing and observer referee "Stop!" And "box!" Competitors wear head gear. In the gym, the audience is not by the audience, but some people have some interest. <br /> <br /> Michel Rodriguez shines his muscle group and her eyes underneath the lower forehead, but once you use this girl is a girl who can hit the pulp when she ever wants, and after hearing the feminine forms of her supermangents, she is not bad. (She exceeds a scene where her father is struggling on the floor.) It was hard for Rodriguez to understand Douglas's temper when crawling over him. <br /> <br /> Director, Kareena Kusama carefully selected his talent. <br /> You can show what you can do with some talent, imagination, and money. It must have more movies. Take one of the multi-billion dollar blockbusters filled with dinosaurs or space ships and spread around a little bit of generosity.
