The sniper will give a real new meaning to the war. I recall movies about Vietnam or WWII, fired, and everyone is dying, Bam Bam. The "sniper" takes on a new level or refinement war. The film is absolutely intended for all the emotions - humor of humans in the wild, hate between Beckett and Miller and finally reliability and rush of moment when they remove the trigger. The seemingly low budget movie action, with every mistake with suspense and thrill, because when it comes down, it's one shot and one will kill.
