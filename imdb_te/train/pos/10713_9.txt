An angry boy who was sadly lost to his parents saw his grandfather. In the Galician fairy tales, they move together from the islanders of the generation. Despite the tragic groups like Hollywood clearer and story traits, there are surprising humor and happiness. It is all shot in the sky, so there is a double dose of beauty. Mountain scene is breathtaking, it's a rare opportunity to hear Scottish Gaelic speaking. I'm in English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of the spoken Gaelic is wonderful. The performances are just what you choose carefully but expect from the actors - in other words, you are seeing the real thing - people who are deeply concerned about Gaelic folk and history. Gaelic community, especially in the Sky, has worked on countless little wonders to make this film. Those who have little interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multi-cultural or social justice should watch this movie.
