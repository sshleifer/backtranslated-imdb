I saw the babysitter on BCI Eclipse 'Disc-In Cult Classics (Crown International Pictures Releases) DVD. <br /> <br /> The story of the film takes very little time. You have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual impropriety, blackmail and all murders, all in one place! <br /> <br /> Main actors do a loyal job. <br /> <br /> When an assistant cast, primarily bikers, asks you to give me more lines than some words. Perhaps they used realistic bikers, instead of actors. Particularly some characters are specifically believable. <br /> <br /> The musical story, times, tempo, and story are clearly noted for moving forward. I found a real treat of music. In the early credits I found the music of the film "The Food". <br /> <br /> However, George E. Cary, who wrote and starred in this movie, liked this idea (trails and tribulation, and, of course, a little help - and of course) he wrote, produced and acted "Weekend with the Babysitter."
