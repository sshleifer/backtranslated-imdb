I work in a movie shop, and such, I'm always on lookout for a wonderful movie. I have decided to check Nothing because I am sitting in our Canadian section, and I try to support my country's film industry. I'm surprised. In this movie, David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are in a very entertaining story, with deep emphasis on our minds and relationships ... without that work. It is constantly joked by two characters interaction, as well as some funny exchanges ("We Can not Die, Have a Cable!"). Even if you leave within the first half of the day, I can not say it's worth a shot.
