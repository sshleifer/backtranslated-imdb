This unpretentious old serial of how friendly, lovely and hearty; I was happy to see the old Lugoshi. It is disarming friendly and agile. This is a long-lost craft document. (Today's best TV series does not compete with these old mediocre good serials). Chandu is deeply, deeply positive and pleasurable. It refreshes the mind. It's not stupid; Those who do not get the provisions of such serials are stupid. Chand is a magician wizard who goes with this eastern name and loves his niece <br /> <br /> Chandu meets his superhuman gifts rather than intelligent and moderate. <br /> <br /> Like a very sexy niece, Nazi, the kidnapped priest of her Ubuntu: Vicious Vindhyan. A poor sexy girl was actually kidnapped in a coffin after sending a flower to sleep; Almost kidnapped from the boat; The Lemuria Temple and its strange, creepy celebrations by a fraudulent police reflect King Kango imagery and the racist jokes of RCC celebrations and rituals. <br /> <br /> "He is an experimental drunken uncle, unfortunate and fraudulent and sloppy, not a very distorted maneuver for luxosis, yet Burton's biopic Wood gave me this opinion about the lounge and the weakness is with the strong sympathy of the actor. <br /> <br /> The serial is unfair.
