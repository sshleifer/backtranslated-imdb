Neil Simon's Sunshine Boys' Life featuring Walter Matthau and George Burns is a funny comedy with strange Bond, but laughter is always bitter taste. You can only feel angry and blue for two great theater comedy actors, now known as Willie Clarke and All Lewis (Burns), are now reduced to a mental illness from a hard and endless age. Will never surrendered and did not continue to watch the job, he was tired of all the players and he retired to his daughter in the country home. The couple in his old time is really funny and harmony, but the scene continues to be a controversy and quarrel, and their broken eleven years later they can not talk in between. Now if they work, the Comedy Story should reunite with one of his best old sketches for one of the TV show. Meetings explode and give free answers to older questions. Neil Simon's writing story narrates a certain corrosive spirit and melancholy a gorgeous mix of gags and a lot of blue overwhelming and even a great couple Walter Matthu (nomination Academy Award for Best Actor) and George Burns climbed to produce (Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor to win). The two actors are very natural and true and they work real time together and their reality seems almost like their realty as they can not bear between them. Its all-consuming truth of the film as the story is also very touching and captures the two actors Report Love Heat is completely real part strange life Strange things are generally comprehensive but at the same time. My rate 7.
