I dug some old songs from my old garage and this is one of my favorites. It was written by Jay Allen Lerner and directed by Vincent Minne. It won 1951 and two Academy Awards for Best Screenplay's Best Picture. An American painter in Paris tries to make it big. Nina Foch is a sophisticated woman who has a lot of interest in helping her, but soon finds herself a loved one. Meanwhile Jean Kelly comes for the lovely girl Leslie Caron. His main dance partner, and they must say on the ground and they are wonderful together. The famous French singer Georges Gutari also sang. If you have good soft dance and fun filled scenes filled with Oscar Levant's pivotal piano fingers, George Gershwin's songs are permanently inhabited in this colorful gem. 8/10
