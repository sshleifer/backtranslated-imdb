Ecstasy's alternate title, Symphony of Love; A title that aptly describes the mood and feel of the image. The ecstasy is an early talkie, and maybe even a classic film if quiet silence is released. The film is visual treat, and deliberately displayed, so the viewer is happy with its majestic song quality, which is displayed in artistic low-key style. Director's style is clearly European. The subject matter and the method of sexuality are much more advanced than the time it was produced in Hollywood. Consider the censorship code in the US, and in the 30s, it will provide much. Heidi Lamar, one of the greatest of all, is the right choice for this 'Symphony of Love'.
