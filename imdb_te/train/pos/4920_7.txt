No, not really, but this is a very good movie indeed, and sadly there is a forgotten gem. <br /> <br /> Straight forward formula, a person has a plague and the authorities have to recognize everybody who comes in contact with before they die. <br /> <br /> It is great to act and act well. Richard Widmark is the most prominent, but Paul Douglas is the captain of the police, and Jack is in full shade in acting bets which are acting as jalpes (not much better) and Zero Mastel Badies. Sadly the Palace went to play characters similar to some really second-rate gangster or war movies.
