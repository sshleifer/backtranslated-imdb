An almost complete film takes place in an outdoor bathroom in China. <br /> <br /> When a father believes that his father is dying, he returns home. Only fancy sets, explosion or glamorous people - good writing, acting and directing (Hollywood, note!). He looks daddy looks fine and is shocked to go about running family business as usual. In fact, he notices that his father and his retarded brother are really fake and caring is fake and it becomes clear that he is from the loop right away! Dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from a big city and does not really see the value of the old bathroom. <br /> <br /> Every Chinese movie is an action movie (jet lee or crouching tiger), dragon), I do not particularly care about these frantic movies. Two amazing examples for good Chinese movies about Shower and Spreadtime in a Small Town People!
