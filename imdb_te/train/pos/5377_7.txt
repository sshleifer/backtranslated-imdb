"The College Girl Murders" was my first acquaintance with Edgar Wallace? And is generally my first real introduction to "Krami" movies ?? And I can say I am impressed. This thing is really fun, though I can not imagine it ever? Goofy! The film has a fun and neat shiny plot with humor, gusto twists and beautifully invented murders. Is there a type of James Bond type of evil conductor? Who always sit in the shade and in front of a large monitor - a new type poisoning prisoners recruiting to kill some girls at a particular college. Communist KKK also has a tremendous monk with a dress wearing a member, an extraordinary police commissioner who continues to tackle the excessive curious teachers and the remnant roles, as well as to solve the case of psychological policy. Seriously, if I knew beforehand that these sequences were very colorful and silly, I'd already buy their entire collection. Pretzel's plot actually raises more questions than answers in the end and the overload of the humorous gimmicks in Scotland Yard Inspector Higgins' account is a little overwhelming sometimes, but I do not care because it's exciting. Even the funky 60 soundtrack period stuck in my head. It is like a variant on Italian Giovole, but with slapstick elements.
