A well-made mill image with tragic end. Pluses: The story moves the way - he begins struggling to survive after a long flashback about why Soorya begins. Music. A baseless look in the life of the police. Minus: violence and gore, but I guess they add realistic effects. Nevertheless, people's heads were torn apart, without boxes and socks. <br /> <br /> There are no complaints - 7/10
