The most striking American title for the best French film "Le Mouton Auregaz" (that is, I mean dubbin sheep) - the original film, which dates back to 1974, is more astounding. This movie is very much ahead of its time; It also fulfills great and new-looking subjects by today's highest standards. It depicts an explanation of the heavily blended director Michael Deville's explanation that completely combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire with a complete mix of satire - all of a sudden before it is sad and more to understand. The cast is awesome, with writing and background. But Daveville's tasty tone, constantly retaining the off-balance but enrapte, pushes this "lost" film to really high levels. (If you have time, the interview with the director in the "Special Features" section of the DVD is definitely worth reading).
