This film is just funny. Foolish but funny. To enjoy this film you will not be aware of how this film goes and enjoy jokes and pusses on the side all that are associated with the movie. I'll still find a bit of funny start when he says "boy want to be ........ cock". Funny stuff. But the film is really good that it's not very difficult to create good spin in this movie. But this is different and focuses on being funny. I must say, Yasmin Bleet is terrible in the film and the 3 main characters, Cooper, Reamer and Scucco are great and are awesome to see
