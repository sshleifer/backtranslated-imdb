Johnny Dangeoli is totally disgusted in the hit or miss category, which drops completely with its well-blown dresses and lack of any comprehensive script or story. <br /> The cast is fair; Michael Keaton has passed years of an incredible comedian before he took too seriously. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopa, Marie Hannah and Danny Davids all the enthusiasm and at least laugh from me. <br /> <br /> Here full scene stolen Richard Dmitry (the term "iceholes" in the history of film) is better spent in murdering English. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Johnny Dangerousley is at least an entirely innocent gangster movie spoof, which transmits some well-known messages about the dangers of smoking (and sexuality). <br /> I like it but it's hard to recommend. <br /> <br> 10 to 7.
