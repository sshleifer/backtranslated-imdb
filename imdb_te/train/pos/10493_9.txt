The movie promotes either financially or emotionally, tough jam or anyone. You definitely laugh, this is the best medicine! :) When her husband dies in a bad financial situation, Grace finds a new way to earn some money and is not exactly legitimate for humor. Even my boyfriend likes not to think that it is a chic-flic.
