Adorable! I saw domestic import in Philli with my children in October. A second time with my parents. I smiled them over the years! It is the first time my parents and my kids remember seeing a movie that they enjoy. It's really cute and we can not wait when it comes on DVD. They have to do more movies like domestic import. It refreshes to go to a movie that can be enjoyed by three different generations (and not be embarrassing). I did not see this movie from my big fat Greek Wedding. I love Mindy Sterling as a mother. She is also in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also in this and he is hilarious. I remember him from WKRP.
