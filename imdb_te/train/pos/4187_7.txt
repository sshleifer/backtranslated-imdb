This is a pretty good example for the film Noir. The 50th century began with Communists trying to steal secrets from the US government. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a happiest picette without unfortunately. He gave a pretty good performance but there was no A-list about him. Interestingly, he is not an anti-hero but a lot of film, a different anti-hero. It's not very simple. Jean Peters gave a lot of performance as a prostitute with a golden heart. The great character actress Thelma Ritter shines as a pigeon. <br /> <br /> The plot has a fair share of turns and turns, voicecocks and rough discussion. There is a frustrating scene at the end of the pretty awkward and exciting movie (at the subway station). <br /> <br /> I think the Nair fans (like me) will enjoy this film. For Non-Noir audiences, it will be for some time and may be the entire Tommy vote tone overdraft.
