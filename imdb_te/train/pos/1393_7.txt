Perhaps the first weird season of the first season, 'Shore Leave' has its ups and downs; Some episodes are dragged down for a long time and others are definitely cut short, but one can not deny they threw in everything but the proverb kitchen sink to make this entertaining episode. Kirk and crew will find the perfect planet for the holiday vacation after the extended trip to rest on the rest, rest and rest on the board on the rest. It is an uninhabited land, beautiful scenery and ideal atmosphere for all sights and purposes. When McCoy led a predecessor, Alice (from Wonderland) was the first hint that things were hiding after wearing a big white rabbit shirt. Kirk rays finds down and others have reported similarly bizarre events and encounters. One thing that they are common is that every crew is thinking about the person / place / thing they found before they find it. This is not immediately Kirk or anyone drowning. Don Juan, a Siberian tiger, WW2 fighter, etc. are more exciting; Kirk Ruth, a gorgeous old girlfriend (of course) and his academy days, meets a punt from Finnegan. The Finnegan Chase / Fight sequence will last long, but at the same time, McCoy runs a horse on horseback and apparently killed. Finally, an old man sees and explains what happens. The planet is a futuristic 'amusement park, where visitors have the imagination of something. Nothing is permanent; McCoy really did not die. After describing it, Kirk decides to order Shore Vacation after all. The ending end was 'all dream', and 'shore leave' was another first-rate episode of Star Trek's first season.
