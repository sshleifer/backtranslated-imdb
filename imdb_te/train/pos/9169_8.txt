I liked Timothy Dalton as a bit too young and very beautiful for Mr. Ar, but I liked it, but Gela Clarke was very plump and small. But this version is very truthful and well illustrated by the novel. George C. Scott did very well and it was toss between Jon Fontaine and Susanna York, although Orson Wells is still my favorite Mr. R, which has 4 versions. I recently saw Rebecca's amazing TV version with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I love to see those two Jane Irr. By the time I saw Ciran Hunt's version, I thought it was Jane Arrid, but the first version I saw was heard by Jon Fontaine's voice to hear that first few minutes. I always want to go back and read the book again.
