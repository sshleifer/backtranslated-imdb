<br /> <br /> There is a story about a little girl growing up in California, California, but much more than that. <br /> <br /> Anyone growing up in the south will enjoy the same things. The desire of a different breed, it will not be completed. Also prohibited at a glance. No words are required. <br /> This is the story of the black waitress, Prattie (Ishach de Bongle) and the white woman, Aime (Giulia Boshi). <br /> <br /> The little girl spends her time with a lonely and prettier of France (Cecile Ducassy). I really can not see this dance. <br /> <br /> The more frustrating elements of this film are the laziness of the colonies. They can not get clothes for the bed themselves. The world ends there; They do not know yet. <br /> <br /> These racist attitudes will be deprived of their existence. <br /> I would like to visit this Africa. It's very quiet; Especially when you hear animals during the night.
