One of John's funniest, Eugene Levy is this as well as great, Just wish the studio wants to figure out whether this one should be on the DVD, I feel in the video tape, but feel this movie deserves the DVD (and the extra will be great) Kung Fu University (Kung Fu U ) Skitt is very funny, the whole movie, the scenes with his girlfriend and her family Nai, this movie does not seem to be in the TV, but it loses so much when it's edited to the TV on the TV, if you find a video I'll suggest you buy it (eBay is a good place to find a copy) I keep my VHS up to a day on DVD . There are still so many great films that are not yet released to DVD and are one of them.
