We're here and there's probably no fun but it's still entertaining and entertaining and entertaining, and in everything you do everything you want to make a film of this nature. I mainly saw the film because John Dal was the director of the lowest estimate behind the great thrillers like The Lost Seduction, Rounders and Rodley. If the film I've seen from the director is authentic, it would be well worth it - and Red Rock West is definitely the movie proud of the doll. This plot focuses on overly moral Michael; The person traveling across America looking for work. When he slid on a bar in Red Rock County, he ends up finding one day - only to kill a man's wife. He was mistaken for a killer named Laiay, but instead doing the job; He plays on both sides against each other and ultimately attempts to escape. However, attempts at escape failed and he was in bad condition when the real lail was changed. <br /> <br /> John Dal has enjoyed creating thrillers on the road; He did three years ago with Kill Me Again, who returned with a road for nearly a decade. It's not difficult to see why this chooses this sort of doll position, as it delivers a fantastic atmosphere for a thriller with a likes. Dahl mainly provided his character with the film 'Noir Noir', because the story focuses primarily on the central character, and his term is filled with dark and mysterious characters. The performance was good, Nicolas Cage made a great job in the lead role and Lara Flynn Boyle, J.T. Walsh and, of course, Dennis Hopper; Once again on the screen. It should be said that the second half of the film is not like the first grip, but the Red Rock West is not exactly boring and the dull stays sloping, with some of the main characters playing. Overall, Red Rock West is a movie you do not have the opportunity to regret seeing. It's thrilling throughout, and do not ask for more than you!
