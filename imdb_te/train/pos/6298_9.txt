So much happiness. I have gone to 8 friends with a sneak preview view of the film. We came to see something but the jokes were funny after 10 minutes of what we did at this time and they lived funny throughout the movie. In the first part you are asking yourself about these 'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff (there are many examples of this lingo) and they get ridiculous and funnier because they repeat the same jokes (with different turns). All major characters in search for these malinski are introduced to the first one even wackier than the next. Until half of the film we do not even know the name of the movie because there are no early credits and we have gone to this sneak view, but we have definitely got a good time. The house was loaded (about 250 people) and half of them did not like it and the other half liked the film. If you like the fantastic comic images with great dialogue you will like it. The film, rather than Clooney, is better than the IMDB rating of 5.6, which is in the time I write, but since most PPL has seen it, I'm sure where it will go. 7.0 I guess, I'll give it to 10 to 8. (Some beers are 10 after 10)
