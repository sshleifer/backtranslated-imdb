The film is beyond comprehension, which remains my favorite film, which has reached almost 157 minutes of almost every emotion. The hardest part I should take is that I listened to the wonderful music and songs from the movie and put it in my DVD player so that anyone who sings songs in the movie knows where and where they look from, where I've seen everywhere, and in the last 5 years, My favorite quote when the lawyer told me in the courtroom, "But can your own words ask for a direct fight, not a live call to violence?" Biko replies "You and I have now come, but I do not see any violence !!" <br /> <br /> CRAIG Robertson Fife, Scotland
