I enjoyed this film a lot and I have seen it twice and there is something to say about a documentary. The musical theme, cinematography and sound are awesome as you would expect from an imax product. Even though those heavy imax are filmed for theaters, it looks and sounds amazing in my home system. In fact it will make the DVD a perfect DVD for your system. <br /> The subject itself is lovely. It's about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I'm already a fan of Mario because he is the best racing card in history because he is the only person to win the championship, the F1 championship, the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script is a very important way for both cars and father and son. The first car was found in the chicken coop and Mario became the first roadway ever to go, and we would follow the restoration as we glow perfectly. We will follow another car in Michael's new racecard and cut the mold in the race season. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, the owner of the Michael Amateur team, describes the film when it was produced. His stories and vattismism, which have long been the owner and driver, benefit most of the production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is race scenes. Turn the volume here! There is something about a musical score that is completely combined to the screen for over 200 miles of riding and an unforgettable experience. <br /> <br /> The last magical topic is the humanity of the Androtti family. God of racing world, Mario Andretti, is a beloved father who is proud of his son's career. They work well together every father and son should see this. You can say that they are a very close family. I want all of us to have that experience.
