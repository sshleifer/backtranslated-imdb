The ancient collection of stories throws a challenge to the production team, how to get this classic character fresh and how interesting it is to capture new audiences while confusing memories from her previous audience. In my opinion, their mission is accomplished. Must see for younger kids, former teens, teens and their parents. There are a couple scary moments fixed in the correct order, but parents should sit tight with little kids, and the movie moves to good things. I'm going to go with those mini-consumer reviewers who point out that Emma Roberts has provided us with a positive role model for young women, not about syrups. Nancy will balance her femininity with career mind praiseing skills. Nancy Drew makes a good date picture in my opinion so many smiles like that, very seriously, true mystery (one extra bonus, and the favorite characters you can discover).
