An image of an animated kid that does not hate all dogs to Heaven. Gambling, alcoholism, death, pistols and hell are all prominent, and kids get a lot less, and why the adults hold their heads strongly regard this movie as a gangster movie. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player with a half casino with his partner, a dog, a carpenter (wick tebak). After drinking (a dog .... drunk ... it looks just weird in a child's picture), Charlie Carfax is deceived and killed. While in Heaven, he finds a way to return to Earth, but he is no longer allowed in heaven. He still goes back to the ground and meets with his old friend Itchi (Dom Deluus) and plans for a revival in CarFax. Meanwhile, CarFax is a fantastic ability to talk to all the species of animals, which help predict species because Anne Mary is a hostile little girl. Charlie and Itchy leave her and try to help her find a family in learning more about them. <br /> <br /> The film will appeal to both Disney and some children and adults. The kids are delighted with funny characters and lively animation, adults will enjoy more than nice, sweet plots, and general development characters. One thing that puts this below, is that it is a musical. In general, it's a good thing, but here the music is honestly terrible. They postpone, almost postponed, and any instrument being adjourned. In fact, this is the worst songs I've probably heard in an animated film, but fortunately, the rest picture is strong enough to decline because of some bad notes. <br /> <br /> The end of this film works, but I honestly hate it. It is sad, but happy, but sadly worried, and makes the movie feel like it's a sequel. Looking at how good this sequel is good, the final thing is that the sequel is not ending, it ends with a good, super happy ending. <br /> <br /> Overall, these weird themes, Basic themes thrown out, however, good entertainment. <br /> My rating: *** Out of ****. 85 minutes.
