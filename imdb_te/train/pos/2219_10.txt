The film is attractive in the Creole culture and society of some African Americans. My own two children are through a paternal grandmother's products, whose father is a member of Guns De Kauyou Libre and a black skin, whose parents are former slaves. He married outside his culture and left all his family, except one sister who suffered his brothers' plight; 8 children in the Great Depression in 1929; She was offered whenever she could make food with her family. However, she was secretly assisted by the family fearing her former communications. My daughter was impressed by this film. We've made a part of our library.
