The legend of the dragon is one of the lesser-less or less of the games. Since it is intended to be Sony's equivalent of Final Fantasy, it is for other games that are quite similar to the Final Fantasy series. I honestly can not comment on the similarities I'm not familiar with FF games, <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of the game is the fighter system. You have the ability to change the shape of a more powerful dragon, but if you attack each time, you should be careful to complete the attack by pressing the buttons at the right time. In addition, sometimes the enemies are attacked in the middle of the line, that is, you have to press different buttons to prevent damage. The use of certain attacking elements also requires a bit of button-mashing. <br /> If you do not want to attack, it reduces damage in half, but only increases your hit points without the use of medicated drinks. <br /> <br /> FMVs are very well- about the same quality as Final Fantasy 8. However, the graphics during the game are not quite standard. They are good, but they were - and honestly, to be - good. The translation leaves something as well. It only raises questions about the role of an interesting character, but some grammatical errors are not allowed to pass. <br /> What I find interesting is that you lose major party roles - one dies, while others will be useful for the party and the leaves mainly. When the death of a character says that there is often no point, it first learns about those characters, but the heroes still remain morally as the next person. People who replace lost characters simply gain all their statistics, so the transition is very smooth with playing the game. Perhaps my complaint about the characters was the interest of the main character's love, Shana. To despair is a woman's essence of helplessness that needs to be forgiven and protected from a player's driving point. When you use her in your party, she is very weak - I do not even know how she has dragon forces, even if I never liked her. In contrast to the character, Rose probably is probably my favorite female character in any game. She does not have any vamp, and some of her dragon magic is very useful. <br /> <br /> For character designers, many have been motivated to make women's characters appear pretty or sophisticated, and have not come up with a lot of idea until the actual use of clothing. Seriously, having a lot of armor and your skin does not help when fighting the monsters. <br /> The truth is, I did not pay much attention to it. I can not comment on plots too. I needed to go next. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I said something about this storyline or my gaming style. <br /> <br /> More than anything, it is a very delightful game. It has its flaws, but it struck just the right balance that I had to think of it and just pressing buttons and killing monsters.
