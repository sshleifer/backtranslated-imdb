It is one of the best concerts. I grew up when all my Lovin 'brand new and today's artist is the measure of the strength of any group spells Sir P Mack at any age to hear it again today. This doco goes back to the scene to show life on the road, not for the band, not everyone down roadside. I personally saw this guy Aussie in 1975 and its performance on the DVD is less than 30 years ago. I have this 5.1 Surround Sound System, this will do justice and I recommend this particular Beatles fan. Today you can reach the Beatles concert. Singer, songwriter, lead / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. There are a few actors who can stand alone with one instrument and hold the audience in his hand. If you want to watch the perfect music, buy a studio record CD. If you want to listen to raw music with audiences' intent and enthusiasm and inspiration for all the audience, this DVD is for you.
