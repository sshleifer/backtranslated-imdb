This episode is ridiculous I've seen in a long time. The South Park creators have exploited the best of a Romero movie I have ever seen. They really touched on Romero's underlying social commentary made by one of his movies. I want to know what George Romero's opinion is in this episode, I'm totally positive! Putting his true attention to his zombie myths is completely intact! Romero deals with a pure gore with a lot of spoof deal without having a viewer when trying to do it with his films. If I did not spread a zombie this part was shown if we could really worry about our property values ​​before our lives!
