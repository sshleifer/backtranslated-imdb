I can not believe that others have taken such a serious view. God, it is a lot of rooting for the hop-a-tall cassidy. It was a great tribute to Western serials years ago. It is not a great movie experience except that. So what if a big special effects are not booming. It's a fun, cheek-in tongue, look of old westerns. Man, relax and have fun.
