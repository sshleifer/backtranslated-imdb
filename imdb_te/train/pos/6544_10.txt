I really liked this movie! This is not the classic Nancy Drew style of any of the books. I have seen many advertisements for this film and I have really high expectations for the film because they are really in Nancy Drew books and they are most definitely met those expectations. Pretty much all the letters are how I paint the books from reading. I saw this movie and I am very happy. Actors and actresses who have appeared in the book series have really acted. Since I saw this movie, I would like to read every Nancy Drew book there. Actors and actresses have really entered their roles and it certainly shows when the film is screened on the big screen. It certainly seemed like the characters and actresses were really in those positions that I would definitely give this film 10 to 10 out of 10.
