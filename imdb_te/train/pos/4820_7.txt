What else can you say? With Cate Blanchett exploding on the scene ten years ago, I was attracted to this young man. <br /> <br /> Although Blanchett and Blunt have played two Queen's characters (up and on the benchmark for actresses), the characters are completely polarized. <br /> <br /> You are the most passionate, compelling play, and Machiavellian conspiracy, which is not the image for you. Not to say that the script or direction is not bad, the film's theme did not dramatically lead to other leading royals such as Elizabeth I, Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII, Henry VI, Henry II and Eliten's ElineR. They have a good soap opera whose policies and decisions have changed in British, and in many cases, changes in world history. In contrast to Victoria, the throne climbs without incident, as the globalization of the industrialization and the rise of the Navy became her global power, where she had a steady government led by competent and dynamic politicians in the state and a married family with whom she had been married. <br /> <br /> She is a dramatic attempt at the cultures that surround her throne, the heart of the film, not the truth of her life. It's really awesome and a story that's surprising about her reign - love story. The marriage made for financial or political reasons is not a reason to shake the sins of the world, but Victoria always remembers the history, a patron saint marital reliability, happiness and an ideal family life. Hence, the film is in love with Central Victoria and her Prince Albert. I played Albert's Rupert Friend, who portrayed him as a kind, patient, somewhat rigid and perhaps a touchless childless young man, "looking good and helping the world." In short, he is a good man with a good heart, not the most powerful person to build a play around, not the story's location, it does not matter. The heart of this character thanks to the poor and majestic performance of friends. <br /> <br /> For the Queen, Well .. Ellie Blunt is amazing. Her beauty is not denied, but she is more than pretty looking; Her face is like quixilower of her expression. The slightest inclination of the eyebrows, the eye or the slight smile offers a lot of smile. Again, this is not a benign display of heavy speeches and passionate requests, it's not that kind of image. But what Mrs. Blunt is doing with this role shows the general human character of the character with a powerful subtlety. <br /> <br /> For example, Victoria's mother (Miranda Richardson) and Joey Di Vivere, who is inscribed by her conspirator's counselor / lover Conroy, expresses her little things like Victoria. She is the first to see her happiness and attractiveness by attracting her eyes from time to time. When she talks to Parliament on her ascension she will see her nervous and indecisive. And all my favorite scene - she finds her nervous, cheerful, and hopeful. She steals she really does not want to do too much women in their life- she asks a man who loves her marriage, at a ludicrous time (and some say) "Nervous smile breaks before you say. <br /> Again, this is not a movie that is bigger than life expressions, but more on the subtleties of a character and a lot of small things. <br /> <br /> Overall, what the film does and what it is trying to do and I give it to it. I thought it was good in some of the politics and some of the good actors were small characters and minor character development, such as Miranda Richardson Duchess of Kent, and Conroy Lord Peel roles. The film did not spend much time on the characters again, but it was more likely to explain the political atmosphere. And I like to adjust to the wedding life of Victoria and Albert, but it can be my greed for more scenes between friend and blunt. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you do not see the film in terms of a historical drama, it is true that the love story between the two characters in historical figures. I gave this film a magnificent magnificent performance, superb costumes and scenery and Emily Blunt's Victoria Victoria's magnificent 7. And for anyone with romantic feelings in them, if you touch the end of the film. God will save the queen.
