On paper, this movie feels very boring. The idea of ​​a 75-year-old man who is traveling towards the country on a riding mower certainly does not appeal too much, but the true power behind the image is its charm and its intelligence. <br /> <br /> This perfect example is a scene where Allin meets a runaway teenage girl. She feared she was pregnant and discovered what her parents did. Avevine tells her story about her own children long ago. He breaks each of them with a stick and makes it easier. Then he tries to break them and break them down. "That bundle," he said, "is the family." We know that a lot of other movies will continue, but we know that a person can break, but the members are strong. <br /> <br /> "Straight Story" is the way we understand this meaning, and goes away with us to meditate on our thinking and make our own decisions. <br /> <br /> Alvin's journey across Iowa is such a refreshing un-Hollywood character interaction. Each interaction is filled with warmth and humor, and we can not help Alvin with his companion Lyle, along with his brother Lyle to Viscountins, but smile is lovely. The simplicity to the final scene is that the true story here is not a destination but a journey. Alvin is a traveler who shares his life with everyone he met - their purpose and ours. This is a slow, easy, relaxing ride that we have to remember about what we lost with the city's urbanization. <br /> <br /> "Straight Story" Rare live-action "G" really should not go wrong. Grade: A.
