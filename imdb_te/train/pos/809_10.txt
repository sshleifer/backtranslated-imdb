Very good picture. Humor, action and everything is a classic science fiction film. This film offers a large number of foreigners. We saw the Rebel Alliance leaders and most of the Imperial troops. The emperor is somewhat the original character. I suggested Evox to indigenous savages and Vietnamese. (Fantastic hints) is the best of the saga which I loved the duel between Wader and Luke. The return of the first trilogy of the Return of the Jedi ended and the end of the Empire. Weader's redemption is fulfilled and Yokoda and Obi-van accompany Akkin to Skywalker's inspiration. It gives a pain and tears. The film features great scenes in Star Wars: Wonder on Emperor. Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (1997 version Hayden Kristensen) finds and watches on the Luke. The next best scenario is when Luke rotates Darth Vader to rescue Leah. Despite a good ending, the film's deep dark side. I thought the eye was more than me. And Always John William's music brings classic into the Star Wars universe.
