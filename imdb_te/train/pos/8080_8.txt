Well, I used to read comments about these movies that did not reflect my experience. Amitab is a better villain than some of his most famous films. He is a die hard villain, no apologetic villain. <br /> <br /> There is a breath of fresh air to see him in the role of his villainy in some kind of disillusioned character. <br /> <br /> The kid who played Aryan in this movie is probably his cast. The director may have done better. But, to be honest, the best part of the film is Shinraj Patel. She is a glamorous heroine, a true veteran tribe who has been over-qualified for every role she gave. But I appreciated her role as I played Virendra Sai's wife. She can give a little bit to do, but she does everything with confidence. <br /> <br /> If you are familiar with settling for Bollywood average, you will not get much from this film. But if you constantly search for more, you give them what you missed.
