I feel better about this film Mike Hammer, Bef Elliott's performance with Mike Hammer. The Harry Essex script is fantastic and has many improvements in the novel of Mickey Spillen. His direction is strong and imaginative, he uses light and shade well. The camera work by John Alton is top-notch, Franz Waxman score. This cast includes many celebrities such as Charlotte Manning, as well as her memorable performance at Peggy Castle. Overall, this is one of the best films ever made. Beef Elliott and Harry Essex were able to get more opportunities. I always celebrated this film.
