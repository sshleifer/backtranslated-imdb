Tim Krabbe is the two acclaimed author of 'Hate Gouden E', which is placed on the screen twice ('Spurlos' and 'The Vanishing'). One of the recent Dutch writers was Dee Grouth, a mental thriller, two different men, Egon and Axel, joining the youth camp and getting enough surprise for a loved one. Egon is a quiet, somewhat dull man, who spends his time studying and writing geographical books. Axel, on the other hand, attractive 'party-animal', heavy alcoholic criminals, her daily anxiety, getting a woman in her bedroom. From the moment they met, Axel has a strong influence on Egon, and the latter is jealous because he has a good life without doing anything good (such as reading thick books like Egon); Eventually, Egon also takes him into illegal practices, leading to lethal drug trafficking in the distant Asian country. <br /> <br /> After reading this book last year, critics are very positive about it. In my opinion, the book suffers from a particularly complicated structure. Cabbay refers to this story about the rare relationship between the two people, the plot becomes more of a puzzle: many episodes are not presented in chronological order, so the two sequences are rare in the same episode. Because of this, this story is surprisingly remote: you often need to know the background of the character that he or she care about. Another complaint is the main characters, Igon and Axel, a little stereotypical reality. Egon IS 'the' dull intellectual, but Axel is in its exact opposite. In real life, such a dimensional people rarely exist; <br /> <br /> More than anything, this film is much better than the book. Its beautiful cinematography, humor and adaptation is very high: Fedja von Hueet (Eagon) is one of the few Dutch actors who can forget his performance (in my opinion, the highest actor). However, the flaws of the film are similar to the book: because characters are a dimensional, they can not imagine suffering. Guess who wrote the script is actually, Crabs himself. This talented director (however, this picture is obviously clear) is damaged by the screenplay with an error. <br /> <br /> You should choose a good book for Coolheaven. <br /> <br />
