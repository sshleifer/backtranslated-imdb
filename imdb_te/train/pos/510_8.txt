I have seen it for the first time - the imagination of the films, and I forgot how much the film was so intriguing. <br /> <br /> Anybody interested in politics or history may like offhand references of the film - but I forgot the scenes in the Candlelight Club in the Waterloo Bridge. Those interested in love will be moved by Hunter-Nevin and enjoy the description of survival for anyone who loves visual imagery. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie is at the same time as "Odd Man Out" and this one is amazing. <br /> <br />
