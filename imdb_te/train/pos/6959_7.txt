Well, this is the movie Ivan Reidman. With rare exceptions, Ivan likes to entertain. His films are not usually "deep", but they are often entertaining. My Super X-Girlfriend surprised me. Uma Thurman is just grandma, and I love her pictures. I also like Luke Wilson, and Rain Wilson is a simple owl. If you do not take it seriously, the film is topped and it's not very special yet, or no one has gone before .... It's a good rental but probably the date picture, especially if you do not like headaches and your brain distracting. It's fun to escape and there is nothing wrong with it. When you remove "super-girl" stuff, you're missing out on story and bad relationships. It meets the boy, the boy leaves the thing. In the end, the characters are looking for love. They were both "dumped" and as much as they could ... a piece of life with a twist.
