This video is my first exposure to Eddie Izzard. We have many friends for one night and channel surf to HBO for some reason or evening. Someone is named "Eddie Izzard". The first few jokes do not laugh too loudly. I did not want to take "responsibility" for the rest of the fun of the thing that killed me. When I was healthy in my laughter, I walked away - like others (we did not talk about insurance and pensions ...). We breathed after that. The plot lines, plot, bizarre and ingenious connections across the sketches are low on illumination. I am a slave to every Eddie-Ezard-piece-comedy, I can get my hands. His work is very intellectual. His comedy appears to be effortless. He seems more and more funny boyfriend that hanging in your home and talking about this or that ... it's convulsively funny. He gives you the impression that the joke is between you .. and himself, only true fans of humor, after all. If you are disappointed in this video, you do not have any sense of humor - or humor as they say in the UK.
