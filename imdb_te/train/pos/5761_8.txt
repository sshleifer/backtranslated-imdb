I complained that the zombie had twice been killed, and kept coming back. I gave the film 8. Let's look forward to this, and other reviewers, such as "hang-com", is a shot movie. Hi, Hey, Hey, welcome to making the whole indie motion picture. Todd Sheets has more than 700 tracks to star in the film, offering tribute to his talent. Yes, the story has gaps, yeah, we see again the same zombies, but who really cares? What it does, it's a fun and gheri horror movie, share your buds, or take it out of the gross out people you really care about. With the people of Mall, I thought you all liked the worst hunt like "Titanic" or "Twister". Peace, and Support Independent Film Making !!!
