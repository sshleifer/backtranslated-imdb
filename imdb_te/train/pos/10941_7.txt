Sarah Silvanmann was horrified at me at first thought she had her own appearance. Her films are not so much fun and she has a little bit of humor. However, I was very surprised that she would shine in true colors in this comedy central gem. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Support a fall cast of this show. The role of her sister is good; Sometimes funny, but ultimately not to steal Sarah's appearance. However, the remaining cast is quite sub-par. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p>
