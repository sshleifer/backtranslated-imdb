I saw this film when I was 6 or 7 years old in theaters. I enjoyed it and recently have a VHS version. <br /> <br /> The kids of my 4 and 6 years love this movie and are asking again and again to watch. <br /> I enjoyed watching again. <br /> I do not know what I think about it because I have no big children. <br /> The songs are very beautiful. <br /> My daughter keeps singing them.
