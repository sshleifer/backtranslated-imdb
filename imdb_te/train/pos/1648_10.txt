This is one of the best films ever made. This is a realistic description of the life of rural ranches, the largest part of American history. This setting has not changed life since the early century of 1906 Wyoming. The film retains your interest without Hollywood myths. The whole family can see this film and is most surprised about how life in America lives in rural country. With this film, you are escaped 100 years old and will witness everyday life. In a beautiful and picturesque environment you will see the hard physical work required for survival, as well as market pressures that cause constant fears and concerns of elements and the difference between success or failure. For most of our country's history see this film and experience life. It is worth your time to watch this movie. My only question - why do not more movies like this?
