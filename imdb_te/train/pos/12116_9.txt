... Betty Davis version of the film is better than Kim Novak's version. <br /> <br /> I really like the Betty Davis version, but I feel that Davis Mildred is a better offense to the raw emotions that makes it easy to become a prostitute. <br /> <br /> What are the raw emotions that the poor doctor is in love with. He's the emotions of depression, the failure, the "other" - the strong emotions he represses. Davis' Mildred, on the other hand, exhibits his emotions instantly and without concentration. She has no feelings of frustration or failure or "otherity"; <br /> <br /> In the Victorian era she lived as a poor cockney woman. <br /> <br /> Novak's character is much more dangerous than Davis, almost through the whole movie. Davis' Mildred ** has never been ** unfortunate, actually she went to the doctor and begged for help. And when he blamed her - she was unhappy with her attitude to the body and spirit of herself and her love for her to maintain her love for her - undoubtedly with much interest in her attitude on the screen: "I wiped my mouth I cut my mouth!" Novak's weakness is amazing. Davis realism memorial. <br /> <br /> IMDb votes conceded!
