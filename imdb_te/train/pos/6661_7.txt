For a long time, we have seen movies in Gandhi. The role of Gandhi in the role of freedom fighters or principles is much higher. But when I hear that Gandhi and the film will be built on the relationship with her son, it hurt her attention because it is a landlocked area because of its own dark side and fewer people. It dared to live. Fortunately, Anil Kapoor (producer) and Feroz Abbad Khan (director). <br /> <br /> Work in South Africa with Gandhi and his relationship with White and his Wives began. Letter Akshay (Harilal), along with his father to become a barrister, rejected his dream when his father (Mahatma Gandhi) pulled him back as freedom fighter (or motivating). Instead of practical study, it demonstrates that there is greater faith in Gandhi's education. Harilal also tried to walk in the footsteps of his father, but began to repel his son and his father as his wife, children and his own dream of becoming a big success. Eventually his father followed his dreams, leaving his own position and defeating his father. He wrote back to India, but started his unsuccessful tales, which became bigger and bigger. I leave the reader to watch the movie to catch more ... <br /> <br /> Performance. First Akshay. He has done so well in his tenure so far and is fully persuaded in his role as Harilal Gandhi. The scene in the room where his wife's body is kept is that you can see the hidden / well-acted actor in Akshay. MK Darshan jarivala Gandhi is good and can live after such a big life. He is well and very easy. She is a wonderful actress and has proved her metal in her TV serials. Bhumaka Chawla has acted well but her candidacy is ruined in this kind of actress. Other actors also support their performances. <br /> <br /> Technique and Make Up are also good and cinematography is especially good for the Duo tone painting. Costume looks and matches the content. <br /> <br /> Overall, the image of a valuable, discouraged, film-loving film that can find boring. Furthermore, the story progress and the connection of the scene can be seen by some and the critics, but the average movie viewer like me can be worn, and it is still adequate enough to take on my subject in my seat.
