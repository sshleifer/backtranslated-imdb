We all create our own reality, or are we? The main question behind this highly original and skilled engraved examination of the hallucinatory nature of reality. M.C. Escher, combining Eastern and Buddhist philosophies with visual Chinese, is a lovely book "Who We Are and What Is Our Place in the Universe?" On a cerebral question, and it manages to change it into an attractive and fun filled 100 minutes. The film is Bart, a writer who struggles with his work, Think of That That Thinks. He sits at his computer and writes at the work screen and begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer. He has long strayed into the turbulent confusion box, in which everything he wrote is reality. Director Gert De Grafeff approaches his subject in a ridiculous sense and circulates the viewer with a combination of unexpected visual wizards that confront our comprehension nature and loyalty. Ultimately, the grapha will challenge the audience at a wide range of film audiences. Whether we really see or touched it or touched it or questioned whether it truly exists, or our whole understanding of the universe and our place is our feelings. Note: Once you see the movie, see the movie's entertaining website. (Dutch with English Subtitles) - Eric Moore
