The silent, sweet and anxious nostalgic image of how to deal with old friends and surroundings from your youth, those memories and the problems and mourning you are currently experiencing. A good feeling to you. All the ingredients are here: old cauldron, competition, friendship and fidelity. We must remember from our summer camps, illness, fridge-rides at night and all the other fun stuff. The old camping leader now retires and all the characters get the chance to experience this week as the camp wants to meet children from the golden years. These are now in their thirties and their careers.
