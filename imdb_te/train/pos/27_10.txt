Emilio Miraglio's "Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is just a giallo most accurate example of what I've seen, combining all the essential elements with a bad recipe actually combined. First of all, and the importance of importance to me, it's complicated, ultimately having a definite sense of twisty plot, and the killer did not eventually come from the left side. There was an antiquated prophecy about two sisters, and a murderer, a red-cloth murders (which you know from the title of the film?) With a madman's mad laughter, with both the scary and the memorable. Every great giallo needs some lovely main actresses, and here we have a lot of headlines led by the ridiculously beautiful Barbara bouchett as one of her sisters, as one of her sisters like Barbara's fashion house, and one of her previous characters, Cybill Dawning. Another highlight of a high-profile Giovanni is an impressive, humorous score, and Bruno Nikolai provides a film for the movie, which should have a couple of days for you. Gorgeous scene? Check again. In WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, the film was originally a treat to the eye. Okay, okay, but what about those murders? After all, what gialli not all about? Well, I am glad that many audiences, like the film to taste, come with different trims, shootings, impulses and other carnage ... Crypts, freaky dream sequences, rats and bots (and a hunky guy named Yugo Paglia for women's audiences, Instructions, a rape scene, red herring and obligations And as good as I say, from fine folks at this DVD no sham, and what you mean: Boot a beautiful print and extra load! Thanks friends!
