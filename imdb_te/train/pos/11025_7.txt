A good action crime adventure with some flaws from director Renny Harlin, directed by Cliffhanger, produces an expert climber for the film, a robber in a full-blown clandestine pirate rocky mountains. Sylvester Stallone is particularly impressed with the Gabe Walker expert climber in the action / fight sequence, but some of them are definitely bound to the unrealistic line. I will suspend my disbelief for this film. The supporting characters are respected in the role of the remaining cast, such as John Litgo, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Lynn, Caroline Gaddlel and Leone. Action / Fight sequences are well executed, but if you are not very hard, you are not sure how hard you are. Instead of making a whole film in a studio somewhere, the places they choose are quite realistic, and the mountain range of aerial views is a great way to add a reality touch to the movie. Deaths are innovative while others are predictable. The villains were great, but they concentrated on a more centralized center to have so many of them. The film's passing is a bit slow but good is good. If you're a big fan of Harlis or Stallone, you'll enjoy this stuff even more than chances. Overall, Cliffhanger plays good roles with action, drama, some suspense, enthusiasm, thrillers and good performances, which they are worth to see.
