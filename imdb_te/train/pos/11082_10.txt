I saw this movie as a kid and naturally moved to tears through this story of a fox family. The amazing scenery at Hokkaid√¥, excellent storytelling and at least amazing excellent soundtrack prophets provide a rare intimacy. I'm still looking for some copy of the beautiful soundtrack. For German viewers it may be useful to know that DEFA-dubbing is worth only to listen. I recorded both (DEFA and BR) but I would only see the first one.
