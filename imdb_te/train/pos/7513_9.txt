<br /> <br /> Starring: Gretchen Mole, Chris Bauer, Lily Taylor, Sarah Palson, & David Stratheren. <br /> <br /> MPAA Rating: "R" (for nudity, sexual content and some language) /> <br /> Nowadays, every celebrity has a biography about his life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biopics are currently very good. "The Notorious Betty Page" is the latest in the DVD release. It features Gretchen Mole as the world's most famous pin-up model, Beetty Page, and is heavily colored in black and white films with some summary. Unlike "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Finding Neverland", the film is not for this year's Oscars. The film does not have the emotional echoes presented in other biographies and the most dramatic moments in Batty Page's life are completely ignored or just suggested. This is not a bad image. In fact, "The Notorious Betty Page" is an entertaining and satisfying film - a great work of the film. The movie is focused on the page's enthusiastic career and the narrow line between sexuality and pornography. It was filmed with enthusiasm and care, and Mary Huron's directing appeared to be the only dream artist for a long time. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bitty Page (as Mole played). Do you know her as an icon or a simple romantic star? Did she know you? American culture can only be influenced by the exposure of more skin than what she thought was unique at that time. Now, many people know America's first sex symbols - many of the models, especially the Playboy and other adult-based magazines. She lived at the time when someone was able to arrest the inch of the meat under the waste and the slavery-style photos of the page were turbulent. In fact, photos began with a full-fledged Senate inquiry about the common manners and the difference between malicious images and pornography. <br /> <br /> The performances in "The Notorious Betty Page" are absolutely fantastic when fully retaining Gretchen Mole. Her performance as Batty Page is amazing. When I announce that role, many are skeptical. When I think of great performances, her name immediately shakes my mind. Now, it turns out. She played the role entirely and attracted me with her weak and yet deeply attractive appearance. David Stratheren is up to last year's "Good Night, and Good Luck", in which he is one of the best performances of 2005. Here, will he give another good performance? Even though he's a little underused. I was amazed at how much time was screened, but quality on quality is always the most important aspect of any good film. The only show I have seen from Lili Taylor was in "The Hunting" (1999). While many people neglected the film, I thought I was enjoying the horror film but not the horror film, and I also thought that Taylor was absolutely loyal to me as an emotionally-distressed Nell. Here, Taylor gives another reliable performance. <br /> <br /> She gives her a very uncompromising performance and provides the performance of Gretchen Mole's fame. <br /> When all is finished and done, "The Notorious Betty Page" is not comparable to other biographies like "Finding Neverland" and "Walk the Line". It is unmatched for them because it tells the story of a woman and her career, at the beginning and the end. Her private life is briefly suggested, but it really affects her, which is the greatest point in the world. We learn the end of the page and find out the effect of making her decisions. But we rarely show the effect of her personal life. She looked back and was a woman who could not rebuild her. Moreover, she is a large model that has become a Christian missionary. The film did not dramatize anything. It may have disagreements with God that motivated the motivational movements that motivated and forgive her. It may have shown the page running and shouting through the rain, she was trying to escape past ghosts and yet it was not. "The Notorious Betty Page" tells a simple story and is rarely made by today's standards. <br /> <br /> Final Thought: "The Notorious Betty Page" is completely relaxed with amazing cinematography. <br /> Total rating: 9/10 (a)
