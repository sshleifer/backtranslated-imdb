Joseph L. Mankiewicz has not remembered one of the best directors in Hollywood history, but the film proves to him. Successful by successfully transferring Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar, along with sophisticated American dramas such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve, which makes Broadway drama into the film and works beautifully with style. Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masters, although he does not perform well. He is the only actor who perfectly laughs at his perfect coolness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is an amazing singer, and Nathan Detroit performs a good job. Jean Simmons's scenes with Sarah Brown and Brando are great with tense chemistry with great chemistry. All supporting actors play their role, especially Sheldon Leonard Harry the Horse as a funny bit. Nevertheless, Mankiewicz has to give a lot of credit to bring the best music on its own right on the screen, which is considered to be standard in many scenes, but is still a story in its own world. Overall, Guys and Dolls are a great musical and it serves as many levels as it should not be.
