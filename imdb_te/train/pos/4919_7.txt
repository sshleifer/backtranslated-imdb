Kazan won the initial film Noir Oscar. Here are some reviews of extraordinary details and length and length of its signals, and much higher rates. I can see where they came from. But I'll take a much more acoustic approach to a long-forgotten film that seems practically portrayed in any budget and partial-documentary format. In the streets of New Orleans there is a pneumonia plague that ranges from military doctor (widesmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to grab the lead physician (polans). The film is Moody, which is depicted in black and white and uses very good locations. Widmark is as amazing as usual. Forget marks (crime is equivalent to disease, and disease is equal to crime) and enjoy chase. It is in a special style, which is a very short period (after the Second World War in the early 1950s) and it is not very common interest, we are not always easy looking at a movie like this now into this new century motion picture maker. They look at this for the first time, they sit tight in the big chase at the end. It's something, and apparently I do not know how they filmed some. I have to say that the film has made 90% of the film and it took a long time to pick up the film.
