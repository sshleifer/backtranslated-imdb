Like his elder brothers, Claude Saver and Jean Pierre Melville, Allen Corneu began to cut teeth in French cinema: "La Menace" (1977) and "Serie Noire" (1979) among others. "Polonian Python 357" is a good example of how Carney has understood and filmed his works at this time in his career. <br /> <br /> Police Superintendent Ferrott (Wives Montant) is usually a cop with unusual methods of working alone. He makes a young girl's acquaintance with Sylvia Leopardi (Stephania Sandelli) and her lover is her other lover: she neglects her high profile (François Perier). When he learns next, he will kill her with anger. Ferrot must investigate the murder and all the evidence is against him. <br /> <br /> These types of distant stories are not exempt from glitches and sometimes, but Carney's scholarly style style styling represents the Dusky atmosphere. The first part of the night before the murder may not be interesting, however, this key-moment is crucial. The Corenio director returns to a clever treatment of minor scenarios and small performances rather than secondary, minor characters who see again during the trial. Despite adverse effects, Corenio and his visual director Daniel Boulanger wrote an acting story. Merard (Matthew Carrier) sometimes expresses his surprise, as Ferot's time relies on a relatively low profile. But he knew that he was working alone. Actually, Ferotte finds solid dreams to find water in the mud and thereby confess itself. In the end, the main idea of ​​the film is related to Ferrott. He loses his identity quite a bit and is a policeman who found himself in the heart of a terrible person. <br /> When he touched the acid on his face, the moment was illustrated by the moment when the witnesses did not notice him when he came face to face with them. <br /> <br /> In the backdrop of this thriller, Orlene's improvedly improved through Corneau's camera and this strange thriller will help in its destructive appeal.
