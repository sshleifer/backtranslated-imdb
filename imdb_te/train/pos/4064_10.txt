I did not meet a man who hated this movie (from hundreds). Defeat is a small scoundrel, or a victim. This film is everything. "Do you love yourself?" <br /> This is not my favorite movie, but my favorite man is directing the same person (Hayoio Miyazaki). In any case, this is my first top five ranks. I've seen a lot of movies.
