It seemed like this and I gave it 10 because it was a christian. <br /> <br /> Long ago "The House on Haunted Hill" is black and white, with the exception of the "hurricane" and "the tingler" (the blood with the intelligent color sequence). <br /> <br /> The ending of the "hurricane" is really astonishing and working today - and secondly, scratchy, hammy, <br /> "The House on the Hundred" Frank Lloyd Wright House has used all of it outside, great Vincent Price and a solid cast, plus good score and product values ​​- when I last saw the last night in the last sixties last night, the audience response <br /> <br /> It's the heroine in the basement Bit alone, if you do not see the movie, read it now and we are waiting <br /> <br /> When the camera is slowly pulling back, the viewers are forced to change their eyes ... <br /> <br /> Whenever I think this is a deliberate, it's not accidental - WHOLE AUDIENCE Screamed (most of the men!) It took audiences about ten minutes to appease. <br /> <br /> Now it is better to paint. He may be, but there may be good pictures of the "House" and the other two films I mentioned. The castle may not be a hitchcock, but he is not Eve. <br /> <br /> It is easy to focus on other people's quirks and forget to check their talent. So I hope this documentary agreed. I'm looking forward to seeing it.
