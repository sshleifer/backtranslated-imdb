Walter Mathau and George Burns work together well. Willy's acidity is a mixture made in heaven with embarrassing amnesic Al. Final scene rounds for the sculpture and completion of the scene where Willy's flat reunites. Walter Moutow can only be a semi-retirement comedian who can play a wonderful role, alongside voice and his great dramas, along with his typical misunderstanding. George Burns Timing is epic and somewhere far better than this film, the desert powder replicas are astonishing his equilibrium aplomb. Invaluable - look for the scene at the end when Al and his daughter asked something of Spanish caretaker, and al's response.
