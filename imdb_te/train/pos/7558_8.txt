From the very first season this episode is controversial with the whole gender bending angle. Suppose that there was a substantial amount of editing before it could be used to make sense of the sensors. <br /> <br /> The story is well written and directed by good acting. (Nicholas Lee made his X-Files debut as Agent Chriskack, not Michael as Michael), I have built and completed everything. <br /> <br /> Its different but enjoyable. Understand any bad reviews you can hear.
