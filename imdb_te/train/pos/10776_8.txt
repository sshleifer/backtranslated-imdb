"Radiofrecia" is still a good surprise in the Italian cinema. The film is based on the book by Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue, who also directed the film and wrote music score. <br /> <br /> The film is a picture of the life of Provincial Northern Italy, Emilia Romagna. We're in 1975, the first free radios of time - one of the movie's boys is creating "Radialapus". Youth, friendship, love, sex, personal dramas and unemployed are themes, but the film is also talking about drugs - the main character, Frekie, and heroin of the heroine slavery. <br /> Without boring and moralist, the story flows well; Actors are strong and are the way of directing. Clearly Luciano "Liga" Ligabue Fellini or a film is not professional, first of all he's a musician. But he succeeded in making a good product. <br /> <br /> "Radiofrequia" Actors are generally very popular, only Stefano Akorrisi is one of the star - one of the most popular young Italian actors. See another Italian songwriter Francesco Gucci in a small role, he is a good Communist Barman and football coach!
