The United States still struggles with World War II (the film was released between VE day and VJ day). Fearless American soldiers have beaten the enemy, or the Americans are usually singing and dancing, as any studio is worthy of its salt. The techniques of techno-culinary music have been spent in the days of American discontent after everything is spent. Most of the day's music was a group of musical numbers, and the best-available plot to fill the next available music number! People who reviewed the film were born after 1970. Now we deteriorate quickly. <br /> <br /> The film may be called "The Search for The Jose Irby". Allow me to explain. From 1929 - His arrival in America - until his death in 1980, Irubby was one of the best pianists for a concert stage. He agreed to do some films in 1942, but Hollywood was there for about a decade at that time. Not only an excellent pianist, but also a successful conductor, Irbai is home to more than 40 years. <br /> <br /> Irby and 17 other pianists were originally planning to play one of Lispat's Rampodeys at the start - and did not any other pianists ever notice? Joe Panstock, who produced the film & many other MGM music, has honored Hurricane Irby with the curious American youth in classical music. Grayson wanted audiourish with the film, not at the time of real life. Everyone wanted to return to Ibrahim. <br /> <br /> Jean Kelly is a great dancer and Frank Sinatra is an outstanding singer, but the film is only 30 years old for Sinatra, and Columbia Records has signed a four-year contract. <br /> <br /> Kelly has become known as a dancer, but Irbery has been in the world for 20 years. <br /> <br /> There is no need for plots for Americans despite a plot. They were frustrated by the war, fearing their loved ones and worrying about the future. They need to be assured that happiness and hope and ultimately things work fine. They need music and smiles and joy and romance. This film and others like it were just distributed. <br /> Enough speech. If the mouse is dancing, the best scenario in the film is between Sinatra and Irkuta, where each of them "anonymous" is congratulated. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in Josh Huber, find out via my website, www.joseiturbi.com, in the US than Di Soto, Carte and De Leon, where you can find a plot summary, Film reviews and this and some other MGM musicals in the 1940s, as well as the etirby biography and discography. <br /> Trout
