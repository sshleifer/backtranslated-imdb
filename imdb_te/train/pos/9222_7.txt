Colonial Africa has fewer films, and they are mixed. It shows the best and worst values ​​in Africa, with its remorseful nudity in exposing slavery in the late 1970s, not altogether different from the values ​​of humanity. <br /> <br /> The Africans and especially Arabs have errors with the overwhelming influence of western pre-concepts. <br /> <br /> The English doctor David Linderbi's beautiful African-American wife, Dr. Anna Linderbie, is accompanied by Arab slave traders, a young San Francisco girl and a young boy. The main slave businessman, Suleiman, with his flowers and sometimes humorous rhetoric, and humorous matches, is in every stage of Arab - "Carry On Follow That Camel", but the film deserves not the standard. Peter Ustinov had enough skills to solve the script's errors, and what a terrible single-dimensional role could be saved. <br /> <br /> Continuing the background of stereotypes, Suleiman's Arab employees have psychedelic tendencies towards a boy who is not as sensible and a grateful person who is not portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> One of David's first ports was a local police officer, a stereotypical tribe and an ineffective African bureaucrat. David then meets two stereotypical white pots, an Englishman (Wax, played by Rex Harrison) and an American (Sandell, played by William Holden). Sassell had a "classical" view on mixed race relations, who refused to help if he did not pay earlier. David won a love for Annea and learned of his own inability to find love, and agreed to bring David in his helicopter to help find pineapples. They miss the Suleiman and his captors and are unable to keep them in the neighborhood - as a result of Sennell's hesitation and lack of experience with David's guns, his helicopter has been shot down but David gets out. <br /> <br /> When we introduced David Malik (Kabir Bedi), African Suleiman lost his family and was now guided only with a vengeance. They find a San Francisco girl with Sunu Manu and find out that they are on the right path to find Suleiman. <br /> <br /> In the most heartfelt scenes they are the party of slave traders <br /> <br /> Suleiman is not a group to send hostages to the Tuaregs that had previously met. However, a young boy who was raped by a witch doctor and a spectacular sight with supernatural references, uses his knowledge of killing Suleiman's servants. <br /> <br /> Suleiman and his slaves are in a few days to get into the slave market at this time. /> <br /> Suleiman now tries to sell her to the disgraceful Arab prince (Omar Sharif), but she is clever, as Anneas has "difficulties". Anna U.N. When deciding to be an American work, the prince decides to continue bargaining without taking into consideration the consequences. <br /> <br /> The slave market is sold to the youngest German pedophile, young adults. <br /> <br /> David and Malik finally face Suleiman and have a bitter-sweet finish from Malik's perspective. Finally, David and Ananza reunited, and Malik, whose life is on the ruins, can find himself able to reconcile himself when he sees his own work. <br / <br /> <br /> The whole storyline is striking but loses marks for the stereotypical shoot of almost all the popular characters. All the leading actors to solve many of the credit scripting Have to go.
