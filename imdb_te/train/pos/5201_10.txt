The Human Tornado is the 70th episode of Blakesploitation film starring Rudy Ray Moore, the nighttime comedian. The film tells the story of dolomite, a bad donkey pimpin hustler on the wrong side of a white, racist sheriff who sleeps with his wife. Dolomite just escapes, and Sunny goes to California to visit the name of Queen Bee, an old friend, the nightclub owner (and Madam to Diamond's 'Ladies'). However, it seems that the rival nightclub owner with mob connections is trying to muscles in her racket, so Dolomite takes her into his arms. Strong dramatic skills, kung fu's mastery, impressive lyrical voice (he offers two tracks in soundtrack), a touching, compassion strap with women, and a round Ray Moore displays many different skills in this milestone. The whole compelling attraction and the great concept of comic timing. The film has all of this: a deep story, blistering action, laughter-a-minute comedy, cute ladies in trouble, a slam-bang ending ... What more do you ask from the movie? Run, do not go to your local video store and rent a human tornado. And share with your family.
