Victoria Maestriosimon (accustomed to her own drama for the screen) is a disturbing and inspired screen version of a play that her man came to her purse and finds where she lives. The next day she walked out of the roommate's work, the guy found in her house and tried to rape him. The story takes a surprising twist, at one time, the feminine man changes the tables and has the ability to strengthen him; But when she learns that she is accused of rape and if she is arrested, he gets out and decides to be a prisoner in her home until she gets a confession. The distance? May be. Disturbing? Sure, but it's amazingly claustrophobic feel about this film, just with the woman and her attack, especially the middle class, that's helping you but it's a piece of what's totally happening. I do not see the drama in Broadway, but I can imagine playing a similar role, but it does not make this film a less inspired experience. Farah Fouet, one of the last actresses to play the role in Broadway, was awarded Marjorie's character in the film and provided a very beautiful and deeply moving performance as the victim's refusing victim. Most critics have identified Phoset's performance as a single note, but for me, Marjorie has believed her and the performance works well for me. James Russo, in his career, was soft and convicted of rape, knowing that Magorie was more challenging than he expected. Diana Scarwid co-star as Marjorie's Roommates, who came home after Alfre Woodard Marjorie grows up and tied him up and stuffed in the oven on their arrival. They think we should look to the police and let them manage the person because it's we see through Marjorie and so go and see it's the arrival of the roommates for the unexpected level. Not for the heart rate, but if you can retain it, you have a gripping film experience that is anchored by a major show of surprise.
