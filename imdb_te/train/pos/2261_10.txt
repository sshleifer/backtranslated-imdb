I saw this film and drama, and I added that it was the most touching story I had ever seen. Until seeing this movie I do not know how terrible life is and still exists for South African children and adults living in that era. It brought tears to my eyes and brought a lot of sorrow to my heart, to have any kind of struggle to keep alive any human being, and taking the children out of those places, behaving behaving, behaving with them. It's just over five stars and I rate it ten. Thanks to Mr. Mbongeni Ngema for such a fairy tale. Although it was 12 years since the story was told, it is still heavily in my heart. If there is a DVD on a VHS or play, please ASAP let me know. Thank you. The PS is nothing wrong with other children who want to educate them about their problems and conditions.
