This is a very interesting picture. This is an action movie with comedy in the film to give a comic strip of spin to the fox team with the comedian Epipse. You're thinking about what happened to the next Fox. The film is well-documented and the director used to give the right colors (dark blue colors) the right kind of feel in the film. The film also stars Kimberly Ellis and she is always happy to see her on the big screen. She plays the role. Jamie Kennedy is also in the film. It's worth seeing you've seen it. If you're a Jamie Fox fan it's definitely worth it. It deserves more credit than originally given.
