"The Lion King" is my favorite Disney movie from time to time, so I should give the sequel a chance and I did. The Lion King 1 1/2 is pretty good and it is good laughing and fun with Timon and Pumba. The only problem is, I sometimes feel the need for any explanations just because the concept of creating holes and feeling the wanting of your own explanation. Well, I highly recommend this film to fans of The Lion King or one night with family. This is the first time a fun movie with the same laughs and love characters. So, hopefully, I will get the same with the third installment of the Lion King series. Sit back and think of Hakuna! Do not worry! <br /> 8/10
