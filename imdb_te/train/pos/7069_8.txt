Deanna Durbin is said to have found young men. This first film is the best. The luxurious story presented a delightful 14 year old Dina, a little beauty with a beautiful voice, as "Miss Fixit" in a family split in luxury. For the plot summary, see other IMDb entries, but soon Dina and her two big sisters plan to travel to the United States to prevent their father from being recaptured from Switzerland. With excellent direction and compilation, particularly the great supporting actors Barbara Reid and the non gray sisters, the film succeeded in attracting one in later appearances. In Dina's three songs, "Il Basio" only came from a traditional compound, but when she sings in the police station scene, the film's position in history is guaranteed. At the age of 15, the viewer was wiped out by both life and classical music. One of the many nice touches that occurs across three SMART Girls is the brief summary of stretching his neck for him to the final glimpse of the cops hustle him! An unfortunate result of the film's success was later locked to the "Miss Fixet" theme for Durbin vehicles, which quickly became outdated. She never did. Her stature as an actress is far more questionable than her Karisma, she certainly has. It has replaced "naturalness" for many of the filmmakers, the ability to play the role she lacks. The film featured well in 21 films.
