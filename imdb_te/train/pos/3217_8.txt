Kurt Russell is incredibly believable and it is the honesty-to-goodness of the main themes [overcoming the stranger's fears, learning growth on initial conditioning, friendship and love of the heroine. It's rare for most people, and I like this movie [that's a lot of A / A violent pop] and it recommends every person I know ..... This is one of the biggest action adventure box hits by rights - it's an insult to cruelty There is something for everyone without having to miss out or do not miss any continuous action. I fear that it was hit by the fact that the elders did not see it. People under 20 may not be able to see more violent action in their video games, but do not care for multi-layered, multi-background beauty or it. The film can convert A / A out of the mindless violence. A man takes a lady [or renting it on a cable lounge] or more of her other actions to see him.
