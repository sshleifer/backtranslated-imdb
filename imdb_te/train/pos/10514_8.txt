Emma Jane Austus is a terrible flawed film based on the classic novel. I do not know much about the plot because I read the book, yet I guess the whole story. I have a lot of scary scenes due to bad writing or directing. The movie is very fun and while I loved it. But all the scenes I do not like but the majority is well acting and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow is one of his best performances as Emma's heroine. Alan Cumming (I'm never really impressed and pretty much here)) and Jeremy Northam (there are better adaptations of James Aston books but it is still very entertaining and worth looking) Who is Jeremy North The wooden display at first look but actually is very subtle, a ID required).
