I liked this movie. First, because it's a family image. Secondly, it provides a refreshing solution that deals with HIV's news in one family, usually with less hysteria than I did in movies. The brothers are very close and not discriminating. Their desire to save the little brother is great, but not necessarily in the end. Leo's choice of how to deal with her treatment is not very popular with people, but I believe that he is the right choice. I can not believe this is a French television program. It has great product values. I gave this film ten and you also saw it.
