Japan 1918. The story of 16-year-old Ryu begins with the death of her father. Later revealed, her parents died of both tuberculosis. In this disappointing situation, Ruiz's aunt married a Japanese couple in Hawaii, both of whom knew only about their image. Her arrival in Hawaii Reyu finds that her new husband is too old to be photographed and he lives in a very humble situation beside a sugar cane. Ryu feels running away in her new home is not used to the hard work of plants and despair on her condition. She soon learns that she is not anywhere. The woman's sister who works with Cana gives her new hope and strength. The film was based on real events between 1907 and 1920, with thousands of Asian women married men in the United States, both of whom only knew in their film. This well-known movie is well written and acted. This area is breathtaking. The film featured Miffune Toshiro as a Bency (silent film narrator) on his last screen appearance. The film gives an insight into the Japanese culture here and throughout the ocean. Must see!
