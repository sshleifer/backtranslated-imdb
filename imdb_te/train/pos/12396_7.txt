<br /> <br /> The second part of 'The Animatrix' is a collection of animated short films that tell us a little more about the 'The Matrix' world. Work and live together. This is a short history lesson in the 'Matrix' world. The first part ('Osiris's final flight') is as good but still very entertaining.
