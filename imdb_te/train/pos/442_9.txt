This is what I call the growth film. Each character is different and better at the end - and this is because a woman knows that the place they choose is "the turtle of love". Jossi Lawrence, a well-known comedian, shines as a woman who makes these changes. The men in the film are also self-centered for better people. This book is very true to the novel. This is my book plus, because I am a librarian. The visual breathing and the message of love is true.
