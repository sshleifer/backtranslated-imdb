Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly a great game ever created. It expresses that you can play for hours within hours without stopping for a break. I beat the game 4 times, but I have earned 120 stars ... (111 I've got) but I hope they will eventually get to them. I have not officially played this game for seven years, and I have seen my sisters playing. Now I'm 13 and still play it, I'm starting to play again. </ P> <br /> Graphics are unbelievable for an opening N64 game. The gameplay is addictive. The controls are great. The levels are difficult, but it is not impossible. <br /> I would like to tell you more, but why did not you get it? Put the X-Box away 360, the PS3, and the Wii and find yourself a Nintendo 64 and go to this amazing, exciting game play.
