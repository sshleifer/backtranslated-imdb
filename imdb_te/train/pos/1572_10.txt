<br /> <br /> <br /> When you die, the enemies are invisible when I die, I complain that the enemies are shining when I die <br /> <br /> This is a great story, great story, good graphics, great characters and great soundtracks ... I recommend! Log enjoyable! At least, in the Dreamcast ... but it is the same as the PS2 version.
