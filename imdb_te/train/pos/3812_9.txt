This is a real eye candy. The world and the ancient cities that make up the floating islands flying. Attacking huge monsters are hitting the cathedrals at their opponents ... who will stop? An ancient prophecy, a group of underdog leaders and a beautiful princess in search of her hero ... sounds familiar ...? Yes we heard that song before. <br /> <br /> When you look at the magnificent scenery you forget. <br /> <br /> It is fun to watch this movie. But after leaving the movie you are looking for a little more story. <br /> What's behind the 30-year-circle? What horse crazy flock? Who built these magnificent monuments, castles and cities ... and why are they separate? And where are those single people, not the peasants, the people? Really, this movie looks very secret, but it's not the Lord of the Rings.
