The Swang's Strongler low budget studio was manufactured by the PRC and is one of their best films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A man who is lynched for murder has not returned as a ghost; revenge on the people who blame him, he uses a cord to steal his victims and, after many deaths, he disappears with the old man, who runs the boat through the swamp. Old man's granddaughter Ferry takes her over and also in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married. <br /> <br /> This film has plenty of fog atmosphere, which makes a lot of creepy. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Rosemary La Planck, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) Stringler. <br /> <br /> The strangeler of Swamp is a must have for older fiend fans like me. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and half stars 5
