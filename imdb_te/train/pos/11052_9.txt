When I was six years old, I learned about a series called "Los Compions", and I was my parents "champions" and "the avengers" every week. (I already own the whole cycle of "The Prisoner!") But after a few years, "Tomorrow's People", "Worst Witch" (I just have to, or just stay in Zone 1 or Zone 4) "Harry Potter", "Doctor Who" and "Other People" I can not spend more for things like pp stories, speak English and understand, but my relatives, including my relatives, have also introduced me to these great stories ... I hope someday that anyone can perceive the attraction of the series and when I see them first I'm selling it, dubbed or subtitle, but I saw them in the same format Urtuncukondi, Zone 1 or 4, even if my TV set!
