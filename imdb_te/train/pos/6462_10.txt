<br /> I'm not going to ruin things to anyone who has not seen this humble masterpiece by Kay Pollak. <br /> <br /> <br /> The famous world famous conductor by Michael Nichwitz is his childhood village. <br /> <br /> Each character has a special purpose in the film and displays the wonder of each actors. <br /> <br /> I do not forget to play the two main characters, Frida Hawlgren and Michael Nginvist, whose dramas emotions Look at the unforgettable paradoxes of the game. <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael Niquist is really testing the most difficult setup here, one of which is disastrous ending. Or excellent. <br /> <br /> Today, certainly one of the best cinemas I have the pleasure of watching.
