While on vacation in Florida I recently tuned across the movie for five minutes to TNT ... (Hay, does it take some time in the hotel?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Jon Hart at the height of the feature TNT. <br /> <br /> "I miss drive" is not already old? <br /> <br /> But I got together with it and got totally amazed entertainment. Melissa plays her role as Jennifer as a psychoanalytic. Supported cast (Nick, former con boyfriend; Karen, her best friend and her life-controlled parents) added great confidence to all. <br /> <p> <p> <p> <br
