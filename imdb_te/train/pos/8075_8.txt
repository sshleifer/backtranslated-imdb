I believe what famous film critics are saying. Though the film did not get the best comments, this film made my day. It's got me thinking. <br /> <br /> What do you do when your dear friends cheat you? How do you eat milk, it's never so loyal and when you give it a chance. In the same way, some people are never grateful. How the film is so selfish and everyone is finally thinking of himself and about how it works. <br /> <br /> A brother dies unexpectedly by a gangster. The living brother decides to take revenge. By this process, we will learn about the futility of this world. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan gave his life's performance. A new actor was given a good performance. Actress Amitabh's wife stole the program. Her character was very small, but she diligently drew attention to her role. Chawla had really great face expressions, but her character was too small and did not give her the chance to express herself completely. <br /> <br /> Rajkumar Santoshi is a great film. His movies always provide a message to the audience. Nanak Singh (the Punjabi novelist novels always have a purpose and is aimed at a social evil) because they have a true message to the audience. They are entertaining as well as giving lessons.
