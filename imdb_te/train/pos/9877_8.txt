<br /> <br /> Presenting Lilly Mars is one of the films that appear to suffer from a studio system. <br /> Now you realize that you are my partisan, I think this movie should be here. <br /> <br /> Basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) becomes a star on New York's journey, and her director's heart (von hefelin) is a beautiful stock Hollywood story, with writers a bit more than normal. <br /> <br /> When Lily took her long break, when she left the star, she did not succeed and she went back to swallow her pride and play a minor role in the show. <br /> <br /> There are some great performances by Judy Garland auxiliary cast. Phil Bainer (the director of John Thorne Wayne's (Van Heflin)), Lilly's mother Springtine is awesome. Acting support for journalist Kony Gilchrist as Frankie, has become an actress theater guardian. <br /> Definitely worth a watch. One of those films is designed to make you feel good about the world and your dreams.
