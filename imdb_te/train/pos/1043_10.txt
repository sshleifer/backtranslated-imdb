Since I remember and I am 18 years old and I continue to watch old movies and get them more rewarding in the long run (but hey is not wrong I loved movies I do not like 40 and 50s today), now I start watching the movie were. Grandmother played by my favorite character Lucille Watson of course. But I loved the way Betty Davies and her family were depicted. Children do not like mild children. But there is good reason, your life has been hiding too much and has seen execution, seeing the terrible things that children have destroyed that innocence. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many people are mad, now I know that he is going to the Oscars and call the bogey but hey But Lukas' performance was incredible, by the end of the film I reduced it to tears.I loved this movie too and anyone recommend it !! :-D
