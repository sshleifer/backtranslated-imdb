The brightness of the film is also pretty dreadful for an effective dentist. This is one of the primal fears of man. This film is a nightmare film that walks in the waiting room of every kid. Corbin Bernson gives a crazed dentist that I am trying to kill people but he only works on their teeth so it really does not work. Especially in the scene of the gory we found that actor Earl Bone destroyed his teeth with drills and emotions, which was the perfect trash you could do when you were a killer dentist. It is well written but gore, which is a normal Brian Yuzna situation. The plot is deteriorated and sometimes designed on the go but hey, it's a killer dentist, the first thing we did when we all thought about it.
