<br /> <br /> GIAST: See something. <br /> <br /> The film is well-shot by Jean Siskel, but I can not figure out why it's after watching it. The film is absolutely original and different. It has interesting conversations at times, some cool moments, and a creepy "noire" feel. But it's just not entertaining. Moreover, it does not have much sense in the saga, especially in character motivations. <br /> <br /> I suggested that this challenge may not be acceptable.
