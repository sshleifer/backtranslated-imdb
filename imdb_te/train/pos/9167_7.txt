This is, in my opinion, better than 2 1990 reforms, but it is not as good as it is. <br /> <br /> It is better than any of the other BBC 1980s, such as Mansfield Park and Nalbander Abbey. <br /> <br /> The length of this adaptation, the book, rather than the versions of 290, and St. John Rivers is covered, but not very good. Timothy Dalton was very good at Rochester, but the actress was very old in the role of Zen. There is certainly a scope that a TV adaptation of this length is more than a tennar spending on it.
