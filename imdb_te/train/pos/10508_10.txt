Mario Peach's Castle For Mario Cake is invited. When Mario arrives there, he finds the bowser kidnapped her! Mario must save the day again. Unlike 2-D games, Mario can explore something he wants. He just wandering around, trying to look for 1-ups, find the secrets in levels, and more. You spend about four hours at the same level. No time limits. There are 16 worlds, number of steps, and star doors, you need a certain number of stars to get. If you get into these star doors, you should go to the end of the stage and fight with Bossar. To get some worlds, you enter the world through painting. There is so much stuff and the gameplay has many hours, I do not see how someone does not like this game. It's great. This launch title is the gamers insurance game that N64 has a good life. Every 3D platform game that we know is identical to SM64. Banzão Cajui and Bajō Poyo are commonly used examples. Super Mario 64 is one of the greatest games in 3D games history. 10 out of 10. If you have an N64, buy this game. It's hard to find use, because no one is selling this baby for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. A perfect 10.
