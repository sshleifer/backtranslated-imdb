Ed Harris's performance in the film ranks from the scale of his usual standards, meaning he steals the screen from anyone who shares it, and it has a formidable Sean Connery. More than a bit more than a sacred image, Harris comes alive only during the trial of the lawyer for a different conviction. It's breathtaking, a master class in artistic control. <br /> <br /> Other actors are proficient and canary reliable, like Fishbourn, but this is not the hero. The plot is based on evidence that the black prisoner is always badly wounded and forced to be cut off by the white juridical officers. This is a machine that drives the story, the right or the wrong, and the trick at the end of a tad. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at Harris.
