When I first saw it, I remembered this little boy, really I was very laughing and the sound came out like other movies I saw! Curly was very good at the "singing" opera in this song, he was surprised that he did not consider his career as a professional singer because he was really good! <br /> If you notice, Curly is portrayed as a stooge at the end of the career, he has lost weight and is thin, because his face is deep and he can say that he has changed. He was still fifty years old when he was still fifty years old, although he had not yet pulled the knot. Because he suffered many small strokes in his big before his career ended. He will manage to pull it in his last ones! <br /> <br /> If you do not really care about the fact that curly is really sick, this is one of their ridiculous stories. I know I can not understand the fact that I'm really changing because I thought I was still great! <br /> <br />
