World War II 11 Again, England's trials and troubles were once again re-emerged. The film is very good for the touch of the human element. The film is perfect for the British line classics like "Mrs Minivar" and "Hope and Glory". <br /> <br /> Like in the film, we see people's frustration during the war. <br /> <br /> These performances, especially the oppressed John Thaw, <br /> <br /> Let's see why this little boy is taking his bed. <br /> <br /> The old man takes his child and brings happiness in his tragic life. When the child returns to his mother, the old man goes to London and tries to find his tragic event. He can literally kidnap the boy and convince the child to be better with him than in the home of the boy. <br /> <br /> This is a good picture that is based on good and lovely relationships.
