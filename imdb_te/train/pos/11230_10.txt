Hidden Frontier talked and reported about several news organizations for their long commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and offering an example of the sense that Gene Rodden Berry's mission is. Homosexuality, despair, war, and the acceptance of different races is equal to their vision or other trek series and movies that exceed that. Production value was low and volatile, but acting improved in 7 seasons, stories were much more complicated and visual graphics were delicate and more attractive. In Season 6 episode 1, Countermeasures, one of the largest space battles in Trek history. The ships are well-received and space battles are impressive and exciting. The real drawing to the border is not ships or backgrounds, but it is the growth of people and characters and stories. There are also other trek series and movies and characters all know what we know. I recommend to check any trek fan countertages and you will be hooked!
