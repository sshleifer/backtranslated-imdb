Three Stooges are always some of the many actors I love. I love only about each of the stories they made. I love all six novels by Stooges (Curley, Shemp, Mo, Lorry, Joe, and Curley Joe)! All the shorts are very happy and most of them are with great actors and actresses, many of them have a lot of shorts! In my opinion three stooges are always some of the greatest actors and all-time ridiculous comedy team! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite stooges shorts with Shem is nothing more than Hajbands Beware! Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Hawk, Alain Lockwood, Johnny Cassier, Nancy Sanders, Lionard, Maxin Gates and Emil Sitka are the most beautiful ones in the minority. Green and McIntyre are offering great performances here! There are so many funny episodes. It's a very small one. There are three other stooges like this, called Brilliant Groom and I recommend both!
