I feel like an active gem for the self-help market. I really can not imagine a career along the lines of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, but usually this is a guy through a break, he goes and makes "X Men" and his humble alert origins soon forgotten or they are. ... if I remember correctly X Men is a group of some weird :)
