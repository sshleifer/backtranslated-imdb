I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Tessel Film Festival, and the Guard of Capture was completely overwhelmed by how I removed it. <br /> <br /> This movie is an adult swimming class for a variety of reasons. <br /> How real it is to me to be surprised. Rarely ensemble pieces are well treated with characters. I enjoyed the scenes in the class, the drama outside was very sharp. If nothing is left out of character or position, in the end it left a very strong sense of attending school or summer camp - here you will find quick friends, discovering yourself stronger and making more discoveries about yourself. <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that Paula's character has a very strong and unusual introduction, you She has made you want to know a little more about her than finally revealed. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, look at it.
