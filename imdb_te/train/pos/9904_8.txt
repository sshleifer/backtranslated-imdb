Slaughter is about a boy named High Marty. He was hurt, and was elected to high school. A group of children played a lot of pranks on him, and these pranks were really bad. The last prank was tragic. <br /> After 5 years. Children meet again for a gang reunion. One of them was set up in an old high school. Now the school is abandoned, and they need to break down. For some reason, the guardian was still there, but he told them to go ahead and enjoy them because he gave them a beer. Parties, and their old lockers looking at, and they see something of Marty. <br /> <br /> When murders started, it was great. Every killing is creative and gory. We see one person in the mask of a teacher and hunt only one across the school. It looks like Marty returns to the perfect revenge. After the first person dies, they learn that they are locked in school. <br /> Now, there are many dubious things in this movie. First of all, I do not know anyone who has a 5 year reunion. Secondly, after the first child dies, a girl gets blood on her. They run in a panic, and she goes to the bathroom, and finds a bathtub. Hrr friend just killed, and she decides to take a bath! More importantly, why is a bathtub in a school bathroom? However, the bathtub does not seem to work really well ... and she's dying a horrible death of an 80s movie. It's a horror slasher. Who cares if it has some careless parts. I'm not for one. This film has really great deaths. The end is a twist. After seeing the hot tension lately, I can compare it to both. They are the same, there is a kind of twist, what kind of disappointment I am getting ..... the right after the twist, if you kill the best in the movie. <br /> <br /> After killing the killer, the killer appears on the screen and makes some crazy, and it's the right way to end the movie. This is me "wow ..."
