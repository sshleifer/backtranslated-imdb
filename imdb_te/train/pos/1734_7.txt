I saw this film for the first time and I liked it. She is very entertaining to dance. She knows how to dance because I read somewhere that I have participated in this film. The scene was great. Yvonne is a talented woman and beautiful. We're laughing at the silly kiss scenes, but it's great about older movies! I grew up with her in Munsets and she enjoyed watching her in her previous movies. Even if they are not all the best, it is not good to watch her work and sing. I'm slowly buying his movies and looking at them when I get them. In her memory there is a big collection for me.
