This image is good. Just. You have rare comedy comedies, and this is a bloody good example. When I first saw the film, the credit rolled, a friend and I looked at each other ... 'Did you catch it?' For those doubters, look at the levels. See the comparisons between Vick and the Club, DNA! See different jingles for different characters, position, and if you do not see anything else, look at the connection between the treatment of Vick and the path in the picture. It's in the Vic's HEAD! The starting line about the world of Wick. The head of the wick with the camera, and the inside, the ending of the whole universe! Completely quotable, amazing cartoon gangsters, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
