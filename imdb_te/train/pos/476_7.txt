An amazing chess player participates in a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. The story itself has a pretty bad angle. So, there's more. <br /> <br /> The fact that the chess player is completely impeded the world is because of his brilliance in the game and in fact there is some history that the player pursues. <br /> <br /> The movie is a romantic trivial chess player shaped and works very well with tournament tension for historical events. It's easy to pair up with the two main characters and it's easy to believe that they can press them as they do in this movie. The added effect of the tournament is very good and creates a good tension setting. <br /> <br /> I do not know the strength of chess players because I can not play my game. Believable. In addition, most of the film will fall very easily. It is again forgotten. <br /> <br /> Ten chess players were caught between 7 elephants and a hard place.
