Unfortunately, the Challenger explosion came at the same time space camp. Keep it a crypt when it really takes it out or they bring it out. I'm glad they did. I first saw SpaceCamp in a drive-in picture. <br /> I really heard about Lee Thompson and Tom Scari. I never heard of others in the film. Hence, I was acting to all those young people, and came to look like a big shock to find a real good performance! <br /> <br /> I particularly like how to work with the children as a team. They only hope for the scenes that children make for touring. The original experiment of an astronaut, old news for us. <br /> These are all different. <br /> For all this is one of my most richest films. Escapist is probably, but it is amazing for an empty nut like me. Perhaps it was rented 30 - 40 times. Eventually, I found myself in a shop and bought it. Now, if it comes out only on DVD. I will probably be permanent. This movie comes from 10 to 9.
