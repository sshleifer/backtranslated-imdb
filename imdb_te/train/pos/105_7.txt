Start with Ed Furlong on this one. You should see. God bless this child. $ 5 bucks he plays the role in this movie is what he really like in real life. There is a liner or two who has almost annoyed me snot because he is subtle humor in the script. You guys have gone in recent years and have learned about all the activities and Ferrlong does not even star in. That's why his performance is good. Even with Madsen. You keep thinking, "I'm really like this person in real life." Should Maddon also act? It's just natural. Vosloo is clearly moved from the cast mummy guy to the type. Jardana Spiro's performance as the biggest surprise to this film. Her reflexes on the spot are on the spot. I fought if she was hot or not, but she wanted to see more. <br /> <br /> There is not a big fan of shoot 'out / compulsory type of movies. But I'm a fan, you have simple twists and turns and you have to be unexpected. It just can not take over your standard thieves bank, they kill the hostages, and the good guys win the end of the movie end. <br /> <br /> The cafe sequences work best with hand held cams. No glass on a bit. <br /> <br /> For those who are there for the Bozz fans - actor Curtis Wayne (Carl plays the role) you think you will double. <br /> As I have seen, why are some actors making foreign accents in this small town? Ultimately, these individuals thought they would smuggle goods to other countries / states, so they could have these voices. But the producers know more about Bonus features about what some international viewers would like to hear about some of their films. And some of them smoker. Dean of Monsia? I should say more.
