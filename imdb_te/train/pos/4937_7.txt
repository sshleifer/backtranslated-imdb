The film is in fact a threat to bio terrorism and the threats of superbugs, the West Nile virus, and SARS. As a thriller, tension is very intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas will serve in their roles. Domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot. Most of the film is his mark Jack Farnons. His strongly defined features and seemingly easy-to-be outside always always move to the outside of a vicious and ruthless person under the surface. The chase scene is also impressive by the packing factory. Recommended, 7/10.
