I had a chance to see in a magnificent restoration theater that was part of the vast Paramount Chain of Villilleville Homes, which played this 1926 film. Mighty Wurlitzer Organ in Paramount ?? <br /> <br /> Mighty Wurlitzer are lucky enough to have a significant figure Dennis James in the international revival of silent films playing at the appropriate time. Music and background compositions in the image. This print is the perfect digital copy of the rapidly degrading nitrate negative and has a one-life-long lifetime opportunity to see a silent film intended to see the overall experience. <br /> <br /> Greta Gabo's first American film. She is only 20 years old but already has 6 Swedish paintings. <br /> <br /> This is a silent film about the opera star. Although Mighty Wurlitzer added tremendous to the mice-en-scene, it is desirable to leave a lot of imagination. <br /> <br /> Modern viewers, for the most part, do not understand silent movies ?? With wide facial expression and wide facial expression, acting was different. So the audience are laughing at inappropriate times? Acting Harm 'and Over? <br /> <br /> Garabo is very rare in the new era of acting, with all sensitivity: she read a half-closed eye and volumes in a downward glance or a simple shrug. <br /> <br /> Although it was Gorbo's first American film, it was clear to the studio that any of their hands knew it. This is its best in MGM film production. The sets and dresses are excellent. Special effects ?? Is it weak by today's standards? <br /> <br /> Viscount Blocco Ibanez's script (from Entra Narance's novel) appears to be designed for Garbo; It shows her strengths, raises her assets and has a difficult language problem: a Swedish actress can play with a Spanish temptation without any suspension on our response. <br /> <br /> She replied to co-star MGM's Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> He does an admirable job and has made some romantic stars in the movie ever in a day: Does not the characters act properly, unseen and unseen? Especially when you consider the powerhouse called garbo. <br /> <br /> Unusual cinematographer William H. When Daniels met Gerbon, Lucien Littlefield, Kennedy and Martha Mattox. They made 20 pictures together. (He is a cinematographer in 157 films and his career has expanded for more than five decades!) He was able to capture his beauty and his photograph is famous for her, The Divine Garbo. <br /> <br /> The movie is very rare: if you have any chance, do not miss it.
