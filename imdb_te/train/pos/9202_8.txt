Deve should admit that there is an eye for beauty and talent. He gave a break to a successful model, Zenat Aman, and acted in a role she played for her role and became a former winner of the beauty contest. Her spectacular, rocky scene, and her hipnotizing music, darling her viewers immediately. This film is a treat for the eyes, it's local, ethnic people, the Buddha temples and the charp, naughty mumtaz, appealing to her, her ethnic dress and dance skills. Dev is adorable, of course, and this is one of his commercially successful performances. Hare Rama maintains an interest in curiosity, which has carefully written script, editing, and charismatic music. Like Des Bundes, his other film, Anand, has been the subject of teenage addiction to drug addiction, and their theoretical coming from the disturbed families, and troubled childhood, is quite acceptable. A good entertainer, this movie has freshness to date!
