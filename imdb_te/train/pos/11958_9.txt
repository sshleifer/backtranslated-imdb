First, comment the viewers liked it from the first moment. Perhaps the current events in the Middle East leadership take on the current perspective, "I came for comedy, George enjoyed it." But for any reason, everyone is really in its comedy. Last time Woody tried to do a fairly simple comedy (Small Time Crooks, Curse of the Jade Scorpion, Hollywood Ending). I remember thinking at one point, "Those sixties were initially funny." I'm going into the film, I'm scared that Woody Tone is deaf, yet this comic perspective is in perfect tune. However, my fellow AARP card has been done in plenty of screening, but there are also plenty of 20-somethings and 30-somethings, and they all seem to give it up and give up occasionally the stomach gaffes, chicks and the like. In many cases, throw-away people are laughing so loudly that you do not lose the next line. <br /> In the meanwhile, Woody is trapping the familiar ground. The film has a lot of Murder Mystery, but then again a little tribute to the Oedipus Vrex (New York Stories), Alice, and Broadway Danny Rose, as I suspect from the trailer. <br /> <br /> With the film in the film, Sometimes a woody-proxy, but her character is far from Nebbit, Ferrell Melinda and Melinda or Kenneth Brang tried to be a celebrity. Instead of arctipal ticks and abnormalities, Sonra's dance form comes directly from family history. In many cases "family business" leads to the popipasms that attract her audience, but the roles on the screen can be understood only as strange and sequiturs. Since we're in joke, we can not help but laugh. But laughs did not come from Woody Nabish, but really from the character. Prior to her, Farrell, Brang, Cusack or Mia Farrow, Woody's voice is not required to use Scarlett to inspire Woody's character. <br /> <br /> When commenting about the character played by my friend friend, Sid, Woody, is a supporting character, but the center stage than I am hoping to go. However, at this point Woody really seems to have written a character that fits her current personality. At the time of his Ed Dubl Sage in Everything Else, or his blind director in the Hollywood ending, the character is a comfortable arrangement at this time. Perhaps more importantly, this time the story works in the story. In art synthesis they find themselves, he has more fish than scarlet, which is used for a great comic influence throughout. Sid is a deteriorating playmaker who plays for small audiences, but he kept the front and center for our happiness as he came from another era. <br /> What about Jackman? About Ian (Swurengen) Macshan? I like both of them. I especially liked McShann's small but effective twists. Jackman is beautiful with the convenience of "Old Money", which has been featured in films often 50 years ago. <br /> <br /> Class echoes from Cairo's Purple Rose? <br /> What do I think? Short answer from 1994's Bullets over Broadway, perhaps his best comedy film. Stylized little than Mighty Aphrodite. Deconstructing is less dangerous than Harry. Short time forced to force the crooks or rather than the ending of Hollywood. Woody finally discovered the comic voice working in the 21st century.
