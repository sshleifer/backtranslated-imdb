My favorite movie is style Western, which is really the only American film to be a movie. And despite Sergio Leone, no one likes many Americans. Winchester 73 is on the right side of my list of ten favorite Western countries. It is the black and white film director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart of the first pair and partnership. This is also a milestone film that Stewart has chosen for a percentage of profits, rather than salaries from Universal. <br /> <br /> Antony Mann did not make much of B item, noir type on this topic with such real budgets. Before Winchester 73, Robert Taylor sang good westerns with Devil's Dove, which never received admiration. <br /> <br /> Mann also developed a small stock company as John Ford's legend. <br /> <br /> Miller Mitchell, Steve Brody, Don Durriya, John McIntyre, Jay C. Stewart is seen in the films of Mann along with others such as Flippen and Rock Hudson. <br /> This is a simple story. James Stewart is a Dutch man named Henry Brown and kill him. I can not say why, but at this point we have never seen such sound tensions on the James Stewart screen. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann reached the spirit of Jimmy Stewart and we're with us dragging some giants. <br /> <br /> The film will initially show a hatred. Erfurt did not transport guns in Dodge City after Stewart and Side Mike Millard were disarmed by Virat Erp by Mitchell Will Gear. Dodge City has a shooting competition for Winchester Rifle and the betting favorite has been threatened by Dutch Henry Brown, Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell and Gear Saloon and Stewart and McNally look identical to both and draw for weapons that are not there. <br /> Watch out for Stewart and McNally's short-stories, they say more than ten pages of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Another character in the film is Stewart who plays Waco Johnny Dean, starring Dan Durri. It may be Durie's finest moment on the screen. There is a mental outside killer who is deadly as he draws the left hand even though he has two six guns sport. <br /> Another man met Stewart Shelley Winters was killed and murdered by fianc√©e Furea Durrie. Her best scenes are with her drawn fancy. She plays for her time until she can safely get out of him. <br /> <br /> There are some amazing performances in some small roles, and there is no sour note in the cast. John McIntyre is a shifty Indian trader, Jay C. Flippen grizzed Army Sergeant and Rock Hudson as his younger face as a young Indian chief. John Alexander, also known as 'Theodore Roosevelt' in Arsenic and Old Lace, also had a brief, but impressive role as the owner of the business post at different times. <br /> <br /> Man and Stewart combine eight films with five Western songs, ready to make a sixth West and Night Passage, and they walked in the set and Man set. Beautiful partnership ending that produces some quality images.
