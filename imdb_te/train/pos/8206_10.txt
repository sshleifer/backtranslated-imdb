Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Colony in the 4th film of the Dirty Harry series. Clint was outdated but he had not yet received Harry's hawk (after unforgettable "My Day Make" catchphrase!), But Harry has taken leave, the woman has taken leave, the woman has been alerted after a rape raid and punks one by one Starts getting started. The last film to see Sandra Locke in the Client Eastwood movie! Improved after implementing it a bit more of a comedy and less intense. Clint Eastwood's sunglasses are gargoes, which are famous for the sunglasses wearing Arnold Schwarzenegger at The Terminator. Watch if you have a watch like Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry movies or criminal crime thrillers.
