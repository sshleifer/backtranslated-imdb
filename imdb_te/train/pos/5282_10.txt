I do not know ... some people may have a tribute to the Muslims' religious actions (Haj), but I have been very much esteemed. Only 223 people were filmed in 2004 and have since won several awards. That's why a good acting film in the film. Rada, a French young man who is sitting for a balacourate, asks his devoted aged father to take Mecca. (If they do not know much about Islam) Father wants his son to run them once a lifetime religious home from their home in France to Saudi Arabia. The productive distinction between father and son is based on simple enough words ('You can learn how to read and write, but you do not know anything about life,' the fatherless father of his son), but the use of Bromidic generation gap literature avoids. Among them are their frustrations. Rada does not speak French but has not spoken in French even though she understands Arabic. Although they faced many people on the road: "The horrified elderly woman they chose on the border of Belgrade, the shy women wearing Burkas on the way to Munafa (Jackie Nersian) Damascus, who help them at the Turkish border" is always the father and son of vision. There are not many conversations in the picture that makes your eyes so happy. Every town they visit will see spectacular scenes.The blue mosque and Hagia Sophia will also be visible even if the film is not too long. <br /> <br /> In general, I take their power from the dislikes and camera subtleties that do not like movies but this one is great. Some unanswered details (such as the unseen French girlfriend of Red) Sensual Picture Appeals. The great work of art and this film is the first of Ismael Ferroukhi's memorabilia.
