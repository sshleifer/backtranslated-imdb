My all-time favorite movie. Oscar-caliber work for everyone, both front and back of the camera. The screenplay is accurate, and unlike the novel, the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs, which is completely satisfying. Other prominent characters take care of the writer Peter Barnes and the Oscar for serious visual beauty director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Mind. It's the best work of Josie Lawrence, and I changed my opinion of Joan Plowrite. After watching this film at least 50 times, I could not find any mistake. Music by renowned composer Richard Rodney Bennett is a miracle.
