I saw the film on BBC on July 27, 2005 for the first time. It's a good description of Conan Doyle for me, and I'm really surprised by what I think about Sherlock fans. I also think about whether or not these fans will accept what they say. Doyle could ask whether he is a strong man or he has questioned himself. Yet he is the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much semi-biological history is it? I have moved this adaptation to you, the movie you want to see - even if you're not interested in Sherlock Holmes movies or books - see it, have fun and have your own impression.
