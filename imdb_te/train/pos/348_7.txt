<br /> <br /> These Valentine cards are witty and well thought out. <br /> <br /> This is a line of a peach in the movie ... "He's no Angel ...." when he's actually Angel !!! <br /> <br /> The cast is demonstrating young talent, but the story does not give them enough real depth. Denis Richards seemed to think of the most closely related girls on DVD extras, and you give the feeling of being tied to their characters. Sorry but NO! <br /> The direction is very good, managing to show very little realistic gore, and the threat depended on your imagination. Miss Richards and Hegel are also not supporting their clothing. <br/> <br /> <br /> In particular, the main direction plus the various other "liabilities" <br /> <br /> The mask of the heart is stalled, along with "masking" of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Anybody who has hidden a body is pretty good for me! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "We have a good slasher, but not sensational, Nothing !!!
