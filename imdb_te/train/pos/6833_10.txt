Beautiful picture, pure cassavetes style. With success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism, Jeena Roland offers a spectacular performance of a deteriorating actress. She tries to escape his own subconscious demons, stimulating the death of a young man. The true purpose of this film is, even if it accepts the nature of human nature and its overall difficulties. Paradoxically between the stage scenes and the film: it's like if the venue for the heroine has changed. All American films are the only ones that are superior, even if you are dealing with adult relationships and trying to authenticate and authenticate feelings ... one of the best dramas. 10/10.
