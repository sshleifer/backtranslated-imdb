First, I do not like it. Acting is not really up to the hamlet scales. Branagh was mostly over-the-top, speaking too much. In my opinion, actors who are not big-name celebrities generally do a good job; Except Billy Crystal and Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you have a lot to talk to me in the drama of the play, Shakespeare today is difficult to understand many people; Many people are known as Serious Literature and its Old English Language because they do not like to try. If they see this film they will clearly understand the description of at least one man of the play. Shakespeare's viewers have seen it: sword fighting and wars, and mighty kings and nobles, murder and incest, nasty schemes and ghosts - and great art, if you look at one, is not much of Shakespeare's day, many more than now. <br /> <br /> "Some of the people complained that" it was set in the 19th century, not Shakespeare's time " Well, their dress and scenery at Shakespeare is their own day.Shakespeare may have Said in Ancient Rome or Medieval Denmark or in any of the days, but he does not wear his clothes as his characters, For example, King John had guns for English and French - in Robin Hood's day, in the Julius Caesar they talk about chimneys, which could not be found for thousands of years, and yet in Henry IV I'm talking about MacIvelli, who is not yet born Bhyantaram silly like that - you can not even play danislo (they are not all those who are living in Denmark?) Can make a complaint.
