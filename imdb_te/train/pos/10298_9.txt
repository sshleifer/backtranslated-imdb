I am happy to see Jim Carrey in the film that I do not aim at above. His role is like all of us. God wants us to be more satisfied and deliver us. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman became a great god. <br /> <br /> I thought Jennifer Aniston's character was very difficult and had a sense of Carrie. <br /> I did not know what was happening to me because the previews had ruined very powerful funny scenes. /> <br /> I've read a number of reviews and some seem to be too small. <br /> <br /> This summer is not meant to solve comedy and problems in the world, but some messages are related to us. <br /> <br /> A funny picture.
