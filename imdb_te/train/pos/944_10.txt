You can put a "Christmas carol" version of Charles Dickens with sack puppets, perhaps to watch it. This is one of my favorite stories since I was a child. I thought it would be better for everyone, and so no one is free, I appeal to you, but for whatever reason I can not miss the chance to see one of the many screen prototypes of this timeless classic. <br /> <br /> This version really stands out to be the gravitational gravitational pull of the cast. In the past we have heard dozens of lines in the past all new intensity, and each character becomes more real and reliable in the hands of this fantastic ensemble. <br /> <br /> Scott was an Emmy in 1985 for this role. In addition to his current credit of Scoutz, he was recently replaced by one of his best performances, in his opinion, instead of his latest credit. He did not intelligently pursue the British voice, but rather distributed his lines in his famous lyric voice. His scrooge is not just a cranky old man (as he is often portrayed), but a deep anger harbors the person against the world. As he visited by three spirits each, we understood how this anger took root, grew, and finally sang his soul. As he is forced to review his life, we see him as alternately smooth, and it becomes unforgettable confusing. And in the great dramatic scene when he kneels and crys at his great grave, he tries to convince the third spirit of his repentance and the desire to change his life, his knee is literally and decorative. Scotch Schugz has made it a completely believable and painful human being. <br /> <br /> Scott's performance is impressive, the collective of supporting actors significantly contributes to the dark beauty of this version. Fred Holwell, a nephew of the screws, is a good example. Often portrayed as a friendly buffoon where he played with the emotional intensity of the missing from previous films by Roger Reese. "I do not ask you anything, I do not want anything from you, why are we not friends?", We see his frustration in his face, but only from him is the self-imposed separatist cousin of the screws. This is one of the most dramatic scenes of a moving performance and movie. <br /> <br /> Performance by Frank Finlay Scorsese's last partner, Jacob Marley, was an excellent English actor. In many versions of the story, the scene with Marley is a low point in the film, making it difficult to persuade a dead person, and the results are usually just silly (ooooh, look, it's a horror ghost ....... not in this version) Very inspired view. The Marley entrance, the door of the screws, is amazingly creepy, like the sounds of their own deal on the go and the echoing chains throughout the house. But Finlays Marley is not a soul spirit. He is a tormented spirit, inspiring both horror and pity. Marley might have been a ghost, but his anger and regret over wasteful life in the pursuit of wealth, and his sins are now better and more human beings. We do not believe that the Scoug, which is also scratched by these blacksmiths, as shifted by Finlay. <br /> <br /> In this movie you really are George C. When Scott is opposite, the scene is stealthily stealing. <br /> <br /> This is the first time we are experiencing this story after another. Edward Woodward (the need to remember him from the equalizer) becomes both fun and frightening words like the Ghost of Christmas Ghost. When he presented the leading line, "It may be more worthless and less fit for you to live than millions like this poor man's baby in the eyes of heaven" He is no longer a fun Santa Claus surrogate, but who is a rejectioning angel <br /> <br /> Susan York is awesome Soon Mrs. Cratchit, and David Warner brings tremendous depth to the long-suffering Bob Cratchit, poverty, unhealthy child, and an unprotected boss. His face substitutes his cheerful courage, and sometimes, in situations where his fearless circumstances are disturbing. Later, in the scene displayed by Screw Christmas's Ghost, short Tim, Warner's performance will be tearful to the tears while in the Come to Come crash family after death.
