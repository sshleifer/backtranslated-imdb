Completely deserves its prestigious Hollywood Award nomination, there is an entertaining little gem of these pizzas and some delightful surprises. There is a wonderful lively shoot (and back to shoot) in the scene of a WW1 trench with Australian comedian Clyde Kuk as a positive non-com and Bohem / Kolman Messenger? Under the beady eye of all the Ralph Sanford's delightful angry discharges; Lost MacDucks guided by Jack Carson equally perplexed and guided back; Assistant Director Chandler was pleased with the opportunity to be sent in a Macdox: "I'll be a director!" <br /> <br /> Ace Comic O'Hallon has a dual role, playing McDoks and himself playing McDoks! Unusually, Richard L. Bear participated in one or more other entries in the series, where he rejected the offer. In real life, Bear is a small, six-foot rock Hudson form, but here he is a famous actor (500 films!), Jacked by Jack Mover.
