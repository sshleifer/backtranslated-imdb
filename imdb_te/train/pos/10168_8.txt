See Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in the movie about the death of a sweet girlfriend's new friend. This is a man who wears "Sex Panther Cologne" from Desperate Housewives in Gabriel and Uncorman. If you're nominating a Golden Globe movie, you have to rethink how you watch movies. However, if you want to see the reality of suspended reality 90 minutes and see a funny picture then you come to the right place. The characters are all funny. They work well together. Real match is up to Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He's funny as he's in friends and she's funny and nice looking at all at the same time. I went with my wife, she enjoyed it and I did.
