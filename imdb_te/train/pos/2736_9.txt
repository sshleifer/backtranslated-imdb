A unique image ... is the best. Acting, script, Quincy Jones score, cinematography, editing, etc. - just amazing. Many people know that, this film is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas farm family (clutters) of young boys during a flawed robbery. Never before have I ever seen it turned into a real inspired film. <br /> <br /> The actors are solid throughout the board, but on vision killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement law enforcing them. Scott Wilson, Dick Hickoch is awesome. Cocky, confused, and unkind, he comes across as beautiful, oily and acceptable. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is unusual - alone, and simultaneously sympathetic and cold-blooded. Can these features be redirected to a person and can we buy it? He does, and it's brilliant! The main purpose of the book is that these two very different sociologists create complex masses to perform these stupid and brutal crimes, and the two actors work beautifully. There were moments in their later career, but these shows were high water marks, and it was the acting period. <br /> <br /> The cops are very good. John Forshite, who led the investigation, but the remaining three detectives are great. Unlike contemporary film makers for producers who need police to fill with superstitious assets or weaknesses, these are just a real read. They seem real. I never saw cops on their screen ever in their authenticity; And most of the criminal abilities are going back. Really one of these is a kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Particle Spiraler Coming Soon (This film is unique if you know what has already happened, but I'm warning for the record). <br /> <br /> In fact, the best scenes from the best crime scenes and movies are interrogating - intellectual fencing cops and crooks, the mono is a mono. In this movie you are in the hands of the best interactive scenes you can watch in the movie. Dick and Perry look to make their way and slowly open up, do not know about the cops stuff. But the police are taught to break their suspicions and make a hopeful confession. This is the best performance you are looking for. Think Glengarry Glen Ross Without Showboating. <br /> <br /> The ICB was originally shot at the original Clatter House to translate the unpleasant and horrifying facets of this true story, and I heard that I played clotics to give the film a real feel to them. It works. This looks like a good, simple folk. It makes the crime quick and sad. <br /> I'm here. It's not a good feeling, but it's one of the best movies ever made, and it's very special, it's essential for every movie.
