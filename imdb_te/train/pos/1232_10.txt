Very funny picture. 80s Classic Film Eddie Murphy. I saw when I was a child and I had a good memory. Murphy's traditional satire does not fail, the film is funny, well done. In the '80s, Murphy is joking about everything very dangerous. Some people may only appreciate this result, but since 1986 the II film has been changed. The atmosphere for the image of the time is good and good for the period of special effects. The contrasting Murphy is a good movie to admire the taste of a recent disappeared actor. The final piece is the actors who love to play a piece of Tulanka Mank. That's it.
