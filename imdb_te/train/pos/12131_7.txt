The film is concerned about Philip (Leslie Howard), a serious but disabled medical student. He falls in love with a heartfelt and robbery servant called Mildred (Betty Davis) .She leaves him and joins with others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). Meanwhile he romanced with another suitors (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee) but she goes back in her mutilated affair. <br /> <br /> Somerset Mum's novel is the best and best of the many images of the novel. Betty Davis Cocktini won another incredible explanation with a spectacular and attractive appearance as a cruel waitress, slavery from beginning to end is absolutely hypnotic in her account. Davis grew up with Stardom with her performance. The rigid and raw character dominant woman acting posteriors is repeated several times. Leslie Howard essentially devastated a good and good student and provided a spectacular and melancholy presentation. He was an excellent actor (in the air) along with the producer and writer and died in plane crash during WWII. Both are played again at the Petrified Attention (1936). The atmosphere of the film is extensively convincingly rebuilt in the RKO (Radio Picture Inc.) studio. Edmund Gould, with Elimore Parlor and Paul Hendrid, was reconstructed in 1946; And in 1964 Ken Hughes collaborated with Kim Novak and Lawrence Harvey. I like the movie classic cinema buffs. Rating: Very good but dated slightly.
