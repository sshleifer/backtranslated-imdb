"The X-Smita Bradford" (1936), starring Thin Man Series star William Powell, released the same year, the second slimmant "Aap the Thin Man", which was fun and fake for the genre. Loy missed, in fact, is not a lie. , I'm seriously stressed to name a better alternative than Jean Arthur and chemistry between Arthur and co-star William Powell is real and it is fun, romantic and involved. <br /> <br /> Story and screenplay Anthony Wiener and John Wayne's production company partner James Edward Grant ("The Angel & the Bad Man") is close to working with a narrow man, but lacks the right humor and tension . <br /> It is not in the stroo premise of the movies of 'The Thin Man' (what else is it?), "X-Mrs. Bradford" dozens of the most entertaining and missarie-comedy dozens of '30's & 40's'.
