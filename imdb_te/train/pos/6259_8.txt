I'm really uncomfortable for reading this movie as "boring" and a beautiful scene is marooned by black and white footage. It was made in 1925! I think it's time is absolutely incredible! <br /> <br /> The journey that these people are going to go is absolutely remarkable. It took them a week to cross a river. Women carried their sticks to a large solid rocket, sometimes carrying their children in heavy wooden tubs in the snow. I want to see anyone now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a wonderful movie with some really amazing shots and a fantastic story.
