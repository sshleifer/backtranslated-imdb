Recent views of this entertaining motivated me to see many classic MGM music from forty and fifty. ANCHORS AWEIGH is definitely less picture than in the city. The songs are not as good, or the chemistry between the characters. But the film is beautifully intertwined as music favorite, like Tchaikovsky. The scene at the Hollywood Bowl, running up and down from the forests above Sinatra and Kelly, is a scene when playing a dozen pianos in the piano, but it is the best scenario in which the mouse Kelly dances with Jerry Mouse. Classical music enthusiasts recognize music playing pianists. Sinatra then croons, "I Fall In Love, Easily", about his love before having his epiphany. The color is beautiful, Hollywood is beautiful in its mountains and polluting winds (you can imagine Hollywood in the twenties, split between the 1940s!) And piano music is absolutely fantastic. MGM definitely has a skill to create stripe movements like this.
