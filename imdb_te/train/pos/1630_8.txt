I am very good to some of the two sons of the film. I also saw this movie when it comes up and I agree with the last post Acememy up ahead of its' time. The magic of the film is a pure mad magazine. I do not know why MAD is behind this feature. At that time L.A. It was one of the early 80s to have a killer with soundtrack with punk and new wave bands. I own the soundtrack and I play constantly to this day. What can i say There are definitely bad films. I do not consider Porky's being funny as the Academy up, there are some good smiles throughout the film, and jokes either stereotypes come or flipped. Hey, no one says this is a Maltese Falcon.
