Never seen the film and sing and dance by Cagni and other actors: Dick Powell, (Scott Blair) great voice and Ruby Keeler (Bee Thorne). James Cognny plays the role of Chess Kent, who wrote music writers and eventually produces the Prologs shown in the 1930s featured in the movie industry. Chester has trouble with people who are trying to steal his ideas for his performances. This is a very entertaining film with a lot of comedy and laughs. Jon Blondel, (Non Prescott) was a great and beautiful character. Dick Powell was a great singer and dancer and started with his long and successful screen career. Enjoy.
