This spectacular film is the only way to disrupt the storytelling story with the lives of the characters to make it for the power from the frantic flamenco dancing, and the filmmakers. Spellbinding is the only word I use to describe the experience. It's not 'business's carmen' by any business standard. It's not authentic. Every nuanced glance, every stomach of the foot, every part of the music is so captivatingly intertwined that you can not take your eyes off the screen. You do not have to love the opera or flamenco (I will not) capture, capture, and capture through this image. Sensitive and direct; Loud and still; If there is one, if not the best, it's kind of movies, so there are a few like.
