I was very impressed with what I could do with a eighteen year old video camera, because I rated this ten. It's not epic, but it's very busy and I'm never bored. If millions of dollars are able to go into a lot of bad movies dumped, give the director the same amount and see what happens. I know she'll lining up at the local cinema for her first major release. Damon is a good job, and well worth the money. What a script! It may be low budget but half of the major pictures I've seen lately beats out of hell. I know the story, story and screen on the screen. She can not wait to see more and more.
