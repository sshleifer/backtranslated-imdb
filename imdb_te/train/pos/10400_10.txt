Probably the best Fantasy film ever made. Excellent color, wonderful sets, incredible, spot-on on Micklos Rossa musical score, perfect for every scene and mood. Acting in low-handed and hard work is good, but here the poetic dialogue is deftly and delicate (humor is also subtle and happy). <br /> <br /> The suspicious Spielberg and Lucas are trapped by this one. <br /> <br /> Alexander Corda and London Films are one of the best movies ever to be released, including "The Four Feeters" (1939). Classic!
