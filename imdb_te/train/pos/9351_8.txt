On September 11, 2001, millions died; But 2,819 people died in a particularly gruesome manner. They destroy its unique mission buildings, but more importantly, the terrorists are the victim of a plane embezzlement. <br /> <br /> The film loses their lives through this tragic incident and sees a deeper view of the four people who have suffered loss of their lives. <br /> <br /> Charlie Finlayman (played by Adam Sandler), a former dentist in New York, loses his wife and three children on September 11 as they are on their way to Los Angeles. Mentally bored by events, he will eventually lose himself with everyone who remembers his previous life; His in-laws and his best friend (respectively, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, and Mike Bender). He was totally rejected and his best to forget about his previous life. This will continue until he runs in his old college friend Alan Johnson (played by Don Cheadle), who is unable to remember the fine man. It starts to catch both of these, but Finnman believes that he has sent him to persuade him to help people in his former life. Slowly, but surely, Finnman will retrieve his trust for Johnson. <br /> <br /> Alan Johnson's life is in the wrong way when all this happens. He is a dentist (dentist), helping to start dental education. One day, a patient of Donna Remar (played by Robber Burrows) tries to make a move on him, who wants to have sex with her mouth. This is an unwelcome surprise for Dr. Johnson, who is married to two children. When he comes home from work on a special occasion, he sees his old friend (Finlayman) and tries to flag him. He did not succeed, but he received another opportunity and Phinemann persuaded the coffee to catch him, despite the fact that he does not know who he is. <br /> <br /> The things about this film use music as a source. One of the psychics of Finnman is music, especially Springsteen and other classic rock artists. When Fineman wants to open up his past or ask him to talk about unpleasant things, he pushes the world with his music and his music. <br /> When the movie ends, I'm thinking: losing my family? How will I deal with such tragedies? It is something we really do not think too often. We always think we are there and we often take what we mean. We recognize how important it is when it's too late; Such a blow can physically, physically, mentally and physically destroy. I really do not know how to deal with something like that. I face the problem head, cope and move on in my life or do I hold my headphones and prevent the world?
