I really enjoyed "Dr. Mordrid". It's a low-budget movie, some of which can be turned off, but I do not have a problem with it. I enjoyed more, considering WAY more fun than Drivel than Hollywood flares out every year. It's too bad that it did not get a theatrical release; I do not know anyone, but I have gone to see the theaters. "Doctor Mordrid 'is a fun science fiction movie I can only enjoy, especially if they are into science fiction like anyone, I do not see why it's a R-rated film, just a F-word, and no deadly death scenes, or any blood Witches Anton and Coball (Anton wanted cobb slaves to use his powers to protect human race The plot is a feeling of the story, but the story adds charm to the story, usually just plain fun to watch this movie: While Jeffrey Combs watches, that blue blue cape and suit wearing it Every time I make a smile, but I'm turning ... Whatever, acting was great, the main characters (Anton, and his Lay Log friend, Samantha), most prefer, Anton sympathetically, as a guest, and Samantha is friendly. Plus, the settings are spectacular. The floating island in the sense that it was very cold, we had to give only a glimpse of it twice; It was great to see more scenes happen here. The main setting is very good; Anton's apartment is very spacious, and he has some cool devices, especially the way he oversees tracking global supervisors. He also kept an eagle in his apartment. Overall, this is a great film; It was fun to watch, and the main actors were feeling a lot of their characters. If you can find Dr Mordrid rentals anywhere, you must rent (or, in my case, buy it definitely money well) <br /> <br />
