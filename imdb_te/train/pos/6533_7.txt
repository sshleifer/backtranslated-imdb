I'm not very exciting, but talking about fashion and unnatural ways to solve mystery. A little too easy, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDB ... it's amazing! <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Flitter) is very happy ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Theriot) is undoubtedly ... he is alright, the disguise and fashion of the movie. Anyway, I would recommend this film, for the summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. Emma Roberts More Teen Spy Movies .. SpitMot ... Remember? She turned out to be good at this tricky detective work.
