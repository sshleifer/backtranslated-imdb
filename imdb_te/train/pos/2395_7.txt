The festival circuit in Austin (eskeesesvi film) met in spite of misfortune, not Shakespeare in Love, and Elizabeth, as well as tiring, to qualify for the audience of this film. In an exhibition of "The Scottish Play", an internal vision called "Macbeth" to avoid a curse at the "The Scottish Play" show, is a crisp, efficient and beautiful treatment of the betrayal of the band. It's a wonderfully reminiscent score, and sounds noisy than its small budget, a silent gem, not world class, but completely satisfying.
