I am looking forward to reading this on some of the messages on message boards - but I can not stop laughing when I see it! It's officially my new favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know all the hates here, because this kind of film has never come earlier. I'm missing another woman-driven comedy name. Most comedians have one or two actresses, but there are a lot of male characters. This is one exception for almost all women - Seth Meers, Justin Hart, and Will Arnett - and it worked. <br /> <br /> The charm of the film is in me, its subtle feminist message: You are the one who agreed, the women's achievements in the public sphere, the strength of the female friendships and the gender roles. <br /> <br /> The rest of the rest are more challenging with their feminist values, and the main characters face each other what they know themselves. Without a big-name actor getting all-male cast and studios behind it, I lost the film theater release and I agree. <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> Mind or feminine concentrated comedy love.
