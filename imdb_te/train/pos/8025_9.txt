I love this movie. The songs and stories are very fun. And the song "Goodbye" always moves me. It's a wonderful thing to really care about these things that you have actually made of cloth and fabric and everything to bring toys to life. Great voices and great talent. Why are these other Muppet films that are so much less interesting, moving and funny? Is it just a lot missed by M. Henan?
