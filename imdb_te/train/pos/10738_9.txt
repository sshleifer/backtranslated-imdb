The Activities of a NYFD 9/11 The film is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on WTC.2 French film makers to counter this program in New York and make it very much. / 11 Nothing really happens which really gives more horror as the movie scenario. On the day of the attacks it appears to be another daunting day in the work, but it will soon change. While filmmakers were on the road, he painted the first crash plane as a film, the first effective footage. He goes to the WTC and goes inside the building. People realized that the second plane was not in danger. In the next period we are planning to save the fire forces as much as possible. Meanwhile, we heard sounds of noises, the sounds of people who jumped from the dome, the ground on the ground, the most serious moment in the documentary. Then the Tower will collapse and our friend's friend should run for his life, when he ran out of the building while listening to a madman's breath. Then a huge sand storm blazes on him and the screen turns dark, he is fortunate to survive and now he has drawn down streets of downtown New York. Because this documentary has a lot of historical footage and because this documentary is completely different because everybody's memory is in memory. Because I was in the afternoon the attacks remained at home, so to see what's more realistic. 10/10
