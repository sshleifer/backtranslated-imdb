John Travolta, the world's largest honor, and mechanical bull ... what can you ask? Yes, you're probably not too surprising or getting this deep meaning. However, I always enjoyed watching this red neck romance. Bud (Travolta) and Cissy (Debra Winger) in the districts and fall in love. You have a hardcore redneck couple all the difficulties you could imagine. Hoskinkton scenes are fun with dance, mechanical bull riding, and-so-needed brawls. It has a 1980s country soundtrack, "Love For All Love Wangs", "The Devil Went Down Down to Georgia", and "Hello Texas" by my favorite Jimmy Buffett. Leave your cowboy boots and have a boot-scooty 'boogie! <br /> <br /> *** (4)
