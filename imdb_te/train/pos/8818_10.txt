It was clear initially that 9/11 of the Second World War and Vietnam were jointly involved in several films; However, there is a big risk that most of these movies are better for Pearl Harbor (or rather: Evil). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> All 11 episodes are very good ( For example, Yusuf Chahin has unnecessary prolog with many cuts and Shohi Imamura's really extreme ending) or sections are in the correct order (Imamura only, Twin Towers does not directly direct, the film must be opened, Ejandro Gonzales Inarritu's rather late, it is one of the most impressive). But it is an interesting image that makes an impressive effort and respond to the collapse of the twin mask of other parts of the world. <br /> <br /> "She's what happened in New York and indicates the silence of a minute or part of Idesa Ouedraogo (you have a bin Laden-double similar to a real one you will be shocked when you see him <br /> <br /> When his elected president was on September 11, 1973, "Our Tuesday Sep Ken (11), a definite (and very angry) Allende was killed and his dictatorship was generous from Pinochet Henry Kissinger and the CIA, which became a fierce attempt in anti-Americanism, but it turned out to be a contradictory story, Shares my identity in the best segment (mainly sound impressions and phone time S eyes, sometimes a few pictures of people falling down to the WTC and eventually collapsing the tower, opening the screen and a question) and Amos guitay explodes in Tel Aviv, a crazy reporter who is desperately trying to get the air after a car bomb <br /> <br /> These are the different sections (I am Claude Lela About a deaf girl about Chow, the show of women's Danis Tanovik's show, Mira Nair has not yet mentioned - the Indian director takes part in a novelty, but the most appealing of Western tastes - 9/11 after a son with a terrible suspicion and Ernest Borgin (yes , Ernest Borgin) was the most frustrating one's wife Life can be imagined) It is not easy to see as a special film, forgetful. This film is a classic known for all thirty years from now. I hope the world will be remembered to start a long tradition of cinema movies. But, alas, it's very probable, it's an image-only effort to remember. And the happy ending of the audience is one of the few 9/11 films that do not reduce this horrible event with love story.
