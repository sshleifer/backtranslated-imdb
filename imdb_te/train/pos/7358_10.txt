<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> The trace of expressionism is clear in the film, covering the flawless loneliness of the films. Gabi (AKA Joey) played the role of Eva Longoria and did not even get her to mention her in her movie. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is, without doubt, a heroic rescue by MC Clarey, who saved young disabled children with a speech barrier. I like perfection! The use of James Cahill's Sound Effects does not match today. The original acting act in the film is true when pressed. When I saw the film for the first time, I was forced to leave the gang deep in the brothers, the Saussuite gang and the CTM (cut throat mafia). <br /> <br /> Personally, this film has a sentiment value and I will download it in the near future. If I found anywhere, it's LOL!
