79/100. Fred Astier and Ginger Rogers have never been together but have never done great movies. This is not one of their best, it's a wonderful musical. Some extraordinary musical numbers are good support from Randolph Scott. Two prominent performances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball are memorable start screen shows. Ball is good, and beautiful. "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best of music duo. Harry Hollard plays Ginger Roger's sister as Harriet Nelson of "Ozzy and Harriet". The basic plot is pretty familiar, but this exceptional with a cast, it works. Excellent art direction and score.
