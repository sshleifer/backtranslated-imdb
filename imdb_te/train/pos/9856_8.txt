<br /> <br /> I do not know what I think about the movie. There is not a child's image too much. It must be seen with a parent as death and dying. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed 81 minutes. (Less without credits too) and the trailer gets you to think of a major creature of rats. But alas, they tortured him. Until the end of the right picture. The two Gryps film occupy 2 stars. But I will recommend the film. <br/> <br/> <br/> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 7/10
