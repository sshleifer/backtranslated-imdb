I'm honest. I received this movie, and I enjoyed it. I mean, do not come to the "hood of the Living Dead"? What other reaction will I have? The thing is, however, the film (and its makers) decided it's not going to be fun. <br /> <br /> Instead, it has tried to be the best film to be a good film. <br /> What do you know? It was very close. Not surprisingly, it's not a classic of zombie motion picture style, but it still has a pretty neat little picture of its own: a little cheese, photography, acting, and events (like props - like Best Buy Back). And acting, writing and pacing are surprisingly good than I expected. <br /> <br /> There is some good humor like our two debates on how to decide if the dead zombie really dies. <br /> <br /> You may be in the lowest budget (leaving fingerprints in each, alas) almost continuous obscenity, which can be pretty pleasant in movies. No, it's not great. Yes, it might be nice. But producers, actors, crews, they tried to make good film (instead of camp classic) and counts for a lot. <br /> <br /> The line of campy zombie movies is a mile long, and thanks, guys, for not adding. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Quirous Brothers. I want to see what they do. And hey, anyone, give them a budget!
