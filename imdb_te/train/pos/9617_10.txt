This is a very entertaining film and I really enjoyed it, although I generally did not rent these films (i.e. indie flicks), I was impressed by the film because it had fantastic actors, from which I liked the Jamie Kennedy screw trilogy. Many of the filmmakers (and I mean) take the risk of telling many people's lives (and this is a risky risk) and interrupts at different intervals. That risk is good because the risk is good. <br /> There are some main characters in the film; Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) - An unsatisfying wealth of cookie writer and his relationship with his girlfriend are on rocks due to a claim. Wallace Gregory (John Carroll Lynch) - An airplane loader / technician who loves all the creatures (perhaps excluding meter mids) and who has bad luck despite his good heart. Siri (Brian Cox) - Germabof, owner of a Chinese restaurant / donut shop, and he is forced to stand by his assistant (Alexis Cruise) as his assistant / cook. Ernie - (Christopher Bauer) married Olive - (Christina Kirk) convinced he was convinced; Enjoy him, look ridiculously, go frantic, and do not live a normal life. They have small and almost silly arguments and Olive begins to have doubts about seriously Ernie. Gordon - (Grant Heslow) whose life is not going to go quite well, because bad things begin to take in his life, and he decides to take it in hand. Mitchell - (Jon Hurtas) Gwen - (Alexandra Westcourt) is a girl of her dreams and they are not intended to be one another, and she is convinced that she is more suspicious. He tries to get his every chance, and he certainly tries! Johnston - (Michael Hitchcock) has been dismissed from his job and has doubts about his role as a provider, doing just another job that he does not fit. <br /> <br /> His wife Anneel - (Aabella Feel) She finds that she is not a husband Johnston, but by the loss of her job. <br /> All of this is exactly what the film is! <br /> <br />
