It sang. It's play. It's comedy. It's a story. This is one of the greatest films ever made ... as long. If you can not enjoy this movie, you should have something in sleep or mental confusion. James Cagny sang his way to the Academy Award in "Yankee Doodle Dandy" and dance; But he is good in this movie! This is James Cognny at his quisessential best! He's fast with a liner! He fast with his feet! This is a continuous action. And the song and dance skies are especially classic, "Shanghai Lill." And the support the cast is great; And the whole picture is upbeat, fast moving, and exudes confidence. And although the film was created 70 years ago, it still remains to be seen. And of course, this film is composed of Miss Ruby Keeler (Al Jalson). She is the perfect partner for James Cogni ... and Dick Powell too! If you like upbeat, fast paced movies, singing and dancing.
