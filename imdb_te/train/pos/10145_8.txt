It's really old fashioned lovely image. Locations are great and the old time is one of Preston's voice movies. Fi then this is when you want to sit back again and watch a movie that is not so much rested then rest. Acting is good, and I really liked Michael Rispoli. He is also in the rounds. And while you're sleeping. The rest of the cast is fun. This is what happens when two people who want to get married are really having their own weddings on the weekend. I know ... sounds cool ... but it is. And it makes fun watching. This will surround your girlfriend or you will leave, but at least you know.
