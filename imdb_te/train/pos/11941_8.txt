They are not jawing journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell from the surprisingly lovely as "sleeves of his girl" or witty detective William Powell and Sunny Lady Thinman from Minne Lai, but enthusiastic sleuths in Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson scoop. Their screwball resume is more postmodern than Post Depression, Allen's writing contradictory self-denial and plain old New York bang. Shades of old knowledge rarely happen, when Sid, the Great Spideri magician, reacted to his background: "I was born in the Hebrew persecution, but when I was older I changed it to Nasicism." Johannson, a bad boy from Allen's Man Point Point, is a relatively good, sometimes unfortunately journalist student found in a well-known murder mystery in London: a serial killer. This plot is the reconstruction of his recent London-based thriller Man Point, right to the "American Tragedy" / Place on top-class sins and the Sun Boating "Risk". In fact, Allen Menhutton was known as Murder Mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo as only a couple of examples. If he again repeats I do not care; <br /> <br /> Alex can not hide his love as a director and actor. The actor was not for Diane Keaton, so Allen took comedy in a good location at Cannon, not greatly amusing, sometimes brilliantly sarcastic: about the suspected top-level murderer, and Sid (Allen) criticisms, "I'm very surprised if he murders a man." It's vintage allen humor. Grig, Tchaikovsky and Strauss made music available to let us know that Woodmans had lost his touch, even though there were not so many bright genres in his film.
