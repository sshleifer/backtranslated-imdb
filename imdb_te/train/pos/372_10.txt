Steven Spielberg wanted to win an Oscar by directing Special Effects Epics (he is the third end of the closest encounters: "The Last Ark Riders", and "ET: The Extra-Trestressal", so he has the special effects of "The Color Purple" Decide to direct the film as long as it contains The first play of Primelberg was a magnificent movie. But the Academy voters who voted in 1985 did not give any respect to Spielberg. "The Color Purple" received 11 Oscar nominations for Best Picture, but Spieleberg was frozen unlikely when nominated as Best Director. A single Oscar, it is not completely closed. It is not correct "Color Purple" Oscar's couple won the first of Wootty Goldberg's fictional film, a woman who suffers from an abusive husband named Dolly Glover, and then gets some thanks to the film for special friends. Oprah Winfrey also entered her film career, and one of Seey's friends was a great show like Sofia. Since I was in Chicago, I had already called Windfire from the Tan Show (there was no countrywide release). Like Goldberg, any debut film! Margaret Avery Shug Avery is superb as another mistress who is the mistress of Sally's rotten husband. Two actresses were well-received Oscar nominations for their work (Goldberg for Best Actress, Winfrey and Avery as Best Supporting Actress). In the first half of the 20th Century set in the south, "The Color Purple" movie is very strong, which finally cries me. It also made me laugh too many times. Why the Academy is so difficult to nominate Spielberg for the best director of voters is still a mystery still for me today. But Spielberg won "Shindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan" after two Oscars, making him one of the best film directors. But he needs to be nominated for this film. He is "AT" Special effects like blockbuster jobs <br /> <br /> **** (from four)
