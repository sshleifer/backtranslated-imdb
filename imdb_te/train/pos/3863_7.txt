This is an interesting series that takes people in real life (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) ... and as part of their original story with the continuous series of participants in the story. Railroad detective "Matt Clark" - plays partly in recognizing popular laws from Old West in partly based stories on real accounts. In that perspective, this is almost a volumetric series, and as it was suggested, this odd construction poses some timely conflicts with real events, but it is more fun to satisfy Western Westerners 1950s audience - and it still looks pretty good after 55 years. Clarke dismissed a powerful man in his Western gear, as he goes against bad bad things in history. And his girl sideways Frankie is very dish. If you are a Western fan, check it if you have the chance.
