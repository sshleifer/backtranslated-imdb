Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, a toaster, and a frying pan. . . If you do not mind mental-thriller or horror movies and have a special place in your heart for your twist, it's a picture for you. The first well-to-do-well-documented film, "Hate of Minitt", has the main hits, such as the traditional segments like "Silence of the Lambs" and "Army of Darkness". Editing and effects are well-made, much better than most of the genres of the genre. Collios combines a complex story of painting on the Bible and Po works. The big budget, big name movies do not have much time in the way of ingredient, the independent film has reproduced this dying character. If you love Michigan, check a good story or a good thriller "Hate of Minitt".
