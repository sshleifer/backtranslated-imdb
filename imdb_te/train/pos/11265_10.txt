I do not know anyone before I saw Robert Wuhl. But after seeing I realized what a funny man he was. This HBO Special teaches him "American History" for New York University filmmakers and the man is simply unusual. He's just fun in almost every key historical event in the US but in some other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy is a great satire, which is really true if I accept it as true realistic history. <br /> <br /> Mr. Woolh has combined and learned useful information with great humor. Very exciting. I would recommend those who are interested in history and I am ready to question his / her beliefs.
