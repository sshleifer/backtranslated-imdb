One day I took this satellite station in Bravo. At first I decided to see it with curiosity. Do not be disappointed to be perfectly honest. The main character is beautiful and her body looks nicely.You can not waste her talent as an artist but after seeing the whole picture clearly! My only real stomach pain is the actor's performance in playing Melnik's character.Crist is his bad! The prison guard Hank is very distressed. Drunk and his co-guard at the Wanda fortunefully dude with the wizard as a viewer for the magic and for the hank. Music used is long and creates the perfect environment for executions. The film is looking for a very beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
