Gomez Pereira is responsible for the latest Spanish cinema's most disappointing comedy (looking at her curriculum vitae), so I did not expect more feelings of "Cassa que hassen ..." I really wanted to see why I was in the world. Anyway, I did ... and what is the surprise. It looks like Gomez Pereira finally mature and now he has the ability to make a good image. He is the Mid Life Crisis, Disappointment, and Final Job Contracts seeking a second chance after you all have been offended. The last half hour (more dramatic) is the best part of the film, and it's just worth watching the movie. Eduard Fern√°ndez is playing a major role and I'm thinking of his best actor (till now). <br /> * My rate: 7/10
