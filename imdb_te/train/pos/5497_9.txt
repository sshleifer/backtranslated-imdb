An incredible part of the documentary, a clear description of a country is deeply divided into it (for more credentials, check out some of the comments on IMDb!). Oliver Stone's "Commandant" (which is primarily a deep test of Fidel Castro's nasal holes). Everything Chavez presented to herself, I do not know whether there is one in the long line of label-Latin American "cadillacs". He does not know whether he will be able to make good estimates that he has clearly built between the vast majority of Venezuelans. It's impossible to answer such questions - it's pretty beautiful, but what's in stock is pretty, it's caught up in a rebellion. Someone says, "We're making history" in the movie, it seems to be extracted. The best things.
