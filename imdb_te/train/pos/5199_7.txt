This is a great African American classic comedy, but one of the greatest American cult classic ever. I recently acquired Rudy Ray Moore collection collection. If you love old-school karate movies and black comedy, it's for you! They do not make movies like this anymore. My whole family buffs the movie, so this site is a serious help in solving many discussions. I am currently in Iraq. This helps me to connect to the world I know in states. Thanks to IMDb.I I recommend this site to my friends. Dolomite rules! Do not take my words for it, and check them for yourself. There are ten lines of comment on a picture that I think, but if it comes across, I'm all for it!
