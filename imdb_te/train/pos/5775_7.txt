C'mon people, look at the title! LOL! Late Night Creation Fee on Saturday I saw this film years ago. It's a great, cheesy monster movie with ridiculous bad acting and two awesome ethical Hillbills. 2 redneck boat rental guys image! LOL, and you'll love the boat scene that the English man and his wife are talking about all the stars and it is afternoon and sunny. Bloody happy !!! They did not care about the plot and wanted all of these to be shot as fast as possible. Bottom line, if you love 70s, you'll love it.
