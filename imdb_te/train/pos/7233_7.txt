I have not read through all the comments, but at least one poster can be captured by a 30-minute version. I'm excited about them because I did not understand the latter parts of the film even when I corrected them. 30 Minutes In 1917, the film is very small. Tourer's next movie "Poor Little Rich Girl" is 65 minutes long and his previous feature "Pride of the Klan" is over 84 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> I am relieved to see that I am not crazy, it must be part of the missing film and that's why the resolution does not make much sense. <br /> <br /> The movie that will review or show you only half of it ... but it's a really fascinating view that we offer to the insides of a East Coast Movie Studio because I would recommend this film anyway. This is the first film I personally saw based on the film industry. The main character, then starring Hollywood actor Robert Warwick, is an actor who has almost appeared in Preston Sturges films. Warwick is somewhat similar to William S. Hart probably plays a Western actor. After the lovely sequences set in the studio, he finds a country girl (Doris Kenyon), persuading her for a screen test that goes far beyond a New York jersey. Again, I would recommend anyone interested in film history for documentary value, but in the form it does not have much grip on a film and is not a good example of the work of Maurice Torrener.
