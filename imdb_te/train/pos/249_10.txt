I have seen this movie trailer a lot of times, and I think Ned Kelly will be a brilliant film. I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not get my eyes away from it (it definitely came to my attention). Heath Ledger knows what he does and works for him, as long as the pieces. Orlando Bloom, which appears to be a split second, is not blunt. I think that this film is a hit, and my many people over and over again look.
