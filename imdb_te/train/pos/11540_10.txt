Neil Simon piece worked hard to get this very praises! "The Odd Couple" is a type of gem. You've got Felix Anger (Jack Lemmon); A hippopotriac, fussy neat-folk, and his mate, a large thorn of Oscar Madison (Walter Mottau); Whole slab. These men have great jobs. Felix is ​​a newswriter, and Oscar is a sports writer. The two men divorce, Felix's wife is near, but Oscar is on the other side of the US (West Coast). Well, what can you say? Two people living in a single house are impossible and impossible without driving each other crazy. It's a laugh and a lot of fun. The two British neighbors spoke to two men, and he was fortunate and lived with them after he refused dinner with them overnight after the Felix was abducted by Oscar. It's time for Felix to make it look easy. I assume all the lightweight-freaks are fairly lighter. They may be fussy, yet they should be patient as well. A very fun movie, and a classic classic. Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" is a classic movie. 5 Stars!
