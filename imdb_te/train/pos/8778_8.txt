James J. Corbett, from 1892 to 1897, became the favorite character of the Heavyweight Champion of the world, Erol Flynn. Perhaps he does not need to hold a sword or be in the West. He grew tired of swashbucklers and said in his autobiography that he felt miscast in the Western and did not understand why people liked him. It was a happy movie, but did not mention James J. Corbett's original story. <br /> <br /> The first scientific boxer to win at Heavyweight Division in the role of Corbett, is more than brute strength to win. He defeated John L. Sullivan and lost to Heavyweight crown Bob Fitzgomons. He is also a compulsive womanizer and that is a lot like that he plays the role of him. This is not shown on the screen. The role played by Alexis Smith is the fact that the banker of his fall is actually no evidence. In fact Corbett married twice and was unfaithful to his wives. <br /> When he lost his title he suffered a great personal tragedy after the events of the film ended. His father heavily betrayed his father to defeat Bob Fitzsimons because he shot his father and repelled the gun on him. <br /> <br /> If one thing I like about Gentleman Jim, rarely squares with happy families who have been killed / committed suicide. In the role of John L. Sullivan, Ward Bond received a career in his career. Director Raul Walsh lost Bosty's great performance to Bond, but it was Sullivan. <br /> <br /> Bond's character philosopher John L. Some of the Sullivan's misadventures that do not appear to be as racist racism. And Gentleman is the best thing about gym. <br /> <br /> Speaking of racism, Sullivan refuses to stay in the race to meet Peter Jackson from Australia and refusing to race from Australia, but his time is the best heavyweight. I would probably say if a Challenger Corbett meets him and fights 61 rounds. In the fight, Sullivan-Corbett created the demand for the title. When Corbett became the winner, he refused to give Jackson a title shot. <br /> <br /> Jim Corbett is not the story, it is played by Errol Flynn's film James Jay. Corbett. But there is no doubt that Corbett was alive in 1942 and loved the film and liked Flin's love of his life. It was like he would have liked to be remembered.
