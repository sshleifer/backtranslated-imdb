"The first battle is 100% outsourced." Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. It is very difficult to describe the film; Comedy, sarcastic, action, screwball. It is reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove's once or twice, especially in the scenes featuring Ben Kingsley (which I have done a great job). Although I do not have any specific expectations for this film, even if I'm a big John Cusack fan, I wash myself into the film. As a result, I've got a lot of fun. Political irony is the precise and most terrible of the US military business community. The sub-plot is somewhat predictable, but the ultimate innovation of the stories made them valuable. This film is not so popular in the US, but for the rest of the world, it's timely story.
