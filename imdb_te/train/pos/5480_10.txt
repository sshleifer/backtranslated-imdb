This is a great movie, if it does not like their government, it will show what our government will do to other countries. This is not as bad as Reagan and Bush number one to South America, but America still does not meet with other countries like this. These films also prove that the American media discloses government propaganda. This is the task of highlighting the highlight. This rebellion against Chavez did not succeed because Chavez was elected with over 90% of the vote. <br /> <br /> The film is not just a political documentary but it is still a great movie <br /> <br /> When another critic is lying to say that "Chavez is taking over the airs", the private media has been conducting anti-Chavez campaigns of all time.
