A pleasant surprise! The Line (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armageddon (4). Especially for an overhyped image. Perhaps the new type of Bruckheimer fare was approved. Instead of intelligent one-liners, you're really thirsty when a good background / inspiration and chase are replaced by intelligent dialogue, shake-n-bread stereotypes. Fanboys waiting for an Armageddon roller coaster: stay away. This is one of the more intelligent action fans. It does not bother me that Jolie looked so low.
