When traveling by train via Europe and America Jessie (Ethan Hawk) and French Céline (Julie Delpe), they decide to spend the night together in Austria together. The next morning, Jesse returns to Paris to Céline, the United States of America. <br /> <br /> "Sunrise before" is one of my favorite love stories, one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen. This is a low budget movie with a very simple and true storyline, but it is perfect for chemistry between Ethan Hawk and Julie Delpy, and the dialogues are fantastic. Direction is excellent, it airs Celine and Jesse's feelings to the viewer. I completed my review number 1,000 in IMDb, and this is a very special picture for me because I select a substantial number of "Pre-Sunrise". I can not understand that the film is not nominated to the Oscars with such awesome screenplays, directing and performances. Yesterday I saw this movie for the third or fourth time, and I still like it. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Antes du Ammanesar" ("Before Sunrise")
