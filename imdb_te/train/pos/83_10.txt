A few years ago I added a comment to the IMDB in the "The Real McCoy's" TV series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> When I first drew together the DVD Four Old Episodes plus the Reunion of 2000 with Richard Kreena, Kathy, this is a beautiful, funny and entertaining performance. Nolan, and Tony Martinez. Lydia Reed (Hussey) and Michael Winkelmann (Little Luke) are not indicated, but they can probably be tracked down via SAG or AFTRA. Another author here said, the program was well done and gave us many unknown ideas in the program. Kathy Nolan is not good at last year's "widow", we do not know whether it feels worried about leaving a show in an unpleasant controversy. In Novan WW II, a women's nursing in the Pacific went to a comedy bombing called "Broadside". Get it Broadside? <br /> <br /> Now, on the TV, a majestic, humorous, violent trash is suppressing our values, "The Real McCoy" is entertaining with good values ​​and good human beings. And I was involved with the creator, Irving Pinkus, for bringing it to my family. We never lost it.
