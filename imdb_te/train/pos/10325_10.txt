I grew up on Dock Savage, and was a baby born of a green death, but now I am completely entertaining. I have counted friends and colleagues who have seen this picture and have enjoyed the diversity of reactions, they mostly mostly think I'm odd but you are there. "I do not know what it's about dock, but he always gets girls" You have to be the ultimate line when men see his sad band. This film is a classic sarcasm in all superhero style, and it is way ahead of time, it does not take seriously, move to Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a god. The film is unfortunately not released on DVD in the UK. As I said classic, I thought it was not without Ron. (Such as the Italian job without Mini and Michael Caine). I give 10/10.
