I saw this movie in the London film of 1975 and have not seen since. I found it happier. I love the originality. <br /> <br /> I read a book called "I'm a Black Hotel" - and as a fan of cinema, I have always been "dolls" films. Kinda is "receiving" them, you know? But as I read it, I thought it was good - but it was definitely "adopted" - it was a little closer to the book. But why did I think so well? Sure, it will never be shown on Sunday afternoon on TV, but it's shown in a variety of movies, where it's known, where is the harm? Sorry, my civil liberties have been crushed here. <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, censorship of movies for adults can not exist. But unfortunately, I agree with the intellectual elders that such freedom is not harmless and does not have the rationality to distinguish between fantasy and reality, and can choose those foul acts. <br /> <br /> When it appeared in England, the British Sensor dismissed it by hand. <br /> <br /> Despite the '69 relaxing on dance', he was looking for a new job Monday, despite the film's theoretical backdrop, if anything of the sensor was accepted. <br /> In those days, there is no alternative. G.L.C. It is simply a local urban council that has the power to pass the film for London, which viewed the audience more "relative" than those who lived in the woods. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, the "board" has only four members - three voted, and "chairman". And on the day, the voters are sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the voters and chairman "La Beti" sat down to see. <br /> <br /> Someone who has voted for me said, "This film is a delight and no one can encourage foul work. There is no other imagination and just piece felt nuisance. The chairman did not understand it, so decided to mislead the side of the Freedom. <br /> When the lost voter finally saw the film, they also hated it, but it was too late! The film received its "X-London" certificate and opened to a mixed reaction. G.L.C. Movie Censorship Board has been canceled shortly! In this way "La Batty" was only opened in London by simply called FLUKE! But I'm glad. It's great! If you do not see it, do it. It's a fantasy, and like, it's less disturbing than many things that you see the news these days ...
