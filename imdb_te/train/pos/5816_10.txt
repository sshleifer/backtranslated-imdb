For the first time I saw the movie "movie". When I was 11, I was very interested in music and dancing. I am more interested in acting and acting. Although the first half is a repeat of Michael Career (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), it is still entertaining to watch. The "Badder" sequence was abandoned, even though the kids were good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" are funny, especially the police officer tells Michael, "I want your autograph here", after stopping him for dancing in a dancing zone. But the icing on the cake is called "Smoot Criminal". Joe Pessie (Duet) and Duty (Dark Wild). Dancing is accurate and special effects. Only spiders I could do. If you do not already have any fan of Michael. I'll give it to 10+!
