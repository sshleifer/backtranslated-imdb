Bromwell High Cartoon Comedy. It also ran a few other programs about school life like "teachers" at the same time. I believe that my 35 years of teaching career is closer to realism than the bravery of Bromwell Hai "teachers". All of the intelligent students looking through their enthusiasm for survival and the enthusiasm of their curious teachers, the integrity of the whole situation, remind me of all the schools I and my students know. When a student repeatedly saw the episode that tried to shoot the school, I immediately recalled .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to remove one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I think most of the adults at my age have taken Bromwell Hay away. What a pity it is!
