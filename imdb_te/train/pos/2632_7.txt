7 If you are a child - 6 if you say you are an adult. This partial sequel to the Lion King is restarting the original story through their stories, including the story they met, and tries to spin the characters towards Timon and Pumbaa. In Disney's great tradition, low level sequels are made, and occasionally the TV series has the biggest hits that have adventures of small characters. You are suspicious of what you think about it, but there is no chance for children and fans in this series; They have fewer jokes and songs and interesting things to make sure that some of these are one of the average sequels. It is the attraction of the most popular central characters, quick pace, jokes in the first film and some funny dresses for older audiences. <br /> <br /> Animation is as good as ever, a little less stylable than the original, but the plot here is taking a cousin. <br /> <br /> Timon and Pumbaa's first moments in the film, often retaining a middle-motion picture of the joke about its parts, is like a real audience. Let's see how close we are to Timon, he thinks he is not fit and he decides to look beyond what he sees to see his ideal home. On the way he meets Pumba, another is expelled and they are friends. Soon they meet Seba, a lion cub, T and P's natural cleansing, but they are trio. However, when Syma finds out, he must follow his own fate and decide to leave the group and help others. Of course there are plenty of simple Disney elements and themes here, friendship, good vs. bad etc. The plot is simple but works on many levels, making it smarter than your average animated film. When CG movies appear, Disney's traditional form should be clever, but they should not forget the popular roots. Toy Story and those who came from there are jokes according to all ages, and this is the way the market is being transferred. <br /> <br /> Never before has there been a place for movies. Young people can not take this purchase incorrectly. <br /> <br />
