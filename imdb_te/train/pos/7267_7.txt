Curly Sue has a 6-year-old hair and a steady stream of life. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive on the streets by short time con artists. In Chicago, the price of bill is jumping in front of a car in a parking garage, and the curly-intended victims are shouting about litigation and traction. It deals with being a high-profile lawyer named Gray (Kelly Lynch), who is frightened of what she did. Scammers will not only pay some cash, they have to spend the night in Gray's silk apartment. Nevertheless, Gray thinks they are more indebted, with three of them hanging for a spell. Gray is the only lucrative act that knows nothing about business and life. Who is better to teach her than Bill and Curley, who are experts in the realities of life? But all the good things should come to the end and there is no life for a legal expert and con couples. Or have it? Sweet and funny picture about the unexpected. Carrie is definitely entertaining like the Shirley Temple, but it is quite uninterrupted. Belushi gives her a rare touching performance that is luminous like a sleety but smooth touch lawyer on luck con and lynch. John Hughes, the writer and director, shows his magic touch once the script is alive and unpredictable. Just look at Curley and see Bill's graying, without money, and funny results. Are there some uncertain moments in the long run, long promises, and finally delivering? This is your to-do image.
