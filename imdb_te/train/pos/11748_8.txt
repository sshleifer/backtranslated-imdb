Over tripping. I was initially disappointed in some of the first episodes, but I continued to look to the confidence of the show and the unquestionably talent of Abe Farrethi. I can say safely now that I am happy now. The story is very well developed, and has a strong basis for all stories, and many do not have information. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can do wrong in this product is a somewhat annoying voice and accent. <br /> <br /> This song is really good for some of the best actors who starred together with the Star Planning. Is hoping for another season!
