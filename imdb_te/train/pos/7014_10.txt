Wow ... I do not know what to say. I saw seven pounds. No one can cry me like Will Smith. Man is very in-tune to the vast range of human emotion. This film was done beautifully and beautifully. Finding such a serious humanity in Hollywood today is rare. I compare it to "Forward Forward" and "Crash", which shows in such a lump in both light and dark. Certainly sticks with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about. I have deep love and passion about movies like this. Unlike a "bad end" in general, an honesty who seeks the truth of emotion, raw life and the helplessness that is all around. So at the end I do not care for a little pain. It is true that there are not always happy endings. Sometimes it's not just a happy ending. Many people have been able to live happier lives, but lost their love and life. If you're a bit deeper than the rest, you'll love this movie!
