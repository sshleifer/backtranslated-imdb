It's a great gem. It's an extraordinary story that's fun to watch. Yes, it sang, but it's very well-written in the story and very melodic to hear. It's very nice to see; I enjoyed it from start to finish! <br /> <br /> During the Second World War, the film will take place in England. It is an apprentice witch who is looking for a missing part of a spell that she needs. She uses her as a tough "magic", and in her care 3 children have used various destinations to look at her. They joined with their affiliate teacher and was surprised to learn that his school lessons actually work! <br /> <br /> If there are no special effects that appear to be a little bit first, then if you use them, they become part of the film's appeal. In fact, the film has won an Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The movie is both naive and fun - and tuningful songs are not difficult to like. The characters look awesome. I think at any age I like this movie.
