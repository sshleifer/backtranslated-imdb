Since I first saw it in 1979, I loved this film. How can Kurt Russell move Elvis and I still am still wondering how to express the expressions and feelings on his face. Sometimes her scary looks, actions, and talks like true Elvis. Fortunately, it was released on DVD, so everyone waits might have an excellent quality version of the full range. I listened to the enemies who say that some leaks or some things are left, but I wanted to work for 2 cars of 2 cars for Carpenter and it was this fine job of television (Elvis's death just two years later!). In fact I did not even see this Elvis movie. Highly recommended.
