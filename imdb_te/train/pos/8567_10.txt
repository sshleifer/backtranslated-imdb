I enjoyed the film and nobody suggested for a good time. It is reminiscent of Disney and reminiscent of G. It's great fun because some adults are notable, especially the "triangle" Alonso, among the crew, Le Pelt and Cruella's confidence. Glenn Close is wonderful and really has her own crush and she is "confident" even though she's crazy in ways that she loves her, and she can stir audiences to fear the audience. (I'm looking at Ella as a dog that I love when she's wondering about bipolarity, I'm not jumping in my seat) I'm going to see again in the theaters, and I'm enjoying it all.
