I am one of the many who expect to be a reputation (as famously quoted) as a reputation, an Yankee-Doodle Dandy patron. How wrong are I These guys are there, exactly in the middle, and the images they returned are fantastic and heartfelt. It also took place on a trip to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> The life of two French filmmakers is the NY Fighter Fighter, especially by young rookie ranks. Initially we saw a lot of the footage and reminded us that there is no idea what to do about terrorism. The film is intended to be about the common people who live honestly to help others, and the beauty of the film will not lose this edge. <br /> <br /> When we investigate a suspected gas line, the memory is a little too hazy), we suddenly hear an airplane fly overhead. The towers climb the camera to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing into one. What are the cameramen thinking at this time? <br /> <br /> If you recognize the importance of the camera scene and you know the same thing, the FDNY camera allows them to follow the building. <br /> What is the true view from front lines? <br /> If they do not cover for the horror event, the footage is no young Doucca alone -Maker is in a dream. More simply, the footage is desirable to stay safe from time to time. But this is the real humanity that really brings this to the viewer. The firefighters we charge without evil are helping to repel the stones of different races and to another of filmmakers (they are brothers.) The film has fantastic scenes and fantastic human stories, Hollywood can not duplicate something <br /> <br /> 9/11 is not a film about politics, religion or nationality for that matter It's not a film about the 9/11 people, and the best and worst true reference we have in the capacity of 9/11 is one of the most important movies I've ever seen, if it's me, it's just a movie born from this incident. You can not.
