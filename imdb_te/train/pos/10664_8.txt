When they see the film, will anyone tears the tears of joy? I love it! One of my Top 10 films of all time. It makes me feel good. I see all the cast members and the end product number over and over !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is the baby's baby, IMHO! I was always upset when reading the reviews I said, but I saw the play better than the movie. Two apples and oranges. The film production process rarely releases the complete production of the original works. I believe only because of people's alienation fears that many of the most well-known acts I have received on screen are not more likely to change than they are. This is a good movie, very satisfying. Everything you need to know!
