<br /> <br /> This amazing entertaining movie will stop you from scrambling and delivering laughing, surprising and unexpected moments. It was fun to watch "The Metador" than any other film since 2005. It was completed by Pierce Brosnan with an unforgettable character. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) Facilitator (Hitman) who specializes in high-end corporate programs (murder of great doods). He is also experiencing something similar to a mid-life crisis. <br /> He has no real friends, no permanent residence and no future plan, he slips into the Mexican hotel bar overnight and goes into Danny Wright (Kinney). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Danny is a down-his-luck family man who may turn things around her on the verge of losing a big business deal. <br /> <br /> Two men are lime and cheese, not a normal land, except they are in a single desolate bar. Night. <br /> The friendship they created reminds me of Laurel and Hardy. A person is straight and another is a continuous fool to enter into trouble. Brosnan and Kinner are not participating in the small roles of amazing performances. <br /> But do not be mistaken ... it is the Brosnan film. He imprints one of the most memorable and despicably-loved characters of the decade. He will shoot your mother and then worry about it and you may have forgiven him. Brosnan may be the ultimate attraction of the cinema, but it is his most fascinating and complete performance ever. <br /> <br /> I am not averse to seeing an Oscar compliance in the film. <br /> <br /> He blamed a high school girl with obscene high school and said, "All blushy blushy .. not sucky fucky". He does it with the familiar Bond Smirk and manages to get it away. Tell your mom to lose a 30lbs and 20 years to tell a little boy. <br /> <br /> The surprise of us with surprising moments when the movie brought some unexpected twists, however, by his little black book, Julian Thooveau called for his birthday, Or Danny and his wife (Davis) one night in their bedroom <br /> "Maddor" is stylish and vibrant and is a continuously entertaining and a lone hitman who is looking for a simple career, friendship and a practice to make at least one of the best things in his life Includes a career-defending role for Brosnan This is a neglected gem in 2005 and you can Nta quickly to try to see this movie. <br /> <br /> The Independent kantrikskam of TC Candler
