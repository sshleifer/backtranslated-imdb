In Mexico City, former CIA murderer and current alcoholic man John Cresey (Denzel Washington) is employed by industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), with the recommendation of his old friend Rai Burn (Christopher Walken), his younger daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita cooler changes the behavior of Christ, smiles and lives again, and she has great love. <br /> <br /> When the girl is kidnapped and convinced that she was murdered by criminals, she swears to kill everyone who is responsible for kidnapping. <br /> "Fire on Man" is almost a masterpiece, a classic in the future. The story is amazing, despite ever corny and running 146 minutes running time, the viewer does not feel passing time. The cast is composed of excellent actors and actresses, their performances are exceptional, Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. Cinematography has fantastic moments, and the screenplay has excellent lines. I personally like Christopher Walken's character describing Manzano (Xiancarlo Gianni) that the specialty of Crease is death, he is making his masterpiece. I'm the best "fire on man", I agree with the user who commented that this genre could not be the best of the year. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Chamois da Vingganta" ("Flames of the Revenge")
