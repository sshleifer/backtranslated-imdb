I started with my first encounter with Prince Music. It was in a bar, on my 39th birthday, and a girl dancing to talk to "1999". I asked people, who is this singer? I was told that Prince. It is very nice to distract me from a beautiful, dancer without it. Then I started listening to other prince's songs and really "dug" them. I know little about this companion Ottoton when it comes to purple rain. This film got me away. I instantly became the number one fan of "War Baby" Prince Prince. Later I discovered that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and she and my nephew V.P. Prince concert we are sitting next to his mother ... how nice! With the retrieval of the hand at hand, I agree with Siskel & Ebert, called the instant classic called Purple Rain. I've seen it over 17 times and it's totally love. I thought that Prince's performance was good, Apollonia brought a bit, but it was good in all the acting. The Prince played this role because John Gielgood was not available for 'The Kid'. The film is visually brilliant, brilliant (not slowly somewhere), and scary. I've gained a place in the best movie musicians of all time. Last time I saw it was after 7 years of gap and still distributed. I am proud of fellow Minnotton Prince Rogers Nelson and I personally love to tell him. He walked right in front of me at the aforementioned concert, "Hi", to my nephew, but not me. He is chatting with his mother. I was a bit crushed but he was still number 1 with me.
