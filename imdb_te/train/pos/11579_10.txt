The film is a story of a youthful woman in the battle, but it is not exactly like the movie, but it's a great story, the film, the acting and the story that I liked the story that I liked. The movie is a feeling that I am there because it is a real story and I feel sorry for the CA-rector because Maruschka Detmers wants life here end life. I recommend everyone in this film, especially young people and magic. This film can be compared to the true story you made from the movie soldier orange or from WW2.
