The ABC's award-winning television show "Lost" became one of the main characters, "I saw this island eye and I saw it was beautiful". The narrative of a drama story about groups of flight accidents on an unknown island is summarized, but it makes the show scandalous. "Lost" follows a large group of letters that they come into conflict with the island, each other, and finally themselves themselves as their new way of life and their dependency on each other. <br /> <br /> The situation becomes complicated when it's clear that this is not a loneliness and it's not alone. <br /> <br /> When I heard the concept of the series, my initial fear was a new lack of stories telling us of some time, but it proved false. The narrative naturally flows, the dialogue is witty, the letters are memorable and executable. <br /> <br /> The island is its own, and in order to understand this comment you will have to watch the series for yourself, only to show its originality and greatness. <br /> <br /> During the writing review, the first two seasons were broadcast, and they were filled with strong episodes. <br /> <br /> My first mild criticism seems to reduce half a second in the second season, but it will return to the final part in a very impressive form. <br /> If I could recommend a television series now, it is definitely one. If you like an excitement that looks more tempting, adventurous, character-driven, very strong cast and crew, beautiful places and more spiritual than nature, "Lost". You start at the beginning.
