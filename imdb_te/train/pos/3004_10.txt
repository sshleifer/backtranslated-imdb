<br /> <br /> In general, I hate the overwhelming mystery (like this) but I love this movie. It's pretty intriguing (only 72 minutes), is pretty directed by Michael Curtis (he uses tons of camera tricks to accelerate the narrative along with it), the most ingenious story line (there's just a ridiculous murder of a locked room) and a good cast. <br /> Pavel is very happy and Vance is great - he does not seem to be acting - he's Vans! Mary Astor has not given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the product. It is very good for everyone, but in all it is Yugene Palle as a detective heath. He is a very good actor with a very distinct voice and some of his lines are happy. <br /> <br /> In general, a fantastic 1930 Hollywood murder mystery. <br /> <br />
