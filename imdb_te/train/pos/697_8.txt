This is one of the first independent films I've ever seen. For such a very low budget, it's well done; As an insomnia, I can sympathize with the main character, my sleep problems have never been as serious or upset. <br /> <br /> Even in theaters, it does not look in lighting, well-liked and well-liked, well-suited for filmmaking. There are some notable goals, but they are intended; You see after watching the movie. The image is very personal, and worth watching twice. No film is flawless, but the story of Hollywood reform is not doing well. Overall, 8/10.
