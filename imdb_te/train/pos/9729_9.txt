The weak start, the solid, the excellent finish. It is my opinion of this film anyway. I liked Simon Pegg in two films I saw him --- hot fuck, and shawn of the dead. His character here, took a completely different turn. He shows his scope as an actor, but I did not really like the character as he initially painted. <br /> <br /> I have a kind of humor called humorous "disappointing comedy". It wants to "jokes" and wit is not more than really painful and embarrassing moments. Bean character Rowan Atkinson plays. Many comic actors have similar roles. <br /> <br /> If you look like me, and you are sensitive and mourning bungling idiots warned, Pegg is just the third of this movie that shows just such qualities for the first. <br /> I read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm. May be. The story of the film stagnated and became the success of "little guy" in the last third. I am not all films sugary and lighter - but coincidentally, with the film being nice, it's a happy ending. <br /> <br /> It is also an old favorite to be happy, watch Jeff Bridges, so masterfully play the role. I liked the "Iron Man", but the reality of Bridges was actually a villain. Absolutely personal taste, of course, his performance is stunning. However, he is a magnificent publisher of the giant Lifetime Man, Sharks. <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed it very much. I thought I was 40 minutes late and wanted to be in the early days.
