The first thing I thought about seeing "Mystery Men" is not how popular is this movie? The film is very attractive and funny because I think the bomb is like a logic. <br /> <br /> "Princess Bride" is fantastic and "Who is Random Rabbit?" Made for classic cartoons. You have to give a definitive idea of ​​the tone of the film, then unfortunately signing to the marketing committee (one of which is one of the arms of the studio "Iron Giant"). If you're in a mood, rent it when you're in the mood. You can not hear BeeGees again in the same light.
