I saw this film at least fifty times and after watching the last week for the first time in a long time I will still be able to get it. <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic, but Spielberg's skill and excellent cast including Hope Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and Margaret Avery. <br /> <br /> You can experience every human emotion when watching this movie. I laughed, cried and angry. Like many great films, the Academy did not achieve success with a host of nominations. But this film, without doubt, is definitely one of the best films of all time.
