This is the reality. I was so overwhelmed by the hitch-patch Hindi films of a whole bunch of Hollywood and Brit movies. Although some errors are inevitable, see this movie. The clean-cut, conscientious nature of Cop Surya (which we usually see is the pot-rural, money-hungry) feared. He has come a long way from his work in the Narco Nurse. I liked the movie so much I had to own it. I'm not usually into the kind of movies vacuum violence, something I really felt for each character and therefore could not really bring me to call it 'mindless' violence. I do not appreciate the high drama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with more Hindi and Tamil films. I did not like this movie. Because ACP Anbuselvan's wife loses his wife, does not overestimate, has heartache and makes my eyes closed. There are a few times when I see a movie when I want to press the FF button. Many times I wanted to do at a cinema hall. Do not do this when watching this movie. I am really hopeful that I will release Guzzy soon.
