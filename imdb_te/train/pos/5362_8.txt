My favorite Schwarzenegger image, along with RUN MAN, TOTAL RECALL. No, it's not 2001, but it's not. And the acting and script are not even similar to other Arni films like PREDATOR or Terminator. But I submit that the IDEA behind this film is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen. State-sponsored game show in criminal criminals against criminals who committed serious offenses against "heroic" thieves with all kinds of weapons for sports and blood for sports and blood. The ultimate prize for winning runner: freedom. <br /> <br /> For a film with such over-the-top ghari death scenes and cheesy one-liner, this is really something to say. Somebody else pointed out all the comments on the cultural / government presented in the film, so I can not come here. If you can see beyond the seemingly crazy feel of the film, it's enough for you to say that most (if you're a big SF fan of imagination) it will enjoy it. As I said, it's not trying to be a serious art film, but it is surprising in the 80s shoot-m-up film. The campus is derived from a short novel called Richard Bachman (Stephen King), but differs from its source material, particularly ultimately. <br /> <br /> My favorite song: "It is expected to be derived from steroids."
