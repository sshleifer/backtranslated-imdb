I do not know anything about baseball, I'm not a fan of sport, but it does not stop me from enjoying a farewell Brother's latest movie, Fever Pitch, a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy. The movie is not really about baseball; Besides, it's really about relationships, and often the emotional breakdown. <br /> Jimmy Fallen ?? Giving her the best date to date ?? Ben, Darke, lightweight nursing schoolgirls. Ben unfortunately did not really grow up, and he made almost as much addiction to the Red Sox baseball team. <br /> <br /> Ben has dedicated his life to Sax, and does everything to sprinkle every square inch in his apartment on the pilgrimage to Florida for training in the spring. <br /> <br /> One day his honors go to Ben Lindsay (an excellent Drew Barrymore), on a field trip to her workplace in the geometric class. Lindsay is a corporate, career-oriented kind girl, but she has a kind compassion, Ben is absolutely glamorous. He was initially going out of his "class" and did not hesitate to question her, thinking that Lindsay did not immediately see a potential partner in Ben. <br /> <br /> When is the first unfortunate start to their first date when Lindsay suffers from a serious case of food poisoning? And while she retching her resonance, we actually provide a first clue of watching a Farrelly brothers movie. Instead of Lindsay - rather urgent - request to reschedule, Ben nurses around to play drops, orderly, and janitor. <br /> <br /> When Lindsay rises in the morning and sleeps on her bed, she begins. The condition is a long, overwhelming process that breaks the web of anxiety and ambition to think about her standards. <br /> <br /> Ben, who inherited season tickets from his beloved uncle, managed to keep his life in the season? He never lost the game. <br /> <br /> Their progress is progressing without flowing across the winter, with a snag at the beginning of the season. <br /> <br /> Lindsay wants to do other things with her parents and party with her friends. , But he stole his interest in meeting Ben Lindsay. Did Lindsey allow his irrational devotion to summer boys to work on their relationship? Can she really get Ben's motivation with sports? Can a die hard and nerdy red socks fan find true love after all? However, Lindsay and Ben came up with a colorful combination of friends who would make the view. Lindsay's stern friend, skinny, richer and copper robin (Kodi Stieland), insists he is the same person at the age of 30. However, the plump, curly sarra (Marisa Jarrett Wankakar) and Molly (Ion Skive) give Ben a more positive and positive perspective. <br /> <br /> Ben's ecstasy can be applied to any obsessive sports fans, but Lindsay's disappointment is the representative of a woman running a mobile career. Ben is not as good as the Fallen Ben, but Ben keeps it unchallenged, showing the real big screen possibility. <br /> <br /> Fever pitch really works, and although there are many, Barrymore is equally pleasurable as the performance lindsey. The film of inspired comedy movements, the movie also resolved the issue of sports addiction, and the couples make it harder to have discussions on the bumpy landscape. <br /> <br /> Many people base out at Boston's Fenway Park, as well as adds the best meaning of the atmosphere of games, but are totally appreciative of baseball fans. Nevertheless, the fever pitch is blessed with such a graceful and delicate funny script, which will find a lot more to connect with novice baseball fans. Mike Leonard September 05.
