I know that I hate this movie now is fashionable. I've seen hundreds of spook films including a lot of original 1963 Hunting and Hammer movies too. This film is not controlled and probably does not come back to what most modern viewers seem to dislike. And many viewers are away from screen-like control films because the swords are more easy to believe that killers are more than demons or ghosts. Actually this film has great scenes and acting and special effects are great. I have now seen 15 times and each time is better. The director of the film did many interesting and stylish films and did not try for the kind of reality of the 6th concept. Going to go and go is definitely not boring. Perhaps the film may appeal to John Carpenter fans but may be a traditional architectural structure. Old Haunting was also the best film since 1963. It's more scary. See Innocentes and The Legend of Hell House together with Pamela Franklin.
