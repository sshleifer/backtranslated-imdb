"Hey Baba Riba" is a young Marina (nicknamed "Esther" after the famous American film actress), and four young men Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop, 15-17 years Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1953. <br /> <br /> The closest relations with young people are very sharp, ultimately a sacrifice, a group of unexpected troubles. <br /> <br /> In the wake of the changing communist politics, they went back to their separate ways and rejoined back in 1985 (year before the year of the film's release). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the film with some reservations. Subtitled is difficult for one thing. Especially in the beginning, there are many conversations that contain many subtitles. Perhaps the speed of speech is needed, but I never read the lesson and realize the scene, which does not mean that it has always played a role in any role. <br /> I saw a picture with a friend (a video from our public library) and understood some of the story in order to get streptomycin for a unhealthy cousin. <br /> <br /> The Yugoslavian age film is effectively notified for adolescents, idealism, and strong and reliable bonds. It is a major flashforward, and it's witty, I guess I'm guessing to see who's looking at the 1953 cast and to the end of what actually happened. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </
