Philadelphia is one of the best movies I've ever seen as Irish I'm Here. I read both the drama and loved it before seeing the movie. The story of a young man preparing to leave Ireland to go to America because he can not earn a living in Ireland. Both youngsters from the young man's view (see the other characters in the film) and another young man who reflected his untold ideas and feelings. But the other characters in the film can not see. This is a very sad movie, but deeply touching, and I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to think about anything. I will vote for any film about any Irish film, or any movie about Ireland and any film featuring Irish actor Donald McConnell. I see that man for 2 hours gum chewing and unfortunately I have. She was ashamed of losing a very young man.
