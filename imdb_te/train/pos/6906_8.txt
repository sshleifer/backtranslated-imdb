I enjoyed this movie. It's funny, cute, crazy, and entertaining. A good cast and a little critically, I got very tight because of the reasons I did not really understand. No, it's not just "grape grapes" or "casablanca" or "moonstick", but it's a happy picture. <br /> <br /> Julia played the man behind the psychoanalysts. The story is definitely a little silly, but it's not a high drama, folks. I was watching the film's review, it's probably good, it went one night when looking for a movie. I listened to it as long as I saw it, I'm glad. I finally purchased the VHS tape on the Bargain Pile and I saw it twice a year.
