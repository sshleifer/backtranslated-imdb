Damian Sajiban's second immersion after the film's excellent role in the film "El Fonda Del Mar". "Tiempo de Valientes" creates the most well-made characters, with far apart models and their unmatched chemistry. I saw Szifron's talent to keep each of the characters in play, but it's enough to have feelings with them.
