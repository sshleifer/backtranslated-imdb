Rudrand Kipling once wrote that God has given people the ability to love the world, but the human heart is very small, each man is a special place that he likes. I think this is the motto of some of today's most prominent directors when expressing eternal love in this particular space and filming scenarios in the lives of its citizens and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of small images, Paris je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us to a breathtaking stroll through the Parisian arrondissements, human feelings, yearnings and expectations. /> <br /> Always stay in a parking lot, art studio, tube station, some completely moving story about some other quarterly, regular people for love always. And Paris je t'aime is the world we want to rekindling, no longer around, love to love, love for a parent, child, parent for love serendipitous love for stranger as they meet their eyes - is about a vast array of <br /> <br /> Not just about love, life, joy, pain, loneliness, chaos, daily ups and downs. <br /> <br /> In this film, I give 9 people because the final part of it refers to some of the stories. It can be further developed, but not all of them and I seem to be missing, and by "further development" I'm not specific to the future of characters. I can only say everything is worrying - attractive. You leave everything behind you, flee to Paris, and live in those little love stories.
