As a young child, I always hated "Cinderella", as my parents thought my two sisters wanted to buy my parents a Disney movie. I wanted "Dumbo", but my sisters won, and we were "Cinderella." <br /> <br /> I'm drowning in the room playing with my Star Wars action people. My love for Disney theme parks made me an internship at Walt Disney World, and now I have two niece nuns. I want to show Disney as long as I can, and lately we see "Cinderella". <br /> <br /> With my newly praised appreciation for Disney, I saw "Cinderella" a new perspective and I was impressed with what I saw. <br /> <br /> Cinderella was trapped in such terrible difficulties as to why the movie did not quite understand much at the beginning. Why is she such a slave to her stepfamily, and why could she just run away? I'm not very sympathetic to Cinderella, but the story is progressing because I'm in the story. Perhaps eye-catching animations or fun-loving characters attracted me or it might be a timeless song. When I heard songs like "Bibbiti-Bobbidie-Bo" and "A Dream With Your Heart Meeks", I was again sent back to theme parks. When I look at awe-inspiring Cinderella Cage I can paint myself in that carefree and pleasant atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Something about the film has provoked Disney's magic. It will kidnap a lot of people and go to the magic kingdom and see all the children like Cinderella who is happy to be in this fantasy world and I will speak. Pictures of Cinderella and glass slipper - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Tinkerbell - Disney is why one of the world's most beloved institutions. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is not a strong story, it is strange in Disney and film history. When we are children, it represents miracles such as fun, idealistic, and fantasy. The film has many meanings, many people there. This may not be my favorite Disney movie, but I would like to mention all the things that I love and worship about the company. <br /> <br /> My IMDB rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A (best)
