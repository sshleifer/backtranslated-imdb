Three horror stories based on members of a Hindu group that have returned home have been changed in some ways. In the first story our ancestors are now in a mad shelter and visit a report to know what has happened in worship. While some two stories sit and face each other, some are slowly fulfilled in the story. The reporter is particularly interested in leading the deaths of the participants. The boring was suddenly stunned with a surprising twist in the story. <br /> <br /> In the second story violent young criminal must visit the psychiatrist for treatment. The patient has some kind of agenda but the psychiatrist will have to work. Again, things get a bit nimble and weird. <br /> There is a strange twist in that story. This is a very well written and surprising story. <br /> Finally, the story tells a spiritual healer that he can remove the illness from people with his hands. One of the patients is a former puja member, so successful healing is very complicated. Again, we are surprised at a twist. There is a beautiful gorge scene. <br /> There are some good female nude pretensions, as well as some males full of finesse nudity. I have found stories that are very well written and the director succeeds every single astounding twist and ghar after the story. <br /> Note: German DVD Review.
