It is a cooking competition show, America. This is not a Japanese version. <br /> This show is great. I would be less concerned about cooking but this program is just fun to watch ... from the intensity to put the dishes by chef to the goofy chairman. The really good way to spend some time watching TV. <br /> <br /> As guests like Mark Echo, you can judge the presentation ... but ... Meh. It is fun enough to see and deserves the winning winner in general. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want,
