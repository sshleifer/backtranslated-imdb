"The Last Big Thing" is an amazing satire, which dismisses the pop culture of the humorous self-descent. Look at the characters and be happy and fun. <br /> <br /> Simon Geist creates a pop-culture based edition called "The Next Big Thing" in one of his last 30s / early 40s. "Thing, this magazine is not really, and Simon is so intimately closely connected with the interview that it's just as insulting to pitch culture." His live-in friend, Darla, also wrote a magazine (which is the real one), primarily with her and Simon Darla is a respectful (or unpleasant) character, you mute her Depending on nervous behavior, Magda is a prostitute, the character I like best.Brent is a musical-video queen for a flat character, tidra, b-rated rock bands. It's a wonderful movie and it's all about what people are doing and why they do it Enu you indie / art house audiences, however, suggest that you look at it. <br /> <br />
