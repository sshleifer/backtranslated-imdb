Only two comments ... for seven years? The film's relentless pulling-power does not have the original evidence! As mentioned, the low-budget tele-music status of the 13 GANTRY ROW is a reduction factor in its limited appeal. <br /> The truth is, the most at-far of the amusementville reaction of the amityville horner at its most basic - not too much horror. Conspiracy is a further case! Gibbney was able to play a more valuable view if he played the role of Halifax - primarily suspected of being a suspicious murdered couple with suspicious "house". The script is better than the average and generates the highest standard overall. <br /> <br /> When I selected a DVD for just $ 3.95 in my regular video store, I was not spending time. Acceptable price for $ 10.95 image. Just do not expect fireworks!
