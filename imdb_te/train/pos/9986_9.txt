One of the few Canadians who did not read the book at high school, I want to include my comments. The movie was not removed from the film before seeing the film without knowing the story. Characters have a lot of complexity, each of which is associated with themselves in their own way. The illumination of the facsimile allows everyone to express their own feelings rather than the characters' lives, the spoon-filled view. You can love them or not like them, and still feel the emotional impact of the film. Fantastic characters by Ellen Bertstein and Christine Horn really bring characters to life. I would highly recommend it.
