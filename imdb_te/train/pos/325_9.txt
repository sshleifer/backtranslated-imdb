This film is great compared to the sometimes hard-tempered courage of today's politically minded filmmakers. Romance, sex relations, politics and arts are easy to add. We can at least learn the energy and charm of the film, despite the failure of the 1960s Boeyat optimism. I do not know what they do with the image "boring" label - so much is it packed into it ever more than 15 min at the same time.
