There is an important message in excellent direction, production, acting & predictable drama script: <br /> <br /> "Listen to all the way" Listen, in order to flourish the voice. Listen to the harmonious voice in the other. Listen, listen to yourself. Listen to any situation or the needs of others. The script writers seem to be telling "the mystery of life" .The list is a perception of a person. It wakes up other senses, especially the vision & horizon expands. A soul can also be found. The artistry of the film shows "It's in Heaven" as a sparkling life, not only its happiness and mourning, but also the ultimate hope of life. <br /> <br /> "Just listen, it leads all the way up"
