It is a top notch film with a top-lyric cast. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the Christopher Lloyd Angels baseball team in the fascinating film about real-life angels that help the baseball team. You never know, it will happen. I love Lloyd's character. He was happy. The story is about turning your life around, as the kid in Angels believes angry, hardened, and embittered manager Glover to look around to look best in the people. The film is well made and the best among the people and about your dreams. It's funny, lovely, touching, and sad, all worked very nicely. You prefer (or love) it. I promise. <br /> ****
