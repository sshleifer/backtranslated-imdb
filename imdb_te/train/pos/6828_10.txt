Broadway and film actor John Cassavates (from Rosemary's Baby) created a masterpiece with this 1977 film. It starred as John Roses, John Cassavates, Ben Gazzar, Jon Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and Peter Faulk. The motion of the film: After the death of a fan who died in the car accident she was trying to get her autograph when her old age and film actress (Jenna Rowlands) retrieved her biography. The film is slow and dark, moody, scary. It has a 60 cinematic look and it also reminds me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without supernatural horrors. There are fears in every horror actress - she comes to the old lady and she is not in her career. Moreover, she feels the real spirituality, humanity and merit-free life. She lived only for her career - she did not have children, and did not do charitable things. The film's meat is the gradual disintegration of her personality. She is different. She is in a crisis. Gena Rowlands really comes into the mind to feel sorry for the character and works very well as part. She is a brilliant actress and contrary to these 70s film and disaster movies or adventure thrillers, often violent films. It is a deep-seated emotional film, but a cold, stubborn concept that Causewates criticizes the major films and actors of the 70s generation. The film or the production of this film 70, which is strange in Nikoson's fraud, Watergate, Vietnam etc. Product values ​​are not great and the film is not well known, this is a very haunting film haunting mood. Kudos to the low-lying director who died in the late 80's.
