A miracle. One of the best music ever. The three Busby Berkeley numbers ending at the end of the film are fantastic, but this film is amazingly nonstop and makes Cogny and Blondell natural acting spectacular. (Keerler is not even a great actress but it's also lovely). Even though the plot with the formulation of movies is a long time, it is usually fresh in the 30th film you've been filtered out into a small number of films.
