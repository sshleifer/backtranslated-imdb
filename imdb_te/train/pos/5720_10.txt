I saw yesterday "grudge" and wow ... I was scared, good stuff. I love horror movies, and I really liked this one. There are so many 'surprise' scenes that jump in your seat (what is the English word?). However, throwing it out from the audience did not make it difficult to laugh. I think it's a very scary scene ... on the bus, in the window on the face, or when Yoko walks without his beard. Make-up is also good. Sometimes you can see that you're there, but it still adds a strange look to the scene. The boy is very pretty, very beautiful without making terrible scary and without. I'm pretty scared the next time I hear the broken sound ...
