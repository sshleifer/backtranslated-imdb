Reses Witherspoon's high school image should not be confusing as it is stylistic in Hong Kong's dark gangs. Election campaign will be held as a new leader or 'chairman' elected through ancient traditions every two years. The race by the two candidates for the position and the ego, the bribery and the last track record is a long time to say the least. You do not feel confused with the tremendous casting, you do not want to be confused with the tale of the story, and you are introducing the director to introduce itself without revealing its brilliant glory. Asia is not Godfather, but it's an enjoyable thriller in a gangster style that you leave at the edge of your seat and win at violence. I think it's safe to say that Subtitle Volume 1 is going to go deeper into the murky world of trio and in other installments like all their combat and under-handed business deals. Anyway this is a good start and what's going on is a great movie in its own right.
