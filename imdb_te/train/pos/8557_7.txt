I will hand over to the creative team behind these "American Pie" films. "Direct to DVD" is typically equivalent to inexpensive and inefficient film-making. Yet last year I was pleasantly surprised if I found myself enjoying the DVD sequel "The Naked Mile". Motion picture producers took advantage of the possibility of providing a rare and yet funny little movie. This year they offer follow-up, "beta house". This honest truth, "Beta House", is the first "American Pie" films that look like "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> It is unlikely, unpleasant, loud fun. Sure, the story is a bit thin, but the beauty of the whole thing. In the first 10 minutes we are introducing all the major characters, new assistant characters, some rare gossip, to meet the villains and to create a simple plot-line. Outside the way, the film has no limits. There's a lot of gags, and they do not hold back this one. I'm talking plenty of male semen, urine, dildos, dicks with chicks, sheep sex, male orgazim sprays, and more. <br /> <br /> John White, Jake Sigel, Steve Talley, and Eugene Levy (similarly) supporting role for the last few films from "The Naked Mile". The whole cast will work fine. Steve Talley (Dwight Styler), in particular, has great power and screen presence. I guess good things for him. For those who have opened their eyes, the film is also loaded with great cinematic references. I have a very big laugh movie "The Der Hunter" simulation. Classic. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the array, it's right at home with the bottom house. It really pushes the tastes of good taste, but ultimately pretty funny.
