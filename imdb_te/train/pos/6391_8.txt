Catch the film at the Arizona International Film Festival. I did not expect much (the festive director told me that it was one of the best films that submitted me). I sold it for five minutes. The shot in B & W on the boosting budget, this film is happy. Performance is great, writing is rich and the image's scene is great. This performance is perhaps the biggest revelation. Because most of the films filmed in low-profile films are enthusiastic or stage acting. It's not. This is one of the most convincing, lovely and funny films of a character I've seen with Toure's syndrome. This theme gets confusing and obscene without being confusing. If you get the chance, watch this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (which I expect to get that right) have a chance to make their subject a wider audience.
