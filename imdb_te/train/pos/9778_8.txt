The story trilogy of "Energy", "Devi" and "Kali" about an experimental commune (or something like that) is called the Taylor-Ericsson group, which I can tell, inside of people, unknown, and leaving a bit of damage here and there. After several years some of those losses are still waiting for the right moment to show lurking and correctly. The power tells her husband's story of a woman who is secretly dead, in fact, he breaks up, and the suspect is a man who does not exist. This woman builds some internal ghost, or when she attempts to talk to a woman while she is acting as a reporter, she finds the sister of the killer. Devi tells the story of a young man who wants to "get out of her skin". He is sent to see a skunkhead, a speed freak, and a psychiatrist who is a former member of this commune, which helps a good doctor realize his desire. This is probably the best of three episodes. Kali tells the story of a healer who tries to "heal" this woman who is part of this commune, and throws some devils who live in this woman, but if she does it or she leaves it, it can no longer survive. All of these stories are very creepy and breathtaking because you are not sure how to ever expect it, and the motion and settings are not new additions, unlike traditional horror films. It has a low-budget appearance and has enjoyed it, but it maintains a great deal of creepy atmosphere throughout its credit. I opened a good part of my mouth this time and was pretty hard when real fears (and gore) opened. I found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and it's very fond of it. To find a good little, this is one, I'd give it 10 out of 8.
