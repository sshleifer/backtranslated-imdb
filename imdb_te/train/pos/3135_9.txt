I liked this movie. I know that it is completely chalked with camp and illness like the original peak. I found a lot of heartfelt responses to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin, and Julie Nemark again together. Anyone who likes the Batman series from the 60s has returned to Bat Cav. You can tell the actors are very funny making this film, especially the Adam West. And he'll gladly do that to the scripts he'll do to bet he jumped back into his Batman costume. I told many friends about this movie and decided not to see them ... now they wanted it. I have original 120 episodes in VHS. Now this film is in my collection. Thanks for reunion Adam and Burt.
