As a sequel, this is not a bad image. It's really better than 1. It looked more entertaining, which seemed to have documented the documentary style. At first it hurt me, the budget. But it grew to me, and it seemed to be more authentic. The film is a liner that is dry than the original, which is a good thing, in my opinion. It turns out to be almost parody with some scenes and letters, which may be the point. This film has at least one suspense, it is not a 1 play, it's great, it's great, the music is great and the acting has played a lot of acting again, as I have mentioned, it looks on some top. Even the end of the end of the movie loses momentum and there are a few minutes to look very slow and the stream does not look like the rest of the movie. Moreover, I thought this was a very beautiful sequel y rating "Return to cabin by the lake" 7/10 *
