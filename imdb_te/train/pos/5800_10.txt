This is the most favorite movie in the world !!!!! I enjoyed joy at age 4, and I enjoyed 16 years. Its perfect writing! Video collection is complete without it !!! I enjoyed every second and this film has some special effects, but it sends a great message to audiences youth, but in reality this film is actually going to be too much! Now Michael Jackson is in many movies, and people still do not see him as an actor. In fact he is the most talented actor I know! He is talented! He is amazing !!! MOONWALKER must see !!!!!!
