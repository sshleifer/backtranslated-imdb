One of the comedies of the 1970s. There is also a good signature tune of any comic show. The story is three people sharing a flat country on top of their owners George and Mildred. Comedy shares a mixture of people. One man and two women. Richard O'Sullivan is with Paula Wilcox. <br /> <br /> Scripts and stars always give best performances and Richard's disappointing love life has shown a relaxed charm. Closing titles In the early 1970s there were no visible jokes, but flat arrangements about living arrangements.
