Dick Tracy is not the best for many comic book fans, because they wanted blood like Batman. Dick Tracy's innocence is a comic book, in which he has a tremendous danger and fun. Warren Beatty is directing and playing a major role, which also fights crime against using super powers. I liked Dick Tracy because I was the baby because of the main colors funny atmosphere: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect image for anyone to see with their children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and the Big Boy Caprice plays with passion. Madonna did not play the same boy doll that she represented as the second villain in the film. As I said, no blood, pornography, sexual orientation or anything else for crimes.
