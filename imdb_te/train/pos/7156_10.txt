Holes is a wonderful picture. I loved it and this is one of my favorite films. It's one of the few flicks of Disney's unreleased Disney product. Holes is usually a very cool movie. I will do more pictures of Disney. The holes are actually a rare breed of events played by Disney. I can not get the wrong idea, I do not mean bad mouth Disney, but most of it is targeting children and that's OK. Children should also have their own entertainment. But Disney teen was convicted of appealing to audiences and they usually failed. But not with Holes. It can be enjoyed by anyone at any age and not once it's cold. In fact, many young hoods seem to be a film because they have roles in relationship. <br /> <br /> The holes work better with a combination of good family entertainment programs. Not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge. I'm taking Disney's more dangers and this kind of logical flicks.
