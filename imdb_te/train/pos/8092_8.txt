I am 8-10 years cold on this movie, dark November afternoon. When I was playing all day, freezing, and when I arrived at 4pm, I had a cup hot cocoa and sat in front of the TV with a blanket. I was surprised watching a cartoon that was not happy and crazy - and was actually dark, and ethical. It captures my imagination. I'm sure I'm missing the text, and it's short of all the wrong places for Tolkien Purist. But it still takes the consequences of the story of the story, a burden for the good of others, selfishness, rash decisions, etc. But the voice characters are a place where this film is clearly grown over new films. John Hurt is great in this. If you do not like how to draw character, look away, and just listen to him. His voice is unusual. I see so many times again and it will always bring me back to that time, as a kid, thirst for some magical adventure. Because of this, I say 'lucky', this film reminds me, so I missed its shortcomings. But between John Hurt, and Tolkien's fantasy, it still has reached me, and still does.
