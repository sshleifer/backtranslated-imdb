<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/ " The novel (filmed for the first time in 1987 with Scott Glenn), until Washington gave him his old partner (Christopher Walken), now Jack Daniel A down-on-his-luck ex-leisure liberty that is keen to drink from Flash's flash. He was appointed as a bodyguard for a Mexican businessman (Marc Antony) and his 10-year-old daughter (Radha Mitchell) of his American-born wife (Radha Mitchell). When he and oil and water first work funning (not mixing), he really makes a relationship with him, encouraging her to do better, but at the same time he is trying to deal with the past demons. He was almost killed by being kidnapped for fanning and forced into Washington's old program for a $ 10 million ransom. With almost any other stock action hero (Schwarzenegger, Seagal, etc.), the next bloodbath is the same recurring sculpture we've seen a million times before. But Washington's role, though he has been killed for a reason, does not particularly enjoy what he's doing. <br /> <br /> However, the kidnapped gang who is responsible for abducting Fanning is receiving help from a very light Mexican newspaper reporter (Rachel Tikotin) to expose "La Hermenade" (The Brotherhood). Various film stocks are similar to the hyper camera work, almost headache-motivating montage editing, and its director Tony Scott (Top Gun, Crink's Tide), but it is not necessarily unique to the traditional 60 and 70 films of JFK or Sam Peckenpa's Stone use). Still, Scott receives much better performance from Washington, as well as Fenning, a typical movie-more than Brad Pitt. Harry Gregson-Williams's south-of-the-border Spanish guitar score has been improved with the soundtrack splashes of Chopin, Debussy, and Linda Ronstadt's classic 1977 indigenous-rock version "Blue Bay". Though the film is very violent, it has been worse than most action films over the last ten years, and overall it is better than most.
