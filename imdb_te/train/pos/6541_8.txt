As I grew up in the mid-40s, I was not even close to the key populations of "Nancy Drew", but this afternoon I was amazed at this film; So, a row from me was added to sixty silver furry ladies. <br /> <br /> The 20-Ish Woman Usher Prize was specially appreciated by an elderly man who left the theater (she said that the film had seen the previous evening and that she liked it too). The point, however: in my front row, there are nine - to count them, popcorn and hot dogs and candy in the next row of girls over nine to ten years and back and back and giggle <br /> <br /> When the film began, they settled to see them immediately. <br /> <br /> The end credits <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect image; It does not pay much higher school subplots, it's not enough self-tone of its own tone, and its thugs are just a hair too far too far towards the critically pushed side at times. But the adaptation of the source material is dignified, the place is well absorbed and runs efficiently between the sins of the more cheesy and the more modern. Last but not least, Emma Roberts has a movie with a surprising carriage - even though Josh Flutter's awesome timing, it's a Roberts film, and she pulls it pretty. She is Nancy Drew's most predecessor of Kristen Bell's Veronica Mars and is the line-shepherd of Jody Foster's early and least-esteemed "candleshaw". <br /> In today's market, this is rare: a family that honors his audience's intelligence. Also, it does not have everyone's taste - but this is what this is the best film of the decade.
