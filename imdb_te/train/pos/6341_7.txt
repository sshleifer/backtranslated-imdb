I have always felt his real lies in physical comedy, although I really enjoyed Jim Carrey's latest "serious" performances ("The Truman Show", "Moon on the Moon"). He's not saying that he is an outstanding, talented actor: those at the Academy Awards seem to dislikes him too much, he is always (really deserved) nomination or award. <br /> <br /> "Titanic" does not take any "organization" seriously proposed for 11 Oscars. <br /> In review. "The Grich" is the best, best acting, and more enjoyable season film from "The Nightmare Before Christmas". Both films are very similar, too, in their most stylized sets and on the premise of stealing someone. Both their main actors are villains (higher than others), both as a strong moral lesson and two really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> You are a toy by Jack Skellington, and Grinch is a human being. But his movements are very liquid, so the cartoon is so unreal, a man who never gets in the film. He will be hilarious, he will be a sad soul, he will be angry. He lives in a 3-dimensional world where 3-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and finally he saves Christmas. I love this picture of bits, and I can not wait to get it on DVD. This is one of those films you have spent between 10 and 20 years. They are timeless for coming.
