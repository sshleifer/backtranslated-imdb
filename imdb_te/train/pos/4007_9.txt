A scary brilliant strip from the gifted British writer Hanif Kurishi, who wrote "My Beautiful Laundry" (from which he has since been the best). It's intelligent people who do not want to add up to most of their lives. They are emptied more than they have given, and there are mostly empty characters. The character of the living on the screen seems to be dead to the mother, but a tough hero shows his love and wakes her up to sex joys. He has his own intentions but Karishi deals with him with kindness. It is a movie in which people and places are familiar, in which the characters are beyond screen limits. In some respects it's a bit like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" but it's a robust task. Director, Roger Michel, allows the scenes to be constructed naturally. <br /> <br /> Her mother, Anne Reid, is every man who deceives her wasteful life. She does not have a false note in her unprecedented live display, and displays her character shadings much better than the actor Daniel Craig does not even tap into Kureishi. If the film touches a false note, she hooks you as if she played Cathrn Bradshaw very well, perhaps in the role of her mother Suduis (or the other way round) and Messi's life also play a talented daughter. The film is also very beautiful (Dope Alvin Kuchler) and is surely the best British film of the year.
