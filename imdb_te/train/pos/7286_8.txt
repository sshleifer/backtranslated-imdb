I had a heck of good time to watch this picture, and I was surprised by its amazing features. For the first time, the film has been made inexorably cheap for its cardboard sets, limited settings and creative scientific credentials. The actress was the first victim of the title role in the title role as a tremendous victim in the first-level (two strippers), the only professional (celebrity figure Herb Evers), Gothic Overstume (Leslie Daniels Assistant Kurt) for her science and her fianc√©e's intense desires. Scripting is very good and the dialog is excellent for the image of this film. There are a lot of things about science and medicine about what matters in our lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is an idea film in many ways. But do not be fooled by its true intention. This is the story of a man who is eager to find an interest in medical science who would like to meet the body with his dead girlfriend's head, creating a perfect woman for the best person of the body and soul. Another bright element of the film is the Socks music, which resonates with the town every time for doctor's beauty.
