Elizabeth (Mary Ellen Trainer) dares to kill her husband Joseph (Marshall Bell) and digs the body ready to run her body well. A homicidal maniac (Larry Drake) dressed in Santa Claus escaped from a local mental shelter, Elizabeth murdered many of her lists but she had other ideas, and her purpose was to take a seemingly dangerous situation. <br /> <br /> Regular stories from these stories Executive producers are directed by Robert Gemicus, Season 1 from Episode 2, and All Thru the House Continues to watch. Fred Decker's script was originally based on a story that appears in the comic 'The Walt of Horror', which was originally portrayed as an episode from Britz Horror's collection Tales from the Crypt (1972), a role played by Elnne Trinere in which Jon Collins was killed. This particular version is good enough but nothing different or unique does anything & it is simple to think & imaginable as a classic. It definitely sticks at a speed of 25 minutes in length, the story is just horrible & generally it gives good entertainment & much I've loved downbeat finishes. <br /> <br /> Director Gemkeis has done a good job & has a good winter atmosphere with an indication of Christmas effect, during which the Christmas backbone opening and closure of the Crypt Keeper (John Cassier) were completed. . There is no greater gore, someone has a poker on their head, one's face is cut with an icicle, one's hand is cut with ax, some blood is a polter, but not usually that graphic. Acting through small actors is very beautiful. <br /> And all the house is not the best story from Gothry, but it's fine, it's worth a watch, but after the comic book story & original 1972 film version we really need or want this?
