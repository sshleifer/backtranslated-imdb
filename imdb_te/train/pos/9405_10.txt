While Hollywood is not lying in the next few years after WWII, England has developed a very fruitful film industry. In "The Man in the White Suite", inventor Sydney Straton (Alec Guinness) creates a never-ending claim of slavery. Unfortunately, that means some other businesses can now come out of business! How can Sydney deal with this and continue to respect him? This is one example of Alec Guinny's great films before it turned into Obi von Canoebe. It's a good look at the whole absurdity of the business world. If you'd like to start any kind of business, you'd like to see this movie.
