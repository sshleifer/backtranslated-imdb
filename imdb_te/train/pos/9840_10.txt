<br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want, <br /> <br /> "Episode I first defined the X-Files before I started looking at it. The show came first and I saw some sections before it was too young to look like the parts of the jersey devil, but I'm looking at this episode of an 11-year-old who is very special and definitely creeped through the scene. They want to kill the hypnosis scene with death by the guy and then the little girl . I said I was sleeping for a few weeks! For this reason this episode has a special illusion about it now, the increased creatief factor I enjoy. Its past life spirit is enough enough to let some of the obvious flaws of the plot look like why she would wait up to 9 before her vengeance really started perfect. Or she's sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. You feel her parents are horrified. And perhaps they did not really see a piece of the story. And with telekinesis? This is not really a good explanation than adding a really good carrier factor to the creepy story. But with its little flaws, this is a classic episode in my mind and has little to no reason for me to do it myself. 10 to 10.
