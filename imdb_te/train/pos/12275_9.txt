<br /> <br /> I've never listened or read this book, but I'll watch the movie several times. <br /> <br /> In this movie, perhaps the most memorable with the rich pictures I can ever see in the movie. <br /> <br /> When I look at pictures many times, I think this is the idea. <br /> <br /> Excellent cinema, story, actors and cinematography. From every angle full of great emotions. <br /> <br /> Although I did not like romantic movies, I loved this and eventually moved to Ryder's request to his father. <br /> <br /> Iran is eligible for the award for his performance. Close is not good. <br /> <br />
