'Luzhin Defense' is the right time for anyone. It was a breeding, serious film, and kept my attention all the time. John Turturus is absolutely amazing in his role as a tender, unusual chess grand master, and Emily Watson is the most respected Russian family spell-binding as a sensitive but rebellious daughter. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the screen, their characters meet in this story. In all, this film is one of the best depths in the life of a chess grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a whole non-major, non-clic feel to the movie. Many come out of the theater idea, and rarely feel the love story is rarely touched by this amazing look.
