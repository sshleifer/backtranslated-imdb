Daniel Day-Lewis is the victim of Christie Brown, Cerebral Palsy, used to write and paint "My Left Foot" in this amazing 1989 film. The film stars Brenda Fricker as Christie's mother, Ray MacAnalyle, Fiona Shaw and Hugh O'Oneer. Jim Sheridan's excellent performances, great script and superb direction help paint a picture of an artist and author Christie Brown who died at age 49 in 1981. <br /> <br /> Brown's low-born middle-class Catholic family is constantly pregnant with his mother (a total of 22 children and 13 survivors). His father felt Christie was mentally retarded and physically disabled, but he was not allowed to go to his son's home. <br /> <br /> In this film, FECKER expresses the feelings of a woman. Who needs someone to talk, despite being surrounded by a huge family. Christie did not speak back. After all he had been a baby since he was a baby, he found a cart for him to kill him, and neighboring kids, all of his activities to include him. His left foot is only a part of his body, and when the kids know how well he is, they make him soccer games for that purpose. <br /> <br /> There are many powerful scenes, but there is no powerful man like Christie holding "Mother" on the floor. The lime piece between his toes. "He's a real brown," his father was carrying on his shoulders and took him to the pub. Walking in the pub, he declared, "My son is a genius." Things change when Christie grows in old age because he has little boy's desires and emotions. He develops crushes, refuses and goes further, revolves around painting. He eventually goes to the therapy in a nearby clinic and works with home therapist Eileen (Fiona Shaw). He falls in love with her. When she realizes that she is engaged, he almost goes crazy. <br /> <br /> This is the movie, because some things have to be left and the characters are joined. Brown was not actually suffering from cerebral palsy for some time, which was left in the film. The therapist Eileen is actually a combination of three important clinical persons in the life of Christ, and although she realizes that her mother believes that she has a good heart, she actually worked hard with Christie when she taught him the alphabet, and before Christ, Christy, "my left foot" D. had a 12-year relationship with him. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Hollywood ends nine years before his death. His wife could be a neglected factor and did not complete the story. <br /> <br /> Despite everything, Christie's biography is very powerful, more than two performances: Hugh O''Nor Young Christie and Daniel Day-Lewis adult Christie. O'Connor's facial expressions and the way he carries his warped body is gutted. <br /> What can one say about Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the greatest actors in the world - he will bring Christie to life entirely, breathless, angry, bitter, drunk, soft, lovely, funny and dear. That same year, Tom Cruise was nominated for "Born on the Fourth of July" and won a Best Oscar. Cruise is very sensational, what's wrong with the academy? Oh, nothing for change. <br /> <br /> Brenda Frecker is surprised by Christie's mother, who always stops belief and can do what he can and can have his family and husband together in difficult times. The amazing thing about Fricker's performance is that the support, love and work of the law appear to come naturally to the mother. This character does not feel her as a heroine or do something common. Fergir shows us religiously but fan of a believer that believes that he believes his duties as a good wife and mother on earth. Even when her husband was out of work, she was pregnant with her daughter, but she managed to find out what happened to her. She saves money for Christie's wheelchair, receiving photos of her daughter and baby, who builds a room for Christie on the back of her house. One day all part of the work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
