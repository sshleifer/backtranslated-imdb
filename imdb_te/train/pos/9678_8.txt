I wanted to talk to my own happy birds. Tis Tisk on critic of the film critic. The sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy. Paulie is a lovable little treasure. There are some clever lines he really made me laugh. I especially loved the dance sequences during her showbiz performance. In his quest with Mary, you can forgive clear clocks to cheer him up. A fascinating picture featuring two strong roles with a true paradise that breaks out of his young owner. In addition, many women want to see and abandon their mutual journey. I liked her artistic and poetic inspirations, and she did not share Paulie's reunion. Eventually Mary was blessed with his new home and joined a good young man who helped defeat the enemies to complete his journey.
