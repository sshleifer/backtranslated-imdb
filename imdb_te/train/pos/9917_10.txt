The documentary I have ever seen. It's a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea. <br /> <br /> Based on photographs of hidden industrial landscapes that are centered on China's modern industrial growth, Edward Bourdins faces difficulties to easily ignore us. <br /> We see that the film is neutral in any political party that does not make us aware of our Western societies - the realization of realities - economic growth, citizens of less developed communities, our comforts and the exposure of the waste of our customers' lifestyle. /> <br /> Amazing, heartbreaking, impossible impossible. This is a challenging journey, but taking a value - please keep in mind that these photographs can be seen without ignorance, at least without any pressure to stand up to these issues. Definitely 10/10!
