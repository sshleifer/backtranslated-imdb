There are some great moments in modern life (not only in Japan, but everywhere). <br /> <br /> Dancing is just a vehicle to say only a vehicle, "if you do not promise what you like." . I'll say Billy Elliot. I enjoyed the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> All the actors did a fantastic job and wrote the story well. I saw the second time and I caught some small nuances that missed on the first view. Good entertainment!
