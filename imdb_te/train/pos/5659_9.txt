Very rare drama, suspense and thriller show for American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many viewers. She was shot dead for Caleb to prevent Sheriff Lucas's overs. We are active and afraid of learning an unexpected connection between these two characters. Anyone who is afraid of what Lukas will do then is really surprising. This exhibition lived up to the "gothic" monitor in rarely tried ways of American entertainment, much less skillful. Claims were certainly a big mistake in supporting this program. This presentation puts the present glute of the "reality" shows-much less than the satisfactory view. The call for DVD box set relies heavily. The quality of the show is for the dazzling market for quality viewing. Invites this gem of a public true story that is overwhelmed by high-saturation of mind-numbing reality charges. Bring the DVD box set !!
