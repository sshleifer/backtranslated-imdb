But this is a great martial art film. Liu Chia Liang Phong was the second choreographer, only in his best match Samo Hung. It has emerged from the harsh performance of technology - at the time of fights - than flashing camera angles. Directing stimulates the viewer through speed and motion but strictly controlled to awe her with the perfect skill to be displayed. The film also took advantage of Liu's participation in front of the camera. Liu's performance at the opening dinner scene was one of the high points in Kung Fu's history. Liu's handsome and talented hiu ying hong (of my young aunty fame) and 'hassio hou', whose acoustic thrillers, and any wireless workshops have been prioritized, for the plot, the film follows the unusual theme of vengeance, Ethical development, and a very appropriate solution. Humor in this is also the best. If you ever see a kung fu movie, it's a good choice - it's all there.
