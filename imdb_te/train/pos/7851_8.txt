It is not unusual due to the cameraman's Revenge Subject (adultery) or animated (Winser McKay introduces Little Nemoni in the movie at this time), but it depicts leaks to tell the story! Ladislaw Starewicz actually wanted the original bugs fighting film but he pulled them dead and started using stop motion techniques to transform his satisfaction movements because they could not make it to the camera because they were hot lights dead by them. Keeping human qualities on small organisms such as heart sports, painting, filming, kisses, and dancing on these little organisms is good work. Starevique also made Frogland (1922) and The Muscat (1933), but his first major work was this. If you are interested in this and know about other shorts, check your local library to take a camera camera from film entertainment and other Fantastic Tales DVDs.
