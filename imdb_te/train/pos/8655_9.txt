"California" is one of my all-time favorite films, and it can easily be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90's. The film has a very stylish surface, but behind the maniac's disturbing and honest shots and the horrors of the horrors that lie on others are far behind. This is one of the most powerful elements of the film, the Brad Pitt trailer-trash named Psycho Early. Pitt has made his scary character almost flawless. Juliet Lewis is equally good as her innocent girlfriend, her innocence is almost a heartbeat. "California" has a very flexible plot, which moves slowly and slowly to about an hour, but suddenly murdered by Pitt's eradication of his mental personality. There are shocking scenes, and it mounts to a powerhouse climax that haunts you all day. The film "Caliphonia" is the worst of mankind, and it's not just violence and gore.
