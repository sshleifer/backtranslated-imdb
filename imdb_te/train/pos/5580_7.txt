Young beautiful Eva (Heidi Lamarre) marries an old man (Gwynemir Rogoz). Unfortunately she was not sexually satisfied and she did not care. Boredom goes to her home and plans to get divorce. Then, one day, she was naked in the lake in the middle of the woods. Her horse guards her dress ... and she runs later! She meets young and very beautiful Adam (Aribbert Mog). They love it and she finds the person she wants. <br /> <br /> Spaner ending !!!! Obviously, since it was made in 1933, she would have to be punished for her sin, which would lead to a tragic end. <br /> <br /> These frightened people were beautiful in 1933, but by today's standards. Lamer's naked swim does not show up, and when she runs after the horse is completely naked, it will be shown in serious long-term shots or covered with branches and covered. There are some shots of her breasts. Even when she has sex with Mog, nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an orgasm. The scene was pretty serious in their day and completely eliminated the American release. Just returned. The film is now easily available with PG-13. <br /> <br /> It's OK to keep shock episodes. It's pretty portrayed and next to the dialog. It may be a silent film except music score. Fortunately all the actors are good - Lamarr and Mog are very attractive and they're looking to keep your breath away. The sequence they love in love is one of the scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Sexually symbolic scenes (most of them are few) Unfortunately, today is very clear. <br /> <br /> In this way, great direction, beautiful imagery, attractive actors, better acting - but not bowled properly. I was slowly moving the picture (beautiful images did not make me a picture), somewhat dull, clear, static and negative conclusion. I can live with the end but I do not care about other problems with it. The final sequence is also really strange - and from the place. That's why I admire this film more than anything else. This is well done and I recommend it with recommendation but with recommendation. I think many people love this movie, so I am in a minority. Use your own judgment.
