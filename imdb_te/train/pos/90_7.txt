<br /> <br /> I think the film is perfect ... is not really the best thing ... he is a hard drunk, <br /> <br /> Ah, but now great kids can not happen? He is not a wealthy businessman who has big ballroom parties and has a nice manicure on the front of the small building. <br /> <br /> It's great to have a kid totally trash his life. After all, who will drive brand new SUV and who will go to Law School? <br /> <br /> Ah, poor little kids ... With their fifth league schools, ultra-clean houses and social parties in their home in a beautiful home ... Why do the world do it? <br /> I hope they all become slaves to drugs, pass their life and end up in jail ... So we are poor little boys and girls surreal world.
