The first 50 minutes of this film are very boring. It has focused on his personal problems, including his unhealthy wife and death threats by admitting his problems, guilt and guilt feelings for his mental illness. Although Doyle has had a significant impact on these things, I am more curious about the origins of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes are amazing. Finally got a look inside the Doyle head, and why did he create Holmes and why did he kill Holmes? The actors are fantastic. Arthur Conan Doyle, Tim McNerny, producer who plays Douglas Hensall and Brian Cox as 'Roll Model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell, is a good film in this area, especially a TV movie and camera work. If the first 50 minutes were 40 minutes better, it was a short story.
