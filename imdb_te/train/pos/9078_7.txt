Simply put, the plot is much better than I expected. The laughter track is sometimes a bit annoying and does not get that way; However, there are enough rick chuckles in this episode. I did not show the best lines and conditions in my big surprise trials. Especially in Spade, has not been shown in the best light of promotions in the past, but his role is very well on the pilot. Almost anyone has eye-candy and all the common characters appear to their predecessors. Now, the writers live in what they have opened up.
