There should be more movies about our Native Americans. I think it was the right thing to do with using real Indians, native Indians. This Archie Bellini, played by Pierce Brosnan, I know he has done an excellent job of playing the role. But my suggestion to Hollywood is to play more American Indians, and nobody else is used. The Suoison Nation backburner is too long. Their poverty is insulting in our country. I believe that our country will return to Blacks to Sioux. We ask the Israelites to return the Arabs to their lands, but now we should be shy. We Must Follow What We Preach!
