For a long time Red Sax fan, I had to watch the movie. That's great! There is not enough live footage from the miracle 2004 Red Sox season, and there are great shots in my favorite Red Sox players. While the film is definitely a chic movie, it's enough baseball footage from the back of the wonderful 2004 Red Sox to make one of my top 10 movies all the time. I especially became part of the red socks fans in Ben's baseball family. The scene where the Ben meets his buddies is dramatic to determine that Ben can get some games seats! If you're looking for a good movie to see with your spouse, date, or other important ones ... you're a baseball fan and especially a Red Sox fan!
