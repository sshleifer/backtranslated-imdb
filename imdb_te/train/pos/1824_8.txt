All dogs go to heaven I always liked the movie. When I was a child, I saw it every day. If you look at its IMDb rating and most people's comments, it will be lower. It's not a bad movie, it's a very good movie. It's good and your kids like it. Although it is rated for G, some parents may find it a bit violent. It's really a beautiful dark story, where dogs are similar to mobsters involving juggling, predatory, and even cold-blooded murder. The film follows a dog named Charlie, who escaped from the pound, his old friend dies, goes to heaven, but ends up returning to the ground. Seeing this movie is that they are seen by a very large child in a very small child. <br /> <br /> There are a few scary scenes of small children, but I'm sure they will do well. Every time I watch this movie, I remind myself when I was a little kid. I'm sure everyone is having images that they remember when they were young, and I feel that way. The performances from Burt Reynolds and Dom Dulis were good, a young girl named Judith Barsi, starred in the film, unfortunately, she was killed at a young age, what deserved. Now I know her story, because this voice is very sad and I can not see this movie right now. <br /> <br /> The animation in the film is great, the voice work is good, and the story is fine, but it is slightly different from most other children's movies. It was popular at the time of its release, but was photographed by Disney's mega popular Little Mermaid. This movie is not the same as the adults, but if you're a child, or if you have grown this kid with a kid, then I'm sure you will enjoy watching it.
