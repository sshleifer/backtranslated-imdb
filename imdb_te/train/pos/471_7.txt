The film plays Emily Watson of Waves Fame Breaking. The film is about a man's siege at a resort in the chess tournament. A chess masters arrives and soon falls in love (at first glance) with a woman who plays Emily Watson. A man who is engaged with her chess, comes for this oddball. When it frightened her mother, she was very interested in seeing her with another young man; Proper gentleman. Her mother feels that this is just a fancy of a young mother, because she has a tendency to take in odd animals. What a journey through man's mind is high. It tells the story of how close he is to his present. Emily Watson is amazing in this, as well as plays the lead role. It's definitely slow, but worth looking at. The ending is also satisfying. :)
