There are several types of reunion displays. Here is a kind of old actors taken from mothballs and they are set to recreate the characters they have not played for twenty or thirty years. They have mixed results. 'Maybury Return', despite some silliness, okay; 'Green Acres to Return' Executive (Eddie Albert used a term for the script, I will not repeat it here, but both the film and the movie Strange); Even though the show was very obscure from the 'Gilligans Island' perspective, it filled the gap needed to 'protect from Gilligan Island'. In most cases, the script is weak; Sometimes silliness appears in a very familiar script? And in the comedy almost always fatal for the characters they discover are funny. New characters are not suitable for the mix. Mainly, these reunion displays are very weak. In the second kind of 'reunion', the cast was put off its past but was around, telling stories, recollections, and pasting from performances. Then rarely have movies based on good performances; And the history of the show ("The Brady Bunch"). <br /> <br /> "Back to Batke" <br /> <br /> Back to the showcase of Adam West and Burt Ward and the original Batmobile. When they were there, the car was stolen. <br /> <br /> Cinema Adam West is demented by a man. He called Jerry, his butler, 'Alfred'. He opens Shakespeare's image in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to get to the parking garage. He was involved in a criminal warrior, in fact he was just a washed actor. When Batmobile is stolen he believes in his duty to rescue his criminal, and as his assistant he prefers Burt Ward and dislikes. <br /> The old and ward reminiscing about the old days. The "flashbacks" starring stars and wards in the old days is broken down. The absurd lack of reality shown by both modern scenes and 'flashbacks'. In the book of Ward about his time in the West's presentation, he spoke clearly about the libido of the West and his skin color (to pay for each of their pursuit of the West) tips and bus fares). The clues they follow, the characters they encountered (even in the flashback) fit the psychology of the old series and there are many commemorations, including fist fights with written effects. <br /> Complete with a very fun and great drink. Julie Neemar (she seems to have a lot of facilift) and even Cameo's by Frank Gorschin reminds us why he has such a ritual. Jim Carrey, his clear heir, is the Gorshin Ridler when he has long forgotten. The film is very clear but it's built for the funny climax. <br /> <br /> This program is a model for reunion exhibitions ?? Unfortunately, there are a few that fit the pattern. Actors put their old roles back into the program; There are young actors in the movie about making this show; Actors West and Ward recall; And playing Adam West, who portrayed a modern film with the true Adam West. It's everything. If you loved the old show, this bottle is the stopper.
