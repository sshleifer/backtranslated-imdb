The end of the season sent the mix messages, I felt the feelings of pleasure, and even the feelings of lied and deceiving. Rosenne tells her whole audience that the whole season is lying nine, because her husband, Don, is dead. Her family agreed to win the lottery, and what season 9 was just what she wanted or wanted to do. Becky and Mark agree to be pregnant because I'm still confused with Mikey, with Bickey David. So I wanted to see her, but it was not. So the end of the season is good, but sent mixed feelings. I'm always a fan of the show. :)
