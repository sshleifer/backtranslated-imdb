I do not know whether to recommend this movie to "Tetsuo" fans. Why "Tetsuo"? You need to be able to label it easily as "Tetsuo" rip-off about this image. The concept is identical, editing is equally frantic and fast - it's good because some of the disadvantages caused by low budget and other factors are obscure, without making the film more powerful. <br /> <br /> In the case of a lot more gore, low pollution and "metabol machine", the variance of a human being, known as "necroborg" (most original), is transformed into a human being, which is created by Slim's small aliens. <br /> <br /> They control the body, somehow manage to keep the mechanical parts, Switching out of nowhere and converts to other killing machines that targets other necroborgs. <br /> <br /> All in all, the plot is somewhat silly and I do not expect much, but it's a low budget movie, as it was previously said, but it's still good. Do not expect much from actors, they are not very good, but it can withstand. I liked the atmosphere and gore, some extravagant conditions and the way the film was directed and edited. <br /> <br /> While the story is not very original, I have some attraction.
