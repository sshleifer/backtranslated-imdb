I think it's unfortunate that the famous commentaries on the film are "clueless and frightening nonsense". I think that's a very funny movie and amazing entertainment. A homosexual and a lesbian woman falls in love, having a child and having a happy life should never stop a person's disbelief. But it's always amazing to see it played in a movie and warming the heart of a heart. Is it impossible? There are many unsustainable events described in other films. Acting is good, the script is fun. The only negative commentary is that the story goes out of the house, rather than exploring whether it has any residual homosexuality.
