A man and his wife get terrible car crash. When the wife remains in a sustainable vegetative state, the person must pick up the plugging and choose between her. <br /> "Wrong Turn" (directed by Rob Schmidt) A horror film under his belt, and it was not a particularly sensational, a bit reluctant to see this episode, Schmidt hoped to be in a very liberal sense as a "Master of Horror". His apologies for my low estimate. <br /> <br /> It's really great by episode 10 in the 13 episode season. <br /> <br /> The complexity of the "right to die" is to be a solid plot device and adequate detail. However, the story revolves around the foundation. If horror elements appear, the film will go from "good" to "amazing". Great acting, great story, great dialogue, great suspense. I was a little cool at times (it's fine) and much more: Gore is very rich! I've read this review of this episode before reviewing, where the reviewer says there's a strong indication of this "Hellraiser". In the first half of the show, I do not know what they are talking about. Then there's a bit that some images remind me of "Hellraiser 2". However, I'd like to get away from this film. <br /> <br /> Some stories may show up later and invite the viewer. Give the image a second look. I did not see a second time, but I think if I had it started (it's not confusing) I'd make sense. The subletlet is also good with dental hygiene, and I go back to whether or not I do not like the main role of her relationship with him or whether I feel bad about her. If he is, he's somewhat an anti-hero of the whole story. <br /> <br /> Stuart Gordon's episode is good and I'm excited about the "Washington's" episode, and I think I can safely bet it's a season's key episode and it's a lot worse and simple to save it. When the legends like John Carpenter come to come back to me (again) I'm worried about the future of the genre, but I am hoping to come along with a fresh face like Rob Schmidt. Please take this back to Schmid for a Keeper, and Season 3!
