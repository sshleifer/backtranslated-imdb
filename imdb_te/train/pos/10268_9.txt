This distinctive mammoth image makes a quiet, equally intuitive man of faith (Joe Mantanga) good. The well-known psychologist (Lindsay Crosse) is explored as a psychological study, which slowly pulls her world out of general evil consequences. Many of the mammoth films of this cast (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Joy, Andy Potock, Allen Soul, William H. Mackey) have identified many players, and have done their normal job. I loved Lindsey Croce in this film, and often wondered why she was not a more recognizable player than she had ever been. <br /> <br /> The film is slowly slow, with flat dialogue, and still maintains tactical levels, leading to logically ending bang-up. You might want to make a real pose at the end, but I found it to be exciting and satisfying. I love this movie!
