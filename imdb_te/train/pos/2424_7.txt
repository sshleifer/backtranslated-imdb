Three Schengble have their deserts after wasting their lives in bad thoughts, drugs, ego, and bad attitudes. Interesting and well-worked; This style of the movie will always make me wonder why it goes on and takes on the imagination. Although these folks are the scum of the earth, I found them still pittinging. They really never have a chance.
