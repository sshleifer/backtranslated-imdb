When this film first appeared, it was in VHS-video long ago. I like this movie because I'm funny and enthusiastic. A few years ago I saw another film: * Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure * Parts of the Lost Kingdom * wizards used in this movie. They called the movie "Korger Connor". I started searching for "KOR" for many years, because I wanted to see the full movie and not only parts of Andy Colli * The store has also rented this movie and the store does not know the shop. For many years I've seen my old VHS tapes at home, and surprisingly ... I've had this film at home for many years because it has 3 or 4 titles in Germany, but this film has a different title. I am happy to find this tape at home and this time I have a lot of time looking again at the cororgor. The music hole is great in the film, but this moment is the best part of the film that is accompanied by music, when drinking through the KOR green forester. Music has some magic in the background. I also like the boy who plays Bow Swenson and Simon. Both of them have a good job. Manfred Kratz, Germany, 26.10.2004. Thank you for reading my comment.
