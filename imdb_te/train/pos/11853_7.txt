Life pod is one of the movies you watch and should not be very tightly analyzed. Performance is not good, it is a job opportunity. Special effects are clearly low budget, but not too bad. Stack off the story line, but with an interesting twist. Computer Run Amok, but very correct when the computer and Run Amok reveal the truth. Yet the film is its moments and is very much viewable. For me, at least part of the film's attraction is Kristin Dibble's main character. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but she was pretty handsome as she was the month's former athlete. All Life Pod is similar to other low-budget size-free movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable. <br /> <br /> White star lines are quite beautiful if not quite right. The White Star Lines Company acquired Stock Quarterlines in 1947, and the last ship to run under White Star colors was sold for a scrap in the 1960s (not Titanic sister).
