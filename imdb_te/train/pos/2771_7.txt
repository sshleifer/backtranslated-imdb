Daryl F. Dave, directed by David and Bathsheba Herry King A luxury Hollywood Bible film produced by 20th Century Fox, Gregory Peck {King David}, Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kirron Moore (Urea) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film is surrounded by Samuel's second Old Testament text from the Holy Bible. When the baby slew the great Goliath, the king was following David as we are now the second king of Israel. The tough and guaranteed king, David, is dealing with great problems with heart problems. He bathe in the bathing of Bathsheba, and begins a journey with adultery and betrayal; <br /> <br /> For general genre, David & Bathsheba is a big, massive product. From its marvelous set designs to its magnificent technicolor photography {Leon Shamroy], it has enough quality to sit on the best side to consider product values. Bizarrely, Theo depends on 99% of the value of the film being driven entirely by central speed and dialogue. This is not one of those fans who want action or some swash to go with their buckle. This is a very humanistic film, which actually does not hit around the burning bush, a bible love story that catches the sins of the heart. We realized that it worked very well, because we realized that it worked well. It's true that Peck is still loser & Hayward pushing it up], and knowing that it's a good story, often forgotten by Henry King. <br /> <br /> Even though some dialogues are acceptable, Philip Dunne (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir) does not interfere with the attention characterized by the Oscar nominated screenplay. <br /> <br /> Some of the forgotten pictures of the Bible / knives & sandals styles (mostly a hearty talkie piece that is a major selling center), but it is really a good time for those who are the most luxurious of the genres. 7/10
