Anyone living near Buffalo, New York, this story has earned me points before I see here because the story is based here. There are also a bit of parts with real-life news-tv anchor people from Buffalo, and once, it does not beat that area. <br /> Philosophy-wise, puh-leeze !!! God is still doing to look and think like people ... and, of course, a bit on the liberal side. Being a mild comedy, it's nothing to win any awards, but it's still entertaining and a fun way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a very good movie.
