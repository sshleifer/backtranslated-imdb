The film was made in 1948, but it still is still true. Very, very funny. It wants to buy a small space in the country and it "builds" from there. For anyone who has built a house, this film is very attractive. Great cast. Cary Grant and Myna Lloyd are delighted in the film. It is a classic black and white image that reflects the 40th-century costume, architecture and great style of family life. Many references are spent on things, and those comparisons of today's costs are pretty spectacular. Anyone who does not enjoy this film can not imagine. I am wondering about the number of young people I could never hear. True classic.
