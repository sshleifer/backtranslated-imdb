*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. <br /> <br /> The story and the film is much better than all, Brosnan is never better than a film outside his "Bond" films. After 2004 "after sunset" his new character will laugh and bring a great time. Professional Hitman, to talk, Mexico City employee Julian Noble meets her top-level entrepreneur Danny Wright (Kinnear, one of his finest characters). The duo on the two screen produces a funniest charge, laughing riot and failing to laugh. Davis is one of his best roles from "American Springer", another beautiful and witty performance. The most fun and the best pictures in years. My last rating is 9/10
