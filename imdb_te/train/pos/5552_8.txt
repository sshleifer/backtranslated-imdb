I am waiting to write till July 4. . . Well. . . Because it feels right to do on this day. <br /> <br /> D.W. Griffith needed to hit, he was not big from Storm's Orphans (1921). He has been working gradually since then, but the scope of his films is small and it does not hit the right strings with the audience. He planned to portray Patrick Henry by members of Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), asking him to extend his ideas to most of the American revolution. This is the result of the film. By the time he finished he had a 14th reel history lesson and not where Patrick Henry's trace was. <br /> <br /> We know the story of the Revolutionary War but the Patriot farmer Nathan (Neil Hamilton) with Griffith love story falls in love with Tory Lord Nancy Monteg (Carroll Dempster, the main woman of Griffith for many years). Nancy's father is complicated by the fact that his father is hating the law. . . Not Nathan well, he hates all the rebels. <br /> <br /> Nathan's hand in the fighting in the Lexington streets will leave his pistol and accidentally injure Nancy's father. <br /> <br /> The story of Captain Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore), a rebellious British officer, could not be loyal to anyone, while eight Indians formed Six Nations on his side, <br /> <br /> Comparisons are essential to the birth of a nation (1915) The previous sequel to the family was Nathan Stonman's family.The sequence of the Battle of the Bunker Hill was likewise demonstrated by a soldier attacking the Redcoats, where the only thing missing is the Redcoats hitting a trench with the patriots.The charging across Henry Valtale no man's landing A fist   గి గుండులో ఒక జెండాను కలిగి ఉంది. అద్భుతంగా సరిపోయే యుధ్ధంలో అమెరికాలో యుద్ధ సన్నివేశాలు శక్తిని కలిగి ఉండవు మరియు ప్రేక్షకులను ఆకర్షించడంలో విఫలమవుతాయి. ఏదో స్పష్టంగా లేదు. ఇది పరిధి కాదు, G.W. "బిల్లీ" బిట్జెర్ కెమెరా పని చాలా మంచిది. Perhaps there is nothing to do. . . I dare say it. . . <br /> <br /> Captain Butler and his men's cruelty have been emphasized, but it is long shot or off screen. Do not expect any heads to be cut in the closet as we see in INTOLERANCE (1916). In Buttler's second command in a scene, Captain Herr (Louise Wolffem) sees a bandit migrant eyes. We see only the beginning of the document, and the rest focuses on the face of the camera hare because it's a good time he's doing. From 1912 he worked with Lionel Griffith and work. Griffith's work and D.W. For which he is known for his famous family, saying "I do not appoint stage actors". Lionel replied, "I'm not kind, sir!" He makes a good and incredibly believable villain. Three-time brother of Louis Wolhim Lionel's elder brother John; SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. JEKYLL and MR. HYDE (both) and later in The Tempest (1927). <br /> <br /> Cap Hare does not recognize his wild-eyed eyes and disappearing hair as a villain, and he also feels very insane. <br /> <br /> Neil Hamilton is the first American horse on the front and "I'm dead." He hides his displeasure very well and we can believe that time is by far the most horseback. Griffith is very much in love with Carol Dempster and asked her to marry him at one time. She refused and soon left her stock company, and then slowly declining her star status. <br /> <br /> When talking about horses, unexpectedly a moment, came during the shooting of Paul Revere's ride. He put his horse on the front of a family in the hands of "hands! Rules are coming!" But when he tries to go, the horse can not discuss the steps back and fill his rider with the ball on the ground! I'm surprised Griffith did not do something else. <br /> <br /> Do not be classic to America? Yes! Do not wait until July 4th to see it, be happy anytime.
