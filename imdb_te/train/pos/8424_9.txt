My Bush South Park creators are a live action project by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. This is a pretty funny snoop of my Bush Average Network TV sitcom. It's also a political satire. Now it's a South Park somewhere Not near, but it's a funniest funny scene and a pretty good political satire. The guy who plays in my bush looks much like him! If you can find a presentation, check it. There are plenty of laughs. <br /> <br />
