I saw this in the theater during the initial release and I'm still sure it is disturbing. This is the first part of '68 and it is still rounding towns across the Americas and recently I was massacred in my hometown of my hometown shooting rampage. The freshness of the close-to-home event that combines this dramatic real story made for a very disturbing theater experience. It really brought Robert Blake and Scott Wilson outstanding acting. I liked the novel based on the true incident by screenwriting and directing Truman Capote and Richard Brooks, which became a movie adaptation of the show and Truman's explanation. Music effectively scores from Quincy Jones. I only saw these two times. This is very true. It is almost like a testimony to the crime and riding with the killers. I will give this a 9.0 opportunity 10. Society violence and crime this day maybe this slow and tame and low impact can be seen but in a desensitized psyche so that over 50 will be a hallmark of this criminal examination.
