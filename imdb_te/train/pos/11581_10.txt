Many of the horror panic that war and violence brings to us will be difficult to call the battle and the hoccochet shocked film. I'm really impressed by the fact that I would not be surprised at what I had said in the film or used to tell them that I was not aware of them in the past, but I'm really impressed by the movie <br /> <br /> Hanna's successful role in Han's Hungarian Resistance How much to kill each other, keeping in mind the portion Terrific and incomprehensible. Due to the rare directing, the Messenger of DÃ©maks never achieved an Oscar for this show, but her performance is strong enough and she has a huge appeal. She played well as Hannah and immediately had our sympathy. <br /> <br /> Help her look very pretty, but it does not play a good role as she is a good actress. <br /> <br /> Hannah's battle has some inequalities. I sometimes have a rush of thought director Menahem Golan (often denounced for Jean Versus Murder) and should actually be allowed to take some more to the scene. On the other hand, I am very grateful to this grateful and thought-provoking film and I feel very positive about it, and I think he has done a good job. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is the most interesting and tragic. It focuses on Hannah's suffering (beware of Donald Pleasures's cruel and shepherd Captain Rozza's horrific role) and show hostility and horror and war-torn injustice and horror. I'll take Hannah's war as a strong anti-war film in the second half and a credit for that same golan. It also comes out of Maruschka Detmer's talent in this second half, creating a character that goes into film history as one of the most memorable, portrayed of strong and tragic. Ellen Berstein is also good to see, its performance and acting style is always reminiscent of Romei Shinidar, she is alive and cast - has made this an effective contribution to Hannah's war. <br /> <br /> The tragic impact of the second half and the disappointing tension can sometimes lead to the final scenes being replaced by hopeful opportunities and good news, moving and moving in poetry and poetry that hit me like a bomb and dropped me in tears. When I get to know again it's not even fiction, this is true, I'm still in tears. Hannah's film shot by Mariuska Deters will always be in my mind.
