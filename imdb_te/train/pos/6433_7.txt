Many posters of Reiner have expressed his wish to make a film showing the Ingrid Bergmam who laughs at the camera. The short answer is that we only have to do so with a choice not only for the tough reality. Bergman was unable to arrest at this stage in her career; In 1949 she left Hollywood to be shot in Europe, waiting for director Roberto Rosellini and never looked at her. She was ready to open the vein after five turkeys in Italy, but year after she made it for Renoir, she returned with Oscar for booting to Austinia. Renoir is one of three films in color at this time and it's not better than a golden coach on balance, it's not hard, and even with French Ken. Renoir probably traveled to Bergman and selected two wooden men and renares on both occasions by Jean Maras and Mel Ferrer, two dugies of solid Mahogany. Although this plot is actually based on a real incident in French history, his father focuses on redesigning the images after being eased and set up by Renoir. This is nothing but a picture of Les Granadae Manows, which is paying for its pastel colors. In all this, it remains a pleasant value for a beautiful and attractive actress.
