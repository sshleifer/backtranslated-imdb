Another review compares this team to a cross between Moti Python and Twin Peaks, aptly. <br /> Another criticism explains the differences between the critical and black comedy and the unpleasant comedy. At the end, all the letters are tied up, the puzzle pieces fall into the novel just Douglas Adams. Details and implications are staggering. Completely Post-Modern. Tragically funny, and struggling tragic. Not for children. Neither the thin skins nor the impatience. Inspiring the thought. Surrealism is rarely literal, rhetorical, and surreal. <br /> And the most wonderful thing I'll ever see.
