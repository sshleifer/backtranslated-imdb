This film is great. If you are a fan of Tui Hark and Chinese fantasy films, you might like it. The film is Lord Lord the Rings: A Fay Fantasy Story, based on original Chinese mythology. (I think many critics call the story short, they think they have zero knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you liked the stimiders or warriors of Heaven & Earth, it was your narrow. U.S. The film is still very difficult to buy in the US, along with crouching tiger, hidden dragon and iron monkeys for the film. Well worth the search! This DVD is also worthy of owning.
