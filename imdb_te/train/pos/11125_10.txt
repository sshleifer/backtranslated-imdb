What can you say about the display of this size? "Sopranos" literally has television redevelopment, as we know. It broke all rules and established new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless, writing, directing, and me, all too, acting. By looking at this show you find that these characters are not real. Actual Tony Soprano or any role you can think of is acting tricks. This performance is very versatile. Some people do not see the show because of violence, it's not about violence, it's about business, family and many in-depth matters. I do not like people to represent a presentation about the show and mafia. For me, it's a show about the family. People who are aged, stay away from the crowd. Overall this is the best work of the show. It should be television. Here. From fairy tale to fantastic acting, complex characters from fairy tales, and what do you get when you add these ingredients? Defines excellence and courage is different.
