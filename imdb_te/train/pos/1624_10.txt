The Old Mill pond is a tribute to the African-American entertainers of the 30s than any delay (the Steffen Fetchite satire). In addition to those I mentioned, there are also frogs or fish versions of cab colove, fatwaller, jassfine baker, bill "bosimile" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. This Happy Harmonies Cartoon from Hugh Hormone and Rudolf Eyesing is a very entertaining musical with very perfect qualities. They're all okay to me half the sound like the real thing they think might possibly be. Otherwise, they are definitely very appreciative. The lazy, shiftless fuchet character also plays an exciting exercise when a tiger is followed by a "Hold That Tiger" score. Recommended for most 30 'animation and jazz music fans.
