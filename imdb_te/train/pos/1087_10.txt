There is a lot of love in this darling small comedy. Anybody who has built or purchased at home or anywhere else with space, just finds that Mr. Blanding.Melvyn Douglas is more than just a grain of truth. Great comic flame, and Blandings' lawyer and voice of reason works. As well as Minna Loy a rather scatterbrained but very patient wife is her best. But the best performance is Grant's. During the release of the film, especially the American, when he was in the grip of housing shortly after the end of the war. The themes are universal, lack of money, work pressure, fear of disbelief. Yes, it's pretty neat, but remember that this is the time when the world is recovering from a terrible battle. This is still true, I will tell you the poor reviews of the current importance of being disappointed and attending the mobilization. The image's look is mild and some great bits are good, especially in the beginning. Although it has lost some social feelings, it is still a gem after nearly sixty years of release.
