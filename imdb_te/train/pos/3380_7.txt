I've seen tons of science fiction from the 70s; Some horror is bad, and others are provoking and really intimidating. Soylent Green fits into the second category. Yes, at times it's a little campy, and yes, furniture is good for a moment or two, but some film seems to be very dear. Here Blade Runner features a 9-year movie, which can be expected in the future, dark, horror, and straightforward. Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson are both better than The Ten Commandments, and Robinson's assistant-suicide scenario is Keworkian and his Ilque. Have some perspectives (Can you imagine the concept of "women as furniture" in our OH-so-politically-correct-90s as a filmmaker?), But you actually think from your decade. This is the one I like to see on the big screen, because I do not think that in the Wide Screen display, the entire scope of this image is due to that. Check it out.
