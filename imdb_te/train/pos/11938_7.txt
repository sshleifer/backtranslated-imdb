I enjoy movies like this for their soul, no pun intended. His good, clean image about a baseball team falling behind, and his dearbeat dad only to say that he will come back for them, as a young fan wishes to win them. The soul is shining in two ways: funny cast with heavenly herald al, taking the daring form of Danny Glover and young Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Christopher Lloyd. Its powerful image. It gets you smiling, and really be in the sport. <br /> <br /> Here's my stomach ache. One of the most flawed things to me is these sports films, which becomes an unpredictable fan for the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong. I have to be away from the film thinking of a strong, cool team thinking of Angels I find it odd, when it really is my base loyalty, Toronto is with Blue Jaws. It's really interesting. It's just a movie about an underdog children's group, but its okay.
