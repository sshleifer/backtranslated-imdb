This works well if it is made "Mitchell in Malta". At least then we could have escaped the sight of a lovely looking Mediterranean language that Joe Dan Baker dressed in that ludicrous looking cowboy outfit ... did not say she was playing an old West gun baked. With Michelle Mitchell, the film is not a comparable police brutality. Oh! Good. At least Mike and Bates's comic commentaries make this an enjoyable charge as MST's episode. But I can not imagine looking at its own.
