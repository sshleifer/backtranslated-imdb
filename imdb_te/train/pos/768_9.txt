In the film, the film sticks. So doing a lot of acting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not want to be alone, <br /> <br /> When it comes to hip-hop life, it's almost like a documentary in the past. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is very small to remember that it is poor. <br /> <br /> Hip-hop / break ID is the best. <br /> <br /> 80 s all bad TV programs, <br /> films, but it is always us who lived through it <br /> <music, dance, and graffiti is fresh, it is a lot of love!
