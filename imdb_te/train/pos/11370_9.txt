Spoilers - until I explain their relationship to the characters and the plot. <br /> This is a quality image. The subject is tragic and persevering. The role of Stephen Ry's character, Burekov, is just attractive. Despite his apologies, his hangout, a constant expression, plays a very important role. He tells about the role of inspector Taggart TV series in England, because he will kill three weeks a week. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland's character "Mikhail Fetisov" is a crucial role (and shown as BBC1, which is the remake of the Body Snacchers' Invasion) I'll write it). Burakov is consistent with his quiet support. And it ends with perestroika, and runs the FBI's involvement in profiling. <br /> <br /> In this case, I must have to do with this.
