The animated features of Disney's 1950s have been criticized for making people overly glossy, overwhelming landscapes. That's just the criticism. "Alice in Wonderland" and "Peter Pan" - because the two yet weak glossy yet and not the whole story. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella", on the other hand, is set in the world with very dusty sparkles and is clearly the best. <br /> This is good. Backgrounds are subtle and stable; Colors are pure without too much brightness. Animation is a bit different. I would assume that some rothoscope is in humans - but rutoscoped humans (including Cinderella her) are not full-blooded characters in the script, so this approach works well. It's really a picture of animals. The studio never used animals in this way, rather than totems than sidecars. For example, rats are creatures that take us into the story. But they are really colorless Cinderella representatives or allies. Cat, Lucifer, is a witch of Wicked stepfather. (The cat is brilliantly evolved and animated - one of the best feline creations of all time.) The ward of the animated ward is made by Kimball and his own cat. Steal the show without attracting our attention from the main story. <br /> <br /> In the main cast only their actions have the maximum interest. <br /> <br /> The famous man is King and Grand Duke. The King is a note character - he wants grandchildren and has all the other desires - but the note runs in a pleasing fashion. The Grand Duke is a Put-Own character that deserves to be removed from his sphere like Cinderella. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is Disney's return for symptoms after an eight-year break, and with his or her image, he has been an early crystalline. He also took care of himself by selecting "Cinderella". She is a passive heroine and many people can not make it about. (Maybe I'm wrong at this score - I do not see it recently "Ever After"). Yet, Disney has been able to bring this enthusiastic story into life, which is uncut across the grain of his soul.
