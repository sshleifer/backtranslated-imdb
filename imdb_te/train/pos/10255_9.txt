The film is the first and the best in six prominent Guinea Pig Movies. At the same time, knowing that it is fake, looks realistic and unrealistic. The story is about a woman who has been captured and tortured many in many ways. At the beginning of the story, a person receives a letter without a return address, and it contains a manga video showing violence. The men who capture her test a human limit before dying. It is not surprising that some scenes are a sight of the eye and it is not surprising that the girl has almost 100 times, because in each picture you will see punches. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of gore, so I recommend it to 17 or more people. <br /> <br />
