I have encountered some of the problems with this movie, which has come up with a lot of criticism, which is overlapping and overrated. It's true, it will last for three hours, but I am surprised at it. I do not think it is overrated, I think IMDb rating is absolutely good. The film has gorgeous dress and amazing effects, and directing from James Cameron rarely falls from sight. Leonardo DiCaprio is such a beautiful as Jack, and Kate Winslet Rose in his best performances. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he has. This story is very detailed and it is hot with character development, which moves in love when it's in love, the first bit of the film is a bit slow. The last hour was stirred up, when I was sinking the Titanic, I would admit that I was on the edge of my seat. I also say that the last five minutes can not move too much. James Horner's music score was lovely, though my heart never went on the song on the song. The 1996 documentary films were good, but with the emerging scenes and some historical errors. Overall, I give it to the 8.5 / 10 Titanic. Bethany Cox.
