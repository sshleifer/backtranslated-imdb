Only 2-part two and two names in the 3-year run of the regular trek series. Most of the "The Cage" footage was inserted from Rodden Berry 1 pilot. This move was created to meet the need to overcome the deadlines in getting episodes (hassle back to the sf performance time back in the 1960s). Audiences who do not know about the pilot that were built almost two years ago for the two episodes of the regular cast of the characters, would have to pay a dozen years of money on these episodes to extend a dozen years of staplettes history (such as 'United Space Fleet' still Payogincinappatiki). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ McCoy also claims that Spock's Valkon legacy is not part of his legacy, but Spock really runs some unsuccessful scheme for Shanghai to our precious starry ship and has now stormed his former Captain pick. Well, Spock is half human, we are forgetting. Or was he just mad? It may well be that he is directing the company to Toulouse IV, a planet so it is related to the death penalty known to Starfight's books. As the jail rises, Uhuru appears to be in shock, and Spock's great scene surrenders to McCoy. <br /> <br /> In the 3rd and final programs we are starting to see the broadcasting images of a mission. Captain Pike Commanding and Spock was one of his officers when 13 years before the enterprise. We do not really know where all this goes and hopes to achieve the spock - and this is another thing that makes 2-Partter very good - we really need to learn about in all the 2nd part. Spock faces only fatal penalties, but Kirk's career seems to have ended, as well. Double tournaments, folks. The first television episode of one of those shuttle caps is also available (first available in "The Enemy Within" when the handpuff is really not needed). One of those slow matte paintings is also to inform the star of the future starbase - the only way to rethink such things. Finally, check Kirk's self-esteem in the beginning of the episode, and the story does not go sideways with the story going forward.
