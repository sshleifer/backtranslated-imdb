I am trying to take IMDb ratings, but I'm in a chaos when I look at the 5.4 ratings of my childhood. This is not a 17th place, but it's a sweet and well-liked movie like a family movie. Kids definitely love it and do not mind errors, and adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the film's spectacular message. The film is not any way preachy, in fact there is a great message that has added its sweetness. The story is on the narrow side, and some scenes like screws death may still be tired on the horror side. But the animation is well above average with nice colors and good character animation. James Horner's music is very beautiful, and the song is memorable, impressive and entertaining. I really liked the characters, Louie is probably the most all of them deep, but the dinosaurs are submerged at least. Martin Shore's clown is hilarious and tough, he screweyes "I leave!" I got in stitches. My favorite is screwies, skillful villain who is crafty and I think it's brilliant. Anyway, however, I would like to see how he lost his eye and when he describes why he was scared of the crows because he was able to develop deeper. The Oscar-worthy script is composed of its funny and heart-warming parts and should be fun for children and adults. That's what made me acting voice. John Goodman, Martin Short, Riya Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yardley Smith all performed well, but he was not as screensaver and spectacular as he went to Kenneth Mars. All in all, this is a good movie. I can not get a rating, I honestly do not. Definitely this movie is not accurate, and it's not as good as a dinosaur film like Time Land Time, but it's fine. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
