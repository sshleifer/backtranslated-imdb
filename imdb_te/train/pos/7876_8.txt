I did not like the bar from the director. <br /> I did not see his other pictures. They came and went away. <br /> <br /> But Page-3 is made well. It seems true. Just like the truth from RGV. <br /> <br /> The essence of the movie is the mental illness known as the High Society. In the middle of all illnesses, the protagonist, Konkana Sen, it was difficult to live a normal life. Serious movie should not be seen with children or expecting wives. Newspaper page-3 is a common place to report on events that are to be held in rich and upper-class parties. This page-3 is also shown a business opportunity picture. Event management organizations are known for establishing parties and by non-rich individuals, by clicking on photographs with celebrities who are invited to party function. <br /> <p> Western culture has become much deeper into the greater society of Mumabi. . <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar begins a new journey from here.
