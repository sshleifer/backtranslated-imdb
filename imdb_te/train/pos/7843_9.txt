I can not believe that they will remove this wind. Specifically, they are only a few episodes left. Some of my daughters, sisters and my friends liked watching this show. We were disappointed when they stopped displaying it because of such ratings. It's not right for people looking at this show from the outset. We have the right to see the end. I wanted to vote from all the people in the voting system for 3 times a year. They can send papers in the mail and viewers can vote on all the activities we've seen or heard. It also helps to promote a new presentation. People see it and wonder what it is. You can not see what viewers are seeing, you can use it for free ad for TV and cable channels. We want to see other episodes. Teskura !!
