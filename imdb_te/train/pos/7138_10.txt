John Tha does not appear in "Morse", "Cavanagh", or "Sweeney" and other productions, "Goodnight Mr. Tom" reminiscent of this wonderful unforgettable appearance. His co-star (in his first role as young Nick Robinson), and a typical cast, is a mere memorial to the art of Michel Magorian's fascinating novel. When I read this story of an old widow Norfolk, I had a clear clear time-line error when I had to take a baby from London and Blitz during that time, and I found the credit for the film's producers. <br /> If you place a CD or video library, it will feel better. Absolute necessity for TV movie making.
