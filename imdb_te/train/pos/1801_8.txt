When I first appeared in 1989, I saw it. Then I enjoyed it, I'll do it again. But now I realize that this G rating is too big for a movie with the feeling of going to die and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dome Deloise work great together, and Reynolds's singing voice is suitable for a junkyard dog. There are some good songs from upbeat ("Let's Make Music Together") to the upbeat ("Heart to My Heart"). I found the plot was good, though it would go off once or twice a tangent. The last sequences in the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie are one of the best I've seen in animation. A valuable picture of experience.
