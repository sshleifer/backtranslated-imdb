Guy Kebbi gives audiences a lot smiling. Like many candidates he does not know anything. Warren William is a very small actor, giving instructions to Kibby; That is, he teaches that the vote can teach him nothing to understand. A campaign based on any comment, "I will take advice below," and "maybe yes, but no one else" is the perfect way to win the election. Briefly, the dumber candidate, he or she is more likely to win. After all, people can be identified with such a person. This makes for a lot of humor in the movie.
