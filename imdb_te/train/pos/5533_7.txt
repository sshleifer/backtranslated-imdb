The filmmakers brought to us by The Magazine of the Penguins, I guess there are many predictions for The Fox and the Child. The narrative now refers to friendship between the documentary and the two fairy tales, from the harsh winter of the South Pole to the lash in France, referring to its friendship with Renard the Fox and its nicknamed child It is simplistic and sometimes the film is like many Japanese movies, which are children-other animals After the development of trust, friendship, and how they were beating on each other, hanging around, and likes to deal with opponents. <br /> <br /> Here the child meets the elegant fox near the house, which cinematographer has to give complete shots and overdrive to catch a cinematographer. <br /> <br /> Drown in surprising scenes, the characters can not get the level to establish the level of trust from the start and wait a few seasons in the past, and wait 45 minutes before they find a level of food. The child constantly tries to kill a relationship that moves his own amusing creature, but the fox, well, and of course the other feelings. The narrative of the film is, rather than the penguins' march of the narrative of the narrative of the narrative of what is happening on the screen, <br /> <br /> Among the two, between tension and drama, especially wolves When dealing with traditional enemies and those scenes are very serious, especially the child is trapped Do it. Otherwise, both of them pretend to play their games together, as you know some magic magic revisions are plain sailing and much bored. Suddenly parents are in the same hall that confirmed it by bawling their eyes, really parents, you may have to take note and let your toddler let down, it is surprisingly dark moments that are not really suitable for children are part of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> As a film, I want to see how the full documentary is the March of the Persians, but I guess I was angry, warn us not to interfere with nature and that some things are not meant to be, and so on. Bertillo Noel-Brunei and Renard is a good film that relies on chemistry strength between multiple foxes.
