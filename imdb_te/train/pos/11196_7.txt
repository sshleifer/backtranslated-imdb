'One-round' is called Jack Sander, because he is a struggling carnival boxer in the audience. If they can continue a round, they win the prize - a popular way to attract customers in a number of previous travel shows. The Jack Ticket Girl is in love with Mabel, although Jack moved into the carbin ring to try his chances. No one knows in the fighting, that Bob was champion, so he was able to defeat Jack - he took some work. Consequently, Jack asks him to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit. Later, Jack is also the most legitimate boxer. <br /> <br /> At this time, Champ and Mabel have been behind the back of Jack - even though Mabel is now married, Jack. So, when the last fight between Jack and Bob formed, it is very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Was he good enough? Could Bob's help bring up an upright anger or prevent his performance? <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and it is this time that it is strange to the director of the mystery-suspense films of the 1920s, which Hitchcock has no fixed style or he wrote or wrote the film (both of which he did). In fact, in many respects the film is a hint of hitchcock's silly style, as one of his subsequent silence Maxmann (also played by Carl Brisson as her husband's husband) came to some similar hero. <br /> <br /> Overall, a bit predictable and, if most people today look like a standard boxing movie, this is not a radical departure for the great director. As Ian Hunter seems to be fond of playing a boxing champ, the film works well. From the very precise silence, it is well worth it and will prepare a good punch.
