Aha is great. I saw this film at the Irish International Film Flade in Manhattan on 12 March 2000. Both stars are attending and later available to questions. A Gorazhous Film! Despite the Catholic / Protestant rivalry in Europe, the story takes place between any two groups of people who hate each other. Horror jokes and entertaining moody love story is a beautiful story of how quickly taking people away when giving them the opportunity to reveal their hatred and anger. <br /> <br /> If it does not take us to USA, it's very unfortunate. <br /> <br /> For stars and supporters ... first rate. They call Orla Brady Irish Meryl Streep, I heard. My opinion is that she is better than the marel stream. They call Merrill American Orla Brady! <br /> <br /> Liam Cunningham's rigid and vibrant role in a political battle of the simple and personal person is amazing. <br /> Watch this movie.
