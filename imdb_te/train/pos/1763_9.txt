This is one of the funniest films I've seen. It has raw moments, but they are full of charm. It's a pleasure to see Altmanesque screenplay, intelligent physical humor, and relaxed friendships, and most of us relate to the piece. And I can say with the measure of honesty that was afraid for Steve Karel's nipple .. really is. Surprisingly, this is good about nature, unabashed comedy love, and many relationships we can find ourselves along the way. Catherine is keener as Keyner Trish, and Steve Karel's friends are flawed, forgiving, and very happy. They thought that Karel was a serial killer was a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year virgin. But he wanted to be in love with the simple truth. The original, lovely, and very funny. Highly recommended.
