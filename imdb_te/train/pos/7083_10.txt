<br /> <br /> 12 monkeys are a picture you have not seen every day. It's a wonderful story to go with a good story. <br /> <br /> It is not a simple role for Bruce Willis, but he has a role to play the role of John McQonan. <br /> The virus is killing everyone and everyone is on the planet, but the story is nothing new but a story <br /> <br /> A man (Bruce) will be sent back to get information on the virus that was wiped out by a man. <br /> <br /> These actors are awesome. <br /> <br /> I mentioned Brad Pitt, who was happy to meet psychologist James Cole (Bruce) in a mental hospital. <br /> <br /> When people move to underground facilities, they see the world of animals that are in the world of viruses. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <br /> <br />
