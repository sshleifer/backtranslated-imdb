Errol Flynn is one of the best screening shows of Warner Bros.. It is often said to be his best, and I can not fully confirm until I see his "Don Petrol". However, his work takes some beating in "they are running their shoes". I think he's a great Flynn fan (he's my favorite actor after James Mason - he's also helping him to be an Aceh) and I think he's an amazing, great screen presence and a great actor. He is the legendary boxer with fancy pedestrians as the head of the "Gentleman Jim", but he is also supporting a literacy, warm and funny script and by Raul Walsh. Every Walsh movie I've seen does not lose the beat of it's pace, a film-maker who was really born. He walks beautifully with Walsh Ring scenes with lightweight moves and sharp, great final scenes between Ward board and Flynn. That great product values ​​("Gay Nineties" never ever looked better!) And add a lovely support cast and it's pretty much perfect entertainment. Alan Hale usually plays Flynn's footsteps, but his father is here, and it still works. Alexis Smith is interested in Flynn's love. The couple are head over heels in love fighting with each other.
