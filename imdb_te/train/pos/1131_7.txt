This is a very fun movie. The plot of one of those who could sit and look at you unexpectedly broke up; More funny. Sally Field, Terry Hatcher (in her Hay Day), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shoe, Robert Downey, Jr. ... These famous people acted as actors / producers. Have you ever watched a soap opera and asked, "How did this come to earth with this idea?" If you think that, you love this movie. I have seen so many times. And every time I watch, I appreciate more humor, and I realize how well I'm doing well. Do not expect Oscar quality. It's a fun entertaining film, not a few artsy attempt to find "man's inner man", sit back, relax, and laugh.
