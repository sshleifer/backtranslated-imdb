While doing some movies, I touched my heart about "poly". It's a witty, funny and emotional film. I'm pretending to be a fan of this film. I did not see "Pali" until May 2004, and since then I ordered Widescreen DVD from the seller in Ebay. <br /> <br /> The special effects shown by Paulie are wonderful. My son asked me how many words were to be heard. My favorite part of the movie is probably when Pali Gina Rolandz (Ivy's) is following the company Cheri Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhub (Misha) plays a wonderful role as a good heart man. Root for him through this movie. <br /> You can not go to rent and buy this movie!
