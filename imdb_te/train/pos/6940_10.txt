The Tales of Manhattan in 1942 told the story of the storyless stories, but wearing men's evening dresses. Each story began when another story (Charles Boyer, for example) issued "tails" from another (Caesar Romero). WINCHESTER '73, a superior image, and a great western, similar plot twist. Initially, Jimmy Stewart Stephen (Horace) gets a grave revenge on McMahon. But in the film two men enter into a shooting contest, the prize is one of the new Winchester rifles (given by Marshall Wyatt Epub - Will Gear). Stewart beat MacMonn, but the gun was stolen from Stewart and the chase. <br /> <br /> If Gun John McIntyre (unfortunately not known when proud to be a merchant), Rock Hudson (in a surprising role - to Charles Drake, Don Duria (as the joyful and moody Woho Johnny Dean), McMahon, <br /> <br /> The movie is directed by Anthony Mann and each character has a wide variety of experiences.Douya Drake's He loses the rifle literally in the dead body (the Dewey problem is damaging) but McMahon, who is quicker to draw, is not stupid enough to fight for a duel rifle.) He and Duel saw him ) Why the threat of Macmoon for the gun Durayaya recounts that he can wait, some opportunities later (ie, he can safely kill McMahon and return the rifle). <br /> <br /> The characters are exceptional. Vinters first looks like Drake's future bride, but she looks really big toward him - an unforgiving side. Drake knows about this disorder, which leads to its destruction. Other characters Flippen has a real collision, an Indian attack that is an army of steward and steward's friend Millard Mitchell. Oh, and Flippen's fellow soldier - Tony Curtis. Flippen believes that this soldier was probably in front of a hundred wars of war since 1861. Steward showed emotions in other films. He has shown a degree of anger at times in a marvelous life, and he is close to a nervous breakdown when he thinks everything is wrong in his life. But here he showed a ghost anger - at the expense of a surprising Duryea (usually similar anger shows herself). <br /> <br /> The episodes of the film are very well put together in the hands of the perfect hands of Man. If viewers notice Winchester Rifle's travels, this is not one of the Western countries.
