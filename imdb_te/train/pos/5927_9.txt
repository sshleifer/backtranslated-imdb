Stephen King movies is a funny thing for me. I really love them or I hate them. Fanseer productions (such as the sempery and the centurary like storm) I did not enjoy some. Some of the smaller ones, I really loved. I'm really enjoying sleepwalkers. It looks steadily. <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They change the sleepwalkers, the shape of the transformation, the human being into the creature as the creature. When they are immune to kittens scratches and when they move to a new town, lay the traps to capture and kill animals. When they go into their latest town, they must find a virgin and when Charles finds, he really falls for her, but her mother must feed her to retain her strength. The story tells what happens with that girl. Charles leaves her or uses her to save her mother. <br /> <br /> Although some of this story is obscure, it actually plays a role in the story and hence the scam in the film. Like most Stephen King stories, it is in a small town with very interesting characters. This acting is not the best or special effects, somehow, the whole thing is 'gel' and is very much eye-catching and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> For UK readers: Most recently shown in BBC1, Science Fiction and Sky Thriller / Horror Channels.
