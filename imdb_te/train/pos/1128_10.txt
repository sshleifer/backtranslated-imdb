Although Homer's epic "Brady" with Brad Pitt is a recent entertainer for "Troy", it is a breathtaking "Iphigenia" with bright Irene Papas. Ending in the natural setting of their natural language with Greek actors gives such authenticity. A random encounter with this image with one of DirecTV's many movie channels kept me interested in my concentration problems. There is no glitter or "bling" in the film, a fairy tale known by the actors. Hence they are bored at a real family in chaos. <br /> If I'm really Homer, he would be proud to say this if he really exists. <br /> <br />
