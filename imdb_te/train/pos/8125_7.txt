Come Things Rarities is rare, an image about ideas. Many films have looked forward to the future, but there are some attempts to show us how the future comes. The first part of the film, when it comes to everything, is small but powerful. (Ironically, the filmmakers of the year of the release were laughed at reports that were attacking England - lamented at its height. Walsh's assessment soon evolved.) Following the end of the war, par model work was highly effective. Detailed titles are reminiscent of German expressionist graphic design. Art director is great William Cameron Menzies, and his prestigious Evett's ruins are in his best work. Margaret is the most seductive of Scott's wife. Everything in the 21st century is equally striking. Acting in the 21st century story is not compelling - this is a misfire attempt to counteract rationality in technology at this time with the 1970's disillusionment. Unfortunately, the model work that represented the crowded people, the rush to run high-speed routes and the 30th technology made it even better. This is especially fitting because the scenes of a huge airplane are very convincing. It was taken by Raymond Massey's fantastic speech, the film is over - the best of scientific advancement is rarely expressed very well. Massi's final question is much more relevant than before, in the deepest man's space travel. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this film are completely terrible, with serious technical problems. Many reforms have been modified to an interesting montage of future workers and machines carrying us from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD of the entire DVD.
