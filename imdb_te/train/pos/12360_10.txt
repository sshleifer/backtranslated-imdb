I loved this movie. It analyzes Italian worst bourgeois society to see how the 70s of left-wing left their ideals and happy arrangements. For example, an elderly psychologist is jealous of his own son and wants to be remembered for his more intense youth. <br /> <br /> When we saw the film, we wanted to buy a video. Two times on the big screen and on the TV, but it seems completely disappeared from the market, even in none of the bookstores in Italy no one knows about the film. <br /> <br /> A romantic scene that everyone loves is not harming the film.
