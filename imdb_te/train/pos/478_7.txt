I'm surprised that no serious critic of the basic chess in the white end of the laser hoon game against the unnamed opponent before the final is so far. Although Jonathan Spielman used the consultant chess specialist, Luzzine won the game with illegal action. After the completion of the queen's queen of logic, it is not difficult to find out that his mouse in D1 is still pinned by the black mouse at C1 against his king in the corner at H1. So he could not play RD1-D8 with a sexual intercourse that he considered unlawful - but he received a deep appreciation from the audience.
