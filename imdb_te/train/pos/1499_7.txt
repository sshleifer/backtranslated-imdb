For fans of the 1970s hammer horror horror movies, the film should be a treat. The only thing I do not like on this film is the fact that Peter Cushing was ruined in the worst part. Generally, though, this is a solid, horror little picture. If this is not the best film of Amicus, it is definitely one of them. Ultimately the best-saving episode, one of which starred John Pertvay as horror film actor - is really amazing. As good as Pertvi in ​​this role, I believe he did not do much in these films. All in all, this is a fun movie, it's a scare heck of me as a child, and it still gives me creeps today.
