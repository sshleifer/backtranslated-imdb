CITY HALL is somewhat mixed bag. Part of the NYC political life is part of the vignettes, and the Part Morarizing Tale. Al Pacino, the Ducukes-esque boss with Presidential Dreams, often gives a successful or suppressed performance. He has a couple of times chewing the scenery, and in the case of CITY HALL, this is where he shines. John Cusack gives a suppressed and generally flawless performance without going into satire of a new Orleans dialect or slipping into the climax of the films. Danny is also a good politician with a Burrough Politician. <br /> <br /> The main problem with CITY HALL, and it's a good idea in many ways, the general feeling of momentum. It comes more like a documentary than a movie. We see the action or follow the perspective of separating the story and naturally, the viewer is not participating. <br /> When the director does not participate on a certain level, they are apathetic to the characters and finally, the plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a "off ham ... how ... okay." They say you can not "fight with City Hall". However, if the screenplay and scratches of the film are strong enough, it can not be stopped without thinking what it is.
