I do not typically like remakes that believe that the remakes will waste time; This film is exempt. I do not know until now that this is a remake of the previous comment, so my opinion is about the original film and not the match. <br /> The story and the way it is written is the question: It is Capote. No more words required. <br /> <br /> The play of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is awesome. I saw some movies with them, one or the other. I'm sure they are good actors and I always wondered if Eric is his sister's number 1 leading actor and why her brother is not. This assertion is, in fact, no question. <br /> <br /> The play of Mr. Edwards, as well as all the sectors of his career, is clear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />]
