This is a true story of an Australian couple in murder case when their baby dies. Meryl Streep is as good as ever, and she maintains our interest in playing a role that is not particularly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> In Australia, the murder case in Ohio during the Sam Shepard 50s is the case. Real-life situations can actually affect how the media operates a criminal case. Cleveland Plein Dealer "Why am I in Sam Sheppard in prison?" I would like to remember a big title with the title. The prosecutor eventually suffered this brutal pressure, and Shepard was tried and convicted. <br /> <br /> I would make a true story of films, in an interesting way, and make an important point in this process. This is one of these movies. There are other good films that tell the story of innocent people who are guilty of "hurricane", "The Sun Blue Line" and "Breaker Morant". Especially, the second is the Australian film. It is highly recommended. <br /> <br />
