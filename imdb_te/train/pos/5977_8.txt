Teenager Eddie spends his life and insults his invasion with heavy metal music. One day he finds that his hero Sammy Kurre is dead and has been shot by the foundation of his museum. But Eddie has never released his final record, and he receives messages that he will tell him how he can deal with his harassment while playing it. A few days before Summit's revelations, he hopes to get a real revenge on the town in order to bring back his life back to the local Halloween party. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of humor and jokes. Sammy himself plays the original horror film villain, 'on' the 'evil' of '80's' rock music'. Well worth looking at.
