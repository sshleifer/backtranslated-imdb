This is one of those that has a great feel to the film. It clays, grounded and makes you think ... and smile. Paul Richer and Peter Faulk take you on a journey that you can not forget. The soundtrack is pretty diverse and suited; And the film itself is like the breath of fresh air. This must be recognized for both film and actors! Finally, there are artworks going from a clear love story and special effects that are visible today. Without such deep feelings and thoughts in my heart, I never went from a movie. If someone wrapped it in a fluffy wool blanket it felt for it. To see this movie is to find a real treasure and happiness.
