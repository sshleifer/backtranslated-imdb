The film had an interesting cast, which did not feature in the Matteo list, but actors who acted in the movie have done a good job. In this movie we have B grade films, story actors are the primary and the way they run it, you do not need a million dollar budget and a basic plot to produce a bribe to a general audience. I love the way they go to the street and nobody is there and I'm curious, where they have just closed a cafe and done all this from a police station. Arnold Vosloo and Michael Madsen have done a great deal of role in playing the role of a hostage. It's a great movie and I like more in the near future.
