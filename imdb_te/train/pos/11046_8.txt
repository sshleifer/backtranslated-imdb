Malaysian is a very interesting picture. It is an unholy mixture of achievements and failures. The central concept is so great that three prisoners with extravagant personalities meet with a fourth (they identify the audience) and try to escape their cell using a magic book that appears inside the walls of the cell. <br /> I am reminded of when I read about Edmund Dantes's prison stay in Chawau D'OM (before Mont Cristo Count). The director intended the concept of contact with particles, especially with the purpose of identifying us (Carrier - a criminal who is not criminal, but it can be fraudulent).
