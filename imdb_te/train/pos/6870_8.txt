From start to finish, I laughed a real hard across the whole movie. It's "The Grove Tube" is probably the Grand Daddy of all the comedy films, and Ramquishias. I have not enjoyed watching tv without touching the channels to experience insomnia alone! 73 minutes, unnatural, strange humor halts! Imagine how all this nonsense that is smiling can make your life easier! It's way better than the comedy central or any major timing performance! Forgive yourself and trash soft, lustrous romantic comedy into the waste land! Better yet, let your box office manager tell you on the big screen "The Grove Tube"!
