"Written on the Wind" is a highly successful universal pic. It is only Douglas Sirk, a man who has seen the possibilities in the material he has given. Based on the famous novel by Robert Wilder and written by George Zuckerman, it has all the elements that make a fantastic drama: Nomophomania, a large oil wealth, alcohol, promise and a light touch of homosexuality. <br /> <br /> The only way to mention two "Dallas" and "Dynasty" is the way Cirk follows a follow-up in the soap opera genre. A studio. The decor is very cunning. Like most of the 1950s, "Written on the Wind" was completely shot in the studio. Let's just look at the scenes in Manhattan or Miami, or the lake can also be seen in the background of the scenery. <br /> <br /> We were recently screening a part of the restoration of Mr. Circus, where people were laughing. Some of the most dramatic moments, especially Rock Hudson, appear to be the best Mitch Way play scenes. Robert Keith, who played the patriarchal Jasper Hadley, and his daughter, the evil Marley, was both a Derick, a fairy tale draft art. <br /> The Douglas Sirc probably wanted to give his performances on top of his cast, Dorothy Malone played the role of Namma Memole, and Kyle, an experienced descendant of the story. It will probably be an easy description of what comes off the screen. One commonly seen person is Lauren Buckal, who has not been asked to appear in the character Loire Moore but is a man who has been hanged with a wrong group. <br /> <br /> Along with his other Hollywood films, "On the Wind on the Wind" showed the genius of a publicly-talented director, what they wanted to see: bigger than the only ones seen on the big screen
