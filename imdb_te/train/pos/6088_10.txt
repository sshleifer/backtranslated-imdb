The script is more fitted for a 30 minute sitcom? Yes, but they still work! I did an amazing work with actors a bland script, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Many people on the board really hate this movie. I can not see how personally I am, but the jealousy is the only one that you like or hate. Like Napoleon Dynamite and every Leslie Nielsen movie never did. You do not think you are one of the worst films you have made or are funniest. Do not avoid this image due to reviews. Watch this and see if you're one of those people you really like! If you do, I assure you that your money is valuable. If you do not like it ... well, you know now.
