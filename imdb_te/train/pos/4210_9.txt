I really enjoyed this movie. All aspects of the film are top notch, including the most demanding, anyway, screenplay and acting. This is definitely one of Richard Widmark's strongest roles. He was completely convinced of his performance. With curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchchau resolved this role. This was my first exposure of Jean Peter's catch-up. She is very impressed here, and I'll be on the site for her other work. Thesma Ritter, an unglamourous character, deserves an Oscar nomination to receive information on her. This film works at every level. Black and white photography is perfectly fitting and the story hooks the viewer from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have their difficult erotic great chemistry. Strongly recommended, 9/10.
