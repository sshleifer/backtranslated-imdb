Mina Kumari displays sitting on the floor more than you can find in other movies, moving away from standing in style and grace. The director has produced more memorable scenes of beauty touching than it may seem possible. Music and dance are of the highest quality. In the first dance scene of all kinds of things happening in the background you may have noticed: other girls dance, drunk down stairs, many activities, but we are looking at Mina Dancing and I have seen these many times except I have noticed you all.
