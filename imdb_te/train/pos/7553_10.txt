When I saw this film a few days ago, my eyes were completely on the screen. Its greatness to my attention I caught my attention to my attention for overall attention. I would recommend not only to the fans of Anime, but to anyone who likes a great period of great movies (or who really loves stuff). The style of art is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbolism inside it is breathtaking. I have heard complaints about the weird insertion of the English text in the film, but I feel like I'm finished with its strange style. The self-attributed description of "Hello Kitty on acid" does not absolutely do justice to this epic ratios. If you do all of these, I would like to find more of the works and see them.
