Director Douglas Circk did not star again with the film. This lush, a masterpiece of the worst saga, beautifully combining all of the elements of the circle's sochers and strategically putting all of them a picture. "Written on the Wind" has influenced the 1980s TV series "Dallas" and "Dynasty", a fundamental feature of a lateral-length version of the next night's soaps. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bachel is great and deftly, Lucy Moore, is married to New York City Secretary Oil Baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stock). Unbeknownst to them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is quietly in love, but sexy secretary. We meet with a sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in Oscar Winner Turn), where she will go back to Kyle's family building in Texas. Yipee! Sparks are to fly - from love stories to catfights, which is a campy trip. Mitch has to fight with the feelings of his best friend's wife, but Marilie tries to sleep with everyone because Michelle has no real love. <br /> <br /> This removes all, Kyle finds that he is not a nephew, but Lucy is pregnant. <br /> <br /> It is pure soap and pure dramatic entertainment. How do you love The film is one of Universal's most popular films and is one of the best works by director Sirk. Some of the dialogue is absolutely overwhelming and Visual forms are thrown out in every way - the wind is so great. Despite Hudson's outstanding billing, Basal was completely abusive, and the cast was great. Stock Oscar loss destroyed him. He thought this was his best performance and was clearly pleased that no one would lose too much. And he turns out to be a wonderful show like whimpering alcoholism. What a wonderful picture! This film will prove what I think for ages - a master of the Circl classical play. <br /> Where is his Oscar? <br /> <br />
