Ghost Train is a treat for those who appreciate the 1940s humor. It has included both World War I in the saga but not until I am in the beginning, and the characters are the only blend of their roles. Asky plays the role of Tommy Gander, which illuminates the story to the boring or "pulling" sequence. <br /> <br /> The story of the haunted station is actually scary today's standards. Ghost Train is amazing that it's the mystery of which is so unique and that each of the characters can communicate. The gander is basically a nuisance for all other members, the rest are well integrated. He is always a center of attention and can be called "annoying" but by those who do not appreciate the 1940s comedy. His humor makes it so naive and sweet to see the kid. <br /> If it is not for Oscie / Gander, the film is in action, less enjoyable and the result is my opinion.
