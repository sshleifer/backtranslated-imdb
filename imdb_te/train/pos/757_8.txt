I must be honest. I have seen and enjoyed these programs because it is gross, offensive, delightful and indecent. Yes, all the flavors have a lot of humor. <br /> <br /> If you belong to the type of humor you think is pleasing to people who fall from skateboards, then you have a great time for it. <br /> <br /> Or, bad, you also have a great time. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the three types of comics that you offer "Dirty SunCase". I'd have a hard laugh with the conditions of the show. "Jacques" is a walk in the park compared to this poll. If Jackass's distinctive American folly is tired, it will try to make English a stupid one. <br /> It is a show where there is less taste or class. <br /> Now, these guys need to see a psychologist. Particularly the role of Pako.
