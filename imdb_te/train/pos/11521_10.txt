Excellent ride from start to finish magicians, thanks to the big part of the magic created by the stars. Alan Arkin was one of his finest roles in decades. As with any really good image, it's a journey in which the theme releases results of the redemption and dreams. I can not believe this movie is very difficult - I bought it in the heart of the DVD but found a shop.
