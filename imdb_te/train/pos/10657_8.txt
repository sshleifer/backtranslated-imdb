Studios has a sense of a stock image for Jeopardy, one of the big budget / box office inspired films. It does not have just 70 minutes and several sets, and the only star Barbara Stanwick. But a star, of course. <br /> <br /> In the Mexican desert, her husband was stuck in a desperate woman who was once again trying to help her escape. Most of the film focuses on how she deals with her cousin, who wants to submit to her instead of his help. There are some psychological struggles. <br /> <br /> It's a surprisingly effective little movie - tastes its tiny length, and Stanwick is not mentioned greatly (but I respect her every time).
