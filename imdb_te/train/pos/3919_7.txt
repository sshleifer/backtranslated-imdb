When Bizet's Carmen rebuilds, middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gaddes) brings the sexy carmen (Laura del Sol) to play a major role. Antonio falls in love for Carmen, unable to accept the love that he loves an independent and seductive woman. When Carmen relates to another dancer, Antonio gets acquainted with his jealousy in his original jealous opera, and in fact falls in fiction. <br /> <br /> "Carmen" is another great flamenco dance of Carlos Solar's trilogy. The dramatic love story develops by the lives of artists with characters they are practicing, and it is not clear what actually happens (with dancers) or fiction (drama). Another attraction of the original version of the famous Bizet's opera is Paco de Lucia, which is based on the novel of Prosperm Marie. My vote is seven. <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
