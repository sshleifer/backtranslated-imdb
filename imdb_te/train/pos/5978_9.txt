This is a real "80s film": they have made more than 100 films now than now, and makes them very interesting ... it is a cultural phenomenon that is no longer present. Nowadays, similar people have been able to make cheap "straight-video" - eighty films are cheap and romantic. Seems to sell romantic. Anyway, this is more than medium-trash-movie level: it has a nice & attractive story and I feel very well. In a scene you can also see the microphone swinging on the top edge of the image. Although Ozzy and Jean Simmons have a bit of camouflage, they do not contribute much to "victory", although they are better in their smallest roles. Monster, the massive-singer "Sammy Carr", he really sings, especially scary. One of the horrific monsters seen in horror films. I might have nightmares of him. Intellectual film is not recommended for lovers.
