Now this show has seen most of the other shows from the mid-90s, but this is different because they have used a lot of comedy and action and maybe a little more of a play. I personally thought it was a good show, and I can not understand why they can cancel. <br /> <br /> The fan base of the show is still alive until 1997. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you can not find the DVD of 13 episodes I would recommend the characters great, story lines are good, the comedy is good and the whole presentation is just great.
