This film killed me as one of the most successful trials of acceptable answers to some nagging questions that cut in recent scholarship about "passion" (Christ's suffering and death). (What does Pilot have to breathe?) It's serious about the movie: "Passion of Christ" is a disappointment of the ghory scenes and the depth of the narrative. For me, I portrayed the image - with the general consent of the people, to sacrifice their own self-interest in a very simple manner - is very realistic and deeply incontrovertible. ("I'm doing my job" on the face of Christ's wrist on the face of Christ is undoubtedly, the film is cool at any time) The movie "authenticity" has no suit, but the settings and clothing are more "correct" than the more acclaimed efforts. It's a slow picture, but if you accept one of its self-imposed limitations (which, after all, "Death" - Life - "Christ"), is finally the most rewarding one.
