I loved this show and I'm still seeing the first season DVD at the age of 19. What can i say I grew up completely. I have my father, two sisters and dogs. The only difference is that I did not live with my uncle and my father's best friend. Also, I grew up with my mother at home. I do not know what I did without a full house on television. I'm Stephanie (played by Jody Sweeney), D.J. (Kirk Cameron's sister Condes), and Michelle (starring Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I'm a middle child of my family like Stefey, I am a younger sister like Michelle, and I have a big sister like D.J because I have a relationship with each of them. I really like how this show always has moral values, because today is not really like the OC-like events. I like the full house comedy, too. Uncle Jessie (John Stomos), Joe (Dave Cowley), and Danny (Bob Saget) are happy to be the father of the girl's uncle, father of the father, and father. After the story of the parent's mother dies, Danny's best friend Joe and his brother-in-law, Jesse go to the children to help raise children. Three men are trying to grow up to three young girls = happy. Every character in the full house is heart, funny, and virtually believable. Joey is a comedian with a boy's heart and soul. Jessie is cool, riding a motorcycle, his three niece, and then his wife Mckie (softly-gaisse uncle) who is softly mocked by his wife Mckie (Larry Laughlin from Summell). Both children and adults love this show. Guaranteed.
