Perfect movies are very rare. Even my favorite movies are flaws - the little behind the Groundhog Day Chris Elliott's role in the rear window, the music score in the best years of our Lives is very cheesy, the beginning of the Knights of Cabria is slightly slow - but this film is definitely running from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The script is good, the performance is fantastic (Reese Witherspoon and Sam Watersston are excellent, the whole cast shines), directed and photography inspiration, and without music score (like the Miramax scores are most fraudulent). Every tragic moment really moves, every light moment makes me smile. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen and more movies about it. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Reese Witherspoon went to fame after this movie, but I'm sorry to see that recent films are more dangerous than this serious movie and are silly, real feelings and real issues. Brilliant! Must see.
