It's small and point. Storytelling used for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is amazingly awesome. Acting is throughout, but over the years the main characters have worked to improve their skills. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to believe that this series is about 7 years old and ends in mid-May. <br /> <br /> I can not reconstruct what sets forth about sets and graphics. <br /> If it is ranked as a professional product, I should give a 5 for a good story but a terrible set. However, as a fan-based product I should give a stunning rating with some exceptions, which is in its league. For the perfect volume, I do not think it's matched. Congratulations to the cast and crew for a great deal of devotion.
