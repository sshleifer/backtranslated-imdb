When this came first, my dad brought home - we were surprised - it was different from anything we had seen before. I'm looking for a specific movie last night, and I found 'Minds Eye' again. The box is different, and I'm surprised that the tape is still working! This is good, even though 'Finding Nemo' is not quality graphics. They need to sell again - this is a milestone for computer animation films. Highly recommended!
