I liked this movie. I'm a Mexican and I'm offended by it. In fact, I would like to show this film in Mexico headquarters throughout Mexico. It is a sad truth that our police system is rotten like a 3 months old corpse. I read news about how killers, kidnappers and other muds could be how to get rid of fraudulent penalties or live like a king inside prison cells. We need to have Cressy, Denzel Washington character. A bodyguard turned into a retaliatory vigilante. The kidnapping industry is developing here (at least in big cities). I really want to know that kidnappings in real life can only enjoy the same task. It's pretty awesome (sorry, I'm that angry!). Man in Fire is a gripping movie that you can not miss. If not used when reading the subtitles (Mexicans do it while watching some American movies), the effort is valuable. Some editing is a bit cumbersome ... kind of like a trafing, remember? (Another clever decision on how Mexico is corrupt). The film starts a bit slowly, but the pace has moved frantically through the second half. I swear you'll be encouraging you to see Denzel Washington's wrong doers dispatch. His performance is not spectacular. The end (no spoilers, ok !!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. Fire is one of the best movies of the year. "Must own" for a DVD collection! From 9 * 10
