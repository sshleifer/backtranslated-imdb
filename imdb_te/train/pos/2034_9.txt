I've never been in heavily in IMAX movies. They're cool, but once you get that start-up "okay, that's flying!" The movies themselves are generally pretty and simple. <br /> <br /> Exceptions are powerful "Everest", the happiest "Wild California" and now the BBC's "The Human Body", the super-sized look of the interior of our bodies. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are the machines of a complexity that is simply unimaginable. This 50 minute movie may be 10 hours long, and I can not find all the systems that work in the Tandem, just by typing this review, listening to my radio and taking all of the things we have for granted. Here are some of the less attractive functions (pimples, stomach) that you feel shy away from, such as a pumping heart (like alien spacecraft), inside your lungs, your hair short hair, abortion, and a surprise ... <br /> <br /> The film also has a funky style that keeps separate from other IMAX documentaries. For example, we found the sperm that brought the blind, but did you ever see the tune of Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On"? It's the "human body" that's just a health lesson, but creative movements that are not fun.
