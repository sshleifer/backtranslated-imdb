There is nothing reluctant to really "The Odd Couple" and Jack Lemmon and Walter Mutau surprised the most humorous comedies. But Neil Simon is something undeveloped about playing a joke in a sketch comedy show than a full-body body of his hit stage. I did not see the play, but the screen version was very confident, as Simon wrote, errors can not get on the screen to the screen. There are some interesting ideas in the story - both recently when the divorced men become traditional roommates and they become roommates, because no one knows anything - Simon has not come out completely. Still, there are many worse ways to kill a few hours.
