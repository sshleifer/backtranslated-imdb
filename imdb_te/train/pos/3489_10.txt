I love this movie. This is one of my favorite films. Do not stop the action. The whole movie is well done. The end is good. The action is over, they are a surprise for you. When I saw the internet about the movie I wanted to see this film, but I decided to give it a chance if I wanted to be such a big Luca Perry fan. I am so glad that I gave a chance because this is a very good movie. It's very original. Whoever stands up to me from this film. Acting was great. Luca Perry has once again done a wonderful job. I will give you the highest rating of the film.
