Presbyter and Powell's great image. David Niven portrayed the RAF bombard pilot, who lost his own death, but when he saw AWOL as a haven and sent an angel to investigate a second chance in life. The scene when young soldiers, men and women, black and white, all murder in action, sharp enough to get closer to heaven in order to process for everlasting life. Roger Livessy, a deeply acclaimed actor, and Kim Hunter's fond of love (later, Jira in Plas of the Apes). Incidentally, Steven Spielberg acted in the role of the main goddess (Kathleen Byron) as an elderly widow of private, known for saving Private Ryan after half a century, a film that speaks volumes for literacy.
