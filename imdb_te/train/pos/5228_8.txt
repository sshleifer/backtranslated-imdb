I found this movie hilarious. Spoofs on some of the other popular films of the time are some of the jokes I've seen in this film. Give it a try. <br /> <br /> I (and others watching me with the film) felt the humorous part of the film. (This does not mean what actually happened because it is not a spoiler) is a scene from MIB "elegant thing". If they first find the device and do not know what it will do ... then again in the movie ... when you come there you will understand. <br /> <br /> The only complaint about the movie is that I bought a copy because I can not find on the DVD.
