It is a little bit less by the critics and Kurosawa fans, but I think it's amazing. It is an episodic multi-role study involving Tokyo's poor living in a city that is literally trash. Although it is just an A-bomb, the film has a clear beauty of the technological use of the technician. The title comes from the sound of a frenetic young man running an imaginary trolley through the slum. All the characters are amazing and all the stories incorporate, but perhaps the most tragic worry man and his youngest son who lives in an abandoned car. When they are not searching for food, they spend their free time using their imagination to build their dream home. An emotionally moving and beautiful picture.
