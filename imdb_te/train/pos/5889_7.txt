Exactly, I have never seen "Roda" and have to admit that I did not see one or two episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show". <br /> <br /> Although I do not know anyone about this joked talent, this film is very much liked. <br /> Marie goes back to work. Rose tries her luck as a comedian. Rodo struggles with a photography career. And Meredith ... what exactly does she do again? These three stories we follow two hours are fun and fun. When two longtime friends come back, it will make the movie better. <br /> <br /> "The little jokes thrown by Mary and Rodas are funny. <br /> <br /> Other, such as Moore and Harper for the past few years I do not know that they worked very well with the band, while both actresses seemed to let me down when they were doing their part to finish the title. (During the film) Joey Lanez and <br /> <br /> Jonah, Cecilee and other cast members are still working together. <br /> It's a reunion, and I'm from non-fan The film is good enough for each character and two main characters (the new version of the MTM theme song does not hurt).
