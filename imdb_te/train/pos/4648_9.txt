Hilarious, sentimental, confusing, intelligent movie. Reminds me of the sacred mountain of the Bunuel's El 'Age d'Or or the attraction of the Elegana - what is it about to learn about the strange characters? I laughed almost the entire way while keeping a peripheral eye on the confusion of the audience surrounding me in the theater and occasionally frightened reactions. From the beginning to the pits and finally the funeral will eventually enter into the end. I'll remember every detail. <br /> Honestly, however, I have only the most positive memories of this film. I did not seem to be available for home and watch, and I wanted to wait for a few years until Krispin Glover watched his big slide show (and next with "What is?" Screening) ... I saw this picture directly in Atlanta, causing a devastating car accident, So I was a little surprised at the moment, which is probably prophetic Vakyamu retarded superhero costumes and God the praise and the appropriate barli Q setting Glover, got up from the ground with an excellent DADA kalala children's wet. <br /> <br /> Life is it to it? In fact everyone has an EXPECTS art. I hear the truth and it becomes more clear in the negative space. We have to say what we have not said, but others are more valid than the lies that we are outing day and day. Instead "what is it?" <br /> <br /> Thanks, Mr. Glover (plus a fun man on the screen or on his big slideshow show - smart, funny, quirky, and outrageously hot). Make more movies, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.
