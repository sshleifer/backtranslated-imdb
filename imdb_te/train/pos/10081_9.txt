It's a beautiful, rich and well-executed movie with a rich and meaningful story. Basically, an old master storyteller wants to know how to take his (human) heir to his skill, but in his male-dominated world he did not get any idea. The characters should deal with their situation and the old owner should be grappled with a colleague and heir and the controversy between his and society's traditional concepts. <br /> <br /> This story is fun, emotional and complicated. The character development is strong even when the characters, their lives, and emotions are searching, the characters are complex and not even a dimensional. The film will teach the old man's emotions and his desire to find an heir, and shows how he and the kid's situation are resolved. Humor is also sometimes very subtle at the appropriate points. The film examines the good and evil of traditional Chinese culture, creating more interest and imagery. <br /> Directing, acting, and scenery are all the best. Other strengths are added, convincing these great and visual imagery and integral, true characters. As a result, the film evokes strong emotions and feelings about the characters. <br /> <br /> Some allege that the cinematic end is weak, but I do not necessarily agree. Perhaps this might have been strong with a different ending, but no improvement in the overall picture was very low.
