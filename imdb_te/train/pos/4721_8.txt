Sad story of the depleted B-17 pilot. Brady was shot dead on an occupied territory. Local veterinarians expanded his compassion and protection with the cost of his own lives. I never heard of this film and made me cry for two hours. After the end of the film, I'm glad I took the time. It tells the whole story to explain Brady's face at the beginning of the film.
