I read over 100 in Nancy Drew books, and if you're not too bright to catch up yet, Nancy is a young man in the film Nancy Drew, not 18 years old, about books. It was when she was sixteen. So obviously, she is not as smart as one of the books that only consider 10th grade. Besides, I think the movie is very beautiful. It's clean and fit for everyone. It's funny at times. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She is clear in her character, and beautiful. Nancy and Nude liked the frustrating around each other because they were not ages enough to be in a serious relationship, as they are in the books. I enjoy movies without sex, drugs, or obscenity, unlike most of my age, because it is a beautiful, PG movie that I enjoyed by.
