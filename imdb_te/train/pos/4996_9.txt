I saw tons of HK activists, and at the top right of this genre. Action scenes are exciting and dynamic as you never seen in any action movie. Kung Fu is amazing, fireworks eye-popping, stunt work heart card. With the full speed of the album, it increases tension and compliment the fluid camera work. The film is directed by the older Pro Corey Yuen, whose reboot is the jet le vehicle with the best work of the genre including The Legend of Fang Sai-Wacho. Although the film does not have a thing, it has the presence of a three-dimensional character, although Martin, male leader, comes closer. Sexy killer, goofy thief and his fist friend, cocking villains - this film is full of archeoppes rather than characters. Shannon Lee has a wonderful screen presence; She is great with fighting, fighting and firearms. She's hard to remove your eyes when she's on the screen. She's fine. Why is this woman not a major actor?
