<br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie on TV was in 1981, and I forgot to record it. My mother is Betamax. <br /> <br /> "Pan on the scene of the Camera Liverpool, I remember the opening scene where I opened Paul Gestures to some scenes," see, Talent! "So it" reminisced "that she started with a new movie" She Loves You "instead of" My Bonnie "in my 1998 tape version and how slow you are watching Camera Pance Worces When you see the speed, you can expect "she likes you." Also, Paul sees girls in this "next" version, he says, "Look, Girls!" And something that the earlier version is remembered, that word just does not seem to fit either Why do they want to make this film an American audience for American audiences? Personally, I'll be watching a British band <br /> <br /> How would you like to use a "choppy" editing for television, for instance, if the film is a commercial break- let's say ' M. Yes, I know I'm dependent on the network, but it really does have an image of the whole of it sliced ​​and destroys us as we know it. <br /> <br /> "The version of the film is probably the earliest version I have recorded since 1981, which is not in my 1998 version of" Shake, Rattle & Roll " "There are two different versions for television, and I guess the" Alternative Versions "link is appropriate for the film, while the American version includes some minor / cut / different scenes and / or Imo is something worth mentioning if it cares about a big disappointment and a thing.Imo try to bet the best of them, if possible, grab the European version of this film, and (perhaps even less likely), an unedited version. <br /> < br> I disregard my old Betamax European version because I do not know how to change it. <br /> <br /> On this side, I was well aware that art and creative licenses are often used in movies and TVs when filming events in history, and I do not allow any difference to my feelings of the film. Sure, I'm surprised that you will make songs at Beatles Cavern, "I did not even write that way?" I wondered, though, that I was a great movie and the performances were fantastic <br /> <br /> Actually, I'm a Stand-Out for me, John, who plays the role of Stephen McKenna. I fell in love with him. His appearance, habit, personality and voice voice was spot on. When Beatles first saw EV Sullivan performing, I looked like a young John to make a double-take at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> If I look for the definitive history of the Beatles' life and beginnings, I have questioned the actual beetle footage. You can not be better than "The Beatles Anthology" because it is "written" by boys. However, if you are looking for a pleasant snapshot of their previous Beatleysian days leading to their arrival in America, you can not make a mistake with the "Birth of The Beatles" if you leave your anal critical assessments at the door - for any "real" or casual beetle fan.
