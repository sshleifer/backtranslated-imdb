The show ended my first child year, and after every Christmas I played a record album for boys. When the CD came, I bought ten copies and gave them to friends and relatives when they started families ... it turns out to be their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVDs (from video tapes made on DVD-R, perhaps in eBay). It's a fantastic copy I bought, and it's great to see the show again more than 25 years. There are a few songs that are not included in the album, and some songs on the album are studio versions of the same songs on the show. But both CD and DVD are the best Christmas games in our library.
