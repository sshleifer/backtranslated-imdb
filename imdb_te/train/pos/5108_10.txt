This is my favorite movie all the time. A pizza and bottle wine was used on my Friday night film when I was alone. This film was first seen with my aunt Brenda and sister chassis. I'm in 2nd grade. I fell in love with Travolta, my new best friend. I've read a lot of comments about how Sissy is "to learn to act" on how to leave Bud Sissy. But let's go back and see the second: Spoiler - my commentary on the film now, when I was eight years old about Bud & Cissy's relationship, because Gilley's riding bull. They will get a huge fight. Bud attempts to envy Cass by asking Pam to dance. Sissy then makes two mistakes right and Wes thinks she asks if "she needs no help". When Bud asks Palm, "Do you take me home and rape me?" Palm answers: "When are you ready to cowboy". Bud then goes home with his condo palm in downtown Houston. Daddy bought her with her oil money and "represents everything". One of the cheats on the Sissy who is the Buddy. When he returned home the next day he waited for Bud. Sissy is the one who left the bud. Then, he was a real "cowboy" and buddy to prove Sissy to win her back. <br /> <br /> That's my comment. I'm sure everyone is! <br /> I love this film. <br /> When it comes to believing or not, I got a real cowboy! I love him too! :)
