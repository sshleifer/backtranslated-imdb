Rade is a young Frenchman of Moroccan ancestor. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in attitudes and values. In the shade, his father declared that his father was going to be driving to Mecca for his Huj (Pilgrimage) - that Rida was willing to accept only from responsibility but not interested. Consequently, at first, Redda was angry, but being a traditional Muslim man, his father was very difficult to talk or discuss his mistakes. Both the father and the son appear very strong and tough - it is quite contrary when Dad says he should not be adamant to his son. <br /> When I read the summary, grew up and began to know each other. However, I really do not think they are and that is the lovely and sad aspect of the film. Sure, there are times of understanding, but often there is an undercurrent of enmity and oppression. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is well-acting and fascinating - giving Westerners an extraordinary understanding of Islam and Hajj. It offers a lovely scene of traditional Islam and the secular young generation. There may be some annoyance about slow pace and relationship across the film, I think the film gave a serious reality and think people look like a movie about - not some formula. A nice and unusual image.
