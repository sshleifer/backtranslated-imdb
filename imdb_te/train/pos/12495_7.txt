What's good about it: some creepy and terrific fan genuine creepy little effects that get under the skin. Hawking Soundtrack is not based on Stubbs for its "Getcha" movements. Even if you see everything, there is still a few things that can drop your jaw in the picture. <br /> <br /> It may be well known: acting is sometimes flat and unbelievable. It has a "shot-on-video" quality in some places (though, it's mostly climbed), and camera work is incomplete-vertical of nonsense actions. Although the effects are honestly creepy, I think some of them have gone a little more times. Ends, and ultimately the most influential moments have come to light. <br /> <br /> Unlike challenging film directors, they have left a lot of things to find for themselves, but they are missing out. <br /> <br /> Still better, the smallest horror film, than the average. Well worth the rental.
