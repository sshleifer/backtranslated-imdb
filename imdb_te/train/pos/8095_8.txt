I'm fond of this film and it vexes me that most "reviewers" are ranked below Peter Jackson's trilogy. A painted novel always means; Specifically, the animated film depends on the artist's vision and judging its own words. As a Purist, this is the best tribute to the updated version of Tolkien. <br /> <br /> Tolkien's Frodo in Jackson's Reality is merely recognizable: he has been portrayed weakly from the first scene, constantly being thrown into the forces surrounding him and does not stand in his two feet (which is physically and transmitted). Did this limp biscuit pick up a ring on the cracks of Doom? Jackson rewrites an unforgettable Tolkien and Arvon plays Frodon's best moment to save him from his ringwritings ... Rescue of Rescue Respects the original. Bakry Frodo plays the role as Tolkien wears it. His burden increases as we see the growth of weight. Frodo is very quick to Lord Rings, and you wonder why Jackson is surprised by such freedoms (he has done so many roles) because the plot develops its inevitable end to character development. The image of Bacque is well analyzed by colleagues between Legolas and Gimmel, which is not entirely in Jackson's version in some awesome scenes. Similarly we're seeing horsing with boppomer pippin and merry, increasing the idea of ​​fellowship. An animated version is much more advanced than my own live performance. <br /> <br /> Tolkien's poetry is one of the most important novels in the novels and my favorite scenes in my favorite scenes: "Merry Old in" song while Frodo is singing, minutes before stumbling into the stridor. The cheery tune dark theme disappears after the seconds after the music, but Frodo is exposed to dangerous when appearing to the Writers. <br /> <br /> Film Budget / Time Limits limits the final effect of the film, but it is complete, it is more echoed by viewers. It's worth a look at it. Its critics also agreed that Peter Jackson was very inspired by this model.
