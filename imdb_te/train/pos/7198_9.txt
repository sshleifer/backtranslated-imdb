It was a good movie and I enjoyed watching many times. Always Michael Cain is awesome. Michael Cain has a reputation as to what role it plays in any film, but not the same quality or absence, but he made a good turn to play Sydney. Well written from the beginning. Who thought that Ira Levin, who wrote creepy works like The Boys from Brazil and Rosemary's Baby, would be witty. <br /> <br /> How are you going to make a mistake with Michael Cain, Chris Reeve, Diane Cannon, Henry Jones ... directed by Sidney Lewett? If no one is given the film, it is a crime. See this and worship it.
