Smart Script and thanks to a steady hand from Kevin Mayor of the author / director, "Perfect Alibi" is an entertaining and highly loved mystery thriller. The film starts gradually and it seems that there is no evidence, and the launch will begin. Tari Garr and Hector Elizondo are wonderful when the mystery comes to the team to remind me of Nick and Norah Charles from "Thin Man" films. Alex MacArthur's tormented wife and historic characters Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsay and Estelle Harris play the roles of Kateleen Quinlan and provide plenty of light moments at the right time. Rex Lin also has a kami. I read a good book, I thought everything.
