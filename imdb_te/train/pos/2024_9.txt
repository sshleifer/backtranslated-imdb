I loved this small series. Tara Fitzgerald performed an excellent job as Helen Graham, a young adolescent with his younger son, from the mysterious past. Love is a coherent fantasy that loves stories ... This film is just my tea cup and I would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours into England of 1800. I must also mention the reason for Toby Stephens to paint this magnetic Gilbert Mark is enough reason to watch this amazing product.
