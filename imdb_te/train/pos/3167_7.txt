It is one of these films that explores the culture of the people of the East who are born in Western cultures. <br /> <br /> It is a sad film about the inability of the opposition to attract cultural divergence over time in Tokyo. Ken, a rock n'roll buddy, kioto marries a Japanese girl so that she can stay in the United States when her visa expires. It is estimated that marriage is only temporarily, that is, until Kyoto reaches legal status. But, Ken, every relationship seems lost, Kyoto prefers a lot and tries to make things work harder. <br /> <br /> It's bad for rock n roll, except for some of the songs that have been written about the broken hearts, dumping Kyoto and removing all the commitments and broken hearts. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto did not expect a traditional Japanese upbringing, and Ken had long been getting married. Moreover, she wants to go back to Japan and go back to Japan. It is sad that anyone can finally see someone who feel that way about him except for a time, it is sad that anyone can think he loves and with and all that is, the girl does not expect to be that long. She does not like Ken, which is used for her entire life in the whole life. She says, "I can not say I feel in English, and Ken can not tell me what I think in Japanese." This is a sad love story, rather than a killer 80s techno-nintendo soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I love Tokyo time and I love Tokyo time. Tokio Pop (New York singer goes to Japan and joins the Japanese American cover band) for those in your Tokyo time, check it, except for a happy ending. <Br />
