But the title is a picture about a man who is hunting down his own brother with the title rifle is still handed over to the person along with the trail before it ends up in one of the director's beloved mountain shootouts than it'd expect from the studio system. Great dialogue, impressive assistant cast ?? Will Gear, Millard Mitchell, Stephen McNally, Shelley Winters, Charles Drake, Tim McIntyre, Jay C. Flippen, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson and Man's finest visual sense raise this with a bar.
