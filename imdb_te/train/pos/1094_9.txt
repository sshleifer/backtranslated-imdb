This is one of the few funny I can see again and again scream. In other places, I have read complaints about racism and sexism. <br /> <br /> Here, sexism and racism are a sexually transparent as a woman. <br /> <br /> These lines are delightful, and all the leads are never good. Melvin Douglas is particularly clever. <br /> If you ever think about or try to build a new house, how much you're disappointed with this process, the wolves you think, you're not alone!
