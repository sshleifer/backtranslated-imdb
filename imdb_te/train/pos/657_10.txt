La Maman at La Fatine is the time it was released (post-68) and is seen with a permanent picture in many respects. Actually, actors do not "work" ... true, they talk a lot ... But what they say is that the value of living will be worth living ... or die. The most famous and most moving text spoken by Fran√ßois LeBron is written about feminism, humanity and love. It's not easy to translate correctly. The film is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman (or two women in this case). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Leyad is one of the greatest French actors.
