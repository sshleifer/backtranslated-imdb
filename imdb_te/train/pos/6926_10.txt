This article confirms the classic image of Versus in the form of brother's brother's against brother. The main character, played by James Stewart, is Lin Macadam, representing justice and righteousness. His brother, a brother who worked with his brother, Stephen McNeill, played Dutchman Henry Brown, and his brother chased him for killing his father. This story takes place in the world classics Dystopia West The only way to prevent its inhabitants from killing each other is to take away their side armies as soon as they enter town, and man responsible for putting this law and order is the classic Western advocate Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> There are also a number of western flat characters, murdered Indian soldiers, invading cavalry and sadness-a girl in a Bonnet-dressed girl. <br /> <br /> Another important feature of the film is that it gives the name of the film, the Winchester Rifle custom. Weapons can be seen as an illustration for the prizes given to those who respect the dignity. Once stolen from its owner, it brings tragedy to everyone involved. In this sense it resembles the other graves, such as the Holy Grail of the Lost Ark of the Lost Ark, and a hard-fitting letter to the blood saved in private ryan. This gives the element of movie Surrealism, which is not usually from Western, it is unknown for exceptional themes and icons. <br /> <br /> It shares this element with many other examples of genre, such as a film that is surely a vengeful film, Jack Arnolds no not on the bullet and Clint Eastwood's Unforcevenen. <br /> <br /> There is also a theme related to rape in Winchester '73. Waco Joni Dean, the film villains played very efficiently by Don Durry, joins a woman after her husband's murder. The inconsistent cowboy dolls with the longest housewife sends him like a cat's satire with a cat before he can cut his cat. Waco Johnny Dean finally comes to him after contact with the Ominous Winchester Rifle. <br /> <br /> The main story of Wolcherster '73 remembers Jason's mythological story and his exploration of the golden wool, as stated in Apollonius Aragonate. Two stories deal with a sacred object. Like Jason, Stewart's character is searching for a one-kind gift from one adventure to another. Another theme in Winchester '73 is equivalent to an epic tale, a fight between brothers. There are many stories of the ancient period with the problem of the Hebrew Bible's Cain and Abel story and the Vallett's story of Romulus and Remus. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann is one of many mythological works, including the theme of kidnapping and rape in the movie, as opposed by Ovid in his Metamorphoses. <br /> Winchester '73 is a good example of Western style, and acts as a cooperative effort for many classic American Western and ancient mythological subjects.
