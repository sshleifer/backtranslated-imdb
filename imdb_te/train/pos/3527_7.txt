Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a secret woman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites her to see a show with him. Not even names - she agrees that they will not swap any information about someone. Sometimes these are the best dates. However, when he returns to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife was murdered. His Alibi mystery woman but no one can remember seeing her and, as a result, the Scot was sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ella Rhineus) does not confess his guilt and finds a woman who saves him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> It is a good film and director trying to come to 100% Kansas. We follow her through some memorable scenes, e.g. Mac Bardder (Andrew Tombes) Night and the Clof Drummer (Elisha Cook Jr) is the claustrophobic stage she takes to drink jams, drink and dance together with her friends. It is a vague image of sexual desire, which is a visual part of the film, and everyone is sweating strong and rhythmic for the period of the scene. Ella Rhineus is the best female lead and Thomas Gomez is a favorite cop. Alan Curtis was confused, innocent, but when he was arrested he was taken to the left for his performance, because he was ill for Kansas for no reason. <br /> <br /> The film is not as good as half the people in the movie, but it does not matter. In fact, it will help tension and dramatic improvement in difficulties to find out what's happening in Kansas and then to get to hell! It's a great movie with some great scenes but Elisha kurk junior has a memorable role, I can never see him ... someone will do me neck-tie .....
