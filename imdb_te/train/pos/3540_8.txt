I bought this game on an inspiration purchase from Walmart. I'm happy. It is very entertaining to hear Sean Connery and play the game. I thought it was the best graphics I had seen in a movie / game remake. Bonus levels are very difficult! The sniper one thinks that I was too hard, it made me so frustrated that I did not play the game for a week and a half. Many people have fired at you or have nothing to do with it to hide. <br /> The only thing I can do is update system. I do not recognize any variation upgraded from non-upgradable devices, such as the purchase of armor upgrading does not appear to be stronger or more filled up on the meter in my life. I really liked Q copter. I think developers have done a good job.
