Although we know how the story ends, it is almost like a political thriller featuring Fly-on the Wall. In calm before the storm, we see Hugo Chavez as an attractive, more than a lifestyle associated with mestizos with 80% of the population, but in the past Venezuela's political process and its oil wealth were closed. He dedicated them as he had them. He is delighted that he travels at a huge speed in the country, arriving at campuses, massive crowds, hugging and kissing ordinary people, passing letters on paper scrapes, and requesting help for the highest office in one of their numbers. <br /> The situation is not happy for everyone. The pure blood castillian Spaniard Elite is a small minority but they have previously controlled all the wealth that is full of bitter and resentful. One of the most unexpectedly hilarious moments in the film, a former coulter lookalike, at residents' meeting in a distinctive gate community, complained of mestizos, "they do not have the feeling of fighting or sacrifice." A few minutes later, a Speaker concludes that the meeting is "beware of your homeowners - they may be Chavez supporters". Duh! <br /> <br /> In the late night interview with the painter alone, Chawaz reveals something of his spirit by telling his grandfather's story. He is a delicate and poetic figure, though he is acting, clown and joking (when he addressed the UN and Bush called the ghost) <br /> <br /> Gun activists called for a storm of protest action and called for their supporters to change the last minute route and Chavez supporters are marching into the presidential palace Umuttadanto and forced to realize that violence is necessary. Snipers on rooftops start firing on Chavez supporters, some of whom have been shot back. The local equivalent of Fox News will reappear, and Chavez supporters accused of killing protesters. Then the camera pulls back and reveals that there are no protesters - the street is empty! The protesters took a different path. There is no need to say that the footage of the empty street has been intensified by anti-Chavez private TV stations (who have continually criticized Chawaz psychologically ill and promoting sexually fixing on Fidel Castro). <br /> <br Filmmakers and their media propaganda masters have greatly stated on TV about how the situation cheated when they ignored the lives of supporters and rivals. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers revolve around this chaotic and military situation, changing the situation as the bombing threatens the palace. Chavez finally surrenders to prevent bloodshed, but refuses to resign and leaves a seabed island off, where a plane is going to take him - where? The US? How do you defeat this heavily armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and ultra-wealthy businessmen who have no close connection with the Bush administration, preventing the arrest of other cabinet members? <br /> If your knowledge of Hugo Chavez and Venezuela is from American media, you do not know anything. He is not "unruly cruelty" and not "ruled by law" - with 60% of votes (George Bush junior never achieved) and was repeatedly elected and re-elected with devotion. <br /> <br /> It inspires the general Venezuela people, cause. <br /> <br /> It is an exceptional exception in an unusual situation. The cinematic masterpiece's expertise is simple, and the story comes from Barreo from each of the Verses to the presidential palace, chaos, confusion and confusion, one of which is a mistake, and moving.
