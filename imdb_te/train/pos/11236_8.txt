For the record, I am not affiliated with the product anyway. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is probably the movie of Star Trek fans with episodes built to date. <br /> It is not in any budget and everyone is developing their time and energy. <br /> <br /> By their own admission, previous seasons do not have the most productive features but the effects, the green screen improves the work, and better than anything else. <br /> I started from the beginning into "into" and watched all the way through. HF profits from the storyline are all the best science fiction and the Star Trek is set in the universe. The characters and "relatives" from the original series have been brought into the stories and added to the feelings of the stories, sometimes improving on the original characters. <br /> <br /> The overall experience is the excellent website, blooper reels, the most subscriber forum with many members and product staff and weekly chats. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for High Definition and High Budget Productions, <br /> <br /> If you are looking for continuous adventures in Star Trek Universe with stories of Star Trek credited, it is ideal for you.
