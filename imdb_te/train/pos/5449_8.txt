Did you know, Antony Kaidis, (red hot chili peppers singer) father is in the film. Blake Dammit, Anthony's father. I saw "Scar Tissueu" after reading Anthony's autobiography and saw his father's picture. I saw in the eighties and saw that person in the film, then I read more and said that his father is a small actor, checking this site and realizing that his father is the truth, this is funny, because it's about somewhere in the book His son may have been ashamed of his father's acting work, but he was not, I did not Father, Blackie, I think did a great job on the show.
