Comment? Do not need my comment? We are talking about all time and masterpieces, all the time, for all generations. This is only the only films I have to watch for. In this, there is some kind of magic like other Disney movies. Even if you do not understand the language, it's easy to understand the message, all the characters are "alive" and "real" (as I was at the age of six, I did not understand when I first saw the movie). Probably not as good as my English, but I've learned so much from these types of movies, and it's rare now that the greatest dimension of these kind of movies. But there is a big shame. It's impossible to see this now in my country, or any other Disney movie! We do not have any copyright, so our kids are disabled to enjoy and learn from these types of movies. So, can we repeat this film again "once upon a dream" or ...?
