The second part of the hit Danish TV series (originally episode 4-8) is slightly lower, but there are plenty of laughs and panic. At this time, Udo Carr was cast as the father of the baby and his ghost as his father. Other standout episodes during this time are Dr. Helmer's terrible revenge, and once again, SÃ¸ren Pilmark's Doctor Krogshoj, who seeks to solve the patient Ms. Drusse mysteries, Miss Marpill style. You will be surprised at how Cliffhanger will be able to make Part III after the death of the lead actors Ernest Hugo Jarrett (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolfs (Mrs. Druzes), but Van Troy is a shot. Unfortunately, Morten Ratney Lefers, Down's Syndrome Dishwasher # 2, also died shortly afterwards. Look for Stella Scorsgard in a guest role. ***
