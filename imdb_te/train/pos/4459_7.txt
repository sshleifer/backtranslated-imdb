For movies like "Anchors Aweigh", have been bestowed with several academy award accolades in a warm up for some happy hour. Either the 1945 suffered a shackled year for a good film or still had a shock in advance by Billy Wilder's 'Last Weekend' that they still wrote anything starting with a ballet A for the best film to please the public of the film's loyal public. Jenny Kelly has been nominated for this role instead of her role in 'Sin' in the Rain, then the scenes at MGM should be something wrong behind rigging systems. <br /> <br /> The studio has its best behavior during this very acclaimed tour of great studios and Hollywood for those who have survived in other parts of the world. <br /> <br /> Yet the sailor's claim is that Jean and Frank Sinatra's amazing talent is certainly a cheerful farce, although the music audience is more likely to be grappling with the unwanted runtime at the previews for musicians. There were pieces too long before and earlier, but the scenes of the lovely Catherine Grayson in this case were removed. Until 'Kiss Me Kate', it is essential that non-opera enthusiasts can find her images in any way with a remote control. <br /> If there is a need for women to choose 'for the town' of 1949, then perhaps the coastal holiday lucky sailors do not need to guarantee audition with Jose Istubi and the whole hearty 'Susie' composition of the piano. Very good luck to get a screen test at MGM's gold studio. Then even a few people should attend. There is no regret about Susan Abbott or Kathrin Grayson's successful screen exams, but the continuous non-opera enthusiastically hopes for both continuous pink slip. <br /> <br /> For all, star talents do not question choosing a good shape and an average score, slight, but amusing navy stories, anchors' least wrong MGM movie. The cast is in that direction in a beautiful color cinematography. <br /> <br /> The natural highlight of the film is in Jerry Felgland, where Jenny Kelly's cartoon adventure is climaxed with a magnificent dance with Jerry Mouse. It is a well-deserved masterpiece in Kelly's career and it's good to think about it before fad Astier dances on walls and ceilings. <br /> <br /> It's not exactly a triple tasting, rainbow sprinkled, chocolate wafer, cream and cherry and banana split sundae, but it is somewhat melted in your mouth and still a pleasant feeling, despite the guilt. Rating: 7/10
