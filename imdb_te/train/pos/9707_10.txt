About a year ago I ended up in American television. A friend who lived in England showed some programs like Office, Extras, Bladdy and Gentlemen of League. Then I decided to switch to British television. Among all the performances listed above, the Gentle of Gentlemen easily found any other comedy I've seen yet guilty smiling and providing material, all of them are very dark and twisted. The included roles are very happy married couples and are placed in meat in the meat (perhaps the best), the worst pair and the worst veterinarian ever seen on a local shop that serves only local shoppers. This program is one of the best I've seen.
