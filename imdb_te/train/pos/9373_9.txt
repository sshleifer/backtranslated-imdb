Like most of you, I'm a great fan of the real thing - 1940s Noir films - but Red Rock West is a real treat for all of us in the past. The word 'neo-noir' has been used incorrectly in the last ten years because of its meaning and its effectiveness. On the other hand, the image of John Dahl is really detailed. The cast was around and had a proper feeling at home with Toy Garnet or Jacques Tourner. The plot you first made in fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would have congratulated it. I'm surprised to see why many contemporary images can be used as they are used, and I'm not even old. Movies like Red Rock West gave us hope for the future when we paid tribute.
