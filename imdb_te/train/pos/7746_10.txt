You know the group dew, the main singer Tom Burman knows. He has directed a bit of the film as he creates music, everything is mixed. It's ridiculous, yet very absurd and cynical, drama, none of the main characters has a pleasurable life, and it does not really have a goal. <br /> <br /> The film starts on Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium with many people's scenes no Friday morning, but they are negotiating with each other during the day and night. There are a number of main characters: a teacher who does not read books, has a sad taste of death and his sister, a gallery owner, two teenagers constantly touching law, a movie theater and two young girls. The person who has something with the wind throughout the movie walks. All the letters have their own troubles, their family or friends, or even life. <br /> <br /> The film is set in Antwerp and shows many beautiful shots of city and harbors. The events of the day are not easily explained, I just advised to watch the movie, there's just a lot to say. But I can say, Barman has an amazing use of the camera and the music (the music that most dance is not really rock), especially the party's superb music. <br /> <br /> The film itself does not have any experience, no intelligence about life, perhaps you should not live in it and waste it or have any moral ethics. Look at it, it is definitely worth it!
