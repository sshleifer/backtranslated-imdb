In the 1930s, Studios utilized a small film, such as testing grounds for new actors who gave their respective production to their full-length films, so it is interesting that it will feature the Shirley Temple, a long-established child star of all time. Then again, she's probably not scrutinized, I'm Frank Cooglan junior who played Shirley's brother Sonny in the film and gave me some less impressive performance. <br /> <br /> The 9-year-old Shirley temple along with Shirley Temple is not an easy task. <br /> <br /> Let's illustrate the working class family status in the film and then give clean transition to the scene and Shirley will be happy in the rain. <br /> <br /> It's Sony's y birthday, and his father makes occasional and terribly damaged attempts to hide the fact that he really wants to give the Sony dog ​​he wants, but since he was bitten and always creeped out because Sony was afraid of dogs. It insists on having a dog at home rather than having a dog in his house, and he decides to have a dog in the house, and as he runs away with the destination in sight, it is also that movie <br /> <br /> Sony train a man in an iron frame on railroad Passing Bacon. , Given how close he is to the tracks, you'd have blown off the right person off the track, but no matter). After Sony gives up on sharing breakfast due to the sour he receives from his ultra smile guy, he continues and disappears from the image of the homeless man. <br /> <br /> Unlike this, Sony will soon hear the dog moving under a dance. And it jumps down to find the cover dog in the burrs. He immediately took the dog and accepted it as he went home because of the fear of dogs, but it seemed to me that he did not just need to remember his authority over dogs. He has authority over him. <br /> <br /> Hey, if it's taken, I'll find a helpless spider for all I have to do and I'm set! <br /> <br /> This is a very suitable movie, it works perfectly well, but it is fun and fun enough. We can not imagine an epic story already in the 19 minute film, but Pardon My Pops still prepares a considerable amount of story and character development during its short period. Charlie Chaplin is proud of the movie and displays the action scenes at the end. Since I am not an expert in Shirley's paintings, it is not hard to see how she has ever become The Most Famous Child Star of All Time.
