Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neal) invited a girl named Azariya. Seventh Day Adventists, they follow their beliefs every day and soon have their dedication to God in their church, with their two older boys. Michael receives a holiday and the family decides to go to Aware Rock in Australia, one of the most attractive tourist destinations in Australia. Not being prosperous, family camps near the site. After a fantastic first day, Lindy's baby sleeps in Azaria at one of the tents. Suddenly, she cried to Ariya. As Lindy goes to the tent, a dingo dog is just exiting, just shaking his head. The baby is gone and soon, so is Dingo. Though the whole camp was looking for a baby, she was not found. Dingo and Chamberlain made her dead and their beloved child, accepting God's decision and continue with their lives. But, unfortunately, this story received sensational coverage in the newspapers and soon tells the story that Lindy has killed the baby. She was later arrested and put on trial. How can this happen? The "mob rule" is a great depiction of the real events that show that the movement of imagination is not. The whole country varies against the Chamberlains, because they appear odd. Streep offers her best performance ever as a lintendy lynch, with her strong stance on her every step. Neil, likewise, was a great job hesitant and confused Michael. This cast is one of the largest in the country, and has made their dugs in the case of Lyndi. The top of the garments, scenery, script, direction and product. If you have never seen or heard about this film, it will be straight away. It is not far from the reality that the film is about "cry" and the one who cares about the media's abuse of power.
