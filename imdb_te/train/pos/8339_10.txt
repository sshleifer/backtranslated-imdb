I.Q., in my opinion, is a sweet, lovely, and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) is really stubborn. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) is better suited for Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James. However, everyone involved in the film has done a great deal of effort. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this sweet, lovely, and hilarious romantic comedy to find you the right guy with this Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan fan who has not seen it. You're for a lot of laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.
