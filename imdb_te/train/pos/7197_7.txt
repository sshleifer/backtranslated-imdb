This serial will give you the opportunity to see an interesting western, you will find only at the end of the only real villain, Don Dell ORO. Ed Cobb in this serial, Ed Tarzan Jim Pearce, c. Many of the actors' characters like Montague Shaw, the eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, Hadley's good performance as Zorro has a very good performance. He was quick, smart, used his whip and knife very well, and his vocal was the best for any zorro.
