I found this film to be good in all areas. This acting is good from all the characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey. Tramell's character just becomes clever and more emotionally distorted in minutes. Despite being the protagonist, it is interesting to know how to continue her writing with new ways and twists for her novels. The arrangement is also amazing and the mystery, thriller masterpiece of the whole atmosphere of the film. Now let's look at this film, it deserves better than what the audience came from, it was misinterpreted by some bad terrible reviews about the movie (before it even started).
