Although some reviews are obviously Lucha-warm, the story is totally foolish and I find that some critics have described the love story as 'Mills and Boon', so what? It is good to see a warm, touching story of true love during this cereal period. Many of the audience kicked their eyes and secretly denied them. You really believe that young Victoria and Albert love each other, yet for political reasons, this is a marriage. I think Sir John Conroy, who is in despair to control the young queen, probably played the role of the pantomime villain. In fact he was rumored that Victoria's real father (due to her relationship with her mother The Duchess of Kent) was interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt completely convinces the princess, who was caught in a palace filled with courtiers and politicians to deceive her. In the end, Victoria painted the character of the great Queen of England and the strength of the decision brilliantly. I believe the term word ensures great success for this highly enjoyable and spectacular looking image of mouth recommendations.
