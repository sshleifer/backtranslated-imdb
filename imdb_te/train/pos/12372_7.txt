Sentinel has recommended me years ago the movie, my dad, and I have seen it since many times. Being crazy, it always gives me fun. Flashback scenes really made me. Cristina Raines's father is running around creepily, two creepy ladies, always handles the cold down my spine. It's your typical good vs bad thing, but at least it makes it fun. Conclusion I consider one of the best in horror history. It's a lot of shocks and suspense, Burgess Meredith has done his job and got me on the edge of my seat. The precise improvement of the sentinel tension. We're never comfortable with Allison's screen. We know that something terribly awaiting her. <br /> <br /> This film is often neglected among fans of horror, but I personally feel it's good, and it's definitely enough to satisfy all the horror fans. <br /> Performance. Cristina Raines has her wooden moments, but for the most part it comes though in a big way. She is beautiful to see, and Saranadan is naturally regarded as her career. Chris Sarandon boyfriend, Michael. He had an instant screen presence, and I could not help but love him. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, John Caradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Silvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Gold Blum and Tom Berenger have memorable characters or short comos. Like Burgess Meredith Chagin is amazing. He looks like a normal old man, but we find it, is completely terrifying. Elli Wallach & Christopher Vilken are doing well as male detectives. <br /> <br /> Beverly de Angelo has a chilling sight, I can not spoil it. <br /> The bottom line. Effective horror film of The Sentinel Horror Fans, unfortunately neglected. It gives you thrills and scares you need to be satisfied. <br /> <br />
