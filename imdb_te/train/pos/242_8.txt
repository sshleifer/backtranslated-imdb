I thought I did this movie well, Heath League is very persuasive and his Irish voice is flawless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts are also good and reliable. I do not know what the truth happened, but people sometimes portray what they do. Perhaps those in power are always corrupt and I have been interested in having signed over 30,000 on a petition to hang Ned Kelly, which is more true in this film than at first. In many ways it reminded me of another good historical film Cold Mountain. In all this, I highly recommend this film and I'm a bit shocked that it's not good in movies.
