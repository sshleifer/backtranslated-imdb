Not everyone is cinema, but this movie is in my top 10. I love black comedy. With the cast, including lines such as Richard Dreyfus (Wick), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brassballs' London), the lines are not dry but dry. The supporting cast is almost dead hub. Counting minor errors in the film: Ellen Barkin's makeup gave her face a washed-out look; With Joey Bishop and Richard Prior working without any benefit, and Michael J. Pollard's screen time is very low. Most of all, this cast is not just ridiculous in the cast of a fine script. If you see Larry Bishop's (author, director) movie, underworld (dark criminal film), you'll enjoy it. His next outing (writer, director, actor) is Michael Madsen and Hell Ride with Quentin Tarantino.
