A powerful adaptation of Best Selling Broadway's Best Selling Book, two "color" sisters who lived at the age of 100 about the lives of Bessie and Sadi Delaney. At their old age, Ruby Dee and Dianne Carroll, they were telling their story Amy Hill Hart (played by Amy Madigan) as a white New York Times reporter. The past and current scenes do not have the most inspirational value in the book, but really powerful. However, some aspects of the sisters' lives, such as their mother's inner-ethnic background and the causes of their father's tough personality, have not been explicitly presented. You need to read the book to fully understand these things. It's just great, because the book is just great! Unlike those flaws, it's made and performed beautifully, especially Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and educational film.
