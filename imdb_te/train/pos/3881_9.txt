The film drew me to an excellent opening scene, which was full of attention and I hooked up to the title. The theme of the film is everyone trying to find them again, but not as tricky as recognition or general suspicions, but we try to forget the normal life. Interesting. The scenes in chicken warehouses are amazing. At one time Jorgen (owner of the chicken farm) was laughing at a seminar, where he was the worst student. His discomfort this allows you to see the depth of his anxiety to change himself. This film surprised me about the hidden mysteries behind the surface of the most common people I see every day. There are not many plots here. Guessing the secret of the old man is pretty simple, but the cunning is trying to predict what other characters will do when they figure it out. Although the characters are not unequal, this film appealed to me as it did sideways.
