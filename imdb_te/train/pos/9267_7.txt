Not bad image. Although I did not really know anything about soccer and I was not a fan, the Iranians were really rooted to win the game. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the issue of women in Iran, not allowed to go to sports venues between men because their standards for women are not correct. . Despite this law, some women tried to incorporate, but most of them were captured and detained. It is really astonishing that any society still has the oldest sense of gender. In an interview, Panahi will see his films history and its unfair papers and one day in future and see how Iran will live once. One thinks that the future will come sooner rather than later.
