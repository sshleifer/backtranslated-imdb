7 years after the terrible nonsense called Star Trek Voyager, I understood beautifully. The next Nation and DS9 are Bloody Good Issues and Viezer Wreck TV Trek. This is probably the best pilot in the trek event. Staff like the selection of actors for the episodes is good. He was the first captain of Scotland's deepest spot and was a refreshing change to the Captains, who previously known his unsatisfactory way of doing things. The rest of the staff really liked their roles and I think they got a good first season off. I was really disappointed when the program canceled untimely. Dark Mirror has shown us that in a mirror the ability to cast. Never seen a film or TV movie. Including the beginning of the story and the beginning of hostilities with the Klingons establishing the Federation, leave to say ..........
