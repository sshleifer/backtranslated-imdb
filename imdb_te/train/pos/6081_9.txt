You can not get more dark or tragic than "Othello", and the film attracts extraordinary performances and drama by Laurence Fishburn and Irene Jacob. Feyburn's spectator expresses Othello's violence, which he believes in Iago's lies with a very convincing, realistic epileptic episode. Jawvet's love, a loyal wife, becomes the object of Igoago's revenge against his or her annoyance (which is not clear since Iggo's behavior has no motivation). Kenneth Branagh (sp?) Despite his general talent for Shakespeare in the film, he is a bit limited. Cassia and Emilia's roles are like Ã‰gogo, though they are more crucial to the plot, in the scenes and outside. <br /> <br /> I know Shakespeare will improve his characters and seemingly unpredictable ones. <br /> If there is any criticism of the film, this story will be very quick and the relationships between some of the characters are not yet rolled out. The director was a great cast, and no one gave bad performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and Emilia and Desdemona was to be developed first. I thought you were confused in this movie, but you're in the past for this movie. Moreover, Othello and Dedomonia need more time together. Convinced of their agony, they are mutually exclusive to each other, and they seem to have just met. <br /> <br /> In brief: Good shows, very small. <br /> <br />
