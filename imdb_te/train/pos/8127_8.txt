This is a spectacular picture of science-fiction special effects blockbusters, which takes another 40 years to reach the silver screen, while being a bit of a preview on the subject of progress as mankind's protective cover. It predicts WWII's global chaos, but has expanded into the campus by having conflict over the past 30 years, and then fights from the man's fighting story from the jungle of rock and place. The performance seems to be wood and strangely toilet, but this is the result of the contrasting visuals that is considered to be completely breathtaking at the time of the release of the film and is still still impressive. This is an image that no one can escape for anyone interested in SF style.
