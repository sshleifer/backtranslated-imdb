I saw this gem of a movie at Cannes, which is part of the directors. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood is not very popular. With all the great actors running their socks, it is a lot of fun throughout. This laughs out loud comedy about a small conspiracy (cousina who played the role of Louis Guzman) who is sometimes trying to steal a car and send it to jail. Will he meet 'life' about the 'ultimate belly' while in jail? Is it for you and me ?? Get a sure call rich quick scheme. Is it possible that towns have a way out of a deserted mansion in the jewelry store store? It's a net millions. Sounds normal? ?? Well throw all kinds of absurd letters and events along the way and you have got the ingredients for a forest ride! ?? The word goes from a low life to the next and immediately goes on a band of failed boxer Pero (sure Star made by Sam Super Rocky) and reluctant to try on Cosimos `Bellini 'lead and assembled in cash <br /> <br /> Italian Cinema Eye Solitio Agotto (Based on The Big Deal on Madonna) Street), which also inspired the movie to 'Collinwood'. 'Palookaville'. This is the spots for the next effort and the cohesion of the Cron Brothers is perfect, although it is written and directed by Rosso Brothers. Stephen Soderbergh and George Clooney were built, who were the smallest hilarious safe breaker.
