In Raymond and Tom Hoolles, this sterling example for brotherly love and commitment is shining. Hulsey Dominic (Nicky) plays the role of a young mentally disabled young man, who pretends to be his 12-minute short, twin brother, Leotton, and Yugenne's medical school. It is set in Baltimore and deals with the problems of sibling competitions, twins, child abuse, and good-for-nothing continuity. It is attractive, and filled with laughter and tears. If you do not see this movie yet, rent it, I promise you, you will be surprised to see how such a fairy image is recognized.
