Successful self-made marriageist Harry Mitchell (a magnificent performance by Roy Schieder) threw a prostitute with a sweet sweet Seini (cute Kelly Preston). The gentle romantic theater manager Raimi (a magnificent slimy John Glover), antsy strip joint owner Leo (well played by Robert Treber) and crazed pimp Bobby Shy (a frightening extreme Clarence Williams III) - who made his video tape with Cini. When Harry refuses to pay, Hoods kills the movies and makes them look like Harry. This will gradually show the intellectual and willful offensive war between Harry and Hoods. Director John Frankenheimer, who received a strict script based on Elmore Leonard's sandy criminal thriller novel, maintains a constant complicated pace, increases emotional pain, and effectively creates a compellingly seedy'n'sordid atmosphere. Harry's bitterly neglected wife Barbara as Harry's loyal business partner Jim O'Bayill, stand-out supporting turns by Brunshi Jade Wesley Doreen and Un-Marrt as Lonnie Chapman are all the same. They place viewers on their toes throughout the plot. Bad defective dialogue, Just Wajano's glossy cinematography, Gary Chong's tumultuous score, tough aomal tone and exciting ending are all about money. As an additional bonus, Vanity and Preston both have their clothes removed. Well worth checking is a very strong and satisfying little number.
