Citizen X tells the real life story of a search for a serial killer known as "Rostov Ripper". This great film shows a long journey that attempts to capture a killer. The film shows how this film has helped the politician to continue his destruction for more than 12 years. Stephen Rhea's performances as main investigator (and probably more than 50 victims, mostly women and children) and Donald Sutherland's overall research are basically spectacular. Jeffrey Dumann as Ripper Andre Romanovich in Chicago. The type of this film makes you mesmerized and soon you have on the Internet to research the real case. This image should not be lost. I believe it on the HBO and I did not release it in the theater for my understanding. Great image
