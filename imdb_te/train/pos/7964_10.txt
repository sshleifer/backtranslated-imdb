I'm surprised how much I love this movie even though my dogs really do not like it. Fox, Feel and Amesh Chance, performing amazing work with vocals and sati, and acting by animals is simply amazing. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie 72 times already. It sounds scary, but it's true!), and the end sequences every time I get. I highly recommend the people of all ages, especially animal lovers. It's really all my favorite movie!
