Gus Van Sant performed some amazing pictures. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I am unable to help that the cerebral edge of the Tom Thabins book "Cowgirl gets the blues" has been translated into a large screen. Together, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant performed fantastic talent and talent towers. Finally this is not a work. <br /> <br /> The characters are not well developed or the plot and content are not alive. It's just that our imagination is more powerful when reading a book like this. We are taking a different time and place and sometimes feel worst and / or best and add it to the entire roller-coaster in the book, which is a nice way to read the author's sensitive. Although the films are out of the whole experience, they are away with strange imagination and emotional roller-coaster. <br /> I read the book!
