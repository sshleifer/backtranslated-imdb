<br /> <br /> 50 US science fiction films are a mixed bunch: they are made wisely and / or come up with a cheerful and cheerful and ridiculous cheese. <br /> <br /> It started on the head with the script - although Shakespeare did not recognize it, it was based on his timelessness. </ br> Artificially artificially shimmered by a machine belonging to a dead species 200,000 years ago. Sometimes wonder why the plot is bristles with the purest so that the stomaties of 50 and corn are always watching, but always do. Love triangle thing ... yuk! Disney's cartoonier is still fine, and the cartoon themes of the Galaxy magazine are even better after 50 years of cartoon themes. <br /> <br /> With all such flaws, such an outstanding impression, we should be grateful for such an ancient print of appreciation.
