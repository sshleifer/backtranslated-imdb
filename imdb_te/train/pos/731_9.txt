This film SOOOO FUNNY !!! Acting is amazing, Ramon's sexy, jokes are subtle, and the plot is what every high school dreams of doing his / her schooling. I absolutely love the soundtrack, as well as the hateful hatred. If you like Monte Python, you love this movie. This movie is tad bit "grease" esque (without all the annoying songs). Sung songs are like; You can also see these songs singing through this movie. These musical ranks have me in both musicals (second to the blues brothers). But please do not think of a music to say; Looking at the songs that are very much liked, it's hard to be careful to direct a dance. I think this movie is more of a comedy of romance's instincts. You remember as a rebellious young man; No need to say, after seeing this movie you will remember your old high school days. Two of the most highly recommended for family (since it has many jokes funnier with age and experience, it's very young but also mature.
