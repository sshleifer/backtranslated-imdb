One of my favorite films, the most nostalgia ended. The film is about the Sullivan family, apparently Michael Sullivan (father), one of the main members of the mafia, the killer to say, and an expert. Children want his father (a terrible mistake) to do the job, so he hides his father's car and he sees Tom Hanks's action to say this. <br /> <br /> Mafia doesn doesn't succeed in mafia, when they want you, they will take you out. <br /> <br /> Of course you can see anyone in a big house, the best car in the world, the one who works at you, but one wrong thing, or someone working at the mafia to do something your "boss" does not want, and you're fired <br /> <br /> What do I mean As you can see, Sullivan Jr. does not see anything he can see, and almost all his family has done that "bad thing" by his son. <br /> <br /> This film is a mafia, or even a lot of folly. <br /> <br /> This film is painful, almost everything you love. Hopefully the person does not work for the mafia when reading this comment, and if you work at the mafia, you will get a favor and hell in the country before your employer and their workers are killed. <br /> <Image receiving this: 10/10
