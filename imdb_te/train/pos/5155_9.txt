"Hitler: The Rise of Evil" was controversial, which was controversial even before the broadcast, which contrasts the film's failure. <br /> <br /> Those who criticize the film, with good intentions, are intentionally sympathetic to Hitler. However, they misunderstood: the evil Hitler was not sympathetic to him. One of the greatest villains in history is that many of the things that do not say unmatched are man's adherents. An unhealthy, disease maniac, for sure, but a human being. <br /> <br /> You must know the story of how Hitler could come to power again to prevent him from happening again. <br /> <br /> "The Rise of Evil" A wonderful, professional performance from Robert Carlyl makes Hitler a human without ever making him redemptive. Whether Carlyle is bound to make the Nazi leader's appearance and habit, not to become a cartoon of deceit or allow us to distance ourselves (something Anthony Hopkins did not achieve when he played the role of Hitler in "The Bunker"). Despite Hitler's degradation and repulsive synthesis, Carlyle would have had a magnetism and power Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Many of the subplots of various subplots, Matthew Modine reporter Fritz Gehrlich, which makes his life's work will attract the attention of the reality of Hitler and Nazism. Madden's performance is somewhat different, and seems to have settled through Part 2, the role that gives us a real life hero in the villain's full movie. Peter Stormer and Liv Schieerber also gave strong support. <br /> <br /> The credits are also checked in the childhood of Part 1 Hitler in a small series of these two parts. And in Part 2, Hitler's relationship with his niece and his wife Eva Braun explains details that have less success than Central Platt, but serve to better understand his mental and emotional state. In the end, we do not understand any movie about Hitler. The average person, gratefully, can not understand the person who tries to eradicate the whole race. "Hitler: The Rise of Evil" tries to understand Hitler, and tries to understand that he has come to power. This is essentially the story to be told, and it is impossible to believe that anyone who has seen this film will be able to say the best, and the ability to do the best. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
