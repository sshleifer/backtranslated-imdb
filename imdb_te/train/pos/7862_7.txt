Here's proof why Mary Pickford is 'America Sweetheart'. In this complicated play, Mary plays the role of a young daughter of a hill, who dares to dream with a relationship with his fellow son. The scenes that they stole a kiss and fall in love are just delightful. She is also ready to bathe. <br /> <br /> Mary, at the age of 30, wonders this role and she is somewhat difficult. <br /> <br /> Tess has to face many physical and emotional challenges. She does not appear in most heroines at the time. Tess hits a tile and does not shy away from fighting with anyone. She agrees to help the daughter of 'Hill Top', but she sacrifices her own happiness to maintain a deep mystery. <br /> <br /> The Danish-born Jean Hersh√∂l is a great looking villain. The scenery that he decides to separate a little boy is enough to discard the vegetables (or whatever) in the film screen. If Forest Robinson (who plays Daddy Skinner) is wearing a beard, was he a match for the prototype used in World War I that is the appointment of the Uncle Sam posters? <br /> If the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning, it is worth investing in your time to see a piece or a pure 'Americana'. This film is available to us, being a happy and true Christian. Recommended.
