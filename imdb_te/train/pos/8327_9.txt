It's a great romantic comedy! Historically inappropriate (Einstein has been identified as mentor or nephews in other locations in the IMDb) but he is a great player. He worked with two good actors who worked together with two good actors. Supported cast (Lu Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Jean Sax, Stephen Fry etc.) all got on the screen and got a great feel. The fact that he carries the surrounding car is striking around him and posters. And he does not wear socks in a scene ... Report, Professor Socks never wear! (Two new entries for the IMDb goose section.) Beside the hysterical bugs and inequalities, this is a great movie to watch with this great cast. I'll give it to 8!
