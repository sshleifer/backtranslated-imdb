It's a beautiful movie, one of my favorite romantic comedy films. It is very ridiculous and the cast is amazing. Although Lawrence Oliver is largely involved with his Shakespearean films, the film states that he does not limit how to play in a traditional theater. He performs a transition from a disgraced divorce lawyer, attempts to prevent women and their brutal ways, playing Mary O'Brien with an unwanted love for a puppy puppy falling for Lady X. The conversation is amazingly witty and refreshing and atmospheric. Ralph Richardson is also happy to see. I highly recommend it.
