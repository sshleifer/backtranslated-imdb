I think it's a funny movie of Holo Point with some good moments I've never seen before in Action Movies. Well, Tia Karere and Thomas Ian Griffith are not good at acting, but Tia Karere is nice and good looking girl, is not it? But Donald Sutherland is fantastic in the mad gangster so his character.
