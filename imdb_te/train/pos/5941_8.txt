A fan-made documentary starring as a famous actress for this new movie Batman and Superman! It is a movie that adore fans and watching movies like Kamikon and Batman made the same person who made Batman: Dead End, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> In this movie, it is different. CGI effects definitely are not perfect and the costumes are far from perfect. However, this shoestring budget is made and this is fantastic for a fan movie. I was impressed by Bag Bag Superman - he was not a little wimpy guy! If it's only for the real movie - fans have fans from here to Omaha to see here. Great work.
