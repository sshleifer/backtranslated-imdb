Guns blasting, exploding buildings, cars crash, and it's just the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This shoot-case is a former action-packed film featuring former CIA hire, who can not think he killed many times (hence the title) is pretty good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tough and toothy Gary Busey, usually played as a villain in this catalog, has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued: after all he is carrying the whole show. William Smith, Luke Osve, Mills Watson, RJ. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rossula, and many other "forgotten" character-actors. <br /> <br /> Return to the States by freeing a group of American military commanders who have been kidnapped by Basky and hi-tech "super circon" (with the backing of a simple tank). <br /> <br /> Why does America need this killing machine more than these bad murders? This question is in any film that focuses on the CIA ... but without prejudice.
