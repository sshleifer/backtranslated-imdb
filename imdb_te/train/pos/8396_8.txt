Sensitive and tough Maria Braun. (Hannah Skigula) married a soldier in the midst of World War II and spent half a day and evening with him. As long as she continues her marriage, she loses him to war and then goes to jail. She continues in her life, a successful businessman who is sensitive, sensible, wiser, and prefers only to use sex whenever and whenever she needs: "I do not know about business, but I know what German women want and you can say that you are an expert on it." As she climbs up, she always remembers her husband Hermann (her man) and persuades her to do what she wants to do? Their future is for him, for the happiest life. The style of "Maria Braun" reminds Fossbinder's favorite Hollywood director Douglas Cirk and a glimpse of damage and survival in postwar Germany. <br /> <br /> Hannah Skies literally shines in every scene of this film and she is wonderful. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
