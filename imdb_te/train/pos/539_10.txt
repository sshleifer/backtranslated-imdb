The first one is good and the original. I'm not a bad horror / funny movie. <br /> <br /> The film is made up of Zad Nelson's character and sometimes intelligent script. Final Destination is a good script for movies and directors. <br /> It seems to have shot a home video camera with grainy-look. <br /> <br /> Great movie made for TV movie. <br /> <br /> Jude Nelson's Stanley is hired to rent and rent the best thing he can do. <br /> When you look at the sequel you will have a new look to see the first time and you have a thought similar to Stanley and get the background of the short history.
