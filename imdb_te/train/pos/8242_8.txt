I saw FIDO on some movie channels and I said I was an instant fan. The film feels like a comic book that captures the look and feel of the delicate 1950s, when you are dancing in the desert to Elvis, you know that ten people know when the bombs fall ill at the desert. <br /> <br /> "Kary Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Kernini and the kid are a wonderful cast. <br /> <br This film is not a big hit and it deserves more recognition than it is from Tim Burton or the SHAUN of the Dead Team, oh good, though it's an instant classic.
