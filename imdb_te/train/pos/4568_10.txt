Daniel Day Lewis, Ray McConley, Brenda Flyer, Hugh O'Connor and Fiona Shaw? Fricker and Day-Lewis have no doubt that they deserve their awards: O'Connor (Young Christie) and McAnalyy were completely perfect: Clich√© is the truth here: they do not do the characters, they dwell on them. Tour de Force, a tour of the Louvre, was a fantasy but it was really a showcase of academy's intelligence, along with this performance, Brenda Tucker's beautifully retained, still and hearty work as Christie's mother. By the way, if you can not see this amazing actress in "Swan", she is another movie worth checking for her subscription (and fantastic Miranda Richardson).
