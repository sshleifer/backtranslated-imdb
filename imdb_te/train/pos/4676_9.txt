I find this film impulse, and I find its ambivalence refreshes in the world of fast-solving films that we've actively shot as "hated" and "bad guy". Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, who lives as family black sheep / lost children who aspires to get the love and respect of his father, as well as a legitimate job that he clearly illustrates in his widow's sister-in-law history. Jade Hirsch plays with his father's tragic father and his regular good guy, and he always keeps on rejecting it. <br /> When I watched it at the Tribeca Film Festival, it was a fitting heir to the classic "Ordinary People". I realized that Judd Hirsch was in that respect too!
