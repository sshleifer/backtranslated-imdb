I'm making films to talk about talking animals. Incredible Journey: For every superb like the Babe, you get the equally poor one like Homeward Bound terrible remake. Or in the case of cats and dogs, you have a great idea for a film that lives up to its potential. When I heard about Polly, the pledge of the knowledgeable parrot certainly did not fill me with confidence. But I found the picture a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> A Russian watchman, Misha Williamenov (Tony Shalub) gets a job in the research laboratory. One day, he heard singing coming from the basement. When he is investigating, he finds a parrot in his cage. Misha is fascinated by the bird, not particularly the parrot, it can speak. And not some phrases. <br /> <br /> Chile is called Polly (Jay Moher Voice), and identifies fellow conspiracy in Mishal. He was convinced Misha Pauli to tell his life story, wondering how the world would stand in the dirty basement. He began when he was a baby, and in the care of Mary, a five-year-old girl who did not have a stutter. <br /> <br /> When Mary's parents were concerned about her friendship with the pirate, they felt they had sent him away. She was hurt by the fall after she was almost gone and taught. Desperate to meet with her, Poly begins a long journey across America, which has different new owners, flying long distances and behind bars. <br /> <br /> In the 90s, DreamWorks released many of the animals that released it. </ p> <p> Although Pauli did not have the same identity or box-office success of Babe, Pauli achieved a little bit of success and worked occasionally of an excellent incognito. <br /> <br /> Jay Moher's stand-up style acting fits well in polarizing. Even if he's a bit of a smart Alec, he never plays a part of the most confident. <br /> When he lived a shelter for Mary, when he was away, he would have to save himself for the first time. When he fell into the hands of different masters, he promised Paul to reconcile with Mary, and he believed. <br /> <br /> Paulie is a little episodic. It's the chosen Pauli Pauli ends, and he's slowly getting closer and closer to Mary. He lets wind in the first pants shop where he adopts by Ivy (Jenna Rowlands), a gracious woman who teaches the meaning of courtesy. <br /> She shows sympathy with Pauline situation and manages an RV across the United States to find Mary. <br /> <br /> Paulie is occasionally a very touching image. His scenes with Ivy are the best. Palli's amazing movements include Tom Jones's numbers on her shoulder. <br /> <br /> She encourages herself to be in her hopes, and some of the dialogue is very well written and thought-provoking: <br /> < br>> The sight of Evey leaving the path of Polly is quite lonely, but Ivy taught me the truth, the sound of the moment. <br /> <br <br> <br /> <br /> 'There are plenty of sad, laughing Spanish Spanish public The animatronic effects are really amazing, and Paulie also gets a sexy scene when it comes down to a small thief (played by Mohr), which can only be a complaint. /> <br /> As soon as you are sitting comfortably with a situation, that's the chimera Pauliki supporting moves to another one. <br /> <br /> ATM machines to steal money from the Paul taught at the scene funny, but a little upset. I am surprised that a child in the film, DreamWorks have been granted the opportunity to be included in a scene. And Paulie diamond exploitation is very mission Impossible. He was caught in the law, and he has been shipped to the laboratory for animal testing that has been there since then. <br /> <br /> The story comes to the full circle at the laboratory, where the story finally turned into poly. But they will find Mary. But the final revelation is the scene of such a surprising intensity. Bobby may not have longevity Bobby, but I believe it is a superb film. Same smile. The same flawless effects. That's surprising intelligence. <br /> A little gem.
