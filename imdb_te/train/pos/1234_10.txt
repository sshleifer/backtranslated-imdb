I grew up watching this movie, and I still loved it when I was still young. Do not listen critically reviews. They are not exactly in the film. Eddie Murphy really shines in his head. You can sit with your family and everyone will enjoy it. It's a comedy with a touch of fantasy. Demons, dragons and the little children who have little exposure to God. The film takes from LA to Tibet for the spectacular view of the magnificent temples of Tibet. A beautiful view! So do your self help and snatch this one up! You regret it!
