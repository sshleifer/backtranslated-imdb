I love this episode in Colombo. The reason is Ruth Gordon and her dame Agathie Christie's American version of Abigail Mitchell is a successful mystery writer. She is tasty to see the perky, perky, lovable writer who suffered terrible damage when her niece died in a sinking accident. She blamed her niece's husband and nephew. The police killed her to take revenge on her death because she left her. I love someone else than Maruthi Hartley to play Veronica. I personally did not really like Heart. And with the course of Colombo, there are some laughs when he questions Veronica at a belly dancing class. Ruth's Abigail is a smart slit and she and her Peter Faulk are great enough to have fun with Columbo.
