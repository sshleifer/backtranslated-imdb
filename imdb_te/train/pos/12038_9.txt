Yes, true classic! What is British drama, less realism and special effects (and raised budgets). This was the last time I saw this when it was shown on British territory TV in 1994. Have a look at everybody who likes a horror story and have lesser-than-big-acting. Copyright is now owned by the unknown and this great drama can be broadcast anytime soon. I recently blocked Woman on VHS, now again I'll be able to enjoy this great great British play. <br /> <br /> <br /> Mark Rowbourn
