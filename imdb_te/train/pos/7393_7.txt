This picture is impressive. My first experience with a foreign film, it's too long, or too complicated. I enjoyed the subtitles; And the plot is surprisingly fresh. After a long retirement, the story of an elder son who visited his elder brother and first met the brother, but it proved to be very touching and realistic. Some of the subtle humor is not discouraged or unable to bear the audience.
