I felt great in children in the film. I was dealing with children at that age, and I thought that their behaviors were very believable. I have a suggestion for the private parts of the age of 5 years. I did not think this commentary was necessary and reduced my opinion of the film slightly. <br /> I'm coming up to Luca Benavard and star. I want to see him more on the big screen. I enjoyed his reactions to the conditions he found himself. Children often do things without thinking through the events of this era. <br /> <br /> I think there is a need to examine the threats message with these thousands of people. <br /> This is a big problem today in schools. <br /> <br /> The end is very unexpected. Billy's thoughts on whether he has won or won is very surprising. How good is that situation? Very often the kids are not ready to compromise. The actors in the film have shown a significant part in the life of the compromise.
