It has only seen Season 1 but it's great! There are many types of people in the island. Someone they are and everybody has loads of skeletons in their shelves ... Melore's Place meets the Creuso family and why is it great? This is probably not but then a spoon full of X files, "what" a dose? And that's a big "hey" and an island that is everything you could imagine - in your freakiest nightmares and you'll be lost. The story has got many turns and it becomes unbelievable. Great arrangement, solid acting with a free acceptance of the human being (well everybody ... I think ...) on the good and bad sides. But weird oh so weird ...
