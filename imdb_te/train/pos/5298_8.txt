John Waters gave us a genuinely enjoyable picture. This is certainly not without its shocking waters-esque moments, but it's tamer than its old fiction stuff like "pink flamingoes". "Peeker" returns to John's initial stage, which reminds the audience of the same type of comedy that was clearly visible in "Polyester". Overall, a really fun comedy with some great moves!
