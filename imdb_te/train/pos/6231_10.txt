It's just great, fun, lovely image. It captures the true essence of the decade and the people and tells the two sisters the beautiful love story of the two sisters. Although the film is only black and white, it certainly does not count on modern days now. The main purpose of the film is timeless. The film features great acting, beautiful song and dance number, and great design work and movie shots. Fleet is also ridiculous, funny moments, there are moments you laugh, but acting is just the other moments you are involved in the hero. It is a wonder how this film will be built in decades, and how it can affect today. If you want to see something great, check it out.
