This movie is very happy. I've always been a fan of Vupi Goldberg and this film only emphasizes it. Her husband's (Danny Glover) success in an African-American family moves the social chain as a success lawyer. She moves to all the white neighbors who are friendly, and she is a little embarrassing. Different events are laughing at the time of the movie, but mostly appeal to other emotions. This film is not a comedy drama. I give a strong 8/10. I recommend to catch on TV or rent it soon.
