I did not want to see it even after watching the cover of animals on Nabubu Island when I looked at my 3 year old video store. We got it and it looked repeatedly; In fact, we have rented it several times. There are some non-animated films that look after my son; What a good change from Dumbo and the Little Mermaid. Acting is wonderful, songs are compelling, they are deep on your head and you can not help but sing along. The storyline is unique about WW2 in its own way, and every time you watch it's new to watch. I have heard that compared to Mary Papins, but I think they are two different films and two wonderful movies, but somehow my son is interested in Mary Papins. These kids are one of those movies that need to be seen again and one of the parents who are unwilling to follow. We have days to see it before nap time and bed time and do not feel the groove that comes when he wants to repeat any other image.
