<br /> <br /> When I was 11 at the theater with my family, I saw this film in 1959. . . Even though I mean very young age 90% of this amazing film makes such pleasure! I saw this morning again in "Turner South". When I saw it, I threw it away with laughter! "Ming Game" is a unique classic from a lost age. If you are youngest in experiencing an enchanting time in the history of the film, I'm sorry for you. <br /> You can not see such movies and understand how they (and even today) send a delightful piece of heaven to "ancient timers" like me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> These films are made up of the predecessors to your popular audience. <br /> Furthermore, these films speak a far different language than any of you. <br /> In other words ?? If you do not understand the problems you're referring to the movie, do not bother yourself by giving comments Frankly ?? There is no point.
