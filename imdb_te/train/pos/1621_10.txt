Harman and Icons 'true Milk Pond' is a true masterpiece of animation art. This duo works more efficiently and artistic evidence that describes the work than this cartoon. It is insult that most people see only the guilty, and always intended, the dazzling entertainment is not amusing, it does not make any effort to thwart the blacks. However, this is a tribute to black music and the music of inferiority. I have not been able to see this candy for a number of years because 'RaceCamers' in England thinks it's too dangerous to show up in multi-ethnic Britain. If someone knows who can get a copy, I will see this work again. I'll always see these messages and intentions, never minded in these cartoons, sixty-year-olds, remembering that it is easy to change and the world is a very different place, but this does not mean that anyone has the right to see what's visible from the past.
