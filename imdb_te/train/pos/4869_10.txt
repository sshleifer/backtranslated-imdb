For people without the fastest brain or without a drop of blood in the Balkans in their veins. If you do not have anything of it, it does not mean. And if you do not understand it, you can not enjoy it. :) For example, if you think Picasso CitroÃ«n is the name of a car built, if you see a Picasso's painting, you walk out, which determines some street painter's worst. :) So before trying to understand it, do not judge :) In the end I think every one of the open minds. My N1 is still Shawshank Redemption! And remember that all things can be placed in frames. Because there are things in this world, no frame just do not fit.
