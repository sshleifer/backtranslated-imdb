In this Victorian era, Joan Fontaine was a villain. She plays the role of a girlfriend who loves her side and sets her attention on Miles Rushworth, starring Miles Rushworth by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is very good as Miles. Miss Fontaineen played the role of perfection - she was fraudulent, calculating, innocent, frightening, and lovely at the same time. Take an actress with extraordinary talent to pull it off. Joan Fontaine looked very beautiful in the elegant costume of Travis Beaton. Also in the film is Jon's mother Lily Fontein as Lady Flond. I highly recommend this film.
