I remember this series well. Stylish and compelling characters, such as stylish and sexy ... and at the moment everything else is quite different - and now ... I'm also sure that the stunning Canadian drama "traders" are inspirational - it's amazing. <br /> <br /> 2 Season 1 and Season 2 are available on DVD in the UK and UK. <br /> <br /> Season 1 is the 13 episodes and season 2 is 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately after 2 Seasons it ended. <br /> <br /> The series was fun. <br /> <br /> You sometimes have Amazon.com.
