I remember this game. It always sat alone on the shelves, and for a day I decided to try something new for change and this game came. This was a surprise because I was the first game for the PS1 that had discs. <br /> <br /> The storyline of this game is very good and distorted, the final fantasy VII storyline is almost impressive, and it is hard to achieve. When you play the game, it is associated with the characters, unbelievable as a PS1 game, which treats as a movie. <br /> <br /> This game is very bad game that is very unheard of and no one has ever played or liked it, because it is one of those games. The shelves will end, a 50% of it is trying to sit off and sell in. Well I see them at the end of one of them, and try them, and many of them are good. Heck, how I got into Final Fantasy VII, looking at a catalog, and finding it. <br /> <br /> Legend of the dragon is surprisingly a lot of square or better than Enix games. I'm not surprised if Square Enix is ​​made, but it's not. No games I play are better than the Final Fantasy Series, or Dragon Quest series, but this one. <br /> <br /> This is a PS1 man made in 1999. This is the story I already said It is amazing, is almost VII beats <br /> <br /> 10 to 10 is accurate square enix.
