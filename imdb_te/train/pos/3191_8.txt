Director Edward Sedgwick, an old hand in visual comedy, successfully leads to this Hull Roach road show, displaying fast moving and witty scenes and spectacular performers, using a large number of roach's loyal performers. Although the film was originally designed as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, Sunny Jack Haley, Joe Jenkins, travels to a young Kansan and Hollywood who sells his auto repair business, where he attempts to play the role of a girl he loves-Sequil Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence). Sedgwick, who is willing to use the entire MGM studio as his set, is always ready for an audition, a scene from the movie star Rinaldo Lopez (Mitch Auer), a naturally-cinematic comedy starring Broadway's lead director Lida Roberto. Laurel and Hardy have many pleasurable interlasts, including a famous skirt involving a small harmonica, and we see good twists like Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Lang. In balance, Misscha must be given Bay to the Bay, who is an emotional film actor, who steals clear as a director and his director for his brilliant ending to Busby Berkeley's film glasses.
