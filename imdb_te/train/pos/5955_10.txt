As the manufacturer of "This Darkness", I neglected three very important receipts in our final credits. Exceptions can not be adequately committed once or when parties join --- the film has seen --- at that point it was mentioned. On behalf of the film's excellent cast and crew, I apologize to them. Obviously, some criticisms are posted here. Our production values ​​are very low and our "special effects" are very special, but the plot is very strong and the cinematography is fantastic by John McLeod. We hope you enjoy that reader, "this darkness" and hope for their efforts to make their baskets work free. Thanks, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
