The first film was produced. Workers are streaming from a factory, some cycling, a lot of walking, right or left moving. In addition to Melissa, Lumiers are both the starting point and the exit point for the film - Meliss Storytelling, Film, Fantasy, Art, Scenes; Lumieres are pure, decorative, with observation. Truth. <br /> <br /> There are many intellectuals who are worried about the film's oscillation. Nothing about it. The film is full - breaks down a steady, inhuman sequence that breaks the life, functionality and quiet harm of the frame, from the back to the right or the left (but never, of course, the camera). And yet the camera is still in stock, having the power, possible subversion, attaching it to its will. <br /> <br /> Cinematography can be a revolutionary discovery but is used for conservative purposes - mapping, editing, limiting, and limiting the world. <br /> <br /> There is a historical reality of this film. These factory workers are Lumi√®re employees. Employers spy on their laborers, an eye that is not visible about his anonymous servants. The film describes two types of prisoners. Behind the gates, the workers are confined to their office. Opening the gate is the image of freedom, running, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, and the more they combine. The first film was also CCTV. The first example of supervision is the invisible facsimile of all visible creations that attract his servants. A frightening, very prophetic image.
