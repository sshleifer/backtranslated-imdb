The French and those Germans certainly have a long history of each other. It is of interest to note that in 1931 a translation of a Kamardasasft or compound is translated. A few years later, Hitler invades Germany and begins his plans to take over the world, and France makes his intentions worse. But it's a calm tense compared to this future. The group of minors at the border tries to go to France to get the job done. Their French neighbors will be pulled back at nightclub. Then a disaster takes place in the mines of the French and decides to come up with a well-designed and written scene, a group of German minors. Is not this a simple story? Pabst is a poet of silent film and I'm not sure if it was his first sound or not, but his poetry was invented. He's not fussy but it's a tough realism that's tough. Threr also a flashback to a WWII event that realizes the point of this story. A film based on a true incident takes place with a constructive and tenderness. Smetimes, it's what a picture should be.
