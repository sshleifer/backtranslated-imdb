Put the camera in ME is a deceptively beautiful picture. This is actually a complex glimpse into child psychology and provides interesting ideas for the development of adults and artisans. On the surface it has a memory of some home paintings made with a group of upper-class neighborhoods in the 80s. One of the movie directors, Darren Stein, accessed a video camera and quickly became the artistic leader of all the films. Sure, these are just some cute kids having fun. But it's too much. This can lead to a few moments when we are struggling with children with many confusion problems that we all face in our lives - we try to understand fear, sexual awakening, unconscious love, loneliness and the adult world. As we are older, we forget how to ignore life facts whenever we are young. <br /> <br /> When the film becomes a filmmaker in the teenage film Darren Stein, the film becomes more valuable. It is clear that Darren is running the show, and these small films are revealed to him, but by his friends, their problems, the dynamics between individuals and the general chaos of adult life panic. Many of the children made movies, but I've never heard or seen kids create "small" films about the inability to fit in and holocaust, homosexual, nuclear warfare and friends. These kids are dealing with some big things! <br /> <br /> The power of this film combines many scenes for running stunts together with Stain and Shell kids --- all are now adults and all still friends. Adds a new angle to this image. How close are people with our childhood friends? These guys have. And, many of the issues they deal with are still still running after two decades. <br /> <br /> Conflicts of loneliness reveal a broken heart, a very common childhood sexual experience continues to be a "sticky" thing between men and some of the ongoing concerns about dynamics are still very charged and middle-class ! This is a perfect feeling, as the home films progress in a two-year period. Darren Stein is the director. There is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Stain and shell chatting with each other regularly, and can not imagine the awkwardness of allowing these young people to suck us. It has been a great success to Stein's success as a film producer, writer and director in the real and entertainment industry. Keep me camera from the first moment we can see the emergence of a gay little boy trying to figure it out. Look at the artistic mind and personality side that we are not always "nice" or "caring" - and a bold move for any artist who shares with this audience. <br /> <br /> There are many revealed moments, but the picture we see is that the most disturbing and intricate movements, a Jewish concentration camp victim, were tortured and killed by the Nazi. We will find the interviews and interpretations of the Nazi played by a Jewish child and a good boy played a part of the victim. It is a painful frustrating moment which is working on the dark side of fear and the adult world horror thru beyond the awareness of children's children. <br /> It's more than some home movies. This documentary binds growing pain, beauty, happiness and sadness. Powerful stuff --- and well worth seeing <br /> <br />
