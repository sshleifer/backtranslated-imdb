It is 60 years old. Humor is very soft, but I grew up much more than I expected. The cast is first-rate and they seem to have a wonderful time. Ustinov wanders by muttering some very funny things under his breath, and it is all too inconsequential; I will buy the movie as soon as it comes on DVD. Ustinov as an embezzov who was posing as a computer wiz of the plot and embezzling money from an American company in an office in London. Maggie Smith is a fun part of her job for a while, and watching her get rid of many jobs. Bob Newhart is his casual sweep sweep, and Carl Malden's London office is a dense and impassable executive fun. The end is funny and neat cynical.
