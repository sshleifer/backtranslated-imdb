I have to admit that I have gone to the pitch with low expectations. Jimmy Fallon's final film (Taxi) Catwoman is bad, and the trailers for the Fever pitch are all right but it's not a big announcement to tell me that I'm not mesmerized. <br /> <br /> "I like the jimmy fruit, but the taxi did strike in his career, now we have a stereo-rehimic two ooooooo! Another strike, it's back to SNL!" or "Buy a little peanut and cracker jacks, Do not buy tickets. You do not go out of the theater and go back! " Then the picture was going to be more entertaining than I was expecting. But hey, I can not let my pans go wasted, right? Another reason I thought I do not care for the movie is that I hate Boston Red Sox. My whole family The name of Pedro Martinez is just a reference to me having a bathroom. Oh man, hold it ... <br /> <br /> ... All right, I'm back. Anyway, my mom, a St. Louis cardinals fan, still believes the world series rigged last year. She denied that Sacks had legally won it. <br /> <br /> I agree that the Fever Pitch will only sympathize with the Red Socks Fans. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has a hobby for sports is in this film at some level. You can not fully understand the intense extremes and lows that go through a fan like Ben's Fan, except the favorite sports team. There's nothing very fresh for a new season aroma and a clean slate too smooth. Well, speak straight up. It's a pleasure to be a fan of sports. <br /> <br /> I love you that the film takes on a fictional story and throws on it. The real world background of red socks last year was an improbable World Series run. I want to marry, I do not like it, but you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> In this case, he was 7 years old, and Ben left his two season tickets when he died. Ben missed the game in 23 years. He has a draft day at the beginning of each season, and he and his friends can find out who is the one who has gone to play with him. He dances everybody for the Yankees games and when anyone complains he threatens them with the Royals (sorry Mr. Shade) and the games for the Devil Race games. It's a very good scene, and I know it's actually a "ticket draft day" because it works well. Ben must also accept what I have to say when dinner with Lindsay and her parents. Red socks are playing a road game, but it decides to tape to see it live in the TV bin. One of the most dangerous things in life is to press the game and try to prevent people from hearing and out of hearing. There is. It's a long and terrible situation. Weyel, Ben looks at a restaurant and enters the danger zone when he cites about watching the game. As soon as Ben covers his ears and does not hear the outcome, the shirt starts as a cloth. Lindsay intolerance, and her parents do not know what she thinks. Yes, sports fans are weird and I can not deny it. <br /> <br /> Now the Pharaoh's brothers are disappointed if you look for the raw and sharp things you know. Ben, as though he likes Lindsay sometimes speaks like "an adorable stroke sufferer" from the side of her mouth, but their moments are there, but overall this is a smooth, more romantic side putting in the Brothers show. It's not always difficult. Thankfully, when the sap starts sealing a bit, Farrellys know when to pull away. Jimmy Fallon proves that he can walk well on the big screen with the item on the right, and Drew Barrymore keeps romantic comedies stable. The fever pitch is just as good and solid as Ben jumps into the lynx field and rushes to Ben to run his loveless love for him. It's fun, it's romantic <br /> <br /> Now I make clear that Red Socks fans refer to "The Curse of Bambino" and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fallon , Drew Barrymore, Romantic comedy, The Red Sox, Baseball, or Sports Gift Fans are usually examining the superstitious fever pitch Sally. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "I can not go out of my way to see oncoming traffic and by the time, but it would make a great afternoon. <br /> Rating: 3.25 (5 in)
