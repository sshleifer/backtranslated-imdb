Andy McDowell's facial expressions are again great in the film. When you enter in 40 years and you think you're wasting a while (or your life) single. If your antenna is actively active, the sweet reminder that love can be found anywhere. I quickly liked the sexual encounter, usually not the role of a reserve school teacher (MacDowell). Her former student was beautiful enough, still carrying love on his teacher for a long time. <br /> <br /> Some parts are not considered unrealistic or inappropriate. For instance, a mature police officer (another friend of MacDowell) allows her friend to do such a bad act, in a scene where the other women's jealousy is replaced and a scene was set up to dump Andy MacDowell teenager? <br /> <br /> <strong> </ em> Film producers know the fact that there is not a long time romance between an old woman and a young man. In addition to this, the happiness is not to appeal to the public, especially to more than 40 envious women. Woe to the mourning woman who lost her true love to the gloomy end of the hope, but if the man continues to live, is not it last? How much? Nobody knows. However, one film may be after a year that you want to see again after a while.
