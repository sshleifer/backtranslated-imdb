Perhaps some can slow it down. However, this is definitely "slow-burning", which seriously affects the viewer. The miracle is the same as the first scene: first of all, what we hear; Then, let's see what the characters are allowed to do; Ultimately, the camera slowly re-sits and sits, and we see another character, just a young man sitting, listening to the conversation or at least not really paying attention. The fact that this young man is in the lead role shows the film's strategy: enables the character to be developed and determined by his surrounding environment, but not more points than necessary. People come and go out of his life. Most of the film follows him (and the only supporting characters that he has in relation to him appear to be close to him), we believe we are aiming, so the micro director is touch.
