Steve Karel plays the role of a slightly odd straight guy in 'The Daily Show', and then in many supporting roles. In the Virgin, Karel has invested a brilliant and happy script all over his strengths. Carey Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man spends a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little odd, but the way to some sort of an awkward nice guy. One night, when Andy was skeptical for the first time with his colleagues, Andy was suspiciously a virgin. His colleagues, David (Paul Rudd), J (Romini Malco), and Call (Seth Rogen) initially complained about Andi's condition. But it is clear that the three men are respected by Andy, and they help him to end his virginity and decide to help him. So Andy's quest comes into youth. Andy is the coolest innocence, and most of the humor takes off from his innocence to the conditions he found himself throughout the film. Some humor is linked to slums, but most of these are just a ridiculous mockery. Additionally, Andy has been experiencing two romantic relationships and friendships for the first time in my life, and Andy touched a little while touching a little bit. I did not try to portray love story or play; It is rolling in your seats comedy. Still, every good joke I have had enough heart to take care of the characters. A good comparison is 'wedding crushers' this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but its jokes are a little too obscure. I especially liked the film finishing off, I thought it was a perfect way to end the movie. Without giving away anything, it reminded me of 'Mary About Mary'. Very light and fun; It lets you laugh and smile, how sure you feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend it.
