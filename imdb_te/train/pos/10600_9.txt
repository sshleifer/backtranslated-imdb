This is a very funny eeling comedy about a society in London. By exceptions, they are not English, but the French province is Burgundy's supplement. <br /> <br /> Comic star Stanley Holloway (known as Alfred Dulittle in my Fair Lady), is the host of other classical comedians at the same time. <br /> The story is based on the newspaper at that time, when the Canadian government gave a "official" royal visit a hotel room to the European member. This idea actually reminded me of the real-life case of the Hut North province in West Australia, where the landlord "broke up" from the Australian government due to Wiley's quota controversy. <br /> The Western Australian or Australian governments have never recognized it). <br /> <br /> It is a great work that has many political and economic issues, such as the TV show "Yes Minister"; Also a great little extraordinary character piece as well.
