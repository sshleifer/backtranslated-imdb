Pinjar is really a masterpiece .... It proves an idea that the movie will make you think and you will question our culture. It is by no means the best Hindi movie I have ever seen. I believe that the film should be shown in festivals around the world and was a serious contender at Cannes. <br /> <br /> The story that tells about the partitioning of the film is a very important story and unforgettable. It has no biases or prejudices, and division has given the human story. Here, no one is depicted in good or bad living. Bad Indians, bad Pakistani and good Indians and Pakistanis. Cinematography is good and the music is melodic, meaningful and haunting. Everything about the film is fantastic ... and acting just took my breath away. All the perfect cast.
