I would like to see that this movie was last year, it was nationally chosen to open the nationally opened day in France. <br /> <br /> The collection works as intended: it stimulates a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions, intellectual work, no less pity or knee-jerk reaction. <br /> <br /> Anti American: I am not able to speak to everyone in this regard, I am an American that such statements are completely crammed. There are many loudspeakers about the Egyptian segment of Chahnine, as the democracies insist on the perspectives of the Palestinian suicide bombs that are "brilliant targets" for the electing of the governments themselves in democracy, the piece: Many views are discussed, no one is true, and critics - even if they see the piece - director and the American conversation And the warmth of the conversation between the will of the devil okka seem to forget, <br /> <br /> The images are very good, beautiful, intelligent, uttejakaramainavi, especially mahakkalbaph, tanovik, Loch & inraritula masterpiece. Nair is generally good, effective against a Muslim family and the true story of injustice is wiped out in the face of Islam brainstorming - and still sweep - states. In the criticism of media fiction in the face of terrorism, I realized that the bit of the guitar was offensive and simple, the piece of pen was very sensitive to my taste and I liked it as elitist. Borgnine is very good and courageous. Spoiler Warning: When a critique is read as a joyful moment for the role of towers falsely read; My reading is what the towers fall because he refused to recognize that the light in his room loses the keys and the loss of his life. Again this is a sort of Impressionist piece, because we know that if the towers really block this person's flat light, then there was nothing smoke and gray, light, flooded through his window.
