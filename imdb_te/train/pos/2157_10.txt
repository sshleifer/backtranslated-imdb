Okay. What you see is not mine in my favorite films. It is a completely ridiculous character play. The main character is a "same thing, different day" is a businessman stuck in mentality. Every day, looking out for herself a window of dance studio from her train, she decides to learn more about her every day. She decides to join the dance class, not her preacher. From there, four learners learn to enjoy bonds and dance and learn about the mysterious lady. <br /> <br /> The film is remade with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez, and the new one is no longer the original one. It is not desirable for Oscars as it was broadcast on television in Japan (released on TV or they disqualified Oscar nominations). It won Best Actors, Cast and Direction for Best "Novel" Awards in Japan.
