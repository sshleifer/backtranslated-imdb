Maybe I'm a soup but this is always sweet movies! When I was 4 or 5 years old I saw the first time, shaking my eyes. By now and now (at the age of 15) I have seen 25 times and have ruined every one of them. Do not worry they are tears of joy! And not all SAP! There are a lot of humor and comedy. Generally speaking, the whole spoken animal might be a huge dragnet but it is not the case in the film. My only word of advice: If you love this - see the sequel ... cornyness! I'm referring to every one of these checks ... you're sorry, no matter how old or young you are!
