W. Three remakes of the novel of Somerset Mayon, this is a great one, and not particularly John Cromwell. The film was seen in the film industry due to a break from actress Betty Davis as Mattred Rogers. Finally, Jack Warner and her studio were paid Royally for her struggle. <br /> <br /> That movie was originally dominated by Mildred. Although Mildred does not care for Philip, he will never be there. She is not insulting to this kind of spirit that she has fallen in love with the wrong woman. <br /> <br /> <br /> Pilla Phillip Carrie is a weak man, rather than a hunk. When he tries to hang on Mildred, she rejects him. <br /> When Mildred returned to her, when she was weak and losing, he got up on that occasion and overcame her own dependence on this horrible lady who stole her will and his men. <br /> <br /> Butterfly Davis Mildred's fairytale character. It was one of her best roles and ran to her. Her dislike for Philip's side is evident at the beginning of their relationship. She washes her mouth after kissing her, which is one of the most powerful moment in the film. Leslie Howard lowered Phillip and showed him weaker than he was. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen, appear in small roles. <br /> It is Betis Betty, and you do not forget it!
