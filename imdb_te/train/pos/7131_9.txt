It's a wonderful TV movie. This is probably the best and favorite character of BAFTA winner John Tha (Cavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse). Tom Oakley (Tow), who lived in the village alone after his wife and son died, is now traveling with an evacuee called Willym Beach (Nick Robinson). When he learned this kid he developed friendship. Wilmis Mum (Annabelle Sception) until he wanted to return. Tom wakes up without consulting him with William, who goes to London. Willy finally gets his home with a loving family (or father). A fantastic picture which is set during the Second World War. It was nominated for the BAFTA Lew Grade Award and won the National Television Award for the Most Popular Drama. John Tha TV is ranked 3rd in the 50 Greatest Stars of TV. Very nice!
