The film was designed to influence audiences and this film was gone without speech. It is a well-known dialogue of gratitude and poetry, which is a comedy, hate, murder, rape, theft and deception. This removes a serious web that leaves the screen unseen to the screen until it closes credits. The story is sweeping. This triggered the human ruins of viewers from the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War. Roger Casamazor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors of the screen. Auxiliary players give a true meaning of magic casting and authenticity. Sets, lighting, scenery and cinematography are excellent. I absolutely love photography.
