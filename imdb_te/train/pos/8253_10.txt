The first thing I have seen in the last year is a must watch! It's unfortunately funny, incredibly original and unbelievable (they went for a miracle to look for this super-wide-screen technician look) and it's actually deep in character and it tells the community. At the same time it's really smart satire of nails everything in homeland security race issues, while you leave laughing and laughing in the world of fear. Carrie Anne Mose turns into a comedy actress I never expected her from imagination! She's sweet, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido, who only climbs and giggles! Dylan Baker is the father and father. In fact the whole cast is perfect. Henry Kerney, Tim Blake Nelson Funny, like the evil guy with a hot sexy zombie girlfriend (getting thought right now), but inspiring and just all round amazing! Watch this movie! You have never seen it before.
