Easily the greatest low budget horror film of all time. At the age of nine I saw this film for the first time and I said that I was scared of hell from me. Now that I grew up, though, it's really what this movie looks like ... the intellectual's work. Everybody, or anyone with any taste, snowman dreams of watching them, even if they do not accept it. I've always found something really intimidating about snowmen, obviously, for me, such a horror drugs, this movie is a dream come true. Some people say that the film is silly or what is intellectual of intelligence ... It's about a serial killer snowman movie, what do you imagine? Anyone who has given a low score to the film will have a good laugh at the stupid one liners and cheap gore. I heart this forever, until this movie, comedy, and movie industry wises up and makes a serious horror film about a killer snowman (unfortunately, it seems impossible) to my heart.
