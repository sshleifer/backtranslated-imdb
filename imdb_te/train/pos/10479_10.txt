It was really a picture that my dentist recommended me, and he was happy! A mixture of British humor (I'm jokingly?) And the lost, middle-aged widow's reality tries to preserve her lifestyle. Add originality of the foot to the original (the plants under the bushes can not do without TLC), and this is really a happy, yet touching film. I laugh every time laugh at all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down lights! Maybe it's my Mendocino county blood, but Brits definitely got this right! 10/10
