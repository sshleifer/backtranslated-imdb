This is a fun, clever story and a wonderful picture with the theme of what is culture differences and what's important in life make this very little appreciated film. Do not let the world's cyanes prevent you from seeing it. Keaton has fantastic moments and is very happy that actors like Keaton are coming from comedy to serious bits, because comedy is not appreciated. Great picture all around!
