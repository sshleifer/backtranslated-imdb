I have been waiting for a superhero film for a long time. "Mystery Men" became "Cartoon Nice" and "Classic Comic Strip Spops" and "Underdog" and "Super Chicken". The same spirit has everything in them: the comic tongue-in-the-cheek tone; Courage for heroism in life with a humorous threat; These characters can not be successful on their opponents-not-so-precisely-rooted path. It is the misfired spark of lords igniting in the weak and simple, and it is amazing to see a very high and bright glow here. <br /> <br /> "Mystery Men" opens a party at a nursing home. Kinka Usher, I want to give older people more energy and life to the scene. It looks like George Romero created it. These old people should get the feeling of being sharper like everyone else, or it's a guard. By the time Red Eyes crash celebrations, you can stand halfway and shout the ladies play a weapons creator with a surrender of ladies in their eighties: "What this party needs - a little excitement!" If writer Neil Cuthbert had any feelings, he would be standing with intruders, and the egg on the spare parts to do the same. It's an exciting start, and the best of the troublesome trilogy: Shaol (William Mackie); Blue Raja (Hank Azri); And Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) does not come out to save the day. <br /> <br /> "Mystery Men" has many other problems. These include the villain Casanova Frankenstein to develop the absurdity of the rest of the people in the film and he can not. Jeffrey Rush is the wrong actor for this part; He must be way over the top to make a conflict between good and bad a Galvanic one. And never performed a talent for rush. You may expect John Lithgow's rudimentary theories of Paul Freeman's powder, Debonyir behavior in "The Adventure of Bucker Bungee" or "The Lost Ark Riders". Instead we have the Paschita; <br /> <br /> Many ideas of "Mystery Men" are tied to anyone who wants to build them very well and may be a deep problem. But what kind of mess is the type of mess that I love. Ben Stiller always seemed slumming in the roles he takes. This is not an exception, but he will go with such confidence if you feel he has learned something about growing comedy in a house run by Jerry Slayer and Anne Maria. His Roy Woody Allen refers to all the put-over, exquisite delicate, long-lasting defensive varieties. Whether he is a servant at his favorite hangout (questionable) or questioning the knowledge of fellow superhero (spinx ves stucci) or a new member in their "Elite" group (which is probably her funny moments on screen at Geneine Garofa) is hard time, he's always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> "I'm One True Thing," Jeanneine Garoffa proves to be the actress Renee Zellweger. I saw the fixed exchange between a daughter and father in films (okay, he died and his skull was in a bowling ball, so suit me). And the funny part about this character is that it feels "screwball revenge" of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with God in "Breaking Waves". And in this version, the girl does not die, and the ring does not ring on your head for hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> William H. Mackie is very difficult; He makes stale magnetic. You understand what Jennifer Lewis' Lucille attracted to Eddie. You can also understand her tension. The barbecue alone is enough to run me on the edge, but Eddie's adorable, half-breed son appears at his father and "I believe you daddy." It looks like Lucille sigh, "Roland, do not encourage your father", Neil Cuthbert seems to be the first-rate clever. <br /> <br /> Hank Azar (in the movie "The Bird Cage"), and Louis Lasser (first for two decades in her "Bananas" and "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman?") And the son and mother who share a will for silver; Captain Amazing and Ricky Jaye Greg Kinnear as his campaigner; Kell Mitchell as "Invisible Boy"; Paul Reuben's "The Splin;" And Lena Olin, if she does not have some lines in the film, it may seem to be a visit to this set.
