I'm still wondering why I saw this movie. Before watching this film, I learned nothing about The Beatles. I do not know their names too! <br /> <br /> They married John Onon, and John was killed. <br /> Furthermore, VH1 is not my favorite music station, MTV. Still, for some reason or I decided to watch, I do not expect much. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much! This conversation was written and handled in a little bit of confusing. It's very important, because John and Paul are pretty much a whole picture, they come out to explore all the possibilities, and keep you looking. <br /> <br /> Jared Harris and Adine Quinn offer a good amount of good performances. <br /> <br /> The end is also very intelligent. I enjoyed the movie as much as you enjoyed the SNL performances, and then you get to the head and get to know that it's good to go and it will end in a good note. My favorite moment is probably a touching roof scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend this picture to everyone. It's a very good way to resolve your curiosity if it's been six years later when Paul just showed up on John's home. The main reason I watch this movie is that the Beatles really can see what happens to me after my curiosity and breakdown.
