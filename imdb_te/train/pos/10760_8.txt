"9/11," hosted by Robert Dinero, displays footage from outside of New York in September 11, 2001 and Twin Towers. <br /> <br /> Very confusing and cryptic, yet powerful and never moving. "9/11" is a real treat. <br /> <br /> Anyone who does not move through this television program is immune to anything. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars <br /> <br />
