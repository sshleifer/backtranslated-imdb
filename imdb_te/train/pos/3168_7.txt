It's a beautiful and sad little story of cultural difference. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who runs to California to escape the failed relationship with Japan. Ken is a Japanese-American manual worker with the ambition of Rock and Roll Stardom, but concrete to provide a potential partner. Kyoko "meets" Can be married only in the US where they live together until they have a "green card" so they can stay permanently in the US. That same wavelength - or the same "time zone", hence the title of the film will soon develop. As an immigration advocate, I saw such "arrangements" and made their own life, so I was glad to see how the filmmaker developed a dramatic opportunity of the situation.
