It is awesome about a brothel in a fishing village, with the best scenes and the direction of the old Kurosawa, human psychology (O-Shin - Sonia Marmalodova), Shakespeare's play and Hans Christian Andersen's tragic and fun. The screenplay is fantastic, the scenes are the color- and some of the beautiful scenes really are strongly in my mind. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a small action, so that you do not even like all the sentiments that come to your costs -. This is not about secretive voices and pride of samurai lost by Bushido's fools, but found anywhere about life, work, and people. The lovely and lovely tribute to Kurosawa, is definitely worth looking at.
