John Holmes is very famous, he is infamous (as Three Amigos says). This is the Rasmon story about events surrounding the Wonderland Murders in Los Angeles in the early 1980s. Some of the story is added from the replacement of the participants. From the friend's perspective, there is a story from David Lind (featuring Dylan McDermott). He is in Eddie Nash's place (Eddie Nash is an infamous drug dealer - and he believes Boogie Knights played Alfred Molina in the same role), and he is the most involved in drug trafficking. John Holmes's perspective (played by Walim Kilmur), which makes him a hammer between the two kings (cocaine has a strong desire). John's wife (played by Sharon - Lisa Kudrow) and his girlfriend (starring Don - Kate Bosworth) have two memorable memories. It's basically the same time frame we're looking at, just the version of each character. The dead person's perspective is merely missing. <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul Boazy Knight of Paul Thomas Anderson has painted John Holmes as a little heroic character, with a tragic and humorous ritual. He is a caricature of real man. He is a mixed child who is less likely to get through his "big" endowment. Director James Cox comedy takes off and makes this piece a nightmare for all of us in the life of John. The real life murders make this film even more exciting. <br /> <br /> Wallmaker, who has been learning about Jim Morrison from the Doors, has improved for the Salton Sea, and then further improved John Holmes's deterioration by cocaine. The cast loses most of the cocaine jackles' character. Josh Lucas's performance is the best of the film. Ron Launius (he thinks that this character is from the Boogie Knights character as Thomas Jane). Ron has a smile of laughing John Holmes, and cocaine craving cheers with blood. The use of cocaine is very thoughtful. Did they really use the spreadsheet ?? <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights Bubblegum Pop (Color and lots of 70 nostalgia) is great, Wonderland is dark. The action is fast and angry, a lot of jumps. It is intolerance and hard. No comedy, never ever had any trouble trying to pay more attention to what the director believes in us, in a fast paced, experimental cocaine. This is a graphic image. This is one of the most violent scenes I've ever seen in a movie. In fact, it shows the murders (first seen in John Holmes' view and then from the third person's perspective). It is graphic, which is a crime police evidence. After this scene I had to make a break. This image is not recommended for everyone. <br /> <br /> For those who are interested in other parts of John Holmes, I would recommend a good alternative to Boogie Nights. <br /> <br /> Sullivan rehabilitation
