People do not seem to give enough credit to Lensman because of it. <br /> Year: This was done in 1984, and Lensman exhibits the most spectacular effects I have ever seen. 80s an early animation lensman is a person who sees most of its use as a computer-generated film during computers. Kim's war against geometric cutter pads in the laser maze can be taken as an excellent example of this. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack: Lensman is one of the most insane soundtracks I've ever heard, and in every corner of this madly crazy beat image. Lensman borrowed heavily on two Western flaws and was the first to deal with the need for a film to be filled in every second of silence with music. When the music was good and the show was a motorcycle bottle at the Theionette Factory on Radixx, the heroine theme failed because Chris's pure irritation was worth it. It is interesting to note that it is noteworthy that the silence available to use as a reference is that it has prevented my efforts in removing the lensman from an analog tape to digital format. <br /> <Western influences: Helmut - sounds like "helmet" and have the same voice about Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairbourn - the same hairstyle as the princess of SW and is suspicious of her name Transformers' Marisa Fairbourn. The ship takes over the role of Han Solos that flies and has some technical expertise. Buzkirk - perfect improvement over Chebica. Lens - a nice concrete copy of energy that comes across a lesser chance of preaching Christianity at the audience than in the original SW. While energy is more dependent on conversion than concentration, the lens is a pure concentration tool. Theoretically, anyone can have a lens. <br /> <br /> Technology: The Boscone Alliance has interesting meatball sponge ships. They appear as white and white rather than stamtroopers. Good idea if a DNA weapon idea was developed only. The Galactic alliance looked like Starblazers (or whatever it called - 60 series where they were struggling with Xylons). There was not enough ship to defeat the battles for me - it was improved in the second Lensmann movie. <br /> Finally a note on the vorgues. <br /> <br /> This character is the only, very interesting character of the latter's fortunes
