I totally loved the movie. It's funny moments, some hearty parts, all the better. For me, personally, really liked the movie because in the end i was something in my childhood relationship. This film, in my opinion, is more of the young gay population. It shows how to treat a young gay boy during the growing season. I do not remember all the taunting, name-calling, and I will always remember the other young lady guys, and now finally it's a picture that really describes how hard it is to grow gay. So, I will definitely see this movie. It can not really see a person until it is old enough to mature enough to understand it
