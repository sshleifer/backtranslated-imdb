Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and included James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Leman. And Ernie Cuckus. The film was added to James Stewart and Kim Nouak on their second screen (after Alfred Hitchcock classic Vertigo, the same year). Stewart's last film is a romantic lead role, as it is too old to play such a role at the age of 50. The film is about a witch played by a moral fascinated Kim Novak who played by James Stewart. She puts a spell on him and he gets head over the heels of her love. I enjoyed the film and its cast. At the time, the film was a moderate success nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Film Comedy.
