A reviewer does not matter what Wells actually says or does, he moves you. I agree. He and a unique power in the film. More than a triple threat to acting, directing, and directing, he has an intellectual-minded intellect. At the earliest he could think of whether he was a painter. This film will definitely support that view. A musician, an actor, a descendant of Shakespeare? It is difficult to say but I am very grateful for his time with the cinema and he captured him in the film. I like the voice. I like face, size, style, mind and games. I love all of my movies and think more. I especially love how the other actors interact with him. Many are never better or worse with him, because he is definitely there. Even when his beauty is destroyed, he can not be ignored, and he makes every scene a beautiful blonde in Rita - a Lana Turner look alike but perhaps also beautiful and then goes to the eye Wells and another greetings for another minute, another movie, in his house Another hour. We all want that we can come on the lost scraps that we cut from all the movies, because the time we know is not valuable in our time. Look at it and thank you for the opportunity.
