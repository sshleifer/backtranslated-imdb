Most good Canadian actors headed to the southern frontier and (I guess) filling all second ranks of upper divisions and leaving the bodies for sex comics. The film was a real surprise: Though Farsus had a typical distinctive plot, the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their roles, and we got the real suspension of the viewer's return. <br /> <br /> When you come out of the music video, you believe that it is possible when it comes to the expelled police. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of good sexual abuse then get out (Canadian or not). And big surprise, this sex farce loads itself with some good nudity.
