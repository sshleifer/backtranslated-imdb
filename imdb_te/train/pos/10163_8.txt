This is a good story ... it's at a good speed and all the characters have grown cooler. <br /> <br /> I've seen all of the movies in the last two weeks and this is best. <br /> <br /> Although it is very small, it's very early on. /> <br /> This romantic comedy might be and I do not like it, but the overall design is really cool in all forms, writing, directing, performance, sound. <br /> <br /> <br /> The film reached a high point from all the pictures I've seen lately - the rest of the big budget or the most promoted. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do you have a good job?
