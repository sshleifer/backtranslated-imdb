Charles Boyer is considered to be Spanish, and he came to London to buy coal in the 1945 film "Confidential Agent" starring Lauren Baucal, Katina Paxtina, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer Louis Denver, and everyone ended up stopping him except Bachelor. His papers are stolen, he is in the murder case but he is determined to obtain coal for his people so that they can fight with the fascists. <br /> <br /> This film is good and not good. It is high for the weather and suspense and it is very entertaining. The beacel is very beautiful, Boer is passionate, Pakshinu means, Lorre is soft, Hendrix is ​​curious, and Seymour is terrifying. <br /> It's not as good: bakale English and Boer Spanish. Uh, no. Boyer is also excellent in his role with the wrong accent, but Basel is not 100% American, British elite. These two are not chemistry. Conclusion: Bakal is somewhat wrong. Her acting is not a loss; She is good in other films. <br /> <br /> "Don Seymour steals the whole picture as a hotel guest that studies human nature, a great piece and his performance Sure, other actors are not good, it's not only small parts but small actors, Seymour is not a small actor.
