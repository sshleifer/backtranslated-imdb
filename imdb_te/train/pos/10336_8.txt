This one is tough to see - says a pre-reviewer. It takes into account the horrible images that came after WWII - especially Dachau's "redemption". In the midst of the battle, we know what happened to the Jews. If a virtual newspaper (based on the Nazis liked to record their atrocities), the order to show "transport" is clear. Knox is nice. He made charts in a Nazi career. When it first contradicted other German counterparts, the first time laughing at Hitler, ultimately, finally helpless. On the contrary, however, we believe that a young Nazi official is "exchanging" the anti-Nazi attitude. It witnessed many attempts against Hitler, particularly the Stappenburg plot, which occurred as the film. A sturdy film that accurately predicts the Nuremberg trials and others after the war ends, effectively using the flashpes.
