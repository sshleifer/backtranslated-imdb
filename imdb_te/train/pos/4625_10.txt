Shakespeare Behind Bars is the most surprising and delightful film I've ever seen. I'm telling you somewhere about a jailbreak in California, the prisoners have been performing and performing different Shakespearean plays each year for the last 14 years. The film follows from their performance "The Tempest" from acting, and in this process we learn pretty much about the many crimes. The truth is not true than fiction - if someone tries to convert this story into a fiction film, the audience will never buy it, but knowing it's true makes it breathtaking - literally; When I learned about a particular criminal offense, I was out loud. It sounds like some loopy episode of Oz, and more entertaining characters and their bizarre stories are real.
