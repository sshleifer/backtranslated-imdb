The appearance of an American Jean Kelly in Paris. Jean singing goes through Paris under any circumstances. Some are absolutely imposing, others are pure corn. Before the "Sing in the Rain", the film can be imagined what Kelly has done just as a year. He is perfect for all time greatness. Interestingly, both of these films, particularly Kelly's characters, seem to be parallel, one of the main difference in Paris is the LA in terms of Leslie Karen's performance. Cyd Charisse, perhaps for the role, was able to do better, but Karen was very reliable and Kelly chemistry. The Oscar Levant's little role in this film gave it just what it requires, no one does not look like Jean Kelly. <br /> <br /> Songs and dance routines are all perfect. At the end of the film, Overlong Ballet is even better than that. Looking back, there is not much time for such a loving relationship to be trustworthy, Minnely may seem like you spent four hours with this sequence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You will find this movie with Sainan. <br /> <br /> The curious performance of Debbie Reynolds was not approved by Cejin. <br /> Complete recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars.
