Once I was in college and when we had an international fair there was a Soviet era poster in the Russian section "You're Bolt!", Which means "no gossip!" I translated "Generation" as "Generation" as "Generation"! <br /> <br /> However, when you find gossip results in speech. Snafu short "rumors", you see that you are not too laughing. In this case, the uninviable soldier is bombarded and is expected to immediately attack Axis Powers in the United States. So he says who he is, someone tells you, someone tells you, and it will continue. "The Russians are coming and the Russians are coming," this story goes out of proportions every time, so when it comes back to Snape ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, this is largely a WWII campaign - full of an insulting word for the Japanese - but I've been doing it. Snuff Shorts are actually very funny. Of course, since they have provided Doctor Sass and Mel Blanc voices, it is not surprising. Visibility.
