Jim Belushi "Twilight Zone" is amazing as "Average Joe" gets her 15 minutes. A magic potion to bring about changes in the life of the balloons: not only listening to Baluchi's "story", but Michael Kane, the mysterious bar tender "all" for all of Balushi's middle class issues. <br /> <span> 15 years old, who was responsible for his high school baseball team's championship defeat. Belushi goes with his "pitiful life", seemingly happy, but always wondering "what if ..." For many days, Belushi experiences a "different" life, one of enormous success, admired and hated by others <br It's not "It's a Wonderful Life", but some things are the same and are very lovely. The "end" is speculative, but still satisfying. Look for a very young Cortney cocks as part of a bit of "lethal attraction" - like the other woman. Very fun movie!
