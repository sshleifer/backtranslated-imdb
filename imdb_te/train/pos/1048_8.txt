For Muslim women in Western Africa, the life of married couples will be very difficult. Society may not openly accept such behavior, but equally, they may not be ready to see it as criminal, and of course it will allow it to continue. Fortunately, the letter of the Comorian law promises to be equal to everyone, the documentary that exploits the real life of many women practitioners in the Cameronian judicial system, who seek to attain justice for many women and children. If a case is actually purchased, despite the absurdity of the courts, the courts are actually progressive progressive (except the Applif Central Story). The program also gives a lovely insight into the entire Camorian life-style, which is amazingly emotional and delightful (apart from terrible crimes committed in cases) compared to those living in Europe or North America. I agree that this comment can deceive me with the innocence, and this attitude can be seen in the happiest pidgin-English spoken. Overall, this is a wonderful little picture, and it is quite fun to watch than you can imagine.
