Simply watching this movie on DVD and the acting is pretty cool, but most of the stories are all too desirable. In the Needle Park or Drugstore cowboy, the film has the same look and panic look. Strongly believe that humans believe in this kind of lifestyle; <br /> <br /> Their total existence depends on the underworld in society, with the use of drug abuse, crime, violence, sexuality, and any self-respect for anyone or anything. <br /> <br /> Wall Kilmore is the best in his role as the former porn star John Holmes. Support cast is just fine. However, it is a dark, dark, disturbing and discouraging film. The murder is cruel, but the daily lives of these people are cruel. If you're interested in these murders or are John Holmes's "fan", this is not a movie to really see. If you want to see a document-drama on murder, Cold Blood is better in the 1960s of Truman Capote, starring Scott Wilson and Robert Blake.
