One of my favorite movies from time to time. Just beautiful, human emotional full, wit, humor, intelligence. <br /> <br /> As the protagonist, the lesson of life, in many ways, becomes a fantastic film. <br /> <br /> The cast is also excellent ... The best British talent around is a great choice. <br /> <br /> Italy has loved everything for each different element of the film. <br /> <br /> Italy should be one of the most romantic places to create such a story - everything about this film works. <br /> I love it :)
