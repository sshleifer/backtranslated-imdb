It's amazing that many people have not seen this little gem. <br /> <br /> When I was 12th monkey and fight club performance, I worked hard for Brad Pitt. ) But his acting in the film as a mental film is endless, dark and right. <br /> <br /> In this film, everyone has made spectacular performances and increases the film's slow and intentional pace. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps 10 from my book is that the end is quite a bit and longer, compared to the previous one. <br /> If you check this image, try to get a non-registered directory cut for the best viewing option.
