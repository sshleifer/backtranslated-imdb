Like other people who commented on "Fräulein Doktor" I stumbled upon the chance on this little gem on Late Night TV without hearing it before. The original mix of a pulp fiction story about a sexy non-mercurial anti-heroine with one hand and a realistic and well-researched character in the fences on the other hand has first struck me. <br /> <br /> For me it was one of the five best films about WWI (others "Quiet in the Western Front", "Glory Paths", "Gallipoli" and postwar "La Wei and Riève d'Orre"). And the scene for the toxic gas attack is really chilling; Horses and men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masks. <br /> <br /> I wish I had made the film tape.
