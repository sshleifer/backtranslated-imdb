This movie is not great, but it is a good and enjoyable one. It feels like a indie film made in a drama script. Morgan Freeman primarily plays his role, though the script written for him is not written. And he is a little sarcastic of the actor who goes on a supermarket to do research for a movie he has not yet committed. <br /> <br /> "It's a picture that inspires the viewer in the direction of their own lives and going on." Bottom line: A good little movie made primarily by two actors and some additional, dialogue driven, two weeks, makes Morgan Freeman look good :)
