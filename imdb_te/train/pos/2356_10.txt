Daisies are excellent performances. Dead Like Me and Wonder Falls can tell you that Bryan Fuller is created. I will be annoyed by those who do not love such as theater, film, musicals and love. It's not a typical television program and a lot more for the wonderful ones. These people feel a little more linear and mute tone to be happy. The program brings color, old movie scenes, amazing music and talented performances. There is nothing random about the options made from leitmotif from clothing. The story takes a lot of turns and turns but conversations are based on love, honesty, courage, losses and many things that we face every day. Daisies have been abandoned because only the unfortunate show performance is over and moved. Do not get it as a regular TV show. Think like an evening in the theater, then sit back and enjoy!
