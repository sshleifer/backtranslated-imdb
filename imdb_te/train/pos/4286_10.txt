The 1980 film Montr√©al International Film Festival (which is the English title "Who's Singing Over Their?"). It then won raves ... and disappeared. A terrible shame. It's brilliant. Sublime, ridiculous, sad, and very funny. This script is the work of art. It was 19 years old and I saw only some funny stories (or other genre of the subject) that fits its realism.
