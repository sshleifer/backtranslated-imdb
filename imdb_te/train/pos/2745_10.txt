I have seen a lot of great pictures, but 'in cold blood' is a class. It is superior in each section. The fact that you have big stars helps you push it above as the name on the marquee rather than pay close attention to the characters and their story. Blake and Wilson Killer duo turn on stellar performances. Most of the films are filmed in real-life areas, and in addition to a lot of home, add extra chilled. Black / white photography moods the mood and photography is amazing. There are many outstanding cinematographic works, but if I can only vote for a list, it probably will be in "cold blood".
