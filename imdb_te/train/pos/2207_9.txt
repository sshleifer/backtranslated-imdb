Not really bad about this movie. I initially did not impress it but quickly rose to me. I like it a lot and I think it's a shame that many people in the past can not see the fact that some areas are banned, one of those mine. The film will release in Shock, Gore and Weather. Score is a beautiful piece of a suspense distribution tool. It looks like one of the best composers in Chris Young's business. While some films have little wood and effects are very truthful and insecure, the film is a little too high. All of this is highly appreciated for a good slasher movie in my book. The film's popular reviewer P. V. In some reviews I have seen a serious film that was shot in the shot. And I will ask: what's wrong? It's great to keep a classic shot and the identity of the killer to be as scary as any good fan of the genre. The only thing that stops this movie to get the top marks in my book is that the surprisingly twist (the killer is revealed) is not maintained more attention, I mean great performances happen quickly kind, though it's just reliable. Aside from the pranks (I prefer the original title) it's a shame and it's a shame to knock it into the cheap piece of garbage. It is more than that, but some know as it seems to have gotten lost in the fog of the early 80s slasher. What a shame ... its good picture people! Trust me
