I like this movie. It has an excellent chemistry between the actors and the story of the missing son, who is a pretty universal story. The best thing to do is to have more than just a theme for the bathroom house story. As the father's son tells the story of his wife's family in the northern deserts of China, the element of water and bath becomes almost sacred ritual. Water was very low, had a normal bathing depth and meaning. <br /> <br /> The whole film is very effective. There are moments, however, when it is verged on "too much" sweetness ... the cloying border during the park recital sequence. But overall, I highly recommend this film.
