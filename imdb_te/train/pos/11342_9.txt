I use Pufnstuf every weekend when I was 10 years old. It is after Bay City Rollers. I've come to a Family Family Channel and then recorded it for my three-year-old daughter. <br /> <br /> When I was young, I forgot all things like magic flute, zoom broom, decoration of Witchcraft. <br /> <br /> This program is decidedly low tech. The mayor is surely Meyer McChee's before and everyone is stuffed with the annoying googly eyes. But children love this stuff. They watch the way, the way to work a soak puppet rather than sit in front of an individual high-tech computer animation. There is a slapstick, but adult themes and children, such as sexual or people's death, accept Jimmy's plans. Kids want to take a smoker bag around, thinking that their house is good for convincing fire, and every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky, I thought she was flying overhead. Music is old, but you really use it, and my daughter really liked it. She used to sing in her car "different, different isolation". <br /> <br /> My daughter saw this show in a day spent at least 5 months, and this is one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I'm in the new Pfunstf 2000 works. I really do try to keep their old flavor and nothing like computer animated characters I think I love Pufnstuf the whole new generation.
