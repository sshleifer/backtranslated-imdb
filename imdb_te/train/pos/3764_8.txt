Well, I agree - I'm a goof-ball and I love the occasionally silly comedy. When I see more pictures by Grussawa, Bergman and Truffaut, I realize that if anyone realizes it, I'm still a soft place for dopey comedy, trying to be sophisticated but fun. Immediately start the revolution with some films Monte Pittan and Holy Grail, YHF, ME, Strange Brew and Bill and Ted movies. <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is not as spectacular as the original Bill and Ted movie, which is still quite fun. In addition, it is not the original, it improves the recurrence view. I did not love the movie for the first time I saw that all other films had the highest standard of laughing. But every time I see again, I am surprised at great times - especially those involved in Grimm Reaper. And, by the way, this Reaper is different from Bergmann's Seventh Seal as you can get !! Besides laughing, the film has some amazing music - it's actually better than the first film. At the end of the kiss song is great but there are also other hard rock voices - you can not kill the old like de Nomollos. Great view for kids and adults alike.
