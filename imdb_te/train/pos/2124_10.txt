It's a classic movie in its story, acting, and film shows. The greatest actors are the whole characters, Miss Sullivan, and Jimmy Stewart's main characters. She admired her in real life and liked Jimmy, gave her first acting roles and helped her get more calm with her performance on the set. Between these two "chemistry" is always clear, and is happy to feel warm and enjoyable. She is a beautiful, young woman, and so sweet in her personality films. The story of the two teenagers is pretty good to see how they ultimately fall apart, and pure magic entertainment. Heart warming shows are also provided by other supporting actors in this amazing story / film. I want to give Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 at this whole Golden Age movie classic, a special attraction for all generations. All must see!
