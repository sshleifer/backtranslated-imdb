Many people in our life have to meet only once in our lives, but for some reason or we should remember the rest of our lives. These lifetime friendships are once among the most distant people and there are some natural reasons why we should not mix these people. We do not always know their names, we have never submitted to each other, and sometimes we forget to ask for their names. This is how ordinary humanity occasionally makes friends and we like to keep it back, because the reunion damages profusive memories, or we do not know. <br /> <br /> The movie 'Before Sunrise' was found by me. I never saw it, but the discussion between the couple was interesting because I checked the rest of the movie. I do not know what I expected from it, but the young couple did not. They came in time to talk with each other until sunrise and anything else before they could be separated. I believe this movie will have good reviews because everyone on this planet has lived at least once or twice. We can think of all the people we met only once in our lives.
