I've used this video and last night I'm looking at it. Acting began to be very bad (hey - hey-- twister) but it is good after wards. The tornadoes seem to be very fake, and most of the CGI effects are very slick, but the fence around the scenes is flying around and absorbing, so that the images are similar to twister-like images. The scene of the devastation has done very well. The story is well written, and it looks like the old old "catastrophic principles" of the genre have survived in the 30 years since the film was flaky. <br /> <br /> Film FX and acting quality have a very weird mix, this is a great deal in my book.
