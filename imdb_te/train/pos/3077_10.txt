I missed the entire season of the show and started looking at the ABC website in the summer of 2007. I'm totally silly about the show. I think the whole cast is amazing. This is one of my favorite shows. I checked the ABC program lineup for this fall and did not see it in the schedule. Really sad. I think Bridg Moannah is going to be back to her baby ... maybe they are waiting. Or is it my willful idea? <br /> <br /> "I'm sure ABC will review its decision, or hopefully choose another station.
