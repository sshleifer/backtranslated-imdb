I'm not a huge fan of martial arts movies, but the video shop is almost empty and I'm on Jet Li Lethal Weapon 4 and when I rented other movies I rent it is free when I rent it. Amazingly Kung Fu spent half an hour after making sounds and throwing Bermat Shurikenes at each other. My dear and my (22 year old biochemistry and accountant students I can not explain it (perhaps a little technique) I always end up with Bruce Lee, the red blade, the big hitting, the defeat him, the big cushions etc. Jackie Chan is a little less comedy and more action Think.
