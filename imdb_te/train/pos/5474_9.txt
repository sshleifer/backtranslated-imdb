The National Gallery of Art lost its original uncut version of the work for a long time on July 10, 2005. It has recovered important scenes cut by sensors after it was released. Cobbler's character, a moral lovely-lovely person in the 1933 original sensor release presented here as a follower of philosopher Nietsze and argues her to use claw men to paw her way. Moreover, as the current VHS reforms eliminate the original uneven ending that I feel, it will be restored to its original look. Excellent picture of seduction and power. Hopefully, the film is reprinted on DVD to greet its great features. Look for it.
