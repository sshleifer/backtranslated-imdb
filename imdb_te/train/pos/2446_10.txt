The show is right there from the beginning of Carmen. She is one of the best characters. Why did they leave her? Performance is not the same before. <br /> <br /> The best parts are with Carmen. You can not replace anyone from the beginning! It's like without South Park without Kyle or Child without Chile! This is not correct! She's just a niece in place, ugh! Awful. She is not fit for all the storylines. She is one of the main characters, and the niece can not replace her. She is a wonderful actress. A better way than a nanny. Get her back, or you lose a ton of viewers.
