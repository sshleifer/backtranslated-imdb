The hottest smart and talented filmmakers by Hook or Crook, is a fantastic novel from Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They managed to tell a real story in a distinctive motion picture style, and it was pretty portrayed ont. Romantic, and excellent writing - truly poetry. <br /> <br /> The main characters act as real heroes and a rare kind of model / motivation for everywhere Bachch Dix and Tranames. This film has a lot of energy, a very sharp hobby and an unbalanced San Francisco heart. I can not recommend very well! <br /> The best Bach Buddy movie of all time!
