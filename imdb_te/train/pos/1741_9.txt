This word is a dramatic picture of the whole sense. It tells a tail that lives in a normal life in everyday life without knowing how sad it is in Greece. Sure it's some extremes .. But now real real life mourns over art. There are serious criticisms of the goals we continue and the entire social structure is built around them. The film has a deep understanding of Greek life styles, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek films that have a lot of fast food-mainstream viewers, this is not particularly targeted at anyone, but when you're looking for someone thinks that you're putting the best words and images to explain your feelings. I'm not a big fan of traditional music, but I do not want anyone to hear when I play in the movie. <br /> If someone told me I told you about this film, I felt that the transition between scenes was sometimes suddenly or somewhat cut. <br /> <br /> I am able to write more on my opinion, but I guess I have to see it. And talk with a friend. Must see
