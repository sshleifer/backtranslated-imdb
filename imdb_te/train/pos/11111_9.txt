Sopranos is probably the most mind-opening series you'll ever want to see. It's smart, it's funny, it's funny - and many people have a Mafia style to resist watching. The best of the characters set in the underground world of New York crime families is the best in this program. For a long time, you do not know whether someone behind you really intelligent guys stirred, or buy them a meal. <br /> <br /> Increasingly, the depth of their personalities is to add more to the original approach of the characters in this program - this is a very dangerous person, many of them are murderers, but if you do not even love them, God will do it. I laughed at their senses, felt they were torn after making a verdict wrong, and feared with the utter impatience of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> The suburban setting of New Jersey is perfectly suited to the subtitle of this show - people are not always visible, and in contrast to the actions taken by the involvement of minor offenders, there are also different developments. <br /> If you do not already have, you should be very sure.
