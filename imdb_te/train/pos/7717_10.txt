I loved this film all my life. It's also a brilliant story, there are plenty of traditional references. Eg. The missing ship decades ago is called Bellerophon. Well, the legendary beast with two or more animals in a traditional mythology is a man who killed the shimmer. In FP, Walter Pidgeon apparently chimera-himself and his Id monster. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <br /> <p> > Cheers
