52-pick up never got the respect to be it. It works on many levels, and there is a complex but plausible plot. Actors give some of their finest performances. Ann-Margaret, Roy Scudder, and John Glover play full roles and provide deep color images. Vanity is the most prominent actress in her career, and she has to run as a serious acting career, and Kelly Preston, Carrie Preston, for a few days. Anyone who likes to act with a sunny and complicated story will enjoy it.
