"What do you do?" The weeks after seeing the emotional Brokedown Palace is a question that will stick in your mind. If Alice (Danes) is telling the truth or not - you have a problem that you have not resolved, and you can come back if you say it correctly. It is a well acted and beautifully portrayed film. While it is slow, its pace reflects the story line - but most image will be on the edge of your seat; The desire to know what will happen next. The end also leaves you imagining the shoes of the main characters, which are brilliantly portrayed by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is also good.
