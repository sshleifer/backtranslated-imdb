A powerful spectacular picture. You have been subjected to death-after being allowed to take part in your story. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadley), was trapped in the life crisis of his career with his family. He notices his former college charm Charlie Phiman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the clue. He has lost his wife and family in a 9-11 attack in America, with Charlie, not really close to the facts ... he chose to include his favorite music from past and video games. Former colleagues will reinforce their friendship and support their previous relationship. Johnson had a friend of his friend Angela Okhurts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist who could bring Charlie out of his friend ... but Alan is forced to leave his friend from his darkest darkness. Jada Pinkett plays Smith Johnson's wife. The writer and director Mike Binder plays Charlie's lawyer / guardian. Also in the cast: Kunqua Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adel Model and Robert Klein. Best Soundtrack featuring the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pierre Jam and Pretenders. <br /> I never saw Sandler fan; But I found him the best in this role. In some scenes, I wondered how ... singer / songwriter Bob Dylan never asked why to play in a biopic.
