This film is awesome. This movie is inspirational. The director, Lucy Walker, the characters are fully developed by the truth. I highly recommend what I see for a particular image of humanity in humanity. Lucie Vallekar shows the beauty of nature. This movie man vs. Nature and sometimes man vs. Refers to the true example of man. The inner crisis and success is excellent in its case. It is interesting to see how Tibetans view blindness as a symbol of demons. The film will broadcast on a particular culture that has never been performed. Lucy Walker gave a voice to Eric Weinannier, who was not generally heard. Thank you Lucy to make your vison true to filmmaker.
