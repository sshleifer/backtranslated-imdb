First say the show is the first level when John Ritter is there. After his death, the show was somewhat diminished, but the producers did not participate in the program, James Garner and David Slade were included in the regular cast from 2003 to 2005. <br /> <br /> The exhibition centers around the Hennes family, Paul (John Ritter, who can rest in peace), his wife Kate (Katie Sagal), their daughters Bridget (Kale Kuko), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and their son Rory (Martin Spazers). When in the ritter show, with laughter (I'm proud to accept it), but now he's gone, and occasionally smile with a heartfelt laugh. <br /> <br /> Ritter's role is very good, I am very glad that after the premature death of Ritter I fell for the show's transformation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] He is always bossing girls around about dating, but he really wants to be happy. The ultimate Daddy boyfriend hates entertaining. <br /> <br /> Katie Sagal is great, and she also loves the character. After Ritter's death, she believes that her character is shaping the lives of Quaoku, Davidson and Spazers, as she and her friends are friends until the end of her life, but not only her children. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The funniest person in the program played by Britney Henness, Kaley Cucoco. She is the ultimate blonde: gorgeous, slow, dimmer, yet she is a wise person. She is on the wall of her innocent 'blonde' comedy, and how lucky she is. <br /> <br /> Amy Davidson Ted may get a tortured Todd, but the purpose of her character. The only mistake of the program is that Kerry does not really show anything to be happy. <br /> <br /> <br /> She is always there after Bridget, where she feels she is thrown there. <br /> <br /> When Martin Spangers is a hysterical, and ritter show as a son of single Hennes, he is the most comic artist. Following Ritter's death, the show provided some of the rhetoric for Rory. <br /> <br /> David Spade and James Garner do not laugh at the occasional storytelling for the role of CJ, Spade. <br /> <br /> For all, I gave this presentation a great review, because a great performance has caused a tragic event to cripple. You will enjoy it. <br /> <br />
