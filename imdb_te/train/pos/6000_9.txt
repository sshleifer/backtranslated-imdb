Kristin Watts (Molly Weeks) breaks up, her boyfriend does not; She has lost her past and lost her love. She hires a stranger (Douglas Davies) and gives her things to fix her mistakes. <br /> <br /> The first impression of "The Cure" is the stylish cinematography that changes black and white colors. The short and sharp screenplay can develop love's tragic and dark story with an unexpected plot point in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is slightly loud and the fact that English is not my native language, a few moments I need to repeat some words whispered by the narrator. Unknown mainstream actress has an amazing appearance and very beautiful. I hope I have a chance to see again on screen. Last but not the director and author Ryan Geoffrey's first good. My vote is nine. <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
