There are very few movies that are so funny. I was lucky enough to watch this film at a theater "reserve" for film buffs like me, so it was not sitting down awkward where my laughing sat down until my throat was completely throat and my shirt sleeves were all wet since my eyes were drying ... <br> <br /> <br /> At this point the story is a bit "slow", but it's the best - amongst some boat boat (I almost dropped out of the seat Ndi ...) is very welcome.
