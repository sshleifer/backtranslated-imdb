A true story of a group of jockeys who stole an honest businessman like drugs, jewelry, guns, money. Some people say that peace and free love in the majority of eight people are saddened by the sixties drugs and AIDS collapse. Honestly, this is only a continuous target of those who are constantly living. What is the second part of their master plan? Once they have his stuff ... they will sit around and get up again. Great plan. Even if you do not know the story, the film does not have any suspense and no wonder. From these characters, from Cock's heroes to party scenes and their exploitation, Cox makes some effort, weak and insulting. This story is more straightforward. As it is, this is just a tragic story for small-time drug dealers getting big-time drug dealers killed. The big story, in more than one way, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. The film should be about his life and his life. <br /> Surprisingly, he is one of the miracles. Although it is not official, Boogie Knights is a good form of Holmes's life. This is not entirely true, but it is very enjoyable.
