Urban cowboy actually argues on how anyone, and still, for the duration of the best documentary of Texas life. Consider the following: Men beat their wives and drink at night bars, fight in the fight, commit adultery, and compete on mechanical bulls. Try and name a picture that clearly describes real life. They will not make them anymore. It's always about the current movies with our money, they live in huge houses, expensive cars will not drive and work. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'll watch at least once a week. No funny. From the end of this film I have broken down. Feel free to email me to learn more about my reason to call it a documentary. Let's look at the following scenes: Bud Sissy sees - he breaks up - he honors honks and waves, she's fling the bird to him - he returns half the peace in half the honking his horn to add tear-off effect. Buds Mom calls him roughly. After 18 o'clock in the town, he sleeps with his uncle and aunt (x2), who has drunk all of his accomplishments and his cousin to see if he still has a job. <br /> "You live like all the pigs" Think of why this scene is needed. Think about it. Is it necessary? Do not recognize it without dirty drowning? <br /> I love her. Wes kicked the trash from her husband and then only a few days (or the next day). Steve asks - hey Sissy, remember Wes? Oh yeah, you can not defeat my husband the other night, so let's take this lesson goin ', then referring to the fact that she wants to comfort him during a buddy and Sissy's many struggles. <br /> <br /> Take the wedding reception picture session Humanity!) They can at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way. <br /> <br /> At the end, do not keep these scenes in a picture to try and portray the underlying psychology of psychology. This is a documentary in real life. <br /> <br /> I only wish that the director's cut is there.
