This film is amazing ... It laughs me up, making it a ball, and it's all talking to most animals! This film should be viewed by people of all kinds! This is one of my favorite films, and I have commented about it so much love! It has a very hearty feeling and an amazing storyline, this is a great and heartfelt image! My favorite character is shadow. This is because I think he is very interesting and fascinating. I have a golden retriever like shadow, I miss him so much !!! He is my best friend and I know he will be in a happier place when he dies, but I miss him all my heart !! I loved this film and everyone should have it! No matter what your pets are doing, they are protecting them forever !!!
