Well, I do not consider Police Story the best film of Jackie Chan. The plot, combat scenes and stunt works are excellent. In the film, Jackie himself was a police officer known as Chan ka kuy (in some versions Kevin Chan), who successfully arrested a criminal. After the crime was released, he created Chan to kill a police officer. Because of this, he wanted the police. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lynne), the criminal secretary, went to shopping mall to steal the evidence of criminal charges from her computer and send them to Chan. However, the criminal owner wanted Salina to download her criminal record and wanted to capture her relatives. Later, Chan appeared in the scene, defeating him, defeating them and defeating each other. In the last scene, Chan saw the offender Lord. Finally, this is the best action and comic movie. Everyone should see it. Highly recommended.
