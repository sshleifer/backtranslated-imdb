It is the second of 6 "Classic Tarzan" films starring Johnny Weashellr in the title role and Maureen O'Sullivan Jane. <br /> <br /> As always, this is a fantastic picture of the series. And "in the middle" with a breakthrough showing the development of cinema from the early 1940s to the 1930s. Similarly, a good pace is shown, although not as good as the next one. Also, cinematography was less successful in the series than later Tarzan films. The stock I saw was of unparalleled quality, some garage scene and some under-exposed and over-exposed scenes. Then there is no crisp performance of Tarzan films. On the other hand, a scene, very soon, in which a camera's jerky movements that are moving behind the camera behind the camera, forward to the Safari men who walk in the forest, are almost really about its modern <br /> <br /> The plot is an interesting feature, She's absurd and reflexive, she's flirting for Martins. Kiss? And Jane's stunned, and partly guilty, response ?? In the future we also saw Jane's earlier in these films. For example, a son in Tarzan! Jane's counterfeit acts hang Tarzan and deliver the boy to his family. Later she agreed to Tarzan that she was wrong. Here, there is nothing quite clear, but we have returned to Jane "Zen Parker", and in the most repentant acts, bringing Martin and Harry to the evening gown to get away from Tarzan. /> <br /> In this view, there are total shots and scenes that have me specifically shot. <br /> <br /> For one thing, Tarzan's domestic life is here, and is always a combination of sensual experiences with the possibility of near violence. <br /> <br /> This is a great deal for me in the main part of Tarzan experience. <br /> <br /> By today's standards I am also surprised by the most violent sequences. <br /> <br /> The scenes that gave me special pleasure: Tarzan Elephants Elephants led the elephants in the valley of the Grevyar; Tarzan was saved from water death by hippo and then drowned in health by monkeys; When Jane and other men are trapped at the Escarpment, the cheetah Tarzan is discovered; Leopard crosses the river on the log. The final war scenes of savages and lions on earth and savages and trees on the monkeys. Jen, she tells us that Tarzan's world is now really, and she shows volcanoes to fire the lions. <br /> <br /> The final series of scenes is amazing: suddenly in Tarzan scene, the savages were shouted out of the trees, taking responsibility for the lions, and calling for the defense of the elephants! Tarzan's triumphant success, catching Hawne Jane in his hands, with a dance and cheetah along with them, as a symbol of the movie and a really good summation of Tarzan and Jane's story. <br /> All in all, this is another fantastic classic Tarzan movie. I strongly recommend this film to anyone.
