<br /> If it's 200,000 thousand or two million, does it make a difference? Sometimes I'm angry at very few indifferent (very large LOUD) Americans, but remember that many of us here do not ignore anything outside their comfort zone. We are helped by what we have done. After the relative comfort of Native Americans, and the apathy towards the horrors of a racial slave, we have developed the hearts and souls in the late 60s and early 70s. But it's okay till now that we only end up with our ends. How can we see any other dictatorial and fierce government and think we're doing something better to impose our will? We're hostile and hypocritical, and I'm ashamed for this. I'm suffering from the affected people. They need to get justice and their homes back.

There is no one on the law. I want my country back, and Chagos Islanders do it. People do not want to leave their birthplace to their bombs and heliports in their heart without posting people from ignorance of their computers. We are forced and unjustly removed from our homes and can not get trapped in traffic. "None of us, like Brit and American, are going around this. When we turn our backs on basic prevalence rights and dignitaries in 2000, the simplest, more natural civilization will observe and preserve their rights, and respect all men, when they turn from basic human rights.
