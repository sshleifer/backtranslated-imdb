I do not think this film is for everybody. But I saw in Seattle this weekend and I felt very funny. I did not laughed that hard in a movie in a very long time. I thought the entire cast had done a great job. You are laughing from the first moment in the last scene. I suspect some moviegoers (specifically those who take themselves seriously) will be discontinued by this humor. I'm not. This movie is a real surprise. And the whole theater was laughing across the show that I liked, and I think that many people enjoyed it and would be happy to have a good time in the movies for change. I can not wait to see again! If you're in mood for LOL, it's for you. Funny funny funny funny!
