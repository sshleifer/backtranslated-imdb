The third and final film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear. It is a political film than plain entertainment. Jason Bourne finally finds out and remembers the torture he submitted to kill his old identity: he really killed some of his corpse. But eventually the movie was managed in a Blackfriars program organized by the CIA and revealed in the film, a limited group of people who have eliminated all American citizens who have tried to prevent the rest of society. Who was an important officer of the CIA until 1980 when he became the Vice President? It goes along with what is said on the Internet. Then truth will be thanks to Jason Bourne but the only person who can bring this truth to the main person and the only authority that can make a decision about the CIA gets the woman and the woman in the General Senate. A woman and a senate; Read my lips. USA fought in media in politics and needed two media outlets to promote: music and film. Hollywood and intellectuals, academics and intellectuals are now commonly used by humans, specifically for the salvation of a woman from a woman and the Senate. So go and see the movie. It is pretty fun and has a sweet smell for a while and looks forward to some of the great change and others are looking forward to, but nobody can pretend that it did not: The only point is how deep and intense it will be. <br /> <br /> Doctor Jacques Coulardou, University Paris Dupine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorobon & University Versailles St Quentin Ann Evelynes
