I saw Murder in the newly released Universal Pre-Code set, and I was surprised at how far the vehicle was ending. Most of the other commentators cover this story, a murder mystery, but I want to include some additional notes. Brisson and Carlisle are much smoother compared to many smaller players, and none have the right tone for what they actually do (Carlisle is a trained opera singer, fewer notes). The great Victor McLaughlin and Jack Oakley each run well, and with the awesome sense of time to keep the ball rolling between the musical numbers. Yes, do not forget the great jazz singer Ernst Anderson in the numbers of Lucille Ball and Un-Sheridon Vanities, but "Ebony Rhapsody". Gail Patrick is one of her early performances, a bit like Eve Arden; Patrick was the executive producer of the Petri Mason TV series. Jesse Ralph is the wardrobe wife then - you can even recognize her in David Copperfy (Aunt Peggotti) and The Bank Dick. The music is great - introduction of standard "cocktail for two" brusson in two different scenes; Piotot button cut in the background of "Sweet Marinehana" with the girls (awesome spray of blood on a coarse white skin); Duke Ellington's orchestra and "Ebony Rhapsody", combined with beautiful dancers, both black and white. And I believe that this is one of the only early musical contours of the mixture - and there is nothing to imagine.
