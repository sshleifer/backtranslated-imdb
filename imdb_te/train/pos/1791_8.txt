This is not a deep image; The plot items are pretty imaginable and "interesting and real", but it's a lot of interesting things (some of our "mistakes" that the film calls them) about what we can regret when we look back at our lives. I did not read the book, it was not known long ago, the story of a woman who had strong memories from the time she really did not share with anyone. <br /> <br /> Streep's daughter, Mammy Gummer, plays the role of young Lila, and then Meryl's old movie Leela. The young actress did a great job along with a wonderful comparison (duh!), Perhaps all others were fine in the film, I thought Glenn Close and Buddy's character Allil was very dramatic. <br /> <br /> In this case, how difficult it is to know that really a "parent" as a parent!
