All of the "adult" of today's family movies do not have to worry about that and it is good to see that you can sit back and enjoy a family with your children. Yes, the film may have some verbal words (Knox is playing, but they are not able to hear the full words), but for most people the movie is really pure. Movies from the day back). It's just a great, fun and fun movie to watch with the most enjoyable, one of my favorites, and family. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have to do with this film is very small and I do not want to do any spoilers here because I do not think there might be some more memorable parts here. <br /> All is well documented and looked great; So go out and get children, do some cookies and watch this movie!
