Watching David & Bathsheba is a good way to get your Bible lesson going to school on Sunday. The script is very entertaining despite a script that is timely and fun. The studio system has its shortcomings, but when it calls for a luxury product, it is split apart. Peck King portrayed the role of David as a painful poet to kill the sensitive Batshiba and Susan Heward for bed. Nathan's prophet Raymond Massey offers his usual fun and brutal performance. King Saal and a young Gwen Verdon as a dancer for the silent screen star Francis X. Bushman. Hooray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.
