This is the picture you want everyone to see if you want to see great acting. Mr. Torn and Ms Farrel do an unusual job. I'd like to have it on TV again, so enjoy new audiences. <br /> <br /> It provides you with a realistic feeling that both pioneers have to go both physically and mentally. <br /> <br /> This happened when Ms. Farrell was very young. I always thought about her as a comedian, but it is not exactly humorous and she's amazing. There are very few dialogues, but it seems more real. Mr. Torn is always a great presence and his breath is a great feeling. Watch the movie.
