Well, the recent history of Star Trek is not good. In the next few seasons, Next Generation has deteriorated, the DS9 remained daring, where no one was there before, and Voyager was very bad and never really lived up to its promise. So, when they announce a new Star Trek series, I do not have high expectations. And, the first part, the Broken Bow, has some problems. But overall, it's a tremendous trek material and good romance. <br /> <br /> I have come out of the way first. The early theme is dull and I look forward to regularly sitting, but what's up for the remote. What's really bad is that the entire rubbery scene is a totally grateful lot to take my wife into the room. <br /> <br /> The plot is strong and good. Although the characters, though new, you never see what you expect. Valkals are slightly different than obviously earlier. I especially liked the linguist, though he was the first Star Trek character he could face in the face of death, his fears and fears would have to face. Trekking, they have acted as a significant problem in the past, they have the time to bring us as shields by shooting, with instant innovation in technologies that can solve what, and the inevitable branches of time-travel stories. <br /> <br /> Do you want to start a pool before anyone can see Borg? <br /> <br /> More than anything, this range is very powerful. They see the universe with fresh eyes. We have the opportunity to learn how to look in the next series. How did Klingons go from insult to war? How did we meet the Romans? How did the federation put the land in form and charge just did. Why is the main command important? <br /> <br /> My favorite line: Zephram Cochran said,
