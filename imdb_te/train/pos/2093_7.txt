It's a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes) but it's the most famous Pearl Buck novel. In other words, there is much space to cover. <br /> <br /> It is sometimes soap-walked, but some visual drama events have been cut by a squad attack at the end of the film. It's a surprise to see. The film was about 70 years old, with a specially influential team working on the film. <br /> <br /> Paul Muni and Louise Rainier give two powerful performances in their day award-winning actors and they are not disappointed here. The problem is credible only because all the problems are the fact that Caucasians and some of them do not seem to see Valter Connolly actually. I want to recreate this movie with all-Asian actors, not for PC reasons, but to improve the story.
