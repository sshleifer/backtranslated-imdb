A big-time Prince fan of the last three to four years, I can not really believe I've got a round of "purple rain". The brand new 2-disc anniversary special edition led me to buy. Wow, I'm really looking forward to seeing it, but it's not how hard it is. Prince's musical performances throughout the film are incredibly low - he really has these movements. Classic "Purple Rain" album and all songs are very familiar (from repeat listening), but your perception of tunes and literature will change to see them in the context of the film - the computer virtual, CRY and purple rain itself. There is something hipnotizing about the scenes that the Prince and the Revolution show. The closing tracks BABY show I was brimming with how much power and perfect talented Prince was in the middle of the 20's (he's full of water!) For a STAR and I DY YOU, it blew me away. <br /> <br /> Michael Jackson also appears to be dead in his peak years. <br /> <br /> Prince shows how to win the girl of your dreams. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are 1980s and unexpectedly fun but it adds to the overall appeal of the film. I love this bit of their dance, and how Benton Morris presents Mirror Mid-Performance - Morris Day and the TIME Performance BIRD in Morris Day Black (and Hilarious), and you see Morris Day and Jerome Benton Dasha Minneapolis Funk style fainting. <br /> I could not see it again. The extras are excellent - especially the young Eddie Murphy Pre Beverly Hills Cop accept that he is "Prince Group".
