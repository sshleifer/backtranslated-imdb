I returned from Hong Kong on my summer vacation and saw the ZU Legend. I thought I kicked * s! It is creative and unique. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with very little drama. Some idea is a very special FX (yeah right), you can not complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are great !!! ZU Legend ..... Kicks A * s !!!!!!!!
