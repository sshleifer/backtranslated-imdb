I never thought of the Pet Semetary. When I first saw it, I was a kid, which made this feeling very memorable. But I keep watching it over and over again, it's never been older, and I never bored. From early credits with creepy opening song that ends too chaotic, at the same time is something sad, sad and scary, and it keeps ringing in your head: Sometimes dead is better! <br /> "All you need to know is starting from point A (the most perfect condition for a happy American family) and step by step sink to point B The music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are cool, and the pet semetary is the last place on the planet. Arlu damned dead!
