<br /> <br /> One of the 2 children from 11 to 6 this morning. I have been associated with watching many "children" movies as parents. This is refreshing for me. I did not read this particular book, so I do not know whether it is true or not in the book. But it certainly took a gross factor to a higher level. This is the story of the "new" kid in the town and it just happens that there are a group of children who have arranged the club for the kind and love to pick children .... Sound familiar? We have not suffered this time or another. He has a little brother to stand up and parents are hesitant. I enjoyed a lot of different how each character was different. Bully (why do they always make the bully red head? My daughter has red hair and she is not a bully!). A great bully who learned that his own elder brother had called himself. It took turns and turns and you love them all with love and really find yourself in the routing for all the characters! Even the great relationship between parents, father and son. All around enjoyable, sweet, funny, macro etc ...... Take your kids !!! You're so glad they're doing it!
