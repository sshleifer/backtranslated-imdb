My Personal Opinion The film is not the first story of John Carpenter's vampire, but I do not love it. Joan Bon Jovi (Derek) is great in the film. He is really mad and believes he is a famous rockstar. There are some bad things about this movie. As the story line, the movie storyline should be even more so. The film is a continuation of the film that follows the film, and they must have three major vampire movies. I really liked the clothes that people wear and their setting in Mexico. I loved how old Mexico and new Mexico were not. Clay houses and old fashion churches. I was a little confused with vampires and they were able to walk in churches but how cool they did not follow the Dracula vampire rules.
