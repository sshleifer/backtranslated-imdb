Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by Maverick Samuel Fuller, has a fantastic presentation of double complexity. Subway rider candy (Susan Peters) Pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark Sinatra dipped in cold shades). She does not know that she will carry a valuable microfilm; McCoy does not know it washed away. Both are not recognized by two federal agents. Hence the motion of the motion is in motion. Candy is doubly (skip and police) and therefore doubly innocent; Skip, over confident the small thief, unilaterally unaware, turned to by federal agents; feds, all knowing, and finally helpless. They can not "pass" the public secrets or communism.
