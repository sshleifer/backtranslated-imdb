A strong pilot, this two-hour episode sets the characters and the background for "prequel" for "enterprise" for the original "Star Trek" series. The craft color space strippers never go out of style, and I can already see T'pol snicker references as "Valkon Seven" - but the ensemble looks strongly, the characters are well-matched and the first (later? ) Suggest that this particular band should be more efficient in different ways than the series Continues. Scott Bakula is the captain with Kirk's brashness and daring but without his self-esteem and self-confidence, and I look forward to no ways to have the series engineer, weapons master and communications officer right Captain hits (just a glorified phone operator no longer!) Supporting players. The authors have made a big mistake in "Star Trek: The Next Generation", "Deep Space 9" and "Voyager": Instead of starting with a large ensemble cast and small characters characters, the little core of the characters that can then be added to a few different types - After a dozen sections, I need more kind because I hope.
