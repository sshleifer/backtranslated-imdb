Although she is today very less familiar, Deena Durbin is one of the most popular actors in the 1930s, a renowned teenager and a very respected musical instrument featuring a perky personality. The 1937 was her first major film, and it proved to be a box-office bonanza for Universal Studios. <br /> <br /> Three little girls have their luxurious couple of three daughters who will soon marry their long-picked father-a pious mother, depressing his golden-digger beloved and returning him to their mother. While the story is quite a bit, the script is witty and the expert cast plays well with a screwball touch. Durbin has a lovely voice and attractive personality and the roles of stars such as Charles Winniss√®re, Alice Brady, Lucille Watson, and Mitch Hour are round off. <br /> Gary F.
