The ocean scene is originally made from Akira Kurosawa script, which is actually a lush and warm image. <br /> <br /> Kei Kumay is certainly an old but notorious master as director (especially the massive scenes in the beginning of the film have some terrible acting), but the whole mood and scenery is very enjoyable. Another thing that has not been cast here: Kurosawa has always made the characters see how much they show. <br /> Maybe while shooting is his magic; <br /> <br /> We just lose the owner's eye. <br /> <br /> It is a lovely and sweet picture, but it is no Kurosawa. Expect to be very surprised ...
