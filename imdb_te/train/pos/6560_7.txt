<br /> It's not very expensive, it's the parody of Western paintings. <br /> <br /> The film makes it more unique, it is concentrated around 4 strong and beautiful women, one of them is black, one is <br /> <br /> These are not your usual Western women - they are tough - they are fast straightening . <br /> <br /> The storyline that accompanies the story is unique to Westerns - "You basted my brother - I'm getting you!" <br /> <br /> In this Western, a woman She's sister shot and took revenge on her gang. <br /> <br /> She goes to her old friends from the days of her bank robbery and surrounds her. <br /> <br /> One of them is not really interested in redeeming Rachel's sister, but they have the fact that they are in the town where gold and jewelry are hidden. There are some of the most unacceptable scenes, not much interference, they are ignored, but I'm surprised why they are there. <br /> <br /> The film uses a little bit of cutting, but more than that, this is a good film, failing to recognize the audience that it is. <br /> <br /> One villain of my only frustrated movie "heroines" is apparently straightforward, while others do not reveal sexual attitudes. <br /> 7 Stars
