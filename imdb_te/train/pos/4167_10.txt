The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is a good film. This is Richard Crane and R.G. Armstrong.The music is scary and gives that devilish chill! I liked the effects on the dog and I think the creature looked really cool with his horns, frill part of his neck, and really starred viscous! You do not see horror pictures and devil dog: its good image and I do not think you'll be disappointed because before the hell of hell can find and buy this rare image!
