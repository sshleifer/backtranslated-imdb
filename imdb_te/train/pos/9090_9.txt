The "Hollywood Hotel" is a fast moving, exaggerated, fantastic entertaining musical joke from Warner, which is not sad with sadness. It is only to remember Tinseltown's official theme song - "Hooray for Hollywood." Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer's score have other gems, however, like "I'm Like a Fish Out of Water", and "Silhouette in the Moonlight". The best song number "Let That Be a Lesson to You", in which Dick Powell and the company describe the unfortunate findings they find on "Behind the Eight Balles", meaning the ending of Edgar Kennedy literally damaged. The film celebrates Hollywood glamor and disconnects at once, as it has received many comic mileage from the pompose and ego-menials actors and fake studio officials. Allen Joslin was a publisher press agent, Ted Hayley, manager of Dick Powell, Fritz Feld, a patronous restaurant patron, Mona Marshall's satirical gull Friday, Mable Todd and Hugh Herbert as Goofy's sister as Globe Farrell, Edgar Kennedy Mona's goofy parent. The "racist" element mentioned in another review is Herbert's ten-second bit of black spot during a fake-"Gone With the Wind" sequence. It's in the dubious taste, but when you see only the same footage available in this amazing jazz combo you should not be prevented when you see other delights in the film, including the Benny Goodman Quartet (Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!). The "Dark Eyes" sequence is a bit long and very late, but "Hollywood Hotel" is a gem, well worth your time and is definitely a movie that is considered for DVD release.
