First, it's a brave picture. I can not see it again and understand the comparisons. However, I can not understand the people who trashed this image. I can see how the end comes out seriously but I'd be lying if I did not mention that I wanted to deserve exactly what every guy forced into a sexy woman into sex. On the contrary, it has not resolved or is good, and the movie is not true. <br /> <br /> Never before has anyone ever touched the narrative and sums up the commentary film. I am sure and intently. I am 24 years old. The way the film drags me makes it realistic. People use eye candy and fast paced plot to the forefront, if you ask a long time to focus on a brick on a film base, they lose interest, they break down the build and call it the worst. In fact, it does not have tolerance and comprehension, is not the product of a creative mind like Talia Luzie, and requires good tuning. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson flawlessly exhibited the cramping of self-destruction. I painted her easily with the Maya pre and posts attack, and I rarely saw the change between the two. Many times, like the "youthful" films mentioned in the earlier comment, the effects of rape appear to be manic, suddenly or alarmingly, alone and lifeless. Dawson, in my opinion, preserves many survivors to carry out the balance of action: the existence of lazy in the awakening hours, for the survival (and attention) for the survival (and disturbance), some of the last dead jobs work <br /> <br /> This film is true I thought and finally raped on different sides of the rape. Many people are able to devour the end of the film in the beginning and in the beginning ... I believe this is the face of Maya ... it's not the job ... it's not a vengeance or meaning ... <br /> <br />
