This afternoon we took children to films and I saw Neil Gaiman's stardust and I could say Wow Wow. <br /> <br /> I have seen something that is rare but it's probably a great fantasy movie <br /> <br /> As I've seen before, Neil Gaiman's mistake was even better. <br /> <br /> I have been able to work through the excellent dialogue, which is certainly good, <br /> <br /> I have gone for days about the amazing performance, Charlie Cox is accurate as Tristan, Claire Dines is bright as Yavne, and Robert De Niro The film is almost deeply closer to the pirate Coptic Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Pure happiness brought by humor laughing our loud funny logic is enough to see the first Shrek like the 80s sitcom, and the rest of the film was a great movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects are accurate, t Rue These are LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza but they are exactly what they used to do exactly where they used to distract you into the movie and combine into the perfect story. <br /> What is the story there? What can I say. How often do you come across the story that includes all of the classic fantasy formula episodes that do not come off like another cheap Princess Bride knockoff. <br /> <br /> If there is any good image in the film, it is all about making them all but they are similar to the great enchanting world that survives. Once again, Neil Gaiman did, and he led another bakery to my heart by creating a very beautiful and graceful fantasy world. I did not do anything to live in it and gave me a small compilation. I do not want to end, Storm hits the ground through the whirlpool of the hold and tries to connect the person's Tristan and Yvwines, its fields and valleys, to scroll through the markets and residents to be dangerous and friendly and never. When I read this, I felt that when I read something as Gaiman, The Sandman, American Gods and Coronel read me, because it ended, it ended. <br /> <br /> "I'm undoubtedly the image everyone does not have the same effect but trust me when I say you do not regret the time or money you spent watching this movie,   ది నేను సులభంగా చూసిన మొదటి 5 సినిమాలు ఒకటి మరియు నేను అన్ని వద్ద ఎవరైనా హామీ చేయవచ్చు ఒక ఆత్మ కనీసం అది ఇష్టం ఉంటుంది.
