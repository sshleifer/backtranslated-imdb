This film, like a low budget, is one of the best mental thrillers I have ever seen. If you agree with the lowest budget from the beginning, how much is it to be a good story, how much better the script is to get, and how great the artist is wondering how little money is. <BR <br /> <br /> All the elements of a great image are here. Visuals, while digital shot, are gorgeous in places. The bizarre, dazzling feel of the film is well captured in the scene with the dog speaking, the scene is simply amazing. It's such trippy piece of work, but has not done in a pretentent way, and because of that I have so much respect for this film. It is recommended for anyone looking for something very special and attractive and is different from most repetitive images.
