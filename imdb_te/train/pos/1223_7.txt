One year and a half ago my father told me about the French Doors. I thought I was interested enough but I did not try to find it anywhere. Then about a year ago I remembered that movie and thought "hey why not" and tried to find on the internet. In the end I see a week later I found in the Atom films. I called my father to the computer and said, "Hey Dad I've found the creepy film I told you all the years ago!" He smiled at me and stopped the lights, so it told me to see the black pitch separated from the computer screen and to see it. I started fine ... since then I started to worry. At the end my chair is standing forward ... It has made me jump! I highly recommend you because it is well worth it if you do not see this movie. Even after the fourth or fifth, it is not disturbed. <br /> <br /> Great movie!
