I really enjoyed a reunion! If they had "Hassie" and "Little Luke" I would have rated it a 10. They do not mention where they are today or why they do not reunite. I feel that they are very popular characters and they do not give explanation about their lack of performance. <br /> <br /> However, TNN has enjoyed enjoying the series again! I'm looking for episodes for years and the joy of tapping the entire series (I missed some episodes). Jenny Hanahan
