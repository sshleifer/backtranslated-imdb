Curiosity is the way we reach for beauty. And the subject of this film is stuff made up. <br /> <br /> This particular piece of art may remind us of other films that have come from the director: love, lost (or failure) and hope and confidence and charity. The title of the film (Gershwin's well-known composition) makes the song impossible for them, and we know that no one can judge. For all it's a comedy lightweight and master-of-the-timing (based on the "Bogdanovich Touch" - based on the "Bogdanovich Touch" - based on the characters' appearance and opinions, almost without a line of dialogue with the detectives following the first ten minutes, from the golden age of PB movies Something that has been learned from directors). This is a self-conscious and compassionate film, and a fantastic cast away from the self-bliss and vacuum (some critics have written) and the superb glorious soundtrack (including the "trilogy" of Sinatra), a better place than it was placed on the American film. It is "beautiful in length, not small on length": it is its simplicity and beautiful, beautiful and beautiful.
