This stunning novel of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-noir thriller has all the necessary stuff - the confusing former boxer drifter, alcoholic widow, the former-cap boy turned out of evil desires, and a kidnap plot for Doom. However, the film never crosses the clich√©, but fresh and humorous. All of the performances are fantastic, especially Bruce Dern's character as Bad sleazeball, Uncle Bud. The motion of the film has some uncertainty, which is not intentional or intentional. Highly recommended.
