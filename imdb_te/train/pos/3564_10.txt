{Possible spoilers are coming ... you've forewarned. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite music and cinematic music! (The other is Damon Yankees with Gwen Verdun, Tab Hunter and Ray Wollen), as we all know, sometimes shaking from the stage (not telling about the performances) from the stage. <br /> <br /> Sets are divine, bright and colorful, characters are bigger than life and can not help but love them, and Michael Kid's choreography is absolutely fantastic. (Very happy to know that they used the original Broadway choreographer) <br /> <br /> For all of the film actors, "bounce the ball" (ie, unmatched chemistry). Frank and Marlone also have the conversation with the owner of the oldest permanent floating garbage game in New York and the most subtle stuff - his fever takes up to 104, penicillin. Sweet, Fresh Faced Jean Simmons is perfect for Sarah's role (although it is true that her popping tubes are not as unusual as Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) all cure. Miss Vivian Blaine - Miss Vivian Blaine, who played the Broadway role as Miss Adlide - last but not least Miss Vivian Blaine - whatever is in my list - hot boxer lead singer and dancer ultimately wanted to end Nathan's 14-year-old engagement with her marriage. <br /> <br /> First of all, Kubi and CB to the BS have renewed their Broadway roles as Nelly-Nelly Johnson and Benny South Street. <br /> <br /> Brando is simpler, and if he does not get the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forget it - he has this idea to bring everything to his role as Sky Masterson. "Lak BA Lady" me every time I see him seeing. <br /> Simmons is lovely and enjoyable in her appearance, voice and style that she best suits herself. Not only did you win Sky (or, finally, trust him), but only to help them overcome their gambling, drinking and other sins, and help them live with God. <br /> <br /> "He is very famous for the role of Nathan Detroit, and here he is from Broadway Sam Levine Actor, but Chop Tone Deaf ... Go figure) I really enjoyed the addition of the song "Adelaide" ... Some people want me to sing like that Frankie's cool, ingenious attitude overcame the film's boundaries <br /> <br /> When talking about Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is just perfect in this role.When she asks her from the slang, "Adelaide's Lanth", she's just amazing and she is also my favorite part of the whole movie. Makes ... especially when "Sue Me" cries before and after her again I'm still better than "boolean and peck" "I can not decide if I'm equal to them ... either way, she's stunning as well as that" take your mink back. " <br /> <br /> "We have a lingo about this movie. It is a combination of high class and street accent. They never use "it", "I do" or "it". This is always "it", "I'm" and "it." Overall, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite of all time movies and musicians, and it's one that gets time to watch each time it comes. My only complaint? No "Man to the Mary Today." Now this is a good song.
