It's amazing! Combine photography, editing, cinematography, and music, to transport us to the dangerous side of the tourist area. This is a "slum" experience without getting out of danger. We're right there! Dream sequences and flashback-sequence-ending are latest. It spoke to me. Keep up the good work! One of those genres is God's city. Too - do not laugh! - Comedy, Despertely Seeking Susan. Nice collective types, with great performances by all means. I'm sorry, I also trained the day with the genre, with amazing performances by a team. I had to change the channel in some Gary sequences, but all-in-all, great movie!
