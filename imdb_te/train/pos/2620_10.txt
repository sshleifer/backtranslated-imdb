What a pleasant surprise: a Disney DTV (Video Direct) is a sequel that is actually good. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy affair with the favorite Murkat and Worthagh, Timon and the crowds. It begins to comment and watch the movie first, and Tamon complains that "we're not here yet". After firing on the remote, Timon and Pumba decide to tell the audience "their story". They start a new movie, and start laughing. <br /> To be honest, I'm losing hope in Disney. Their live-video-video fare is quite unrealistic, with the storyless story of the original story. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: it tells the original story from a new point. Okay, Timon comes from where and he adds some stuff like he and Pumbaa met, but it is an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella will definitely re-acquire the bond and friendship they love in the first film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> "Tarant's anxiety-pimple mother and Julius Stiller Timon's little silly uncle is Jolly Cawner (" The Simpsons "), starring as Matthew Broderick Symba, and reminded me of his" Teen "scene Ferris Bueller. <br /> <br /> 'The lion's voice is so much talked about, <br /> <br /> 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is the perfect choice for you for wearing shrekification of animation.
