I was surprised to find a film at the age of 60. It's almost two hours long, there are absolutely no stars, but there are subtitles, but interesting and enthusiastic. I am very impressed with the reality of the film. You can see that hurricanes are real because you almost always experience the coolness of snow. This is the relief of the CGI-world in our days. I'm thinking of how much work this van dike was. I read as I read it for 17 months. Would you like to talk about 'Titanic' now? It's a great movie for a great message and it recommends future directors, and I recommend to see how great and realistic movies look if they are directed only to visual effects instead of realistic effects.
