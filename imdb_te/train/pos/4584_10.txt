<br /> <br /> I do not see everything in Chan's movies, but this is the best I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In this story, self is not unique, go into that deep. This is a typical adventure, fighting, good acting, warm feeling of humor. The film has a passionate tempo and you are surprised to see it. All cool stunts (of course made by Jackie himself) will make you want to jump around the bed and scream. It's awesome! <br /> <br /> I'm here in this Police Story Sweden and I know it can be a bit difficult to capture. But I can assure you, it's worth it.
