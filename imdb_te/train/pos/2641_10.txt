Green Eyes is a great image. In the present case of supporting our troops, the film is interesting, in this period the respective soldiers could not get out of their duty. From the historical perspective, the end of the Vietnam War is with us something to remember and learn. Jean is very proud of the film, and he deserves credit for the "Green Eyes" credit. I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not showing too much. The film is a kind of film shown on TV every year, like Wizard of Oz. One person's dedication to his losing son is completely moving. I was a friend of Jean Logans and I was proud to know him. Rocky
