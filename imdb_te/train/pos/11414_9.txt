A great storyline with a message. Jon Ploweite is superb as "Phoebe", Mike Copsa is a "coach" and Richard de Clarke made the character "Carmine" look great. Missha Barton has a good performance as "Frankie" and "Hazel" plays her first major role in Ingrid. The film is superbly directed by Joe-Beth Williams. Editing is the first rate.
