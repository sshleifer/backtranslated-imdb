Mary Pickford often stated that Tes Skinner is her favorite film character. Well done! For both of her and her version of this edition, she was not only to buy the rights from Adolf Zucker, but also to credit her on the film's main title card. It is necessary to play this character here. In fact, in my opinion, the film also evokes all-time great experiences of silent film. <br /> <br /> True, director John S. Robertson did not finish his camera from an inch, but Robertson's talented hands would not have this effect, but it would be more effective. The first rank is a creative artist, Robertson Pace, camera angles and master of the montage. He also made great performances from his players. The heaviest Jean Hersh√∂l is distinguished by hiding, believing that it is a gracious person like Dr. Christian; Lloyd Hughes acts as one of the best acting jobs in his entire life. True, it's probably not the way Mrs White is intended, but it's hard to explain why spending wealth on dope care, but in fact it's not the slightest attempt to confirm who's fired the gun that killed his future! Needless to say, this particular quality of the preferred hero was lowered by Jack Jing in the 1960s bowling, which completely eliminates the author's sharp attack on self-confidence and middle-class Christianity. Notice that a well-washed priest is going through a pace or two with a surprise, but he can not make any effort to help his tough little hero. <br /> <br /> "Tess" is another good actress, providing an insight into the work of Gloria Hope, whose work is limited to a silent film. She married Lloyd Hughes in 1921 and retired in 1926 to dedicate her husband and their two children to her entire life. Lloyd Hughes died in 1958, but she lived until 1976, easily accessible in Pasadena, but she had no brains to interview. Lost another chance! <br /> <br /> For me, Forest Robinson has shown an impression just like Skinner. I thought he was a little wrong and a brief glance on his film proved this: he usually acted as priests or judges! <br /> <br /> The product is pretty expensive, with beautiful photography and fantastic production values.
