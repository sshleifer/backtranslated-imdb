Archaeologists give a team a true treasure The crown of Queen Sheba From Egypt, the crown will be transferred to San Francisco by steamship. But it's not an easy journey. There are many thieves who love to get their hands on the precious jewel in the crown. Fortunately for the participation, to go to Mr. Moto in order to save the crown. <br /> <br /> After the disappointment of Mr. Motors Gamble, I went to Mr. Mo. , But, approved, the worst was afraid. But within the first 10 seconds of the film, I know I'll find it more enjoyable. I'm a sucker for a 1930s style mystery that has something to do with archaeological digs in Egypt. And grossly disguised as a German archaeologist (Peter Lorrey plays a German role?), Early scenes really impressed me. Although the film quickly turned to exotic San Francisco, it was enjoyable. In the rainy night the darkness and the bad characters are shining; Removed gun fired from open windows will lose the head of the dug; Advanced and incomplete foolproof alarm systems are just begging just to test them; And believe that the master criminals are dead ?? These are kind of a lot of the most visible 1930 secrets I really love. And Mr Moto took a vacation take-em al. A couple other bonuses for me in a small role in the always loyal Lionel Atvil, G.P. Huntley is actually funny, and re-designed for Mr. Moto. I've already mentioned in his disguise the opening sequences of the film, well coming near the end of the Athletic Moto movie. Moto is like a whirling Dervish of action he goes after his hunt. All this and I did not even mention the spectacular performance that Lorre had changed. <br /> <br /> I think you have to end up after this installment of the Moto Moto series, which you can understand when you think about it. . WWII is just around the corner. After Pearl Harbor, a film with the Japanese protagonist was not very well. At least the Mr Moto series ended with a very positive note.
