If you like the organized crime type pictures, it's great to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Those looking for a crime film starring in a color film to make a little disappointing to the film's production can make this film a bit disappointing. If you do not know about Hong Kong movies, then you will be surprised by this surprise. Some of the choices made by the stories are a little disappointing but a good crime movie. Some things did not make sense but it was proven with the east. <br /> <br /> People do things without regard to how they personally arranged their personalities. It's also a slightly annoying design that has spread in this film.
