When you read the summary of this film, it's the odd movie of the film and in some ways, Garard Red (Jeron Krabbe) haunted by visions and hallucinations. As stories continue, there are subtle indications of Gerard's (more or more) look and it is very fun to identify and identify markers used in the movie. Despite the hints of symbolism and the end of the film, the film was very exciting and did not get boring for a minute. This is largely due to the great performances of Jonathan Krabe and Renee Saudydickk (Christine) and the entire great directing by Paul Verhoen. His directing style is clear and can be seen from different angles, 'De Wear Man' is a typical Voorowan film. It is not only visible to people who are familiar with his American movies due to nudity and graphic violent scenes, but it also appears to people who are familiar with his Dutch films, because his talent to tell the same things and great story. When people look at the American images of Verhoevens, you can tell about the little people, he has no talent in telling a good story and focuses only on blood and sex. Some people think, but I think it's a talented director who is trying to reflect each deep message in each picture. Although not a good image, Hollow Man (his last American film) can do more than the movies of Vershon's science fiction stories and provide companies with more credibility and power to give him more confidence. He needs that. Just look at his Dutch pictures. They show that he needs a little liberty, but they also show that he has great talent. <br /> <br /> 'de Weird Man' brought a stage closer to Hollywood and one of his best. <br /> <br />
