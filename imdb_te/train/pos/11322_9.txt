This anime touched my socks. When the anime first opened, I felt very slow; The story does not go much further, and Shiro is an innocent male lead character. Once you learn more about the hunt, and you learn more about the Saber and the Holy Grail Battle, the story becomes a pance and you can see the multiple dimensions you're blending. It is amazing. <br /> In addition, I thought it would be very true to develop with real people in the real world as the characters developed. There was no stupid completely clear things; The development of Ilya and Rin is very interesting, but it is interesting to see everything in Shirovo and Sauber grow up in some of their personalities. Some of the "surprise" people (Gilgamesh?) From the cast seemed to be separate from another cast, such as "Generic Bad-As a Bad" as "A" immediately dead A <br /> <br /> Andre, I liked music. The early music rocket, the final episode from the final episode ... brought the final theme of the final episode more seriously. Ogam, type-moon!
