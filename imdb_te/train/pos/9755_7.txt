Last time I saw the film at the age of seven, so my views can be spent over time. At that time I enjoyed the switch between the cartoon and live actions. At that time I felt regret for the blue camel and his sad life. After the kidnapping of Captain Contagious heroine (the princess or the shepherd of the dolls), the tables fell on him. Unfortunately, the producers decided to transfer the film to VHS, so I have twenty years old memories. If I saw the film, it felt like it was crisp and smooth, but I really enjoyed the film at that time.
