First I'm not from the South, but I am an American. I like country music but I can stomach it. I never wear a cowboy hat but I wear hats. I live in a trailer but I eat tuna salad and have a home. What to do with this comment? One of those figures that you only say "living" people love this movie. The film depended on the "beloved and lost" place. James Bridges directs an American love story to be realistic. "Let's keep it there" in an era of Jerry Springer and the rings truer than ever. <br /> <br /> Bud is "coming of age" and embarks in his own life with the usual help from his aunt, so he moves to the big city with them. Budd himself finds himself in the local Honky Tank world for the only escape of a blue collar man. He quickly encounters Cissy in a similar manner, and both have tornado romance filled with painful hype. <br /> <br /> The story takes a couple of minutes to hook up and takes a lot of turns. Marriage alone is the transformation. This film shows some of the modern struggles that this lady has when she is married to a woman and is seen by men and women in competition. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sissy also gets the ideas of having fun on it but reminds her to quickly get married and start acting like "get started". When the emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and specifically split into the story (where some of the storylines have left), the story goes on and Sissy comes for a former con with a tendency towards abuse and cruelty. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by anyone who can compare Budd to Winnie Barbrico. John Travolta gave valuable recognition, which was valuable. He is believable and true. The scene that he killed his beard, first look at him at the bar .. I give goosebumps. Beyond I'm not a big travolta fan, but in the beginning, I see why Sony kicks his shoes. When Deb Winger was sympathetic to her relatives, she remembered the emotions to Bud, after she killed her to clean her house when she broke up. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is terrific. Ways played by Scott Glenn hated him and gave the first rate to curse him as he was destroying Cassie. Madeline Smith-Osborne, Buds Mistress / girlfriend was very reliable, U.S. The big chest girls throughout the day prayed to wake up the flat chest to wear the clothes she wore in the film. My big kudos goes to Barry Abing and uncle Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson. They are nowhere near Texas in someone's mother and uncle, and their role is small, they have made a very big and lifestyle. Two memorable scenes of the Dal√≠ Parton competition and the unforgettable sight of Budd and his brother-in-law's death. The dialog between them touched. <br /> You can see this as a true American love story. I recommend that we do what we want to do ... It's time to thank us for the real world that is right for our own feelings and entertainment. If it sounds like this in the world then you will enjoy more. Finally, if you're wearing music, you're sure to send it back for more than 30 years.
