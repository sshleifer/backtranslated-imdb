Wow. The truly fantastic 'trip' to the tones that are supposed to be a super-surreal depiction, dark intention and the world of cartoon animals. It is filled with curly backgrounds and a very attractive off-world bunch of characters with curled backgrounds. With all the cool fantasies, the wandering plot is secondary to eye-popping visuals and we are following the little cat and his zombie sister when we are facing death, submarine, water elephants, samurai swords and fish pigs. I have never heard of it, but now I like it - because it reminds me of the surreal pencil-work of the American cartoonist; Bill Plipton. It's a demented pleasure for fans of odd, pretty things and has glued to the screen for fear that I'd miss something wonderful. Keep it easy, it's 'Hello Kitty' without 'O'.
