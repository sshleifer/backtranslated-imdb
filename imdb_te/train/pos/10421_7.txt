This is a very beautiful picture. Color photography is beautiful as it is shown in the luxurious bright colors of the Metropolitan Opera House. Other indoor scenes in different buildings are similar. Regarding music, the voice of La√±a 'sings a number of songs in the world, sung for the best and beloved Arias. Fantastic Dorothy Kirsten, who combines her soprano voice with Launcha's delightful harmony, is also a pleasure. In fact, Hollywood has taken up their custodial freedoms with the life story of Carroso. The narrative is very small in relation to realistic events. For instance, the facts about his death are completely made and there is no connection to the truth. There are so many good web sites that have many of his portrayals of the true story of Karusso. These websites can use any good search engine. There are many books available about his biography. But the fictional story does not do anything to make this beautiful movie. The voices of Lanja, Kirsten and Chorus are the real stars in the film. Enjoy, I know I'm sure.
