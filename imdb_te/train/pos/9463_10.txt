I loved "Dawn in Real Life". You've got Got Mail or fantastic journey from fantasy travel as you're sleeping, but the sight gags and raw jokes are not full of ridiculous, and romantic is not what you throw at it. <br /> <br /> Don Burns (Steven Carl) is a leading advisor who fails to get things in his own life. Until one day, the family gathers / tours, he meets and instantly meets Mary (always with the beautiful Juliet Bino), a lady's bright design, a return to the classic film of a classic film in a lovely filtration. Chemistry takes place on a cup of tea and muffin, but Mary must be for the previous engagement, and they should be in the path. <br /> <br /> After that we will treat Don's strong and pleasant cousins, not only to mix large breakfasts, but to enjoy the use of the many bachelor's jokes that are brilliant and sweet dawn. Although I could see some of the characteristics of the family that I liked most, I thought it was a great simulation in the big family, it was not parody or raw hyperbole. The Barnes family is close to those who are simply interested in Dan. Unrealistic fairy family moments are amazing. The family is nosy, but understands-enthusiastically or gossip; <br /> <br /> Don is falling in love with his brother's girlfriend, who takes him to the family gathering. Thus a roller-coaster control involves an engaging and funny love-junior. <br /> <br /> "It's not particularly" hip "or" intellectual "but it is not too ridiculous and with a lot of humor in modern movies In fact, at the beginning of the film, the early spark of love starts with a peculiar discussion of a classic Hollywood-style dialogue <br /> <br /> I've probably rambled and repeat myself, but I highly recommend "Dawn Real Life." It's a great date movie, trust me, you laugh, and you <br /> <br /> =============================================== ================================== Grade: A
