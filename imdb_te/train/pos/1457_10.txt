I saw this documentary twice - and although I am a big movie, most documentaries do not have my attention. But the film has mesmerized. Almost every shot is accurate - telling more than audio commentary (this documentary is missing). <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is fantastic, I can not adequately appreciate it. Mardi Gras Beads - Who's Thinking <br /> <br /> You can be sure that you are really there - Amazing and amazing alternatives of a factory's film footage - interviews in China. <br /> <br /> I realized politicians - and I have read many books on globalization, so I am not surprised at this movie. But it's a lot to think about. <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> I can see everyone.
