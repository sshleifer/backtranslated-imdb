I was looking at this every night in this VH1 last week. There is an outstanding disclosure about how these drugs are contagious and how drugs are displayed in the media at the end of the 60s. Wedstock, Easy Rider, The Beatles, The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin. During "Drug Years" Vh1 has created a complete diagram of life and times. From the San Francisco Bay Area to Studio 54, the documentary is the evolution of the pharmaceutical business and has progressed into the breakthrough and American culture and shows new life. Cocaine from Marzewana to LSD influenced the way the document enters the country, hippie movement, traditional resistance, and how drugs (music, films, etc.). Featuring tons of lovely interviews and newsreel footage. <br /> <br /> Drug Films: Smoke Referle Trip Easy Rider Madness Blow Boogie Nights
