When I first saw this I saw this pilot, and Batman and Green Hornet took the role of "camp" because I'm sure countless "Spirit" fans would hate it. But I have never been to Batman, because I am entertaining in some of those shows. There are two parts that accompany me. The first is that after Danny's partner is damaged, he always makes a dramatic speech about how to stand up for the law and to obeys its definitive letter. Then, he said, "boy, I'm stupid!" Instead he turns his way into telling Danny (which is the kind of TV Batman) which has become a vigilant. Then, he had a scene trying to deceive villains about kissing her, but she was not cheated, because he was very honest to persuade her! It is also a great example of the "underground" camp "camp" through both the actor and the actress.
