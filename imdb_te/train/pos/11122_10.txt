When we started looking at this series in the cable, I do not know how addictive it is. When you hate a character, you are very beautiful because you can understand why you hold back, depression, fear, greed, or temptation to do what they do. <br /> <br /> It is almost as if the viewer is facing one of Christopher's learning curves. <br /> <br /> I can not understand that abuse of Adriana, Christopher's, physical, physically, and mentally abusive, but I have to read how many women are able to cope with such behavior. Carmella has a dream house, an endless supply of expensive things, but I'm sure she would give it to a loving and loyal husband - or maybe not. That's why I have seen. <br /> You can not see the episode many times, you can see the first five times. We also see episodes from the sequence (see Season 1 which is broadcast overnight but language with censors, language, censored, restarted in the movie network) - when they're there, we're there. <br /> <br /> I also love the love of Malpap. "An Albacare around my neck" Johnny Boy is my favorite. When these ornaments enter into our family vocabulary, I have a sense of life. I'm on the end of this series, and I've collected all the DVDs and kept my favorite collection.
