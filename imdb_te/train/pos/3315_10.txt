Betty Midler displays her talent and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I'm thrilled by the tape and I can see when I want it. What can she take to protect audiences in captivity? Her voice is beautiful as always and really impresses you. The theme of the show was her "Stay With Me" from her 1979 film "The Rose". You feel emotional in the song and have goose bumps. To get out of the show and rent a Betty Midler movie or go to a nearby music store, you will want to buy one of Betty Midler's albums.
