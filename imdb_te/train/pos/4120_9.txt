<br /> <br /> In 1970, after five years, Kurosawa became the first film to be made in the color of the film. Dodds' Ka-Den is centered around a series of stories that continue in a small Tokyo slum. <br /> <br /> The title makes the mentally retarded boy imagine he's running a train. . In the small community we will learn about people slowly, two drugs are sold as wives because they are not happy. A thief is an old man, an urban center trying to rob him. Very poor father and son who can not buy a house anytime, so they imagine their own part. By the end of the film, the stories come with the whole circle, some are happy, others are sad. <br /> <br /> You can see that Kurosawa's first color film uses it for its purpose. . Maybe too. The film goes in several different directions and it's hard to settle down and get it. But do not make me wrong, Dodds' com-din Kurosawa is not the best, but comes from the best director, which is better than 99% of today's films.
