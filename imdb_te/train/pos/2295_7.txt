The film has some very intriguing humor, which is the parody of the actors and the tribute. However, after a while it seems that I was surprised by the exercise in style (despite the fact that Dassalier is part of the Bascas and much better performances) and Bairr. When Blair, directed by Claud Brasseer, comes from a phone call from his father (Bernard Blair) - from heaven, and he's got a chance to tell him how to misguide him. An effective emotional caper and clearly heartfelt. However, in the amount of time it does not have enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the film interesting. But some really nice sequences and sequences, and anyone who loves French cinema's 'mosntres sacr√©s' should get a delightful amount of money from this film.
