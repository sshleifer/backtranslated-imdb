I first read this book, and when I was a teenager, I saw the movie at the end of that night. About a year ago I checked it in IMDb and no copies were available. I've hit the web and find a site that provides war films, I'm very happy with what I did, make a copy and then sit back and confirm that I want to see again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I have copied the book and really see the movie to make this movie truly enjoyable. The book is not in print but I do not track a copy by E-Bay, writer Alan White is Commando / Paratrooper during World War II, which participates in other secret activities and is his first book. I know who it is and I believe this book gives the book and movie authenticity. Because of the film's ending nature, the film is not only ten, it is not as good as the book. There are also two stories that have a different plot in the book, which is not strange about the man in the battle rather than the great nature of the war. The film is exceptionally well illustrated. <br /> <br /> If you can keep track of the book, the movie is definitely worth it. And I'd like to read more and more, I want to see one of my best war films ever!
