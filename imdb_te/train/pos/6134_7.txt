I have to go out and buy it until some DVDs go on. This is one of those films. Like most people here, I remember seeing it as a child and loved it. I never knew about the cut scenes and music numbers, so I was surprised to see what they were doing. I agree that the range of "Portabelle Road" is now a Todd Long (like a soccer game) but in other than that, I have retained the rest of their respectful place of residence. Probably the original version (renewed version) on one side with a revised version on Disney Flip, then select the ones they want to see. All in all, still an entertaining film that has managed to recover some of my childhood memories.
