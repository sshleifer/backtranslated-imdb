An entertaining film with some depth in the evening. All actors and actresses are doing amazing performances. With an outstanding cast, however, expecting a stellar performance, but surpassing expectations in the film. Individuals and personalities are personally associated with their own family. One watches and family members interact with each other's own family memories. This is one of the few films that inspire someone to read the book. This is usually another way; A book reads and then wants to see the film. I must copy the book Susan Minat and read it. The Rhode Island scene as the soundtrack is amazing. Any car buff is clearly restored to the restored period automobiles. I do not need to say it now, but I am recommending more of the evening. See that you will enjoy it.
