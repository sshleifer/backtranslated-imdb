The great acting in the film (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and a steady, chasing pace with the story that has been periodically revealed to us. <br /> Instead, the music is completely mood and <br /> <br /> The story is enhanced by the dominant white population to provide a fantasy story of the originals, their stories and their tensions. <br /> Although they do not have a relationship in the style and style, it continues to me in Ursula Le Gwain's "Lathay of Heaven" (1980). <br /> <br /> "The Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking movements. Remember, "hacking and slicing" does not make a movie horror film, which is the psychological element of fear and shaking of all of us.
