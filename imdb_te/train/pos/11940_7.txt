A baseball die hard, this film goes contrary to what I expect in a sports movie: the official-looking sports action, believable characters, and the original story line. If "Angels in Outfield" fails in the first category, it will succeed in the latter two. "Angels" Roger and J.P., both Anaheim Foster who are in love with Baseball, but the Voyageon Angels franchise, connects the story of a family looking to attract fans and win a game. Roger asks for some heavenly help by the promise of his death penalty that only Angels win at Penant, and it will be in the form of diamond-dwelling spirits that repel the slash of the franchise. The small-fuzzed manager George Knox (portrayed by Danny Glover), who is convinced of what Roger is hoping to see, the team is suddenly hoping to divide around their season - and Tony Danza, who plays Roger and JP specifically Glider's performance, and a slippery pitcher, also clearly pushes out windup Even though, it does well!
