If you like animal movies, this movie will please. My wife likes animals and animal films, she is particularly parrot in the film. It's not geared toward kids, but I laughed at the lot of humor. The French fashion character laughs at me, and adds the balance to the script. It's a Disney movie, with its sappy, happy, family apperal, but I'd leave the theater with positive fealing.
