In the 1990s, British enthusiastic and fascinating sitcoms - Ab Fawb, Men Behaving Badley, One Foot in the Grave etc - 70s are the real golden age. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, all new territories to explore, including the slowly growing understanding of the sexual revolution, feminism and "sensitivity", were twentieth years after political inclusion. Trying to be confused with this entirely new world is the subtleties of Monte Python's Flying Circus from the comic strips like Mont About the House, micro and non-subtle themes for everything. (By the end of the 70s, there was more meditation and bitter-sweet sitcom than the "hangover".) The best example of the good Britons of the House of the Life - some well-known in contemporary life Observed observations, throat, cheeky, fresh, ingenious, sometimes outrageous. This is enough to show as a Baba for the innocent 90s, and it is hard to believe that both were created in the same country. <br /> <br /> Man is one of the greatest Brit cams in the House 70s, right there with Good Neighbors (The Good Life), and George and Mildred's House of Spin. With good neighbors - many of its creators, writers and its cast won many British television.
