The great TV show in history is not lost, but it's not too far away. While it is not the plot or classification of the West Wing or perhaps Early ER, it is undoubtedly the most consistently gripping performance I have ever come across. I can not predict what's going to happen. I often like to repeat stories behind the characters that give rise to new developments to see them. In some ways I want to stop the show forever, but I think they can be in 6-7 seasons before they end up with an incredible high end. The combination of characters and their nationality combined with the performance of the show to go back and forth, so dead characters are spanning all of "Life Spans", which is quite different to what we have used. It's awesome, awesome and there's more than just a little interactive (here's a little bit of advice for all the conspiracy theorists )- that internet talks should take place-you only add to the plot ...
