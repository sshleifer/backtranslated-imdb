I used to see this program when I was a little girl. When I think about it, I do not blink. If you ask me it is a good show. The two things I remembered as early as the theme and theme song blurred. In addition, everyone is an actress. Also, writing is very strong. Exhibitions are the highest level. Some networks will bring back when I see each episode. Before I close it, I always remember this presentation in my memory, and I saw each episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network brings it back, I hope you catch one day before the wind goes off for good.
