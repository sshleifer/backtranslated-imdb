"Journey of Hope" tells them their Odyssey of a poor Turkish family and hope they down into despair as they travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity. Although the Oscar winner's film was very well made, it lacked material and had many compliments. Departure on the bus for 1.7 hours on the bus, boat on the boat, get out of the boat, get in the van, get out of the van. It's time to spend a good time or leave it alone. This story has an imaginative diagnosis, especially those who are aware of the common crime of illegal immigrants. A worthwhile and reasonably entertaining watch is over-rated.
