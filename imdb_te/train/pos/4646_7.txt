I do not know what to do about this film. I guess I really like what it's all about. I have never seen such a film and I doubt that I will do it again. Glover makes her unique. I read some of his poetry and I would have to see one of its slide shows. I really like this person, he's just bizarre and I can not help. Note: I have seen this movie before by its final editing, so maybe I have seen and seen others are different. If I choose to view the image again, I guess. I had a profound effect on drugs ...
