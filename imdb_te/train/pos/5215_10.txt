All I can say is, the first season I've got my attention this season. I've chosen actors, Gear and Claire, this story has been promised .. I've seen it and I can say - I'm overwhelmed. There are surprising scenes, but the truth is that it is true. We should not escape from our reality, these things are going on right now. And there are experts trying to change things and make things better and laughed about their commitment to reason. In fact, I can not feel like a "Hollywood Touch" movie .. That's fine. Claire and Richard both played great roles and qualified for a 10 out of myself.
