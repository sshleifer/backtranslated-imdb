"The Foxes" was a movie I remembered to shoot young people in the late 1970s. I'm definitely at the age of Jodie Foster and I belong to this film. It deals with frustrations, temptations, relationships and youth rebellion. The soundtrack is great for inspiring rock. "More Than a Feeling" The sad numbers like "On the Radio" by Boston and Donna Summer. The music of my last teens. Yep, I'll always remember this one, if it's not big.
