I love this movie, but the film does not like it. People who do not like this film should be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe Mr. Carey behind that makeup. I know that most of the actors and actresses in this film have done the movie beforehand. There is a new face in the film. Who's Who Tinler Momsen Who's Who When opened, Grinch (Jim Carrey) was hiding. And some can cause some fun whos in Whoville. Sicne We know whos love Christmas. Grinch does not like Christmas. And the little candy Lou How (Taylor Momsen), daughter of the town postmaster (Bill Irwin). Directed by Ron Howard. And the commentator is made by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambour (Space from Muppets) as Whoville Mayor. Christmas is not like talking about the Grinch.
