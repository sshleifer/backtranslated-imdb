It was released on DVD in France several years ago - I want to re-release with English Subtitles. It was not confusing with the Penelope Cruise rebuilding, which received poor reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a farmer telling a fortune that he will marry the king's daughter. He wants to join the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in an early film for her. I will not spoil the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a younger age, a great loss to Movidam.
