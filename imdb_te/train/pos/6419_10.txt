This film is a wonderful military image. It's not a wonderful Hollywood movie, but it does not matter. Hollywood has good sacrifice for good entertainment, but it's not with this movie. Other reviewers have found this film very slow to their taste, but ?? Retirement Soldier? I appreciate the pace of movie crews intentionally telling their story as much as possible given two hours and nine minutes assigned. The story is told and repeated several times, but is it a professional soldier? And that's an African American ?? Report the story submitted by film crews, and it will provide the US Navy to the world. Brusher's story to become a naval defender, and not just a story telling his life as a Navy diver over his graduation. There's no way I could be in the test dive of the 2nd officer of the Commanding Officer of the Commanding Officer of the Commanding Officer 2nd Class Brusher how the Master Chief Petty Officer should be on Sunday, and a linear and assignment change. How did Brussels find that it lost the third hydrogen bombs in the Atlantic Ocean in the 1950s on the coast of Spain and how he saved another pirate life in a runway line? Brassier did not take him back and took the shot himself. I say that it's a worthy story, and I can say that it's not enough for two hours and nine minutes to tell the full story and from the deleted sequences that made their best effort to tell the crew the story. As much as possible. As a professional soldier, I am proud to see such a great story in such a comprehensive way, seeing the traditions and dignity of the preserved Navy in such a natural and complete manner.
