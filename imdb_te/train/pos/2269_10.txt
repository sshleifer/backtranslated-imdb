I recently read the novel "Mother's Night", I've had a DVD for some time now, and every so often see. I saw and questioned some films that I saw as Mother Night, and I was surprised by the screen of the screen of his text, not only the brightness of Vonnegat. <br /> <br /> VHS does not rent or watch this movie, it must be done in dvd, and the film is to be accompanied by the director's commentary. <br /> I think any viewer was amazed that they learned how to take up a more complicated story in its ingredient and dialogue and that it worked well. The text, and much of it does not deduct from it, the film can be book as well, and the best adaptation I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'll demand both the book and the movie, just let it look. <br /> If you do this, it will change to you.
