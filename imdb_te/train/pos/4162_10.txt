Yes, this is it. In fact, it was my top ever 20 favorite movies of all time. Number 15, I think. Anyway, I'm not one of the plots in general, but I think the plot is anime and RPG video games, (Final Fantasy 7, for example) and the movies work better. But this is all this. Vivid images of planets, stars, very well written screenplay. It's not really for babies, they still have any graphic blood, guts and silicone which can be found. But I do not think they're going to understand it.
