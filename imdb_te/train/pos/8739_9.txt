This is a FUNNY image. These include all the classic Disney episodes (music, great characters, story, appeal) that are tailor-made with amazing animation and fantastic voice talent in the words "anim" and "cost of Egypt". /> <br /> The characters work well, and have a strong appeal, and humor is aimed at a wide range of overcoming barriers to generations. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film three times, I think many of you are taking friends to watch this weekend. . Many skeptics saw this film in my recommendation. I am working on a multiplex and I can say honestly no one has gone out of the film without any satisfaction. <br /> See it,. You're sure to enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay for the end credits! The funniest part of the film is laughing throughout, as it is sly and out-of-the-moment.
