SAPS AT SEA is clearly a Gary Cooper film, a break in the SOULS AT SEA. The title aptly described the team, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Ollie's nerves walked on a sea journey to relieve the escaped killer Nick Gringer. As Rychard Cramer has played, this criminal is entertaining and chilling, making him a good foil for the boys' comedy roles. Despite its powerful presence, Kramer never went up to the boys, paid tribute to Stan and Olly's admiration. <br /> <br /> Laurel and Hardy's personalities raise their average items. SAPS AT SEA has its slow spots. For example, as a previous commentator suggests, a doctor (hilarious James Finelson) tries a balloon called "lung tester" in Olly, not punch. The most part of this illustration is the first part of the boys' apartment, which is entirely associated with the second part of the whole marine relationship. But overall, the film is a little fun entertainment, so it is not acceptable. <br /> <br /> Hal Roach is a special song to see the final collaboration between Laurel and Hardy and the producers. I did not see pictures of Laurel and Hardy's 1940s but I did not even see the weak Hall Roach products I saw. In later films, Laurel and Hardy appear in a foreign environment, including colorful auxiliary players such as Finelson and Charlie Hall and horror musical scores of Marvin Hyde and Leroy Shield. They are not well-known and optimized bumpers we know and love, but in later films, blackheads or enthusiastic misfits are discouraging. <br /> <br /> Many Hall Roach Laurel and Hardy movies are now generally not available to the public. Larrell and Hardy are also great comedies in a small entry like the SAPS AT SEA. Because Hall Roach, for the most part, has been granted the Stan Laurel, guiding force in the band, and full artistic freedom. After Laurel lost his autonomy in other studios, the band lost its distinction.
