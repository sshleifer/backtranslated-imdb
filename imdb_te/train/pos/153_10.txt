The film is small, a cinematopic artwork. The film was shifted by intense images intensively moving to the sensitive viewer. The film opens in the Spanish Civil War because children's group wants their revenge on another child. In fact, they are demonstrating a version that has witnessed in the adult world around them in their world. Then we will meet again with three more children in the hospital. See what each of them has done here. One is a reclusive, sexually suppressed patient. Another person is suffering from illness. The third child, a young woman, became a nun and worked in a health office. <br /> <br /> The film is not exactly for insulting viewers of the movie, it's logical and intense. Acting is amazing and the script is very well written. The film is a musical score without fearing throughout. This is not a movie for thriller job seekers, but a picture of a clever audience.
