GÃ©dion and Jules Nouvet wanted to shoot the documentary about the rookie New York City firefighters. <br /> <br /> Jules Captain, who worked with James Hanlon's ladder company, checked the gas leak with the captain to repair and repair. In the context of anything interesting at firefighters. <br /> <br /> A few seconds before the plane crashed into a tower, the camera was shown. <br /> <br /> The captain asked the captain to follow him into the Towers. The first thing he saw was the two men in the fire, who refused to film. <br /> <br /> The filming of the firefighters and others was filmed. <br /> <br /> Brothers Knudet took care of not being too violent, gray, and gory. But the language is a little coarse from firefighters, and CBS has shown a lot of balls that are untrained. Brother Naoudet's mixed footage was filmed in an interview with each other, so firefighters explained their thoughts and emotions at specific times of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a movie with a similar title, more money from DVD sales goes to 9/11 charitable organizations. It is the best documentary ever to be promoted, emotional, moving and totally political propaganda.
