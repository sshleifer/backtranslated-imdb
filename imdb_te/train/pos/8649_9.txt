I bought this a while ago but somehow neglected to see it until last night. I am different from Brad Pitt but I am like Juliet Lewis. <br /> <br /> After this scenario I would definitely have to confess the good actor - his role is absolutely reliable, and I did not think of "Brad Pitt". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I Duvovny Duchovny. I thought I was an X-Files fan and I saw it twice a couple of years to confirm the date of the film. I like Dukov, but he has played a two-dimensional role except for the voice-overs. <br /> <br /> Mingle Forbes has become a treat. Why did not I notice it before? I'm a little worried about Lewis, the film, and the "Natural Bourne Killers" (a company's favorite) stereotyping again (see other roles I've seen and looked at). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The film is almost baseless. It is precisely not entirely-formed (and perhaps some of Pitt's "swept"), rather than the character of Dukov. I am happy that the innocent leaders die - even though they are suffering first. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK, you may like this movie and may be vice versa too.
