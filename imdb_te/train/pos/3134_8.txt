This well-written story of Making of the Batman sitcom and actually reunites our heroes in a great quest and provides their TV history. Unlike Brady and Partridge Family documentary films we can not take a look at Adam's and Burt's past and present lives, but also get them back in action. The story tells us that Batman is a return to Batman series, filled with Kapau and Catmans and Ridler (s), but the story fills modern fans of all the Hollywood tales, heard in 35 years. <br /> <br /> Kudos !!!
