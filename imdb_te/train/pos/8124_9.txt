Aside from the great movie Metropolio, it is the oldest sci-fi movie. Sometimes the film is a bit pre-bit and acting is a bit wider, which is a great movie for two reasons. First, it is very original in both style and content. Even in the 21st century, I can not think of anything about it. Secondly, for its time, special effects are totally unbelievable - creating spectacular views of the post-apocalyptic world by using matte paintings, models and massive molds and creating a vast city tomorrow. Certainly, you can sit back and watch the movie, because only today's scales are the effects. But when it came to the film in 1936, you realize that this is a state of art and it is really astonishing the audience. In many ways, most of the sets of "modern cities" presented at the 1939 WORLD's FAIR are remembered. <br /> Do I think this film is so interesting or do we want to be rich? "The final result is less than two! <br /> Final note: I saw these two times on TV and I watched the video three times a sound and print quality stock - especially the sound, if it is available on DVD, And optional captions. As the video is soundtrack, I really appreciate it!
