If it's a better movie than the 101 Dalmations (not the live action, not the animated version), I still thought it was small what Disney could do. It is well-portrayed, suited for music action, and effects (compared to 101) are good. The performance was probably good, but later human characters were given more appropriate roles in the sequel, and Glenn Clock really did not miss the first film. She will shine. She has fantastic characters to play off the poor ducks and exuberant furious sidekicks, and they add Disney's scene to us. This is a great family picture, less or objectionable, and more fun and interesting for adults and children. It is classic because it has so many Disney films. You can expect it to be a third and better here - because you know you're probably making one. ;)
