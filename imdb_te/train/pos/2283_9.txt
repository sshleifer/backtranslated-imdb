I did not read this on Kurt Wonnegat's book, but I found some of his other work better and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen. Overall, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vannegat's novels. It concerns the story of an American country in Germany who was hired as a spy for the US. His job is to include himself in a high rank Nazi and send secret messages to America through his annual radio program. <br /> <br /> When the war ends, he is a war criminal but escapes to New York, where many odd stories are waiting for turns. <br /> <br /> If it's a mother's night it is most sentimental times. But for most film schmaltz kept a minimum and very strange plot is performed with skill and aplomb. And there are some amazing moments of black comedy involving three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and Nazi at the highest rank in the jail cell. Very good.
