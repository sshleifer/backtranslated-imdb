Forbes has been disappointed to go to California and Mulder will visit the historic interest areas of the leading serial killers, taking action on the action. His idea is: he writes words, she takes pictures, and has the highest selling coffee table book for life with the ultimate result. For financial assistance to the trip, they decide to drive a car and actually make a statement. Their misfortune sees Brad Pitt's statement and immediately after killing his landlord, he and his girlfriend Juliet Louise meet the author and start their cross-country trek. <br /> <br /> Pitt is really unusual for the real cold inspiring Early Grace, and Louise plays his usual white garbage character in his regular setting. <br /> <br /> Like the Duchovny and the Forbes regulars, you will suck the viewer in their plight and feel tensions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] A top image.
