Well, I've come a long way from Houston now, but when I watch this movie, I'm back to Giley's bull for a day and a little coward for a day. <br /> If you grew up in East Texas, you know that the film is a perfect description of contemporary life. If you do not trust me and do not see the movie. However, with most of the people you love (and at the same time repulsively) or too little, you can enjoy the red necks. (There are so many things to be fun for fun). (What's in the 80s) or white trash element and it's time and place honest. <br /> <br /> I'm a 10!
