Like many Americans, I first introduced Hayoio Miyazaki's writings, I saw "Spirited Away". I fell in love with the movie and I saw many times. I'm searching for every film by Miyazaki. One of his earlier works was "Castle in the Sky." <br /> Although it is still pleasant, "Spirited Away" (which is probably unfair though compared to his masterpiece in 2002). <br /> <br /> Paz (James van der Beck) While working at a mine in the end of the night, he slows down the girl slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she is introduced as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has a secret, and before he gets to know, he is dragged into an adventure that drives him with pirate, army and losing floating city. <br /> <br /> Hayo Miyazaki is the feeling of wonder and magic: that means you can expect a thing. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and fear, like the Miraculous. <br /> <br /> Cinema Animation If dubbing is not a problem because it is impossible to determine whether it is impossible, the movements of the lips are enough to the words. This translated dialogue will help you to write and speak well with talented actors. Voice acting is different. James Van der Beck is the best. He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and enthusiasm to Pazu's role that is perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is very good as Sheeta. She feared by the events surrounding her, but she knew what to do. Mark Hamil is recognizable as evil muska. He is dangerous and wants something from Sheeta and does anything to get it. Other voices are bad. Clarice Lechmann is a terrifying man like Dola. Leitchman can win an Oscar for "The Last Picture Show", but she is a pirate leader. Leachman's character almost always gives a bad quack that is monotonous. It's very bad, it's ruins the image! <br /> <br /> Jim Cummings acts as an effective voice-over actor, but he misinforms the ordinary. <br /> I would definitely see "Castle in the Sky". I'll probably buy it. But it's "spitted as far away," even though it's still not pretty good.
