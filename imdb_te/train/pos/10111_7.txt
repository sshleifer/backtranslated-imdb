The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is not a good documentary. Beautiful, it is poor looking and cheap, it does not go off on tangents that make people very uneasy and cohesive, but adds the charm of this. I say this because it is a documentary about an oddball that has made oddball images and is surrounded by fellow oddballs and there is really no other way to document the life and career of man and his crew. Wood's intellectuality and inability are some of the insights of insight, and there is a credit for the documentary's reality in the two traits. Overall, timber fans and generally the watch for the movie is valuable, but do not expect brilliance here. Wait a document after Wood's own heart.
