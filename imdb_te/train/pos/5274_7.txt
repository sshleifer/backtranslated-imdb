Yes, I liked this movie when I was a child. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up this movie was very different from my father <br /> <br /> At first, my mother was sure that she was a 10-year-old's most appropriate image. But we want to see me because we bought a new VHS system. <br /> <br /> I said, So, a few days ago I inserted the video and saw the film again after a long time. I was frustrated and I loved the kid and continued to watch it. The experience was not so great ?? remembered enu acting is pretty bad, the plot is very bad, the jokes are not funny anymore, but women are still beautiful. Yes, I grew up. Even though the film experience has changed, I think it's still worth 7 stars. Did you know good old times ??
