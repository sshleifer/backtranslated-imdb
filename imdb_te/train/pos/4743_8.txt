This is a very strange HK movie in many ways. At first, action sequences are not very fun. The first gun battle in the film is just silly. The crazy cold, or the silly is not funny, but just crazy. There are not some great action scenes, but most did not come to the level of other films I've seen. On the opposite side this image is actually just people, having characters. All the major characters are interesting (except for a bad guy who is flat as a billiard table) and very well acted. The movie is just fun to see all the major characters in the film. The conversation is very witty, and the translation does not seem to lose much. This film is worth watching, but I hope the uneducated American audience does not think this is to offer the best HK.
