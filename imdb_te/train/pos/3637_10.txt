This is really a great movie. I love Dennis Quaid and the whole baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very favorite actor. The chemistry team is wonderful once they do things together, it moves to just one goal and go to show what you can do when the mind is united. The band returned from the brink and lost several times to win about one. <br /> <br /> On top of that, Dennis Quaid's character has gained in the lead leagues. You can not do anything, but the root of this person. It looks like someone needs to do something, they are going to do that. <br /> <br /> The true story is based on the fact that this film is really "nothing"
