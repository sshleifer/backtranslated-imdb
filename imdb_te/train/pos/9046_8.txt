I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Zarhed (2005), since then, I see every one of my films on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he is serious (he is somewhat similar to Owen), just separating from the screen. <br /> <br /> We are going to have a movie in this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not despise this film. With a great number of believing people (well, it depends on the author's initial sophistication), a great cast? Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern has always been on my watch list? <br /> <br /> But this film has a very special significance for me. : In 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; Like him, I saw black stars to see Stuttnik, through black people. Similar to Homer, I used rackets in my backyard and used precise chemicals for fuel; And as Homer, I also ended my efforts explosion disaster! <br /> <br /> I could not achieve his great (physical and physical) altars. <br /> Definitely, this is a basic family image, but it feels like a dying species these days. Take the time to see the kids: you're all laughing at everything.
