Hi everybody my names Larissa I was 13 when I was 13 when I was 13 years old and it fell on my socks I was looking at the film for a long time just 30 minutes ago. . Alisan Porter is a good actor and when she deals with cards I love that movie so funny. Every time I watch that movie at the end I'm crying so I'm only 13 years old but its such a touching story is really weird that Alisan is now 25 years old. Every time I look at a movie, I see someone who is young and they come out the year after they make it up and they're really young to see how old the person in the movie comes from. Like Harry Potter. That movie was also great but still Daniel is 12 years old in the first film and I am about 11. So how can he go from 12 to 16 years and I'm only 13. I'm not sure if he is in the present 16 I think he is almost 18 but u past U only at 1 when u at a movie and after 4 years old u weird kind thats.I'm my I am a big and I am kind of computer person to envision it.Ã® damn but I also want kids to do a lot of things. I'm very smart as Curly Sue in the movie but that guy calls me the fur seu foster home away and that's a thing I do not like in the picture if I've really made it in real life. Okay I'm going to know a lot of writing writing sometimes but it's a lot of head there if they do not get kids out and kids will get to learn. <br> Larissa
