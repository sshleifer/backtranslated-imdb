There are really shocking events along the way, also a wonderful, free flowing, often literary film that whisks along, laughing ever. Women are treated and still eventually they come through very well and it is a very bad scare all the way to work all the work is very well a gasps at the way. This is probably Depardieu's best performance, definitely his most natural. Genie Morrow should have a very difficult role to play with serious sex scenes with a pair of boys at least half. Miou-Miou is lovely and has very difficult scenes to play again. Initially it's down and dirty misogonist rote / ropp, but the story and characters appear to be very soft and honest. In the end this unyielding and courageous image demands respect.
