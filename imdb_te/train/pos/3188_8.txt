I am the only terrible day in my life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> I have to confess, for just 2 reasons: Vera-Ellen's Legs. But it's too much. The plot is actually very clever and creatively woven. It is almost like Shakespeare's comedy with all the happiest misunderstood. The unfortunate feature of this film is that the version I purchased (the "100 Family Classics" collection by Mill Creek Entertainment) has the best video quality, and I've heard the same about alpha release. Brightness and contrast are a bit too much, so many scenes appear whiter when dancing Vera white dress. But I think you can fiddle to replace your TV set limits. I can imagine how I looked back in '51 on the big screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> "You are not sappy, contrived, not dramatic." 100% ahhhhhh It's very bad, you're not bad, your painful lives are never as beautiful as Har Har Harris Wait, what do I see, my life is good for you Oh hell again watching this movie.
