This, and the "secret castle" Kurosawa is very dear to me. I'm not handing a candy-like hand like 10, but it definitely deserves if it's anything. Although it is too long (like all of Kurosawa's), it most likely accompanied me to the problem of flawedness in most of his films; The storyline is very slow and slowly developing, featuring scenes that are very unnecessary or lententent without any real intention of the stories or character descriptions. For example, Dadakudan gave me the same experience, for example "mysterious castle"; <br /> <br /> This is a very exceptional Kurosawa film, but there is no storyline, but many small independent stories are more dependent on the character description than the character, except for any other Kurosawa movie I have ever seen. This gives much more to the conversation he used to communicate (especially the father and son of their "new home" plan). <br /> <br /> Even if this is a miracle, it is sad how much it is to be depicted at any time, with humanity and sympathy. From the beginning to the end it provides the whole emotion level from the smile to the tears with perfect balance.
