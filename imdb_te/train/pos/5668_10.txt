I do not fall in this series of accidental. After half an episode, I was hooked. A dark and strange series with American Gothic Gary Cole is the mysterious sheriff buck trying to get Caleb's control of his illegitimate son Lucas Black. I was impressed by Gary Cole's terrible sheriff and I was more impressed with Lucas Black. Lucas Black's Caleb Sheriff was able to stand against Buck, which is one of the most horrific characters ever created for a TV series. I rarely saw a boy or actor who has a lot of presence or talent like Lucas Black. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky to see Lucas in American Gothic, you will see him in the Sling Blade. <br /> <br /> It has never been described in a very few dilemmas and secrets.
