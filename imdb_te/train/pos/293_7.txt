Private detectives could be more schlocky than they thought to take part in women who were supposed to spy on? <br /> <br /> But the actors have changed the meaning of the dialogue. You can look behind real lines real lines. Directing is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I have seen so many friends in the mid-80s, because I was worried about how to make such a bad thing. Good picture. Friends enjoyed a lot.
