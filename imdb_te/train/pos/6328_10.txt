It is a pleasure to see the mutated art without distortion or contribution. I did not expect to see how to rebuild as a worthy piece of literature. If you love Bulgakov's book, you'll understand that the commentary that was slightly more misleading than actually drawing the deepest meaning of the story is more complete for an art-film project. There are two examples of Master and Margie. The story is complicated and distorted, the film is nothing. The filmmaker makes Bulgakov's work as well as the research conductor reading a score - not a note missing. Here is the U.S. Why not get such a talent? Now my favorite book and movie has the same name.
