<br /> <br /> If you do not like this book, it's not as good as the book or commenting that it's different in the book. <br /> <br /> I can not understand this kind of criticism. Books and movies are different media. With hours and hours of time to develop characters and stories, the films will be 120 minutes. Yet the film has the ease of promoting many feelings: visual, audio, as well as imagination. The movie is very good or, of course, I do not care if it is not a comparison of the book that is based on it. Who cares? <br /> <br /> This TV movie is lovely. Old and very often the story, the possibility of clich√©, it may easily bother. However, Riphen and Reeves stop it. One critic has found a lot of confusion in old times. When I was 40 years old, I did not expect this film. This was her credit as an actress and she played amazingly well at the age of 23-24. I think Reeves could have done it anytime. The story may be strong, and I agree that the play is "harder" on the screen. However, it is well worth looking at; Apparently not a powerful romance story, but a romantic romance which leaves you satisfied with overcoming a strong emotion and good evil of love. <br /> <br /> "Fashions Story" is not necessarily kissing naked buttocks or kisses without F # $ word. <br /> Finally, the musical score is wonderful.
