Italy has produced really great and original horror films in the 1960s - and this is definitely one of them! The first thing you will notice about Dansey Macabre is this movie style. Depicted in beautiful black and white films and due to the use of director Antonio Margherita lighting; It's almost like a German expression horror film. In addition to a horror-filled plot line, Dance Macabre actually confirms that the film captures the essence of horror. However, the fact that the beautiful Barbara steel looks in the film does not hurt things - and this good news continues in the film, which she has attracted more of her acting muscles, and she has acted in popular films. The plot is well known about the time of release, so Egger Allen Paolo has a great deal. We follow Alan Foster, he is a poet and a writer who earns him from Lord Blackwood, who can not spend the next night in the old cottage old castle. Everyone who had spent the past one night died ... and our hero meets previous beters! <br /> <br /> Nowadays, horror films do not focus more on each shot, and as a result there is not much beauty in the genre. This refreshes to see this movie. Many of the shots here are very pretty - wearing a one-look-through skirt from the male side of the couple, my personal favorite - a shot of smoke at the end from under a door. This is my first Antonio Margareti film, even after seeing this; It is clear that he is one of Italy's leading directors. Interestingly, Italian greatness has contributed to another; Zango creator Sergio Carbouki. Plots are slippery at times, but make sure that the movie is always boring - it's always a secret, even if the plot is low. The way the Danse Maccabre uses the 'Haunted House' theme is both fine and original, and the story helps keep the story as much as possible. Overall, Italian and / or Caul Film fans should not miss this little gem!
