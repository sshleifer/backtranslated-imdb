I did not reference anybody while watching the movie for the idiot box. In the late 90s, I always thought this was a very successful film. <br /> <br /> When I saw on the Internet for television, I was surprised because it was absolutely awesome for a television movie! <br /> <br /> I am the most agitating subject of length. I think it's totally unnecessary and I've removed a fighting scene. In addition, dragging in the final direction, the adventure may never end. <br /> <br /> The plus side, there are strong, very interesting and attractive plots with amazing performances for everyone. I felt Patrik Frayze looked a bit bizarre. <br /> <br /> "The first half of the film gave me the film, which is still a great movie for television." 8.
