I have created great expectations before seeing that some friends say it (and they are not paravs!). It must be seen! <br /> <br /> Freudian Psychonolises is interesting in many parts of the film, but it is very perverse and does not stick to the end. <br /> <br /> The analysis of the Kyllowski's Blue, much of David Lynch, some of Hitchcock's and perhaps I missed a little (I recalled ... Daggleley), and I'm usually very clear or in the air It's too big. <br /> <br /> Unlike recurring, this may last for a long time, which has been used to study some of the abuses that have been documented in the documentary, and many thrillers are based on this theory. <br /> <br /> Again, it is at the top and most people are dead and I believe that you will have dark praise for blood.
