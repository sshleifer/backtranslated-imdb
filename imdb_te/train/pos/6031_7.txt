On August 19, 2000, two hundred members of Cleveland, Ohio USA, titled Sinematake, viewed an old Cinemascope print of Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 film "Zabrisky Point". <br /> <br /> Audience has shared with the audience that this print is exclusively from Italy. The film is heavily expanded on heavy artifacts. Looking at this fantastic print, Antonio is intended to make a sense that this is truly a modern art work. It is more appropriate to place this segment in the Cleveland Institute of Art in the University Circle. <br /> <br /> Compositions of Antonioni are created for CinemaScape Landscape. His beautiful balance of colors, painting, huge choreographic mobiles, the actual artist's work, the use of the screen as his canvas. <br /> <br /> In the end, the audience could understand "Jabrisky Point." When its narrative opened, it was clear that the story was not a story, but an attractive rendering of an artist of frail images in his film. Dramatic Motor only provided the artist's sweeping collage to the setting of more turbulent activities of the sixties. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's traditional narrative does not comply with standards, and can be interrupted to creatively lapse with amazing performances at any time. The audience went ahead with the flow of his great imagination, paying attention to the huge pictures on the canvas of the heavier. The audience rarely participated in the role of the character, but it was here that the director recounted that the theme was human alien. <br /> <br /> In the cinemascope, the small or low quality print of this reality is also perceived to be able to justify this particular rendering. All viewers appreciated the "jubrisky point" in its original, breathtaking design and received thunder applause at the end.
