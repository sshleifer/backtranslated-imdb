Omigosh, this is the most horrible film I have ever seen. I say that I loved horror movies, and I've seen heaps that I never had to sleep with the light before (considering limited availability of New Zealand) ... until I saw The Grudge. <br /> <br /> The Ring (based on Japanese horror movies), some may say that this is one of the other (and more distinctive) stories, but Grudge saw it in its horror film - and I also screamed in a particular part of the film. <br /> Acting is especially great from supporting characters - Cade Strickland is stunning and steals the show, an enthusiastic person. Jason Behar is a real hottie, and he looks like William Mapper as he is enjoying it. However, when I'm usually a fan of Clevel Dual, she really does not appear in this movie. Supporting characters, she probably got so much depth and back story, but she does not look like her all there. For Sarah Michelle Geller, does she look at her with all of her movies and not her characters? The ghost is honestly scary, sparkling music and acoustic effects (especially when Cadie Strickland's character is sounded in his apartment), the ending is also very good. <br /> Superb highly recommended. 9/10
