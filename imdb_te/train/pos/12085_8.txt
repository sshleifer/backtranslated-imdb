Shirley MacLainin as another tailor. A 1962 labor is a mother-in-law of a Chicago neighborhood, an experienced character actress working on another and a gatty woman who does not allow her to succeed. Though many magic tricks and practical jokes learned from her, and even all the wrong possibilities, the teen boy and girl are taken to their enthusiastic aunt joke before. <br /> <p> This theme is intelligently covered in the Cuban missile crisis with all the elements. Men saw bomb shelters, news programs only at the TV set, at a diner, and the usual fog of fear and fear in the air. When a "harmless" miracle rushes from the ratios, the viewer gets better though the climactic end. Yes, Virginia, the sun will come tomorrow! Apparently a small budget product, it's still a sweet little picture, filled with magic that Sunday's Matineas. With "Oldies" with certain options thrown into an effective soundtrack, it is sure to enjoy the whole family. ****
