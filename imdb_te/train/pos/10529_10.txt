Not my favorite Aston novel, and Paltrow is not my favorite actress, but I found the film almost absolutely delightful. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and 'Miss Bates' are all absolutely amazing. The period does not differ from the details; The sense of the movie is just true. But find 'true' Mr. Knightley as Jeremy Lord. No more perfect casting, IMO. I hated Mr K in the novel, but he invented an amazingly human and human being in the film. Northam's good looks and smiley eyes do not have any objection to enjoy! Highly recommended. AnaR
