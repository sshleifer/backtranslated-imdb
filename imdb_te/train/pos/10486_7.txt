"Save Grace" is not riddled funny, but offers very good laughs and I enjoyed it as an important degree. Brenda Blethan is a good actress, and she does a good job of filming wife Grace, who resorts to growing marijuana to pay huge bills. The supporting cast also works better. French actor Tchecky Karyo has a funny little character. In the campus alone is attractive. An over-the-hill woman is growing and sounds funny enough with the idea of ​​smoking. And the picture every now and then cleverly plays around in the premises. Of course, there are flat moments, such as one where the two elderly women are mistaken of Grace's marijuana leaves for tea leaves and pulling childish antics at the work they operate. This is a mindless gag that does not take off too much. The film's tone is downbeat and occasionally lame, but I'm laughing to recommend this English import. <br /> My score: 7 (in 10)
