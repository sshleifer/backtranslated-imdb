It is Karisma which is separate from Jubida. Even Nana Patekar has tried her best. The story is very good in this story but when it comes to Shahrukh's film, it seems logical. I really like the shows, the dialogue delivery, the story, the way I like it. It is well directed and edited. <br /> <br /> She is also a good assistant to Kareema's mother law. <br /> <br /> Although she has a lovely moment, she is good to see her. <br /> I'm not really interested in their role in the Canadian family, but when they enter India, that's true. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
