I do not know what to expect from this film. I love to see Brosnan in any film, he is always good, but it's totally different. He is a mess, and plays well being a mess. In fact he remembered me a few times in the unit. Yes, there is not much violence, but it does not happen so many actions, but acting is frightening and acting is very refreshing and it's very funny I do not think you're coming out :) "Wow! I blown away", but you enjoyed a good movie Let's come. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're lucky, some moron statements go wrong and upside down, upside down, upside down (inverted audio) adverts !! Brilliant. Like Jack Daniels's announcement, the drink goes from glass to bottle, with American "Twin Peaks" commentary
