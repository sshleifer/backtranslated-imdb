I thought this movie was the most beautiful of the Muppet films. I want to withdraw that statement. In my opinion now, the Lamp Muppets movie TV movie is pretty Meri Muppet Christmas, which breaks off a fantastic life that is truly horrendous. Muppets Manhattan is not nothing special, but the Merry Muppet Christmas is more enjoyable than Christmas. <br /> <br /> "I am on a Muppet Babies TV program I love the Muppet Babies Sequence here (I said Muppet Babies Show was inspired) <br /> <br /> Manhattan Melodies is also a real Shoestapper Sesame Street. But I want to know what a bit more entertaining between the beginning and the end.Break Shields and Gregory Hines and great dance sequences from Rizmo and Rats (lately danced by Jim Henson) and the movie is definitely exciting.I am a Muppet film, a great Muppet Capture and Muppet Christmas Oel Muppet movies are the three most accurate.
