<br /> I did not like the opera before because I hate soprano voices, but when he came into the 17-year-old and classic rock I've seen this film when he changed all that. He has an adorable and wonderful voice in the film. <br /> <br /> I heard in CNN that I was dead tonight at pancreatic cancer home, he missed, and he definitely left his mark in this world. If I find it, watch and have fun. * Smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and check before it's sold.
