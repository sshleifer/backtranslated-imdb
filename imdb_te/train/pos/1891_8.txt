When you watch this movie, Dudley Moore began to understand what was used lately. Our archive contains a dozen movies. <br /> <br /> As a comedian and musician for Hollywood, he has already performed the best talent. But mostly he remembered that he was pairing with Peter Cook on television and one or two different British films. Perhaps the best of them are 'badged'. <br /> He always hides through the cook, he breaks their partnership with envy and nudity and allows Moore to realize his true potential in the United States. 'Arthur' is the result. <br /> <br /> It's really fantastic movie. Moor's stupid comedy is like a drunkard. The script fits well in its manner of very sophisticated, almost surreal conversational digigions. I was actually surprised when he was something British about him and he found such appeal to American flavor. In the same fashion, Tommy Cooper tried to paint an anarchist comedian blank. <br /> <br /> Liza MÃ©my and John Guilgood take direct roles against him, but still have some fantastic one liners. Especially John Guilgood sees him sarcastic and vulnerable, a treasure to see. He steals any scene in his film and is well worthy of his Oscar. <br /> <br /> There is a follow-up movie called 'Arthur 2 - On the Rocks'. It will never achieve an enthusiastic level, but it's still good. Guilbud is the only one who plays a guest role in the beginning and as a ghost. It's dark. And there is some interesting spirit exploration. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seems to lose interest in Dudley in these two outings. <br /> He eventually returned to Britain, forgiven and was clearly dead. <br /> <br /> But what exactly is the 'Arthur' model? <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
