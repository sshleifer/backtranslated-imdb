This is a very strange film by director / animator Richard Williams. <br /> <br /> All of those who know about William's work know that it's a little off-kilter (though not intelligent), but this cake takes up. <br /> <br /> It's the two weird rudols pirate toy where their owner's new French doll has to protect a victim and find themselves at the mercy of many hideous characters along the way. The film's strength is primarily in its aesthetic quality; Its weird character models, its powerful animation and its contradictory contrast with sweets and horrors. The raggy aam and ory roles, like real rag dolls, floppy and darned, are more reliable (at least one visible) than Williams' amazing animated figures of ordinary cartoons. The animation controls the loneliness of each of us, and controls the silent-film chase with Sir Leonard Looney, in fact, bringing the camel-dipped knees with greedy. <br /> <br /> Greedy animation, on its own, is the most sensitive psychedelic animation I have ever seen. There is something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop - and every second is something new. Greedy who lives in what is considered a "tapi pit" is a big black man. He lives and eats sweets. <br /> <br /> I am singing a song in this movie, but I think some sex experiments have been made, then she tries to kill all of the candy hart for the candy hart. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of complaints about this film. Because it has six and half of them, it will constantly drop down the pace of the film. "I'm looking for, and what am I looking for?", "No Girl's Toy", "Blue" (they do not need to sing twice), "I Never Get Enough", "I Love You You" and " . " It's no surprise that others are simply unwanted and clear. <br /> <br /> It's a weird movie with strange experiments, but what you're looking for is not good for you.
