I understand this movie for the first time and this is great. It has the feel and speed of "real indie", and director Todd Yellin is clearly judgment and judgment of photographic and editorial vision, mature and seasoned professional. The shots are well-made, thought and move forward to the story. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomons deliver scripts to a story that contains more depth and lyrics than "painting the number of stories". It is a story that Jard Hirsch Caliber character needs to have a shot at work. Jude is usually amazing; Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd. But Elliott Carte, who played the role of Adam Goulden, is a real surprise. Yellin was able to easily be naked out of the young actor in a role that was reduced to the value by stereotype or overreach. However, the film is refreshing and entertaining.
