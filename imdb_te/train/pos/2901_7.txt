Tiempo de Valientes Buddy Action fits snugly in the movie genre, but surpasses its roots thanks to excellent casting, tremendous understanding between its leads, and outstanding photography. Diego Pierretty as Dr. Silverstein was assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods, allowing him to turn the gun with Detective Diaz (Louise Luke), and appear to be involved in the weapons smuggling conspiracy. Diaz is suspended from duty, but he has to be the best person for a job and have professional psychological help to restart. Sylvester and Diaz are soon engaged in Argentina's intelligence community and some uranium conspiracy, and the film separates them as a crucial factor in the development of some of their own sleeping skills. Peretti and Luque are amazing and the screen team reminded me of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, although not as classically beautiful as Peretti Hill. Notably, nearly two hours long timpo di valiantes do not wear its welcome, and in fact the writer-director Damian Eszipron sets the potential sequel in the beautiful coda of the film. All in all, an incredible and very entertaining action comedy is insulting panders or your intelligence to the lowest common denominator.
