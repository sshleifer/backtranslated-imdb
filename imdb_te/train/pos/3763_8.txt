Now it's very fond! The first film has some iffy dialogue and some weaker acting, but this seems like the team behind has got their stuff together for their sequel and put out a solid, completely enjoyable, hilarious and creative comic to keep everyone on the edge of their seats. Seriously, this is a mix of creativity, filled with great stuff, which is not related to sarcastic 80 movies at the same time . The scenes in Hell are great, so in heaven. This is a promise, and there is no shortage of the mad cap adventurous romp you'll never see another movie like this. The ending of the film's final acting is not as bad as the first one, it's generally fun and enjoyable, it's the most clich√© display of the fun of family fun films. And while Keen Reeves is looking at about 30, here's not bad. <br /> I think it sounds like a good deal.
