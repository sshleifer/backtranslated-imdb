I've been reading some other users' comments and decided to put one of them. Some users will remain in the 'virtual' type of psychology. This film is considered a 'fantasy' .... if there is a 'fun movie'. It does not feel 'true' or extreme. Although the shadow of the explosion is a shadow of the explosion, it's a pleasure to all of us when it comes ... At that time I'm 30 years old and enjoying this experience - my youngest son also loved it! Later, I shared with my daughter and she loved me too. SpaceCamp is a fun family image that should be enjoyable - fun. All 'real' documents in the world can be viewed by documentaries or documentaries and any other type must be omitted or obscured. For young people who first viewed this movie, they really could go to SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one in Wandenberg AFB in California) - they felt the same type of environment to find the film and then felt 'depressing' ... I guess their parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh! Good. If you love fantasy-fun movies and do not see this, I would highly recommend it! Have fun!
