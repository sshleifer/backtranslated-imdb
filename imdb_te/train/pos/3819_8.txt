I waited for a long time to watch this film, and finally found at the Istanbul Film Festival. Perhaps, I was very much expected from this film, so I was disappointed. I'm not the best film from Korea, but it really is worth watching. <br /> This thing is great. But there are spaces in the picture and you jump from one point to another. However, Geon Do-yen's performance is beautiful. It is one of the best performances in the history of the first film and I think it's not good if I'm not in the lead role.
