Sports films are never my thing, but the smallest of them works for me. The best thing to focus on sport and more on the role of the reckoning bull, wrestler and girlfight. It is directed by Kareen Kusama and is Mitchell Rodriguez's best first appearance. Girlfriend concept is realistic and both are involved, so it's enough to make a memorable image <br /> <br /> The plot is enough strait forward. Diana Guzman is in her fourth year high school, but she is close to relegation due to her picking fights in the hall. <br /> She will sign up for boxing lessons in the club that trains her brother. During ninety minutes, we see the viewers exceptional. Diana is almost literally a girl from a girl. When one of the boys in the club finds herself attracted to her, we can see her behavior, as well as her behavior, and she will get it. There is no bad scene or lame / compounded moment in this movie. The only mistake I can say is correct, one of the suburbs ends in an incomplete note. Since then, Girlfriend is a great movie.
