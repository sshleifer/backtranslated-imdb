A single mother (Diane Keaton) learns that she works in minimum wage jobs. When she is removed, she finds that her sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts) are unable to support her, who has asthma. Then she goes to her friend and selling drugs starts. She soon becomes addicted to the drugs she sells. Her life drops, especially her children, their eldest son, when she finds the truth and threatens to leave her. Then, she struggles to redeem her with the help of her children, but can she protect her family from the drug lord she has worked for? <br /> Wow! This film has the best performance I have ever seen! Diane Keaton is very high, and her role comes as crazy but she is very convincing. She is much better suited to drama than her comedy. However, the best performance from the film came from Michael Seater, who played her son. He is still the youngest child in charge, but he is the eldest in the family. His performance is great in the scene where he faces his mother about drugs. <br /> <br /> A good looking movie is essentially about acting from Michael Seater and Dyer Keaton.
