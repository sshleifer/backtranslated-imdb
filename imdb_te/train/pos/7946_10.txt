This film is a real masterpiece, it really is. It's rare that you come across such a heartfelt image with a little fun, laughter, heart break, and a little drama to keep on your toes. <br /> <br /> The real family picture, Howard Bound tells the story of their brake pets, crossing Rocky Mountains in an attempt to find their masters, along the way. The ability to give the animals the human personality - one of the really amazing things about this film - the voice acting is good. Shadow is a fantastic character, an old, wise and brave, and a very powerful moving moment looking at him to save the saucer in the river. Possibility - Who does not like a dog like Chance? The most unfortunate and friendly kid he ever showed on the big screen. And the saucy is so witty for a cat - she has me in her piercing when mocking her keeper; 'Here kitty kitty kitty ... not in your life, chubby.' <br /> <br /> Sassy Waterfall (I'm really scared for her), falling in Shadow (almost tears), amazing ending, when three pets come back home ... including good old shadows! <br /> Fans of all time - Do not like animals that do not like this movie. Rent it or buy it now, and it will leave you a lifetime of happy memories.
