This film is one of my all time favorite. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. ... Which cast. Sam Jaffe did not mention Ganga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy. Today, the final fighting scene still moves me and the end always leaves me with tears. If you do not see, I will recommend it.
