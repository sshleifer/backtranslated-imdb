This film is amazing. If you have a chance, look at it. However, a warning, you'll be tears out of your eyes. I'll do, every time I see it, and I've got it and have seen it many times. The performances are the best. It deals with darkness and pain and loss, but there is hope. This film has seen the world differently: with my experience, according to my English teacher. Also, if you have seen, note the use of shadows and light. The real room - an outstanding image of the home room because of excellent acting, amazing story, and heart-wrenching conversation, and I rated 10/10 -. For a long time, very moving. Not all answers, but it makes good things about humanity
