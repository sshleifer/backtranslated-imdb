The simplest is a ghoulish horror film, which moves through the motion and the downside and downside of the man's fraudulent / distrust. Father (we can not learn his name) The mother is a delicate man and loving father who increases his sons. Dad goes into the boys' room and tells him that God has given him a vision. And what's the focus ?? <br /> <br /> "The Father destroys the God who demolishes the demons, captures them, Fenton, an old boy, is a frightened murderer who becomes a murderer, Adam, young, uncomfortable, but believes he is following God's will. /> <br /> In the end, the father took his father to his father's "demonic" blows and put his father in the list of God, meaning an abusive father, who loves his children, who follows the instructions of God: "This is our job, Son, we came to do this. "Fenton was horrified, his father was mad and he was reported to the police The father explains: "If you do, the son will die I will die." The child's death is unbearable and tragic, and their whole lives creep. (1) The Freubba agent is similar to the simple structure of the image used in a simple story of the police station . Moody lighting, stormy weather and calm weather today can cause backstory continuity. I thought the horror of the ending was just a story, and I remembered Andrey Yets's real-life parallel, believing that she was caught by Satan and saving her by drowning her. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, rather than the story of divine vengeance, I believe I am looking for human tragedies. </ P> <p> The accuracy of the dad's vision. And this, like some plots holes, me encountered a problem. Even if the victims are not subject to the accuracy of father's victims, who will have the power to act as an angel of death?
