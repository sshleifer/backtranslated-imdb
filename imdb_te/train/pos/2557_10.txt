I, I am a kid at heart, I still love watching cartoons, still do! I remember watching Bugs Bunny when I was a kid, he was still my favorite. "I'm looking at him when I was a child, I'm looking for him" and "I'm young," Dad, bugs are you younger than I was a great "new" appearance on TV, and my dad. I think he's absolutely genius more than one generation, maybe 3. I love kids and adults, okay, great everyone's show. It's very funny, me and my husband, both in our 20s, love watching the shows, and we do not mind running back either. This show brings many memories and happy ones. I love Tini's little TIMA Christmas special, it's beautiful. I can not choose the role of my favorite Looney Doons, which have changed over the years. Of course when I got quite a bit of bugs, and Porky Pig. Pepe is cool, I always love him. Actually, I have to say my favorite there. It's incredible for all ages, so funny and voice acting is incredible, and I'm giving this presentation to 10 to 10 people, unfortunately it ended 2 decades ago, but it's great!
