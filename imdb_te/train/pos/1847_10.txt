You can never forget that you have many of the things in your life. It's a real and true story of a beautiful and moving movie. I dare say that this film is very low. It shows us the reality of life ... the more bad you meet, the better you are. Trust your instincts and live the happiness of life ... without revenge, without living under "a rock". The concept of cinema is very interesting ... connecting storytelling with real life events ... to keep us aware of all the facts of emotion! Bless these people and be happy to everyone! See it, I recommend it to all young people. It's not about racism, how it's to live your life!
