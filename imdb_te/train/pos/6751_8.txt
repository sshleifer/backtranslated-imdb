Good image from preming; When the sets and locals explore the labyrinth, from different angles and perspectives, it's like a natural picture of the modern city's residents and how they live. <br /> <br /> Don Andrews, it is dominated by Hamlet, and is not always good. The story may be a pure drama but Andrews gives the weight and increases it almost to the level of tragedy. Jean Thurney is attractive to her girl, but unnoticed. Gary Merrill is a very interesting villain, with his natural warmth that gives Andrews coolness a good contrast; His laughing, durable-inspiring bad guy is constantly chasing him, he is mentally open, he is strongly wounded and opposed to the moral policing that follows him. <br /> <br /> There is no big surprise in this film. It was a reunion with director Laura's actors, Andrews and Tirene for director Primer, whose career peaked at the top of the film. Supported Cast - Merrill, Carl Malden, Neville Brand - all of these, they are more positive. Primer, as an observer, always opens without expressing a perspective opinion, because morally the faint end is disappointing because the cat and mouse game between the two enemies is bigger and more arctic than any larger feature films. /> <br /> <br /> <br />
