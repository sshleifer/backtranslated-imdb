OK, I did not imagine what I saw when I saw the cover of Fido, and honestly I came across in the video store when I was tempted to rent this movie, but nothing about it really grabbed my attention. But when I was looking around in Netflix, they made a statement like crazy if they liked the "Goofy" scary movies, so I figured I give a shot. I'm so glad I saw it, it's just a great movie, it's absolutely fun and pretty looking. As I said, it meets Pleasantville Night of the Living Dead, what a great feeling, what happens after a mega zombie attack? As we have seen in another zombie comedy, in the shawn of the Dead, they enjoy the make-up of zombies that are "handy" citizens. This is a very neglected horror / comedy movie, I think most people have blown away with the shawn of the dead that got this boot. <br /> <br /> This is a great story and the cast is perfect and it just became a really funny movie. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s alternate universe, radiation from space shifted the dead to the dead. This radiation still affects humanity, and all the dead after the original pollution will die. In order to continue with normal lives, the unions are committed to the help of the administrative agency Zomcon. Zonan provides remote controls to control 'hungry' for meat to use slaves or servicemen. In the town of Willard, a homemaker, Helen, bought a zombie despite her husband Bill's zombie fear. Their son, Timmy, calls him "Fido", and friendship with the zombie. One day Fido's collar deficiency and he kills their next-door neighbors, which turns into a zombie. Timmy zombie "kills" the neighbors. When a pair of local gates blame the missing neighbors, they catch Fido and Timmy. Helen arrives and saves the nuts and Fidos from harassment and they try to forget about the whole thing. Several days later, neighbors' body was found and Fido was found to be the killer, he went to Zamon, where he was told to be destroyed. Timmy learns by a friend who is just working at a factory at Zomcon. <br /> <br /> Phimo directs Timmy to rescue him with the help of his neighbors with his friend, hoping to get back. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to see this, I would really recommend this film. But it is very fun. Billy Connelly did a great job with Fido and really brought in, pun intended, a lot of life in the role. When I attacked and killed Timmy Fido, she was so funny with her last words, "You're not really nice, but you liked the flowers, the scene that made the most laugh when the old woman was burry?" And he buries her garden. Zombie girlfriend is sick, disturbing, wrong, but not to mention the classic smiling neighbor. Although it's still like being out of the Beaver-Esquire type in the world, I'm still in love, still there's a lot of gore in the movie. <br /> If you are looking for Fidon, take it, and I promise some good laughs. <br /> <br />
