From the movie, the TV series Beavitch of the 1960s has to think about it. The film was made by Jimmy Stewart & Kim Novak alongside Alfred Hitchcock, starring alongside Vertigo. <br /> <br /> It is supported by both Jack Lemons's 10th film and Ernie Kovacs. The film has a lot of good stuff about it. Hermione Gingold is very good in the film, and she's good to support here because she's in The Music Man. This cast is great. <br /> <br /> In the late 1950s, the New York City experiences were of concern. <br /> <br /> It's not Vertigo, but the audience did not do that after reading the film. It's appropriately good - certainly William Asher is happy to see it, thereby creating the 1960s series. I'm not happy what Ferrell did on the big screen, it's better than this film.
