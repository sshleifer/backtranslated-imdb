Gorgeous over-acting by Leslie Ann Warren. The best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen, and the clothes are second to none of the love sequences in the warehouse. On the face of the corn is a classic, good as anything in the blazing saddle. It is also wonderful to take advocates. After allegations of being a turncot, he said, "I'm a lawyer," since Pepto Bolt's lawyer was honest and sold to his owner. Three Funny Words. Jeffrey Tambour, then a fan of the Larry Sanders program, is also a mad millenniar to bow to the ghetto. His character is more subtle than usual. The scene, where the hospital scene, and a demolition of homeless attacked the site, were all time classic. Look for the legs scene and two bigger dickers fighting (one blades). Every time I watch this movie is better (this is very often).
