I could see this movie thoroughly and it was moved deeply. I'm not sure if it's really a comedy or play - it has both. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper both looked spectacular - 60 years old ladies our image was definitely changed from Aunt Bee! They are vibrant, beautiful, sexy! There is no mention of other characters in 1970's "MTM" or "Rhoda" shows. When I was in New York City (when "Roda" was set) I felt that some of the references were made to her sister Brenda or Julie Cawner. In Big Apple <br /> <br /> My hope is that ABC can bring back all of these shows to the series and guest roles. By the way, what is the CBS reunion or ultimately in the series? Is not the network conducted by "MTM" and "Rhoda" programs?
