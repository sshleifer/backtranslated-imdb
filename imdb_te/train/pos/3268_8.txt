A beautiful romantic comedy. The plot is a bit complicated - I've tried to summarize it three times and I can not. That's enough to say it's worth it. The film is cute, funny - the plot is completely unreal but it works. Everyone in this movie is very good and everything is great - it creates a sweet, romantic feel through the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is very good - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepard are in the top form and are delighted every second. Ryan O'Neil and Mary Stuart Masterson are just right but good. If you're a sucker for good, sweet sentiment movies (like me), this one is a catch. <br /> <br /> Additional bonuses - Additional bonus - "The Next After" is another great song sung by Johnny Mathis sung the title song and Cher and Peter Cetera.
