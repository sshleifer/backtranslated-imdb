Young The first film of Lincoln John Ford and Henry Fonda's director / star collaborator. <br /> <br /> Forward is a young actor that he feared and was scared of playing Abraham Lincoln feared. <br /> <br /> Before the filming of John Ford, he said he was going to play the Great Emanciparium, just as Jack Leg prairie was going to be an advocate. Fundo settled with a cast directed by John Ford in a classic film. <br /> This is not a biography of Lincoln. One year after Young Mr. Lincoln, along with Walter Huston, Raymond Massey performed a pulitzer prize by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Fonda did not play the Great Emancipate, a small town attorney in Illinois, as Ford said. The film is about 10 years of Lincoln's early life. We saw him in a simple shop and received some laws from the migrant pioneer family, after which he again crossed the story. <br /> <br /> After 10 years, Lincoln's current practice lawyer has begun to get some notice. He served a few terms in the legislature, but he was not sure if he was in politics again. <br /> <br /> Most of the action takes place here. When the two sons of the family were murdered, he brought back the legal books back. He offers to protect them. And one simple murder but one of the deputy sheriffs. <br /> <br /> The trial is supported by Lincoln in the genuine case of a gangbeard used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quilon, who played Fiction, but two sons. <br /> <br /> Unlike appearances, Young Mr. Lincoln's great strength is John Ford's mood and atmosphere and a small Illinois prairie town in the fourth. July celebration. You look like a news reel. <br /> <br /> John Ford movie fans later recognize two musical themes recurring in musical films. The same theme as Liberty Wallen's Shot the Man Who Music for The Waver Miles in the background is music from the beginning of romance between Fonda and Pauline Moore. And in a dance, Tune plays Lovely Susan Brown Forda and Marjorie Weaver as Mary Todd, who also danced with Fondo Kathy Downs, and danced to raise a church in the grave with my darling Clementine. <br /> <br /> Lincoln is a favorite subject of many biographers and playwrights. First he is the embodiment of our own American legendary country about growing people from the overpriced authority through their own efforts. In fact, Mr. Young Lincoln shows a background from the very graphical Lincoln background. The latter is our president during the great crisis in American history and he has taken a good and moral decision to free free liberty during the necessary civil war, but for some necessary political reasons. <br /> <br /> In addition to Fonda and others, I mentioned special praise, Fred Cohler, Jr. and Ward Bond, the entry of two towns, Kohler murdered victim and Bond as the main complainant. Coventell and Quinn's pioneer mother, her last film as a prosecutor lawyer, and Donald McGall as Alice Brady. <br /> <br /> For Spencer Charter's good acting, you can not make you better than Young Mr. For a film that captures the play and love of the set time.
