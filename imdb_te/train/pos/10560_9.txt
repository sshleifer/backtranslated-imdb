<br /> <br /> The story of love, hypnotism, feminine and dancing is a platform in the story of Jimmy Cognney races in the story of the producer constantly filled with your eyes. As a viewer you can never be forgiven. Direction of massive scenes in rehearsal rooms is great. <br /> <br /> Some of the pieces here have become quite a bit dated, but this is not very important because if you see this in the 1933 time frame <p> <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cognney is looking for the throat eyes in the film, Never lose his satisfaction, producing work on previews made for movie theaters. In this way he tries to save his donkey out of business, and he is a Broadway producer before he starts this. Jon Blondel is ignorant of love-interest, naan, a lady who has been portrayed as a strong woman for a change, which makes movies such an extraordinarily awesome performance at the time. <br /> <br /> I am the only problem with the film and are ultimately enormous structures. These are excellent in itself, beautifully directed and produced in wonderland, but they just did not seem to fit the story. They have to put 3 previews in 3 days to get the only link to the main story Cognizant and what he does. The girls were rehearsing during the whole film and I worked hard to find these sets fit in a movie theater. <br /> <br /> In the end, the productions seemed to have pulled this crazy story into a hole, which is not good. I was tired of seeing the first music series, and then there was another two. <br /> <br /> These scenes also come from the audience with many shirts. <br /> <br /> All the suds are all great films. <br /> <br />
