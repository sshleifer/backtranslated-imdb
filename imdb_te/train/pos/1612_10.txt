The film stands on the head and shoulders above the majority of movie romantic comedies. It's actually flawless! Writing, acting, product design, humor and sadness are all fantastic! <br /> <br /> Like La Martin from Den Martin - Attractive and Happy! <br /> <br /> Each character is particularly exhilarating and memorable from characters from Cher and Nicholas Kage. For many supporting roles - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Garderia, John Mahoney, and Danny Illo - grandfather with his dog pack! Norman Jussen, the director of each of these performers, performs their general quality in this collective work. For many actors, it was initially released in the film, so actors were exceptional - and there are many current acting powerboards that have changed their careers by their influence on the film. <br /> <br /> I have seen this film all the time - sometimes it significantly reduces the effect of cinema. More to say, a few years ago I made a move from the movie to a scene - any scene - the scene was compelling and beautifully designed. The most exciting and memorable scenes are the original meeting between Cher and Nicholas Cage characters, where Cage cries out his story; Vincent Garderea found with his pythor in the opera in the wake of his gold mine pumping business; Olympia Dukakis confronted John Mahni with his student's co-workers in the Classic line of discourse about sexual relations: "You are eating!"; Danny Iel at his dying mother bed; Nicholas Cage "Boo" in the background in the background like an aria rapture! <br /> Among them are Sabrina (two versions, most notably Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden) are great romantic comedies; Harry Met Sally; <br /> No one is equal to the Moon Struck!
