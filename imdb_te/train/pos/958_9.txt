Wow! I've seen very low budget images lately, but it's pretty cool. The original filming of police life in the city of the East German coast is contrary to other crime films or series. I love the lead actress and the full rejection of the clich√©s about the police. This film is as entertaining as a drama as realistic and at the same time as a documentary. Perfect transfer!
