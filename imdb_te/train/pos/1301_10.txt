I liked all of the cream of the cream, even if there was a small and valuable catalog of work to hold. Rock up the socks more than half of any rock law they still have to rock for some of their songs (the narrow and off-of-doors off the towels) and even still rock today. This power for the gel on stage was one of the rock band reunions ever unexpected with their Royal Albert Hall last year. Older people have their fans, but the power still exists, classic blues songs as well as their own great arrangements. White Room, badge, politician, spoonful, sunshine of your love, does not lose a beat. Sometimes Clapton's Solos is no longer on stage with his solo band. Ginger Baker, said enough. Jack Bruce is still sturdy with his voice, and Clapton can never get any strength. Bottom line, if you want to see what's the best performances you saw last year (well, some of them can be seen), this is on the DVD with these unique features.
