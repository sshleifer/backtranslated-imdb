It's not the best of the "Dirty Harry" series. From opening credits, you are wiped out in a strongly beaten revenge story and seriously absorbing. Sondra Locke is definitely in the role of an infected woman for revenge. There are many "next side" sequences in Eastwood, which are nothing to do with the plot, but Harry appears to be the best in his evil. The film is loaded with rocks with unforgettable characters in small roles and should work as a standard for detective / action flicks. This dirty Harry film is in "dark color". I'll see again (ok, not sitting in the same place) because it's a pleasure for "vengeance". The pace is quick and many scenes are unforgettable. "Go ahead - make me my day ... you lucky, punk? ...." Yeastwood, like Eastwood, could be a threatening voice with his anguish, rubber expressions, and vespers.
