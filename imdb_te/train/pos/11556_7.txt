Jack Lemmon and Walter Mantou began their career together and ended up. Remember that we are laughing as the oldest man's Krungyest, as well as the endless couple, Lemmon and Matthew at Hollywood's best-loved comedy teams over the last 100 years. Instead, Prior and Wilder are not "undesirable", they are the classic comedy team that reflects the more modern Marx Brothers Routine. Such physical comedy and Marx, Chaplin and Keaton are a well-known confusion combined mixture. In the Ad Couple, Lesman and Mattev play the opposite games that create confusion. Physical comedy is similar to chaplains. The joke is usually the opposite of the joke being opposite. Not your typical Guy film, the age of comedy against two older adults who are in their age with two young people. The chemistry between the limeon and the mathou is fun. This is not a movie for everyone, it's a great comedy.
