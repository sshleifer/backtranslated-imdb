I was fortunate enough to see this without any pre-view hype. The next day I was shocked to give the ghost film's respite back to my mind, the next day. I saw it 3-4 times, and every time I appreciate it. The settings are gorgeous, the evening town has beautiful light effects, marsh long shots, and the house is also grown with enough moss. The main hero is so fond of him that he is easily sympathetic, and good. I would tell a man who complained that there is no 'spark' in the film, because this is the only one who has been fighting against the ghost. This is a slow-paced film, which spends extra time, before and after the ghost attack, improving his character with family and work life. <br /> When I came back to the main town and met with the one who helped him, explaining the ghost, especially turning back. He recounts the black woman, and then he says he's going to the end of the conversation, because after all, what's wrong with her? Another person says, "You can not go back alone!" And the hero gives his dog. <br /> <br /> Cute little dog offers little relief of comic relief, which can also go home and lock the room. <br /> <br /> Many casual shows of ghost really ignored me. It shows that the church is baked in the middle of the church, showing that it is not afraid of the church and does not shy or abide at home. It's very early. Another incredible unforgettable sight was seen with children outside the church fence looking at the funeral. When the camera rises to the right, the woman appears in the background of the grave. The old man does not even see it, but the kids are all yelling and taunting. Krerie ... usually ghosts are shadows, special places or people are chasing. Mentioned, the devil's fragility and anger are frightening, and I feel the attacks and the end is perfect and completely defended. Finally, the hero made a big mistake by going back home. Or maybe he was found by any thing, by sparing the cauldron girl. The person who manages the hotel manager is so believable, and fills the character really well. I am spreading this comment to my friends about how I enjoyed this movie, and I am assuring myself that others see it as well. <br /> <br /> I think most reviews of the film have been hype. </ P> <p> The question is whether ghosts can physically harm a man. Whenever I plan to watch tonight again, yes yes. Any other movies to recommend? <br /> <br /> Thanks,
