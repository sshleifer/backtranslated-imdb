When Steven Spielberg presents a film, people are not good, the film is no exception. Some of the movies I love are very low at the box office, but the film is not one of them (nine million dollars, I do not feel bad again). The characters were fun, the animation was not clear and fuzzy, and the music was modern, which was unusual for the animated film. I do not think it's too scary for Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Cyrus" (for a target audience for this movie) for the younger child, but ultimately the creepy professor was very dark for a small child what I thought was the picture I thought. Overall, this film is a fun and enchanting classic that I loved over the years.
