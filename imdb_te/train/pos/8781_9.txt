I feel a bit familiar with boxing movies as a bit and it's the only thing that "Gentleman Jim" is calling you to be the best boxing movie ever. Robert Wise / Paul Newman film "Somebody Up There Likes Me" This image may be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is very close. <br /> <br /> The film is just James James. Ordering the growth of Corbett, which is the crucial time of the game's transition to boxing. From the cruel days of boxing and bare-knuckle rules to the late 1800s, the queensbury's rules remained a more "courteous" day of Marquis. <br /> <br /> It is illegal to stay away from sports when it comes to illegal landscapes and acceptance and respectable time intervals. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is not realistic in those days. It's virtualized and, yes, sometimes even a bit hokey. But always do so hilariously. Errol Flynn "Gentleman" is perfect as gym, which is not really a "gentleman", but a fast talker from a working class. Alexis Smith is very courageous for herself as a high-profile woman who has a relationship with love / hate (and we know the love that ultimately won that match). <br /> "Gentleman Jim" great John L Sullivan (whose famous line of course "I Can not Play Any Person In The World" ... again Romanticism) joined hands on his belt to the corbets. This is one of the best scenes in any sports move that really made. Realistic? No. But amazing. Hey, if you want realism instead of "ragging bull" instead. This is a more realistic boxing movie. But "Gentleman Jim" is very fun.
