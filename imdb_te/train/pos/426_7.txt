On a lazy Friday afternoon, Fox featured in the movie film, I can not think of a good way to spend a lazy Friday evening in the value of my two cents. Especially when you consider the lack of user comments. Need more than four comments for each image, good or bad? <br /> <br /> The first thing to keep in mind when looking at the film like April Love is to remember in the last half of this scenario. Films were very happy at that time. The screens are without tragedy when the screens are filled with technique Carlar films to distance people from the gray light of the evil medium in the box called television. <br /> <br /> Teen Idol Pot Boon plays the role of a young teenager Nick Conover. He was sent to live in the country with his aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and Uncle Zed (Arthur O'Connell) to steal the car. It seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son (Zed Jr.), so Uncle Zed seems to have lost his lifestyle. Zed expressed his fears in the hope that Aunt Hendrietta kept Nick on agriculture. The plot lines are that Jade and Nick really do not work for each other. Zedd then goes to meet neighbors, Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Immediately, Jade fosters love for Fran, and of course I do not need to tell you that I will develop a love in the Lid Zed. Then Uncle Zed's horse, a trotter turned into the forest and does not let anyone from the death of Zed Junior. You can fill in everything that happens from that point of your own, and it's not a real surprise to see how it's there. <br /> <br /> If you're a bad boy, you get on the image of squeaky Clean Pot Boon, you will have trouble with the rest of the picture. If it is noticed, Boon Nick performs a surprisingly good performance. Definitely the character does not need much depth, but it's a neat job when you least expect it. Proper selection for Arthur O'Connell, like ZD As he goes early, he can not reach and be cold, but when he is slowly warming up, he is looking really good. Jeannette Nolan is much more fun as Henrietta, a regular intermediary between Jade and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers and Hammerstein and she gets some opportunity to help her with the singing talent. Like Liz, she's cute to hear, great to hear, and at times very funny. <br /> <br /> The best thing about April Love is that there is no real Kannier character on screen. The whole thing is not a real villain. Everyone likes a hole that you like, you can not help but enjoy the movie. I found honestly very refreshing, putting your problems behind you and enjoying summer picnic with friends. Think of old Andy Griffith display with musical numbers, a little more plot and wide screen technicians. The songs are mixed bag, the title song April Love is the best of them. Another thing that I really like is that they do not fall back using the blue screen backgrounds during the horse racing scenes, and they are quite bit more entertaining and exciting because they are. In fact, it is good to look at the whole picture as beautifully photographed and confusing in the department. The chemistry between Jones and Boon is good. <br /> <br /> The reluctance between Nick and Zed is portrayed as an attempt to gain the respect of others. <br /> <br /> This film will never be confused with great movie. And instead, instead of going to Disneyland, a park requires a nice vacation, and what is April Love. <br /> My grade: B + <br /> <br />
