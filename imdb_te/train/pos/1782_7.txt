I saw this picture three times. For the last time, I kept skipping around the confusing scenes to find clarity for the plot. Probably the plot was not logged to logically hang. <br /> <br /> An outrageous approach to distant events is very bad. <br /> Take the young en grant (Claire Danes). Here a young girl attended a nameless college of accents of a great family. She must have help with this expensive education, but no family relationships have never been at all. <br /> <br /> When she influences the consequences of her wrong decisions, she has no relatives. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Then, after Harris Leila upheld after her brother's sad tragic death, Ana suddenly bored him and was bored with his own behavior. I must miss something important here. On behavior is totally absurd. He quit his relationship with Yan Harris and eventually marries one of the bridesmaids of Laila's wedding. <br /> <br /> Despite denying Harris's veneration, she has deep feelings about her death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> </ ref> Harris is still on the scene where Lee's marriage is a scene where they have a deeper feel. <br /> <br /> The film has shown a model for Ann's romantic relationships. She always fell with her people and she refused. This model took place with Harris and two husbands. In contrast, Leila married a man who did not love her and remained with her husband until she died. <br /> <br /> Lila has been able to build a relationship because Leila refuses to marry her marriage. <br /> <br /> Then Leila Ross's comfortable return of the child came back. Apparently Nons Lie was able to identify and extract enough information from the last few great moments on to contact. Nothing in this conversation is found in this movie. <br /> <br /> I thought about the house where Ana lives in his last days. How to buy a small amount of money in his singing career? <br /> <br /> In online, an economic frontier was seen in a phase before developing two daughters. <br /> <br /> At another level, I enjoyed the setting and music of the film. The seaside building is just hearty and beautiful. Claire Danes is bright as young an en grant. She is really a very talented singer. I very much love her natural brunette in the bottle blonde look in her image extras. If only that awkward CGI fireflies go away, I could not raise the whole point of the image in my vote!
