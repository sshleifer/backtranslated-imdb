<br /> I've read the comic book and have seen it in the video store and decided to give it a chance. <br /> Animation is ok, I've given me a sense of 80 Amame, which was set for me. <br /> <br /> Everyone hates me. <br /> <br /> The character development is good. I brought a transition from Hope to Lady Death. Because you do not like it, it's not clear. Lucifer tells how it happened, and she used her words. <br /> <br /> She is a good teacher / soldier. <br /> I think it is necessary for everybody to look at and review it all the way. For everyone, the favorite Anime Vampire Hunter D is the hardest push of all the people
