It is the type of image you want to see with a glass of wine, fire, and your feet up. It does not need much to follow the power of the brain, so it's very good after a long day. I'm so untrue - if you're looking for something bad, do not worry, but it's very funny. If a businessman agrees to live in the slum for a while and actually enjoy it ... I would definitely recommend it.
