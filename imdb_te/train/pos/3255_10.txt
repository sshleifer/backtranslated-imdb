Each scene is perfectly integrated. The film has an amazing cast and crew. I mean, you have a bad picture with Robert Downey Jr., there is no one and never existed. He has the ability to brighten any movie with his amazing talent.This film is perfect! I saw this film sitting on a film shelf in "blockbuster" and as I would call it, I could not pick it up and could not bring it home with me. You can call me a lovely fantasy, but the film did not touch my heart, and at the same time did not say that I laughed with pleasure. Even if it killed me, in the end, I finally discover my whole life. My horror, action, and a ludicrous comedy is a brother who has totally admired the film. This feeling is a good picture. It laughs out loud, touching your heart, falling in love, and enjoying your life. Every time you deliberately walk in the movie, you are consciously chooses to live and feel this inspirational movie. Who knows? If it's possible for you, and keep your mind open to the spiritual wonders of life.
