Who knows? Bowie Monarch, a real monk for Dowdy Queen Victoria, a real monk for 40 years since her husband, Prince Albert, died in her childhood days of drama and conspiracy. <br /> <br /> 'Young Victoria' is not only a young queen's sex with her husband, but also a nice job of describing the political machinations around her ascension to the throne. After the birth of Victoria's father Duke of Kent, after the birth of Victoria, the Duchess of Kent was eventually tied up with former Army commander John Conroy, who was the widow and her baby queen - should be developed to develop Victoria in the 'Kensington System' <br /> <br /> In 1830 the Parliament Regency Act passed, which is still small when Victoria's Motherland (and hence the Guardian) reaches Victoria's throne. At this time, the Duchess and Conroy unrequited She tried to scare the princess and she was her personal secretary and Co. The strongest rest was Victoria, who refused to go along with the worst plans of Conroy and her mother, the Duchess King did not like William because he felt disrespectful to the monarchy as a luxury man; The king felt that the Duchess would respect his wife. As a result, the Duchess tried to limit Victoria's relationship with the king. In the over-the-top scene that was originally seen in history, King stuck with Duchess at his birthday party, claiming that Victoria was her goal of surviving until her 18th birthday, so that her mother did not become regent. <br /> <br /> King William puts his word and dies shortly after qualifying for Victoria's throne. Victoria took revenge for her supporting her in childhood, blaming her as a child. They were expelled from the Buckingham Palace separated apartment and for many years Victoria had little contact with her mother. <br /> <br /> 'The Young Victoria' surrounded Victoria's coronation surroundings. . A good part of the film portraying Victoria's relationship with Lord Melbourne, the wig party's prime minister, unfortunately, was filmed at a younger age. Initially earning the Melbourne Young Queens Trust, they became good friends. In the early years of her reign, she sees Melbourne as a progressive, but as he becomes a common politician, he loses some respect and hides his contempt for the people he has done. In fact, Melbourne is the father of Victoria, but the film has led to some sexual tension between the lead actors and Prince Albert, who are romantic rivals. <br /> <br /> When the Melbourne Force is forced to leave the plot are thicker and Queen new Pel√©, the more conservative Tory party, the new prime minister. The film describes the events of The Bedchamber Crisis, where Peel resigned after Victoria refused to replace some bedroom ladies of wives with the Tolle politicians. The film emerged from another scandal involving Lady Hastings, who had been waiting for the Duchess ladies-in-waiting, to be linked to John Conroy and was alleged to have become pregnant. Because of her hatred for Conroy, Victoria Hastings has contributed to the rumors of the spread of the alleged pregnancy. As it turned out, Hastings only appeared to be pregnant, in fact her abdominal tumor. Victoria's experience shows during the bedrock crisis but the filmmakers ignored some of the uneven things in the film which clearly showed in the Hastings affair. <br /> <br /> 'Young Victoria' course - Romance between the Queen and Prince Albert. Victoria Albert retained the film, which was apparently apparent, because she wanted to make her sense of the new sovereign slightly less familiar. <br /> <br /> Albert spent a good time with each other until returning to England and Victoria supported during the breakout of the bedroom crisis. <br /> <br /> Prince Albert and Prince Philips are very good parallels between the current Queen's husband. Although Philip was mainly Danish, he went to school in Germany and with German-backed in-laws. Albert and Philip both did business in court (courtesy of George III for George III, and Albert finds that the servants still make the table). Philip was Monarch's husband in Albert's fight, and they had to do something. <br /> <br /> Albert and Philip both participated in various civic projects and demonstrated that they did not live in the shadow of their continued celebrity wives. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, at the end of the film, the spectacular scene was criticized by Albert Victoria as being her 'interference' in her affairs. Albert is in the second 'bedroom crisis' so he goes over his wife's head and arranges a companion with Victoria's bed ladies. <br /> When Victoria did not speak to Albert, the murderers cut nearly two cuts (the film was shot in Albert Arm but never happened). <br /> <br /> Performances in the film are uniformly excellent, Principles, Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. Young Victoria suddenly ends and closed credits turn to hagiography (most not to mention Victoria's disappointment after Albert's death). But 'Victoria' is still an attractive play and lovely history lesson.
