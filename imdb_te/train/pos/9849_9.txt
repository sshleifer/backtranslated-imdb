When I saw the trailers I saw this movie. And when I have it, I have a feeling that Kanga feels unhappy. It's a great movie, I can not get it wrong, but I see great parts of the trailers, if you notice my motion. It happened very fast and it rolled, I was never bored, and I enjoyed watching. Humor is absolutely great. My first relationship with a sloth (or something like that).
