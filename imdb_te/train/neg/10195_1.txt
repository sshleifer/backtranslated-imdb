The author / director of this film is absolutely unaware of the film. In this project, the DP has been tied up and replaced with a monkey because it is very dark at each sight or hot spots that are hotter than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story is awful, the characters are quite a dimensional. This film is not for poker fans and movie fans, but someone may have said that someone is a self-film (that is perhaps the author / director). In this world the poker fan does not like this movie. Your money man also hates this project. Going into a casino and playing some hands do not give you the experience to write about poker. Continue your day's work. If it is playing poker, then you should hurt'n.
