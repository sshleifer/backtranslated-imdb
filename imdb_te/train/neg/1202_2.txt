A dog found in local kennel has teamed up with Satan and has puppies, one of which is given to a family who had previously lost their previous dog for a hit & run. The puppy did not like the Donald Trump and how to fire the owner of the Mexican home. Only the father suspects that this cancer is the most visible, the rest of the family loves the devil's puja. <br /> <br /> I have seen the baby in the 70s for the TV horror film, which I felt as a child, but it was a sharp nail-binter, but it's just a lame Knows that it is boring and really does not perform well on the lowest bit. <br /> My grade: D
