Beige and pointless bit (bloody pads, but soft). Written with bad, inward and wooden conversations. You do not care about the characters (in fact, whether the actors themselves live or die). Little grace or attraction, little action, the whole thing is a little point. Perhaps some of the set and settings are interesting - those variations between the boards of all buildings may be as real as life. The frame encounter is unnecessary and redirect, and the character of Hoppong Cassidy itself is boring and ineffective.
