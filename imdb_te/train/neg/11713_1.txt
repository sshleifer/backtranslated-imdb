Just a warning ... this is the worst picture I've seen over the years ... I can not see it in the end ... it's time pure waste ... he's really sorry for the snipes ending in such a film. There really is not much to say about it. Terrible acting, very bad lines, story, everything. The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is that you really want to see how the film should not be. To tell you a scene: the police are searching for snips, and they surround the building with helicopters and cars, they turn around in the building, but they are still whispering that Snipes is unsuspecting.
