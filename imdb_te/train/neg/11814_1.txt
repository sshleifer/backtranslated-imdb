Back in the day, I remembered seeing dumb nintendo power comics that have the same artwork at this show ... then the word came to me that this presentation was coming to me on a television! I'm not esteatic, but curious ... I was curious about how bad it is to fight this show. <br /> <br /> All my friends have said that this program does not have any real meaning and I say it's pretty crazy for the people to enjoy (I'm really gay), so I decided to look at the show with low expectations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so dumb and I hate how to fan drops on the tiff for most fans, it's sad. I hate how they made chef Kalasaki (or whatever his nonstraight name is) is a good man who has a restaurant. Bad move, 4 kids TV! Escargoon King Dedede (who sucks big time on this show) is not a losing advisor and I hate the face of a company that keeps delivering Dedede supplies that terrible weapons that Kirby destroys. So stupid, I hate this presentation. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Nintendo is too loud enough to get some popularity for Kirby, so I hated Kirby. Kirby'll never beat Mario in the fight for the cold, and Kirby will always have nothing but a small little cream puff for gay. NUF SAID !!!
