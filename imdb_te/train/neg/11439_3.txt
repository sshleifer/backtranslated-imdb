The film was designed to appeal to chic flick audiences, which I sat and enjoyed most. However, Heather Graham became Meg Ryan after a very frustrating attempt (who was as abused as hell on his right). Her performance deteriorated and she was less discouraged compared to her colleagues relaxed in her roles. This image may have been more because of the budget, which is suitable for settings, actors and good story lines. At the end of a painful awkward picture, my wife and I both finally agreed to be 'nose'! The next good luck is Miss Graham, the kind of films she's portraying as her from Hell.
