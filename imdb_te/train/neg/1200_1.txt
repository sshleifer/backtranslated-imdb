Rip-off, a dull, clear, tediously exorcist red-eyed Doberman, is made up of special effects on this TV for television. Richard Creanna is a picture of chewing. Only 70 clothing & music add to violence. You have to sleep almost as much as "The Corps Vanishies", or "The Blue Hand". Practically not working. MooCow says no stinky dog ​​eaghhh! : = 8P
