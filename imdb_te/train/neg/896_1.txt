This film is awful. Not too risky but very predictable. In the mid 60s, the film follows the life of the small town's family. Principal father in school, going through middle life crisis. Enter the beautiful teacher from the big city where she began challenging the students' minds with the idea of ​​stimulating your idea. Principal does not agree with her teaching, but she is beautiful. You can connect the dots. His young daughter (Vinana Raider Wannabe Tara Frederick) is bored and living with a small town lifestyle. She receives some bad advice, some meeting with the Bad Boys and her family is clearly not taught in family planning. Shocking! Looking at the director Paul Shapiro's work on the TV, the film is a more mature version of a special episode in a special or more worldly sitcom after a special school.
