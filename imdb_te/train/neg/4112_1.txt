I feel if I make this kind of complete tarred bomb, even if they have any money. I want in the film industry. I wiped my donkey on a toilet paper piece and once made a better script. <br /> <br /> When looking through a gun tunnel, they used a single 30-foot tunnel and repeatedly changed the position of the stupid hang light again and again. <br /> <br /> When I meet the director of the GEM of this movie I think I will fight with him and start by plugging in his LOAFERS <br /> <br /> Now
