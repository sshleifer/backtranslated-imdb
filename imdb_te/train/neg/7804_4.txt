TEMP (1993) did not do much business business, but here you do not want to do anything straight away! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is a new woman in Millennium Investments, a high-profile brokerage firm, starts with helpful suggestions from the wide-eyed Secretary Dedre (Sheila Kelley). Deidre is no longer able to climb a prestigious daddy girl and a corporate ladder, she can not retain a top broker and kill her in the wrong side. She throws skeletons in Ellen's room, trying to deal with her husband (Barry Bostwick), as she is responsible, trying to kidnap her daughter and steal money from the company. <br /> Harris and Kelly provide the best performances, supporting cast alright and it's reasonably well, but it does not completely replace the script that travels well and offers some surprising ones.
