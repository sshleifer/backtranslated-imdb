I bought this film for $ 5 dollars for Chase Mastersson in a burgen bin at my local video store, and I should have thrown in the toilet and dug five. The film recovered in a group of twenty somethings and returned to the death anniversary of their idiot friends, who drunk and wandered into the woods and died. The problem is that there is a Repecen monster hunting them one by one. The acting was endless, and these plunged individuals were clearly featured on programs such as the 90210 and the Dawson's Creek. Directed by a twelve year old and the script was probably at the age of thirteen. The whole set appears in Malibu as one's backyard. People who have appreciated the film are the directors and / or actors of the actors. Avoid this pile of garbage at all costs.
