When I was on the other day in the movie store, I was crossing Blond and Blander, but it seemed to be a pretty movie about it. Who knows? I mean, I've seen Romei and Michelle in the past, Blond and Blender might just be another hidden treasure. But when I started watching: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson, Wow, I know I'm for something scary. Palm Anderson and Denis Richards are not responsible for them, but they are not all very well at all and I think they're playing for the characters that are intended for more women, but what's considered the two hottest pinnacle is what's their 40, what's in their 20s. <br /> <br /> Dee and Don are beyond your stupid stereotypes of blood, which really does not have a clue when it comes to the world, it's just really sad. While the girls are mistakenly mistreated for the murderers, the police are in their story and are actually calling girls' songs with their "ignorance pleasurable" attitude. They are arranged to "hit" a man, and they feel they are going "to show him a good time," but the real murderer has repudiated and wants the case and wants to kill the girls. <Br /> <br /> Denise and Palm look very awkward on the screen and it's like they read the script the previous day. I thought this was a stupid comedy, but more than stupid, it was just unnecessary to go into the bad. Will i recommend it? <br /> <br /> In a million years, at this time the girls are trying to maintain their status as "sex kittens", Bland and Blander's army is a big blonde bomb. <br /> <br />
