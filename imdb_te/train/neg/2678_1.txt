There is nothing convenient to say. Pumping with impossibility, huffing and "message". The new Russian (post-Soviet) films are very good (cuckoo comes into the mind), and many are the cardboard's bouquet and the backside of the asbestos (a good example of Nocchino Dojore). This is the vacuum "dazor" type. Acting is horrible if it is ineffective in the direction of the full blown direction and the inevitable compelling of the inefficient compilation sometimes as disruptive from acting impotence. The Cameraman Special Award to make sure that every shot is moving (would anyone please Blair Witch to have 15 unreasonable fame seconds?) And take care of those who cure on CounterStrike and masturbation are focusing on the front tune of the deficit. The female mainstream poses and attempts to very seductive, the male villian required Diction coach (genetics will not be bad: rather expressive eyes) but one for this abusive pile of art. Anyone who reviews it may be the cousin of "sweeties".
