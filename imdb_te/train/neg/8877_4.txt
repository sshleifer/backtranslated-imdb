'Major Pane' is a picture of life that lives in a small group of little boy in the Marines. This film does not really have much to offer, but it offers a watch well worth many happy moments. It does not expect a memorable image, though. Just expect to laugh your way through the movie and at the expense of other people. The confrontation between the Major Pane and the Chubby boy were hilarious, and except for the boys who wanted revenge on that Major Payne I would remember all about the film. Again, this is not a great movie, and you can look for a rainy day when you need some laughter.
