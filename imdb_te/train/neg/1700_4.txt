In the picture, I think it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell the story on the screen. This story tells a story from David Lynch, but not quite one. I thought it was funny but I thought it was very strange as a comedy. It's a good movie-making but really it's not anything. As I said earlier, I am a huge David Lynch fan but I'm a bit depressing in my work because I do not see it. This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but I know he still has a ton of talent and I am excited to see what he's doing in the future store for us. If you like Lynch, check it out, but do not be surprised if you do not like it.
