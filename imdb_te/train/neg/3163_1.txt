<br /> This is the first post that I have mentioned earlier on IMDb. If you get it, the film warns me of all the good spirits that stop me from experimenting with movies. I thought about watching this movie, I thought some good actors (even though the worst critics have read this movie) thought some comedy flick. , Comedy .... Then all started to repent ... The man can make you believe in yourself, and you are going to be known as the heroine of a feminine film that looks everywhere in your head. Haha ~ How well a person can be able to digest a devilish witch and can make all her efforts to stop you from doing what she's doing. <br /> <br /> The movie, "zombie" hero, yes he loses his fianc√©e with his eyes, and the hero's "terrible stupid" sister who roams around like a goat, with black marks u you tried and you If you succeed by looking at this film completely you will be bleeding from head to head ~!
