Want every good story "Broadway" added by Broadway Music? Those who can not clearly come up with their own plot think is just for exploiting classic literature. Oliver Twist and I agree that such stories are not my favorites, and this is a great example, because the deal is often true that you wrote things that you have left off. So do not add to the boring music of each of these serious stories and abusive boys, and suddenly stimulating it? Oops. <br /> <br /> In my rating four stars come from my casting, which I can compare to my fair lady. Each of these movies may have a drama version, but then they must go and see (see above). <br /> <br /> As with my fair lady, the songs really do so and they say that Oliver Reid's singing voice (I apologize if I make a mistake, apologize) with compassion. Why not make everyone feel really shy by putting good crazy silly tracks? It was a good influence. Usually it destroys the story. It's made with one. The jury is still on whether this story is valuable, but it is impossible to tell about that gaming.
