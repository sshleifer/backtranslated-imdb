Terminus paradis is exceptional, but "Niki Ardelan" is too late. We already have enough of this and we need new stuff. <br /> <br /> There are no problems when Big Directors look outside their time. <br /> <br /> We are not born again, no one can ever say anything about the old period before. Many people do not want to remember or remember, and the new generation of movie users does not mean a bit. This song is not the first day but the last song - Paureyi! Perhaps young directors should take this action.
