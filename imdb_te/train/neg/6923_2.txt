Absolutely terrible Mexican film depends on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, a newspaper that wants to go to the limits of the shelter in the woods to write a story about how it works ... Our hero, Gaston, head of the shelter gave a great performance to Dr. Malard, As in the mocking of soldiers, the tail is in the basement Men hanging around will see all kinds of things that are scary. He goes up a ladder hanging on a building. A human man wearing a hen, yes, it pecks around the ground for chicken chicken feed. This scene is the comic highlight of the film, but at least for me, it's the lowest point of the film and really uplifting when you thought that increased men and women this may even be remotely entertaining. Ah! In fact, Dr. Taurr and his legion of name change are real scary. And it brings me this remarkable fact about the film, which is a feature of many movies that have some kind of serious problem in general. Yes, it's obvious, but some distribution issues and others, one of them, has many titles changes, so that no one can buy the same waste at the same time. This is definitely the worst. It's too small. She is the only unique actress to examine Cloudio Brook as the head of the shelter. He is a big slab he smiles like witch, bolus orders, sashays with a knife in his hand, and compliments. I'm so tired to hear him speak about the "soft-hearted" system as a means to cure mental patients. What a group of ludicrosity (hey, the script like this deserves this kind of image like this). You may not be long enough to figure out what's going on in the shelter, or it's not even more interesting. Cinematic Chicken Scratch!
