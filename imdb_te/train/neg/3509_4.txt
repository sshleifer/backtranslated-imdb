Half an hour episode to get out of this twilight zone somewhere inside this spot. Cube Tat, well-made, claustrophobia and mind-to-one, I'm afraid that Cipher is a bloated, tedious rehearsal of the most exhausted themes. The half way is before the good sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> Cipher will make its way to the right of the inexorable finale in a relatively small 95 minutes. There are no characters, and technology is really cheating for an image created in 2002. It's hard to connect this tired and unprofessional image with the director of the Cube. <br /> When you see the grass grow and dry, your stick insects are bored, then watch this movie, but other activities have probably proven more stimulating.
