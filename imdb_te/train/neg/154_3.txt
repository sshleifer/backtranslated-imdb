In the original language of this English language it was seen on DVD. Either the subtitle is too poor or the original dialogue has not done a lot of story and no role has been developed. There are some HK stars but their presence is not required to make the movie better or worse. It's just bad. The bright colorful scenes made in CG are attractive for the perfect colors and brightness, but it will be higher in the long run. If this is anything I would think cg, fight scenes, and a child's film with its nonstop barrage of worst plots. I realized what happened in the film but the whole delivery of the story is very difficult.
