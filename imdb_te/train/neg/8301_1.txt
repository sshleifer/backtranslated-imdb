Very bad. This is a good secret because anyone thinks this is a good idea. I like humor as the next man and I like the "Christmas story". The fact that this is based on the same director and memorabilia of the same writer is why I am totally skeptical of the film's complete failure at every level. Charles Gradin is a father of the father for the starters. Another does not have the same pacing for it - it just does not flow well. Everything seems tired and forced. There is not a whole lot of joy in the first film that is spreading - you must end the film. I have not recommended this movie for curiosity-seekers who have enjoyed "A Christmas Story". This is bad. 1/10.
