I can not believe I can wast too much talent in a movie! The Gingerbread Man starts in the right leg and manages to build some great expectations for the end. But at some point the cinema turns one of the worst stories I've wasted my time. It is not believed that this was a morbid malory dose how to carry Kenneth Branagh's character through his nose. The climax of the films is an uncanny and readable as a beer, which has long been abandoned by the sun. Gingerbread Man was already the worst Grisham-film, and it did not change as talented actors attracted the film. Do not waste your time here!
