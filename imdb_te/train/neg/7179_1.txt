How good it is to understand his "message" - this film is a terrible railroad - awful acting, dumbly camera work - Carr agreed to why to try and pull a stutter - he was lousy. You are extra on the DVD and he can see the way around a camera - he just soaks - he loves the center of attention. He is a bad actor - he's another proud filmmaker - Eric Schaffer reminds me. Some of the films featured in City Youth Centers and New Age Churches - where people who are damaged think about their images and talk about them. But in film it is choppy, predictable and sappy.
