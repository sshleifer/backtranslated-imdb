The film should be in the bottom 100. Acting was very terrible, and when we saw my son and I was physically ill. And the story is worse. I'm still bad, but I really wanted to do it, and I added a warning to Frankback's review, and no one still had trouble getting it done. Do not waste your time, money, energy or anything else in this picture. Thanks to the courtesy we've seen on TV, you have not spent anything on it. If we have, I will be forced to write people responsible for this abomination and forcing a hanging in their normal direction. At the end, I always say that Carrie Fisher enjoyed watching the law. But I regret to say that this is not worth watching her in the special film. Do not ruin your opinion by watching Cary's view.
