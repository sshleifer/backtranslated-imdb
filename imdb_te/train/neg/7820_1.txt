Or: Is it a bird? Is this a plane? No, look ... it's a disaster! <br /> <br /> Or: (... ok, it fits.) If the singer tries to make a romantic titanic like a movie to crash the box office record, he fails. SR structure can not do this, dark and limiting color scheme (I call it the "Wicked-Washi"), boring routine dialogues, clowns, fun and magic with advanced alien technology. <br /> It just does not work. <br /> <br /> The main thing in the role of Superman is that he is a superhero. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Supersoftie is only 2:40 long long, Superman film, not the whole time, facing trouble and sadly lost. br> It's not a Superman or superhero film anymore. <br /> This is a big difference. <br /> It's too big. A joke. Sacred skywalker, this Superman, so give us supervillains, Superaction and the most important thing, Superfun. <br /> We want fun! Singer, if you want to do 2:40 love the long love soul drama about lost and sinful people? <br /> They say: Superman returns. And then, there is supersadlysoftie door. <br /> Maybe the singer tried to kill Legend without Cryptoite, but could not make a bad image. <br /> <br /> The next time the singer (and Warner Bros.), a superhero film, is not a discouraged superlum soap, or leave it. <br /> <br /> The film looks like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover. Yes, there are technically all the varieties, yes, there are very little discussions, there are some jokes, a scenery action sequences, etc., but all these messy pieces are simple what their poor quality. <br /> <br /> It is not more than a super boring sideways and is not one of the worst films I have ever seen in my live. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous cast strategy can be sequels in the next 25 years). Kate Bosworth starred as a 22-year-old Star Reporter. She was five years old, so she slept with her six years ago, so she was 16 years old (13) and the daily planet reporter, "I'll have to spend a night with Superman". Warner Bros., it's too big. <br /> <br /> Round is not so bad, but smashing a little wood, but the whole film is made of wood ...? Temporary good manners and sometimes polies. For the rest, forget it. <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder is fun and very easy to act. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jesus was upset. What is that hell? The problem here is, they mean this, not this interference. Will Spiderman or Batman or Ironman become the same as Jesus or the angels? Or they speak directly to God. Why not? They are superhearts, every day human lives are saved. <br /> <br /> The film is not a true reporting film, but instead comes from a bizarre despicable parallel universe. <br /> This superlative depressive image for the warning brothers is probably the greatest disaster in history. <br /> <br /> I am creating and transmitting some messages or feelings, showing loneliness, losing and misleading people in the new and thousands of movies or TV-shows in old or new ones like Magnolia. <br /> Singer and Wb, just nothing. In fact it's nothing more than that (comic / superhero) is a dark hole for movies and steals us for three hours of our life. <br /> Mrs. Smilla little brother. (Very angry and green color like Hulk.)
