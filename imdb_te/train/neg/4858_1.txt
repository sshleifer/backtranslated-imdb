Why does anyone in the world make this piece of garbage image? The first two Zombie Bloodbath movies are stupid enough, but the cake for this trilogy (probably all the time) takes the cake. Todd Sheets is still the director, but is not the screenwriter, no longer negative or positive, he is just the opposite of the person who wrote this one. This work is heavily dependent on the f-word, which is used somewhere between 200 to 300 times nausea. Acting The last two bloodbath movies are about equal, so naturally, some of the worst I have ever seen. Special effects are better than the last 2, but they still appear to be God. The plot is very good, some good government efforts and misdiagnosed zombies and generating zombies. Even the school kids I know how to wildly mutant mutant zombie and time travel, has led to one of the most idiotic endings I've seen. It went out after the film, which was fantastic, because the whole movie was a vibrant. <br /> <br /> In this case you will be looking for a reader in this regard, because if you go with this intense mind, you can kill yourself. <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 minutes.
