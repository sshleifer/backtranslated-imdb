Well OK, I saw this film a little over 2 years ago and now it's taken out of the dirty shelf to see it again and I definitely think this film is good. The film is a bootleg I'm your last summer you did what you know 3, the final stab is screenshot 4, and the film is not well. I've had the flaws and of course it's ridiculous for a midnight popcorn film released in theaters but this film is not half bad. It has some fears, and I can add some really hot women. Plus it shows off Joey Lawrence's new beefy look even if it does not win any big Hollywood roles either ...... I think it's bad for man, he has blossomed in the early and mid-90s such a career, some Disney films and continuous Laurence Brothers. Joy Lawrence Sitcom is a bit in the scene, but in the 360 ​​degrees turn to his career southwards As the only low-budget films. <br /> <br /> The movie also throws you out of the guard, and you know that you are thinking of the staff, knowing that you are finally disappointed to learn secretly. It's also killer who throws you off, I got an idea but still killer woulnd't who he thinks, but his intentions combined with mystery is a huge depressing. Now, is there a secret that was dropped out? This film is one of the best rated movies. But I'm a sucker for college backgrounds and I went on a spring break in a building on a beach building compared to one of the colleges here, so I had a feeling of feeling about the film. <br /> So the slasher image. Good midnight movie.
