If you ever hear these three words ... "Joe Don Baker", be afraid <br /> <br /> Final Justice is a low budget action movie (pronounced haronimo) based on the sheriff of Texas town Geronimo. An ugly, slimy, rude character who is hunting for a criminal in Malta who has killed his partner in Texas. His partner actually slumps down twice in the film. Very bad editing. Joe Dan Baker (Geronimo) ends 4 or 5 jails in the film, making the plot somewhere faster. He's in the Wild West plus he shoots everyone. I did not say no to the 20th century. A female police officer (around Elin, from Seinfeld) from Malta is employed to show him and she is the only one with Redneck. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Their dance is shown throughout the film and I have started connecting with blue women. Well, at least it's better than watching Geronimo try to dumb his way out of something. The end is flawed and some speculative, and I was finally over happy. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to imagine how he was in three Bond films ... very strange! However, if you're doing a laugh, then look at it in MST3K. Also, I've heard his other bad movie (among many), "Mitchell" MST3K version released on DVD by Rhino. I can not wait to see!
