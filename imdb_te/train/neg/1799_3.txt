Eddie, skipped from "Family Ties", is a nurse who is attracted to a wussy 'metal' nerd. His favorite wussy 'metal' singer, Sammy Karr, dies, he throws a hesy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall. But later when he received an unreleased record of the soul of the 'metal' statue of the deceased. First he sucks into the thoughts of vengeance, but then he does Sammi does not take it too much. It is not true what will happen to his main victims to the hospital. The film is totally ridiculous and there is a lot to do with real metal when it says "rock star". Okay, maybe a lot more than a piece of junk, but my point comes. And how can anyone rokut for a person who plays Skippy from "Family Ties"? I do not have a clue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
