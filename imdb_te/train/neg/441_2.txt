It's not in televised in England, but I walked on YouTube on the Internet. It's dumb, immature and boring! It was in Douglas Ten Napoleon, creator of "Earthworm Jim", I never got into that cartoon, but I have to admit better than that. Cartoonist has not done anything for years now. For Doug TenNapel, this is a mock trail and all the time is short! The story is inherited from their two cats, their home and money from the owner of their dead elder. What they argue and spend their money is controversial. "Boring"! The animation is terrible. The main characters mean that cats, right? But they do not look like cats! Bizarre animal monster-with the bigger mouth-appearing creatures, teeth and chin eyes have shown! Human and other animal characters have also drawn true ugly! The theme song is terrible and irritating! Also stories are dull and copied mostly from older shows. This performance surprised how other IMDb viewers received 7.5 / 10 votes. Television is not really useful! But now most of them are dumb, cheap and boring. I'm sorry but it's full of time and full time and totally waste of your time and I'm happy that Britain is happy to withstand this dirt (Oh yeah, if you're digital) but I'm not, so it's not my problem! Loser! 2/10 (and it is very lucky to get because I've given other programs the worst!).
