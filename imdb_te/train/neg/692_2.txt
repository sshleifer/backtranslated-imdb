One of the many slashers appearing in the early eighties, the only thing marked for the opening performance by Prox Daphne Zuniganga (The Sun Thing, The Fly 2); <br /> <br /> During their Christmas break, a group of students volunteered to clear its furniture's condemned college building. <br /> <br /> A thug killer throws criticism in writing, hitting one of the scary ways of young people <br /> <br /> In this book a slush and unreasonable prayer for slash clich, director Jeffrey characters, Horror is provided in Ob, so I would have found something more worthwhile. The overwhelming majority of deaths (which, let's face it, is why we normally see this kind of picture) is not just brief, but only a really gruesome picture comes only when the bodies of the victims survive the survival (the film is more particularly bloody pieces of the corpse). In the last minute, the film is unexpectedly ending down the downbeat by getting a low score from me, but it's really only one slasher.
