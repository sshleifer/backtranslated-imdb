The story of a man who has an unnatural feelings for a pig. An exciting example of absurd comedy begins with the opening sequence. An official orchestra became a lunatic and violent group by audiences crazy songs. Unfortunately this disables the absurd WHOLE time without a simple story. Those in the era should also be stopped. The cryptic conversation makes Shakespeare a third grader seem easy. At the technical level, it's better than you think with some great cinematography by the future great Wilmos Zigzimand. Future Stars Sally Kirkland and Frederick Forest can be seen briefly.
