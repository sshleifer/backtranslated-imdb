<br /> <br /> <br /> Ice Akas the Ice can be used in a single word .... Amateur. This film is trying to be different from most movies in the film 'Blair Witch' .... It does not work ... It just looks and ends and someone decided to make a cheap video camera, van and a movie. The story does not explain the hero's original inspiration (and looks like a lesbian comparable to five girls) and there is no violence to talk ... the sounds of tuning and crunching. The whole image takes place inside a van, which is a good view out of the question. Five girls really come across their best but totally terrible actresses with what they've given ... although the material given is difficult to decide if they are actually aCt .... whimpering, whilst screaming the cost of whale ... Difficult and so cameras are so difficult to say that it says it's too hard. This video was portrayed as a violent torture film but in reality there are only five girls in a van to listen to the horror ... literally bring the whole film ..... we have 5 hours of continuous throwing and five girls still alive ... with a minus one finger. After a gorgeous movie, it is hard for the poor actresses (LOL) who have tried hard and possibly their voices (and their pride). Do not judge this by poster ... you'll be down too.
