Hay HULU.com is playing the Elvara Late Night Horror Show on their site and the film is a monster, which is good to watch the Elvira comment in the film. However, the film is really bad for horror movies, bad effects, bad dialogue, and just how bad it is for the 70s for a bad movie. If you want to laugh it out. There are 10 episodes while you're at HULU and some good plots and products have good movies and you can see most of them in 480p until you have a good speed connection.
