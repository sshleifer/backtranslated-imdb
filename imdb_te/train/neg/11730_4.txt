Investigative reporter Darren McGawin (as Karl Coach) is back; This time, he was followed by "The Night Strangler". Once again, police officers and fellow journalists reject or seek to cover the supernatural dimension. <br /> <br /> Producer-director Don Curtis understood the same basic story as his previous "Night". Curtis forms a pleasant auxiliary cast, in which "Dark Shadows" includes George Deczone and Ivor Francis. Joe Ann Pleblug (like Louis Harper) performs a sexy collection of belly dancers. Even though I have never seen anything, Roger Davis should be a dying companion of Mr. McGavin in an early scene, vulnerable to the presence of vampires! Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Zoo On Pflug, Simon Oakland, Valley Cocks <br /> <br /> *** The Night Strangler (1/16/73)
