This is the most saccharine romance I have ever sat. The bed, the housewife, and the ostrich-toilet in the afternoon to see the static image in the heyday compounds lying on the bed-eating bowbons. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see in the end is that in almost every scene Kean was able to appear to the eye with the dream of Reeves. . In many movies he goes very fast to get a good look. Giancarlo Giannini wanders his arms with Latin emotion as the quickest step in the show - more Italian than Mexican. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is tight with wood. Unfortunately, no BODIES ripped - the hero is mannered perfect and manned perfect. The aristocratic blood clot is similar to the old World Family Clutch hills. What does it matter if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is a fantastic story. <br /> <br /> I know before the titles are finished that I did not expect the film. Luminous grapes were seen as a paragon in all women's magazines in Women's Day magazine. I did not name his name, but the art director is surely Thomas Kinkade, who painted the dollar canvases in unison chains as snoggers in fuchsias. This film is literally seen through pink glasses. If you like dreamy pink and blue sky, this picture is for you! (Bonbons also looked very good!)
