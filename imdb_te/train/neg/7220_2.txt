Where do you earn money to earn such movies? I mean, nothing about this film was redeemed. No one knows the actors, the writing is terrible, the photography is unclear, the story repo man and a nickelodeon Western and performance is unbelievable. For anyone who looks at all kinds of film, good and bad, I must admit about the worst I've seen from the Eye's People back in this film 50. I do not like the worst of people trying to create art, banning some fun or paradise but this film will appeal to no one. The story tends to bend the mysterious contamination of a person who is a bad reformer of Celtic soul eater, although it works like Maguskus without his sexual feel. The bad guys have a team up with the good guys in a town that they are unable to escape from. Get there from there, alas, the best part. My suggestion is that if you are bad epics, enthusiastic writing, incredible acting and tedious settings, you'll be out of this shelf when you rent videos.
