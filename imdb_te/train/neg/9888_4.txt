From actor and independent writer / director John Cassavettes, an influential woman provides a view of the working family to the viewer with the problem of a mental instability. Her husband, Nick (played by Peter Falck), is a blue collar worker and she is embarrassed by her wife, Mabel (played by Gena Rowlands). Since the opening of the film, Mabel is very quirky and strange, but it's clear that after a few minutes she is more than her. Crazy. Bonkers. She is from the damn mind. Nick makes his hardest effort to hide this from his colleagues, and after a special occasion in her dinner, asks whether she is okay, as he attempts to reject Mabel's illness. <br /> <br /> I find some issues with this image. I imagined that these problems were mostly in the story, and some acted late. Mabel is committed, because, apparently, she is nuts. Then, six months later, she was ready to come out of the hospital, and her husband throws the party to invite her back. He does not work for Stupid at the beginning of the film. Why does he invite these people, some of them strangers to Mabel, and his wife go to his home when his wife is in such a terrible state? It is just idiotic. Later, after arriving at Mabel's home, Mabel's father had a huge reaction to Nick, a spaghetti who did not want to eat at the top of his lungs. His daughter has returned from a six-month resettlement, and what does she want you to do is she is calm and he goes to nuts on spaghetti? A few minutes later, in the film, Nick Mabel brought up the stairs and forced her to do whatever she did when she was emotionally unstable; She makes strange sounds and gestures. Did not she send her to make her look good? There are many other parts of this post, but it is very necessary to look at them in more detail. I have a serious problem with the cassettes decision to make his characters act this way. <br /> <br /> However, as the film ends, I have had problems, and this is really remarkable. Acting. Gena Rowlands played an amazing silly woman. There are times I forgot her acting, where I got her wild gesticulations and I got caught up in the crazy debate that I was actually scared of. She was amazingly convincing and intense. Even so, I was impressed with the Mabel family. Peter Faulk played a very strange role, and he thought he was a lunatic, and he had a situation with his children, his job and his wife. I usually do not appreciate children's actors. But the young men who played the children of Nick and Mabel in this film are unusual. They seemed to be children of Mabel, because she had such a relationship and that it was interesting to help her with her problem. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ <br /> <br /> In general, this film did not impress me. The story is obscure and obscure, and I am surprised that the characters are not insane in the film. Only the wonderful acting characters of the Longgetty family have been saved. Their original dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together, and possibly the only reason for the film.
