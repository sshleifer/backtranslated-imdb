Last month I saw this movie at the free sneak preview and I went out. It's pretty terrible. In the process of trying very hard, they starred and made a terrible film. I was disappointed when I thought this actor might be too far away, but I was wrong. At the end of the film, I told them not to release the film, hoping that they are going to do the survey. I was impressed by the free aspect of the preview, but it turned out to be my time waste - and, in general, I'm very easy amused. It tried to be innovative and creative with shots, ideas and shoot, but it failed because it threw many ideas at once. I'm not generally picky about movies and I do not feel the need to display my opinions about movies in general, but I have to warn everyone not to see. I'm just saying IMDB to tell all the guys
