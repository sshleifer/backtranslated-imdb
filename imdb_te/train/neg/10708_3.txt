The film is really good, and some plot elements have been taken from the sci-fi worker The Hadden. And the dolph always offers some cheesy appeal to his characters. <br /> <br /> The Dolph goes to New York, where he plays the buttie-kicking monk (!), unlocks the door under his fame for 2000 years. He must lose a minion, a soul jumping from body to body, he's hidden and jason hell. Minion, naturally, wants the key so that it allows the antichrist. The ride was accompanied by an annoying female archaeologist and accompanied by her and dolph minion-having bodies. <br /> <br /> Forget if I'm doing this sound fun. Pacing is very frustrating and slow, best acting subset, and fighting scenes are poorly performed. Dolph is sleeping through his role and spills some of his worst conversation in his career. <br /> <br /> The cheese factory finally moves to the end. The rest of this movie is a snoozefest. <br /> <br /> Very bad, I really like it.
