I watched this as a whim because it is available and I have heard thumb movies funny. This is not one. The majority of jokes are around the "Geranium's" physics and, instead, Kate Winslet's. I feel really thoroughly of the creators of "Thumbtanic" to make it a little less for making a job as a respectable actress, because she (the barrier of heaven) did not starve itself in an ideal modern beauty model. <br /> <br /> There is a line that goes like my favorite part, "Hey, I have a great idea! This is a swim on this temporary raft that no one has seen!" In the 26 minute film, the entertaining thirty seconds do not redeem its value.
