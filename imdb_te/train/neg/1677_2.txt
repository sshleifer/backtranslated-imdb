Unlike other people, I refused to name it in the film badly. <br /> <br /> A strange, unpleasant and eventless invasion of the eyes and ears is surprising, why the film "Wonderland" was created for the first time and this depressing and tangled mess gives their green light in their right mind. Biography of porn star John Holmes? The man who studied, why did he go into business and how did it affect him? Great. Be committed to being committed to being fun. <br /> <br /> Has the next career ended with a chaotic, violent, rashoman-style study of hacks' serial murders? Who cares in hell? What ideas do we get? The film is completely the most interesting factor in the life of John Holmes - he's a sexy star! "Wonderland", as well as anyone: the most famous male adult adult actress in history is almost unrelated. To deal with a thousand times worse, the film jerkoff will load the Gimmicks - Annoying Machine Gun Editing, Sloppy Dogmie-95 Camera, Unnecessary Split-Screen Graphics and Animation. <br /> <br /> The director (and I use the loose term) threw together a dozen or other methods from other films as a comprehensive story and exclusive main character, "Nark" or "Traffic" Decided to call a film, or "minority report;" In the film of the "Natural Death Killers" or "28 Days Later", the franchise is often incomprehensible in the pre-soundtrack-pre-song-to-"velvet goldmine" or "autofocus" or "catch" of "goodfellas" or "blow" Crowe, Retro Title Sequence of Your If You Can ". In the list and continue. <br /> I love this film. I have real hopes. "Wonderland Avenue" is over the years; I think the murders, though they are emphasized, are not murders. If the killings (and the increased involvement of Holmes with L.A. types holes) at the end of a career, or swinging 'signals to the end of the' 70s, I think the film will have meaning; It had a purpose. This is - no point. Means. How many perspectives are there in the series of murders unknown by the general public? <br /> The film should be the third act of "The John Holmes Story". That's it. Period. And it can work. What is it Oh, right, right, they do not tell the story of the traditional rise and fall. They did not want to "boogie knights" or "goodfellas" or "star 80" or "autofocus". They wanted their film to be different. <br /> Well, in a sense they succeeded. There is a big difference between those pictures and "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> Those movies are good
