I have gone here with my hopes, and I can not bear more into a twenty minute film. Although this is thinking that another terribly bad remake, maybe I probably kept my hopes high ... Maybe someone will get right this time around. Unfortunately, Prom Night has recently released April Fools' Day Remake, a bad script, bad direction, cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, boring, repetitive and nearly a dozen eye rolls are valuable. We've seen before and we've seen this a good one million times better. If you go to watch a prom night in the theater (I think you should wait for a DVD or PPV), be ready to laugh at the audience because they laugh. They do not laugh at the fun-looking movie, they are reacting to key "thrilling" moments in a much smaller picture if you feel you're looking at the newest instrument of scary movie. Seriously, is it a remake or a spoof? Motion picture producers have missed this mark very well, and I went out of a large number of audiences in the theater that I attended. It's about past, I want to do it. Although not me, I tortured me and hoped it would be better. It does not need to say. The "horror" scenes are joke, but due to many acting, the script, due to "special effects" and camera work. It seems to have spent a fortune to build this film, but it came out with a micro-budget image. I wanted to see Dollar story tags on half of the items, and I realized that somewhere in the cast was a romance. <br /> <br /> The horror style of this movie is doomed to be the biggest horror horror future.
