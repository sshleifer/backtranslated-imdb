As I realized, TIW Wacher was the first work of a young director. My suspicion is that if it is a normal person's work, if you love movies or it's a film student's work, as it is a reference to the Oporto School of Arts in the first credits. <br /> <br /> However, director Ricardo Pino is not entirely aware of some basic views about the film. What is the movie? How to tell the story? It does not matter for the novice. One story is one of the first things you learned in school when reading the movie. As you do in novels, in movies, you also need to build your story in three steps: introduction, development and ending. Know that you must have your hero and adversary and climax. You can also say for a 3-hour-epic, simple image, a small image and a 30 second trade, belief or belief. <br /> <br /> In tough terms, TIM Wacher introduced its main character and then the movie ends - the whole picture is like the introduction of letters in Jeunet's AMÃ‰LIE. TIM WATCHER does not have second or third actions. It's not parody or art, so you do not even try to justify the disrespect to the academic institution. You want to tell a story, it does not happen. The worst thing worse is that Tim Wachcher is a warning; And that is not a real benefit. This is not a point, or at least, right. With the sense of vengeance, its goal is a kid. <br /> <br /> "I am so excited from this little one that the film opens with a sequence of credits that look good and is more than a regular Portuguese documentary I do not know the budget for this film, but if you judge the list of gratitude in the final credits, it is difficult to open door to young filmmakers The TIM WATCHER is a workout in style, color and carefully selected plans, combining the best score and nothing else, no plots. <br /> <br /> "You can shoot a good story in a very small picture And the product position and over-the-top stylish cinematography.
