But there are some good activities and a somewhat interesting plot. Navsky acts as a body builder and he is not that attractive person, in fact, IMO, he is UGLY. (She has everything in her acting talent!) Sascha has played well with Jonah Pasula, but she needs more lines than she has given, her character has to be developed. There are many men in this story, zero romance, a lot of actions, a little more than a way. It is very violent. I love the scene though, this film takes you around the world, and is a bonus. I have some stuff about Mafia in it, not too much or too little, but it came to my attention. Actors should be more beautiful ... The biggest problem I have is that Nevsky is not simple enough, just that simple. I think for so many guys, Sascha will be hot enough, but ladies that are us act fans, Nevsky does not cut it. Overall, the film is good, I did not like it or I did not hate it, it seemed another common action movie.
