<br /> <br /> Filmmaker Stanley Caldwell has intimated the production of a novel for the drowning of the garden at this point, and he is expected to find the second unit director's murder. They are happy with Hollywood in a tongue with their actresses (looking up the ladder), sleepy autocratic directors, and do not like those who are completely challenging the spotlight. Brian Cruise, who I thought to be sarcastic, appears to be producing his second unit director and screenwriter, Alison (Dialia Salem), to the point where he felt very much as a caricature. Andrew Moxham is the brother of the victim from Paul Parsons, the first movie. The dark humor of the film is at this time working as a film director of the serial killer and exploits it as precious. Nelson again drowns in his psychology role in his psychology role, Stanley is always wise, utilizing his brains as a commander for filmmaking, who will kill him and kill him and keep his job in full control. Alison is the preeminent writer who wants to catch the essence of his subject. Why is it motivated to kill Stanley, why is he doing that and drives such a person in this dark way? Alison's comedy actually works with many people, this dark comedy is satiric in the heart of the thriller. In fact, you get the inevitable showdown between Alison and Stanley, with a really ridiculous and unbelievable resolution of the killer's task (to swallow it very hard). Unlike the first film that has been sophisticated, the director uses unnecessary methods that do not require Po-icon Leong (such as all sorts of weird angles, slow-motion in sepia color, and video capture in many cases) and instead annoying instead. This sequel is very low, and humor is not as realistic as it is very effective and more obvious.
