By all accounts, it may be an interesting film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you do not want to be a part of this, Everything about the film is cliché or useless.The story of the little story in the seventies and the eighties was death (and much better). <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a 'sick room' brought me cold in my spine, but most of the film was abandoned by bad script writing and acting. <br /> You can not write the Chandon dialog in each sentence for the chief police investigator It's bad that you do not have Tarantino or scary sounds.But ironically OTT is acting with Daddy casting (I'm not wrong, Danny Filth is a great singer and musician, but the actor is not he) and the performances are beyond the vehement of the burstingly cringing vein. <br /> <br /> Anyway Bruce Camp El give me. <br /> <br /> In some vicious CGI, gruesome gore effects (for goodness sake, Peter Jackson's fine and ten years ago the budget) and the over-use of editing filters shriek! <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem with the massacre of fear is that it seeks to build up the atmosphere and stimulate terrorism and isolate the audience. Very good horror films made by the seventies and eighties have improved gore effects (eg Maniac, Zombie Meat Eaters, Beyond, Cappipia etc.), my mind, second-rate and <br /> <br /> This weird vampire in the film Chandon I'll learn from it and go to a slightly fine horror that really feels awesome. <br /> The next time for Better Luck.
