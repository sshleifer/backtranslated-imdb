Well I'm always a Steven Siegel fan and let him say that his movies are usually great but do not measure up to this rest. It is very stupid in my opinion I do not like it all. The biggest reason I do not like is because it is very flawless and does not make much sense to me. Although acting is very bad, Steven Seagal does not perform good performance, and the rest of the actors I see are being directed to the rest of the films. It does not follow a simple story, so it happens at one time, because it is not very appropriate. You need to take action in any action in the third and take action to take action. Special effects are very bad and you can say it is fake. So all this is in the worst picture of Seagulls so you do not have to rent this if you want to watch a Steven Seagull movie just pretend to pretend it. <br /> Overall Score: ************ <br/> out *****
