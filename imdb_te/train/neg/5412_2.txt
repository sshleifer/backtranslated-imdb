Parry Mohan is safely included in the list of the worst films in the list of the blacklist. The film is one of many disabled-people groups, after Black's extraordinary success mocked the Disabled Brotherhood. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan's satirical portraits of disabled people. The daytime and emotion of blacks were black and gave us the glimpse of the world, Parry Mohan shows two complex-monkey monkeys in order to keep half of the world disabled and unwrapped to protect their love interests. An Malik's music is adequate. Vivek Oberoi, who made a good start with Saathiya, is heartily losing his film in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan deserves to be banished from an unacceptable actor and film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol both suffer from having nightmares in the thirteen without having to save themselves. Boman Irani, the villain Dan Tony, is somewhat acceptable. Avoid the image if possible.
