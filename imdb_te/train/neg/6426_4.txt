I have documented a documentary called Fast, Cheap and Out of Control as a very interesting documentary. The documentary contains four "small" documentaries about four interesting people. <br /> Each of these individuals is very involved with his work and demonstrates the familiar love and pleasure for one's job. <br /> <br /> This is a sad part, these people should be working / studied. They were interesting for almost five minutes, then completely memorable and stale. <br /> <br /> The video is very creatively filmed. I enjoyed the image of one thing with one voice dub on another. It's amazing and well done with music.
