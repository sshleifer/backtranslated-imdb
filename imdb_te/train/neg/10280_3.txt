Did Hey Jane really see this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Dull, Blonde and Totally Imagination and Heart Defect. I'm watching this movie that Karl Pope will play a major role in this film! The woman does not have a significant personality and can give a completely poor performance. Barzinsky is the same as the one who is the only thing that is interesting. Perhaps she is involved in this project to start with green. Maybe I look forward to a lifetime of 15 days from Christmas, but I have a very small little picture with an actress who has a little fun with a different director and a replacement JJ.
