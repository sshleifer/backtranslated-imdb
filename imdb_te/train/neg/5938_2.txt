If you do not live in the 90s or hear the rap! This film may be for you, but no fan or any single person is boring because it's a boring and I do not have any point in the movie that I did not know or did not know. Another thing that I have to do with innocence is that he is like anything in his life, his appearance in jail, selling drugs, and rapping is not realistic. I think the movie I released in 15 years may have been much more effective now! Good rap movies are dead and trying to not flow or stream, rich or sensational
