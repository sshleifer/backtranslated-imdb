We believe that this film is awesome, including the title sequence (now known as the funny), but believe me folks, it's one of the most awkward bad movies you can see, it's not laughing for five minutes, I've lost the feel of humor. <br /> <br /> David Niven is an emotional conversation about a devastating (feminine) love air traffic controller, when he is falling to his specific and burning death. (It's not romantic ...), he fills up with the same metric, and the air traffic controller washes on the beach while driving on his bicycles. <br /> <br /> If you really love sandwiched the bare-film Twilight-Zone-Esquire theme, an astronomical courier, Campi / Rani-ya is more fun than the ladies of the ladies), spending the most homo-romantic substitutes The most weird elements of the film are the bad cartoons national and ethnic stereotypes of some kind of universal nature and the power of love Proved to be a broken rayanni defend.
