Vampire is an interesting concept that has something with a virus. (But has done so many times now) Overall this image is too long and pulls a bit. Editing may be hard. I'm sorry to hear about the problem with the credits. Perhaps this film was moved to market. Places are light in places too dark. But the worst technical problem is the audio. The level dialog is good enough to hear, but most of them have an echo in the interior, which is very distracting. But they are not careful in recording, or sound mixing may be good. There was a lot of background noise. The martial arts scenes must have earned someone to make sound effects. Swords that swarmed swords were not a sound in an epic battle. It is very difficult to edit in fighting scenes. <br /> Acting is a bit flat. I'm sorry, but when I see that same person is writing in a movie, when I see it as a red flag in my experience, it's a good effort.
