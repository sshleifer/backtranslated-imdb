I saw this movie a long time ago (aprox for 10 years or so) and liked it. I remembered it the next day and decided to look again. The second time is not pleasant. This acting is 'so, so', the plot is careless, unreasonable and predictable. <br /> Acting ... It's not a story to play those characters for those actresses. The plot ... there was no way in hell that women were the first exploitation of the 2nd robbery. (Note on the note: she did not recognize the TT that even when she came up with the money loading for her court date and asks where they got her and she will have a logical answer! Ding, Ding ... we have a one!). The main objective is not to hit women's 'hitting the system' or stealing large amounts of money and not using their intelligence or other resources. At the end (Barrada) finally plays a lot over the sympathetic B / C but it is not sad (they're stupid, they deserve to die). <br /> <br /> I can not imagine that these film rates are more than 5.
