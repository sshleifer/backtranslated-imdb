I do not cheat through the 'glowing' reviews quoted in the DVD box. "Wild Entering.", "Seriously Frightening Independence.", And all the worst, "PAR with JAWS." <br /> <br /> I usually feel bad when writing bad reviews for movies but I can not believe I'm resting in a comfortable 7 in IDW. <br /> <br /> When the daylight raids by a monster unveiled, chemicals made by lazy scientists do not go anywhere and that's where it goes. Basically and unlikely, a girl monster (I give points for a good creature but this is not WETA creation) and her semi-humorous family spends her an hour and a half tracking ... the canals around the Han River. Their search did not have any suspense-again, somebody called it equal to jaws? And by the time they saw her you realize that you all are pretty much understandable. Earlier, a large group of the film was committed to a government bond that ends in a funny scene, a spat with a gutter before a busy bus stop. <br /> Bleach. This is bad. I'm not kidding. Would you like to see a rotten beast? Deep Rising Rent. At least you will save 30 minutes in your life.
