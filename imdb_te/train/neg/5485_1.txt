Without reiterating what is said about the film, I'm looking forward to watching this film ... I'll do the cast / place and the excellent director Michael Winterbottom's work ... its vague shadow 'Do not look now' about the storyline from the beginning. In the different environments (Italy again) removes the heart for loss ... or how did I see it? Spin explains what I expected to happen to this family in a foreign country, and I'm waiting to be there ... I sat there and sat there ... what did I expect? Nothing is real! And I do not understand anything !! You do not give yourself the opportunity to come up with characters, so they are 1 dimensional and vocational .. You are guided by the pace of the movie. The eldest daughters with local veps boys have a great chance to take another direction, with the visions of her mother's little daughters ending in a fruitless and nonsense workout, and the fathers have been attracted to her female students to be fraudulent by her age. The script was thought to have gone down to the minimum, without any impact on the last minute story, as it was in the last minute. Credits (unexpectedly) can not help you when you start to go, but steal the time you spent stealing this time.
