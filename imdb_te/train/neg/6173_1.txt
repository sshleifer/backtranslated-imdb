The film is obscured by the left in Hollywood to paint Reagan's administration ineffective and bangling. There have been some errors during the crisis, but I'm not sure what this lens is portrayed in. My first reaction was to direct this film by Oliver Stone, but I was wrong at this time. There are obviously many people.
