This year there is a picture that's worse - it's tash. The first promo film gave me a hint that was a boring Dhoom 2 style movie, and I first saw it because it was a bad movie and it was probably a chesty promo but this film gave me shock, it was after Dhat 2 and I Expected to meet Saif-Kareena after the first Saif's introduction, Kareena is artificial and Anil Kapoor Oha God, what's doing in such a weird image? What's the role of this? What is he doing? His first scene is good, but his action will be repeated and he occasionally gives Akshay good scenes, but the film became more boring and shimmering romance, childhood Rajkikant style action scenes and all the boring scenes <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya had to direct If the film works, then Yashraj's strategy, just Dab (Vishal Sekhar) is a common one. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar has brought fresh air in the film, he is actually frustrated by some of the busy moments Saif Ali Khan, Kareena equally bad Anil Kapoor Hams is surprisingly and more Good luck
