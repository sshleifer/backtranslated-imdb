I found the embarrassment to see this film. <br /> <br /> I thought my dad was moving under the throat. I can not get my shadows. Alcoholic, I do not think film about such alcoholism. Alcoholics, true drinks are very lonely, of course my opinion. When they talk strongly, the main character does not really have any problem, unless he claims to love you at one point - a bit of weak effort in establishing his cool character. He was constantly surrounded with people! <br /> <br /> I thought I was really alone with the character of any loneliness and a sense of crisis at any time. I could not connect with the character and did not think there was any link taken into consideration by my father. <br /> <br /> Kevin McDude is an ok actor but not a tough guy. The clock's orange object is a bit like a brick. Macked is a very old man for teen, who have three different characters or have to avoid the teen stage and become more concentrated on adult McKid. <br /> <br /> In the good note, the beginning of the film !!
