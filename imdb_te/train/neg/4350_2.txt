Where can I start? I heard this movie coming out and I was very mad. I was a huge fan of the original Carlito's Way and when I heard about it, I felt like almost all the other sequels in Hollywood. I thought it was bad. Boy I'm wrong, this movie is much worse than I expected. Not all the sequels are bad, but these days the Hollywood issue, it makes many sequels and reconstructions and rushes them. This is not a release of the theater, it is DVD release. Still, in my opinion, there is no reason for all to do this. After hearing about this movie, I heard that I'm not in the casino. The film is good in the film and there is a possibility. Why did I check this movie then some of you might ask? Well I had a chance to see. I can not see movies that have high expectations, I have very low expectations in this regard. I wanted to see if I had anything in it. Now, if this is a Carita's Way Way that you read, you know that you're going to be jailed with a story first. <br /> * Too little spoiler because I do not want anything to ruin, this fact you do not want to waste 2 hours watching this rubbish. I will say all - at the end of Carlito's Way 2, we can not go to Carlito jail. Now, I do not know about you, but I have shown how to stop Carlito's way in prequel jail. <br /> Now, my problem with the movie is not the only one. The actor who played the role of Carlito did not do very bad work, but he could not save the picture if he tried. There were not all the little things that Carlito's way fans wanted. You can not see any kind of Kleinfeld or other key characters, I'd like to see something like that. Even worse, Luis Guzman is in the film, and he plays the same role in the first film. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, I'm a Carlito's way fan, straight to this new DVD release. A disgrace. If you're a fan, do not see this film coming up with high expectations. This film is basically nothing for me, and it is definitely a movie I'm picking up or watching again on DVD.
