My girlfriend is a habit of going to blockbuster and choosing movies. At times, it has led to some pleasant discoveries. <br /> She is going to run an hour and a half. <br /> She brought home "advice from caterpillar". She was excited because the box was fun. We're never lucky, there is no campaign on the boxes. <br /> <br /> This is a work of patience for the film. This is one of these movies, if you're a proud and desperate person who loves to watch movies about you, you hate every part of the film. Until the introduction of a nice character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] <br /> <br /> So a group of emotionally swollen, scarcely and majestic artists can encourage love and gain success in their careers. Then, they meet a nice, intelligent, mentally mature and loving character (almost perfect guy). When we look at the woman and fall in love with her (in her 30 years) look at the boring artist. So she tries to flee from the nice, intelligent, mentally mature man and stay with the guy who is married to whom she has great but empty sex. She is rude to the man and drives her energy away. In the real world, she was very successful. <br /> <br /> "I am a man who fought for his love", but I never wanted her. (My girlfriend did not even) she did not deserve him. And, I wonder, did the director want to be punished by getting a relationship with her 'almost perfect man'? When the artist quit and asked 'almost perfect man', we were strongly screwed up to leave him. <br /> <br /> Andy Dick tells me a little laugh. The heroine was very annoying in the film, but his character was also angry. In other roles, they have played well, morally bankrupt and annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It is a comedy and I can say that I am laughing sometimes in the movie. Unfortunately, not laughing for the last 10 minutes. But by that time I had those laughs, I prayed for a long time for the film to end. <br /> <br /> I need to get these painful characters in my life.
