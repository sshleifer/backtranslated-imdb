15 years ago, Power Rangers, one of the programs in particular of young people. When I was a three-year-old boy living in the Philippines, this Friday's show can be seen on ABS-CBN (Channel 2). When the film came in 1995, when I saw my father and 2 uncles it all shocked and feared me. My grandparents also sent me a full "Balikbayan" box, including Power Rangers Stuff ("MegaZard Figure and Rangers' Sacred Toys"). I also played video games, and one of them only loved ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which is really sad. However, it is a program to celebrate my interest in the robot array (especially anime mek series, such as "Gundam"). I am 18 years old, this show is very cheery for me now. To prove this, notice the memory by purchasing a 2-set DVD collection with "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie". I said, "Ugg, how awful, it's another waste in the attic." Not a demonstration I'd like to see again and again for all of my people. I'm not saying leaving your life for the rest of your life, but it's not a bad thing now, is it? Instead of "Power Rangers", I recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Bulge" (highly recommended), "Ninja Senshi Tobicage" (Ninja Ninja Robots), or even ORIGINAL Sentai shows that are the clues of the original Rangers "Power Rangers."
