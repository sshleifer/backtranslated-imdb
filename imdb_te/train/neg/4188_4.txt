I'm a big mark to Neil Young's music and I was able to find Gretley's first appearance, acclaimed by the film and the film that came with many Al-indie press circles. <br /> <br /> The film began as a soundtrack, and Neil said that most of the characters came to life. Just a soundtrack was filmed. That's not the best way to create a story. The character is really an arc, and when the "important" events take place, the director does not work because the levels of film technique are very high at that time. The film is all song, and in the end, the characters on the end of the festive song are sung ... lyrics work for the first scheme and then the nerves are pressed. It does not seem to be true or fake, it's just offensive. <br /> <br /> The awful acting, finding a mood and playing it all. Low lighting at times. The only splendor I can give this film is related to many scenes portrayed as a newscast, but the film is used in the movie. A good soundtrack, but nothing I'm quick to buy. A bad image.
