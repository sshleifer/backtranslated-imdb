Although the storyline is very well illustrated, Steven Seagal's voice means that the heroine is sure to say that you are sure that many people are suffering from the movie. There are many parts he will start to talk in his deep raspy voice and then some others voice is talking to him. I do not know the reason though, if he had difficulty with his voice during the production of cinema I think maybe the events that he does not own his own voice when he seized. I rate this movie from 10 to 3 depending on the quality of the film. The admission price charged for this movie is not valuable when an image is paid for a movie on the theater or DVD. I have been for a long time for Steven Seagal and all the films he has done in previous years. So far I think it's one of the worst things I have ever seen
