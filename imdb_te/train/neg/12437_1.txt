Culkin is the main character and the first villains of the Home Alone movies first 'Home Alone 3'. However, the plot is identical with the original "Home Alone" film. Instead of two comic villains, we have three or four conversations. The film has some traps, but there is a long sequence with a remote control car. Slapstick comedy is stable, but the little boy and villains can not really make a difference in the film. (Pan is not intended.) This film is neither new nor different than previous films, nor does it have warm, holiday or subfields that have two other films. It's more of a pure comedy, but the characters did not really succeed in making me laugh I did not do it myself. I do not recommend this film; It is very boring. If you want a good Holiday Family Film with Comedy, see the original 'Home Alone' movie.
