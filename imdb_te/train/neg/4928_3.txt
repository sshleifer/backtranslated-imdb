This romantic adventure appeared to be frighteningly destructive in its day. A wealthy upper class adjusts to English women's schemes, plots and everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her special place to start the secret activities of her decisive social counterpart. She has a brilliant sex-character reversal when she proves to be more courageous and agile than most male characters. But naturally there is a long, dark and beautiful stranger to maintain love, and this bad woman is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The wishy-washy weakness and gullibility of each other can make serious plotless plot, but those who are thirsty for romance can ignore it.
