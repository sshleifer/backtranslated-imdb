On the same day I finished watching the book, I know what happened. I have high expectations of this film due to rating. This is because the film is being distributed to 10 stars. <br /> <br /> There are twin twin important things that you do not like to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** Spoilers ********** <br /> <br /> Casting. Jack Nicholson is just as fit as Jack Torrens. Also, I did not choose Shelley Duval for silver. I have painted silver very differently. They can see why Jack Nicholson, grin, pointed eyebrows, but he is not really supposed to see 'bad'. He is supposed to look simple, and he turns bad. Also, they do one of the worst image couples. Danny Alright, he needs more life though. <br /> He treated the drone. <br /> Screenplay. They cut so many things in the book, and added things. Some things have been deleted, changed or misbehaved in the book I am looking forward to. There are some things in the book I look forward to (Hedge animals, Rok Male, Elevator), and it's 2 and half an hour !! <br /> <br /> I was so frustrated. End. Holiday died, Jack was dead, Silver did not hurt anyone ... Overlok did not blow up. The ending in this book is great, and the movie is very confusing, and I'm off. Hiloron was not required to die, but Jack killed him with ax. If they want to kill him, at least Jack uses a rack mallet. <br /> <br /> There are other things that I do not like about the movie, but everything has the right things. The camera angels are cold, coming out of the elevator (not in the book) is cool, but I'm not worried too much with this movie book, everything needs to be scared. I will read this book before seeing this movie. I agree that Stephen King has never acknowledged Snanley Kubrick. I can never do that, I will take all the rights that I rarely miss him all day. I can not wait to see a 6-hour version, at least it has hedge creatures. <br /> <br />
