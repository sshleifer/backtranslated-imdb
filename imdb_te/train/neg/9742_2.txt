This is a very frustrating picture about a scientist who is terribly disturbed when a teleporter creates a device and uses the machine to transport it. Fly and other plots done earlier in others. Although he is not only bizarre, he is endocutating people with a touch. What's really stupid about this film is that we believe that this person works against him. He can create millions for the company he operates, but the company's head tries to destroy his representative at every stage. None of the three people have ever made a mistake.
