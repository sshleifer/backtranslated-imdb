<br /> <br /> First, the film starts with the police and his partner, who first put outside the police and furniture shop. The "bad" police take a girl on which they pull over the warehouse's attic, sitting outside the newbie police and thinking what will happen there. The "bad" police eventually returns with a huge duff bag, and the new cop thinks there are no problems, but he still wonders what's on the bag, so he asks, a bullshit response comes and then he feels everything <br /> <br /> " Bad "cop replicates this process, and once again with a strapped scene (a little better). But eventually people started to catch it, which took a little to consider how F *** ing was obvious. A girl gets a voodoo curse on her, even if she is dead, like a la. Now, the "bad" police eventually kills this magical protector bitch, and then removes the Duffel-Bagged body. <br /> <br /> She is the eye shadow lots, which is supposed to suggest that she could be a zombie, so that she put the oogey-boogey magic, magic curse causes all of the other girls to become "eye shadow monsters". Some girls meet with the currency expert Dude, who gives them a ride (they are usually seen by him). But when one girl looks like the other girl, she is weird (because some people are strangers, but others do not even notice) .... a huge plot hole. <br /> <br So, wipe it up, kill the "bad" police, who ends up to become a zombie in the final scene of eye shadow monsters. This is despite the fact that they are trying to prepare us for a sequel! Anyone want to see the second part of the cow's downfall.
