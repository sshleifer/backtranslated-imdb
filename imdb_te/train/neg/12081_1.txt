Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff "I thought so, * breeder *." <br /> <br /> "My favorite referee"? ", just for full absurdity. That is, and "right not good!" More than anything, I would like to credit MST3K staff to ridicule this TV movie. You can not really make the dialog a lot more fun; Bill S is a good playwright. On the other hand, this product is very quick. <br /> <br /> I would recommend that you read a book and read 'Hamlet'.
