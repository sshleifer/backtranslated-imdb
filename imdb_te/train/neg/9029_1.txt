<br /> Although it is the 'top gun' opening packed action, it has all the same stereotypes and rare situations. <br /> <br /> Many dead-end story lines in the movie have been a moment in which I have been together with a TV series that I missed at one time. <br /> <br /> Quinn's Mexican drug-lord character is ridiculous and his 'colleagues' are right in the 1970s Quinn-Martin cop show. We have no reason to believe that Costner's character is engraved and that Mendez is in love with his wife. <br /> <br /> If we believe that our wife is a mate for a colleague, we believe that the first hot body will jump. <br /> <br /> The absolutely perfect 'B' film and the huge waste of everyone involved.
