It's probably the worst ever movie ever. In fact I will do well, it is not properly arranged. The film has a budget of $ 5 and remains amended. Do not see it. I did not get through the movie all the way and had to stop it. The producer of the film is happy that it is a horror film, because I give this 1/10, but it's really bad comedy. Usually, a group of girls collapsed in a car, a headlet broke, and the owner of that car went after them. What was the hell of a woman with the gun and the loading of the girls to remove their clothes? It should be kind of cheesy porn movie.
