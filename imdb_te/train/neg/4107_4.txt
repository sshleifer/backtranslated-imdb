The problem with "The Killer Elite" is that by spending time watching and watching the movie, you're doing more of the experience than most of its celebrities, particularly director Sam Peckfaf. /> Already unstable Peckinpah was heading into tough weather with this image. At least one biographer, he was acquainted with cocaine. <br /> <br /> The concept behind the cinema is good, and the first ten minutes will promise a lot because it's a shame. Mike Laken (James Kane) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private contractors, who perform a very dirty job for the CIA. They make quick move, live well, and look like best friends - then something is going to break their brotherhood. <br /> <br /> An opening scene breaks a building on them - why not exactly for the course in terms of murky inspiration of this film. But in principle these people will kill and do not really care - a lot of opposers like Peckinpah's wild bunch of long ago. An early title tells us they're working for content, and then adds a clear tongue in the cheek ... "I think the CIA will employ such a company for any purpose, of course, alert." <br /> <br /> Burt Young, Gig Young, and Pequinpah Regular Bo Hopkins is a traditionally strong penguin backup cast featuring regular Bow Hopkins in the plum role. A madman is a madman who can not afford a fake $ 500 per day, and you only tried to do more with the script writers, including Stirling Siliphante, for the lazy-the slippery and the evil chop-sock noklafs. The attempt to disturb the dose of liberal social commentary can be heard awkwardly.

We're 40 minutes ahead of our first battle scene, a totally confusing collection of random strokes, where there are some people who have not met before us at the San Francisco Airport, an office suite in their combat interaction. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the left part of the cast is a battle within a harbor of Victory Ships, a linear who reduces the hint of real suspense to run Ninjas publicly when Ken snatched. A Climatic Samurai between two ninja warriors before the bipartisan duel, "I've been between seven and five, I'll take a little guy" - from China, we all know the land of the ninja. <br /> <br /> Ken is much better in small scenes like lawn, recovering from some dirt wounds. Among his superiors, played by a soft Arthur Hill, was made by the company "Humpty-Dump". Ken refuses to stay down, and his recovery scenes, despite the slap-to-kill for the film, fine acting from him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter, as an assistant nurse. <br /> You can not see the Killer Elite (Killer Elite), but in the 1970s "Kion in Best Actresses, Heflin, Duval, Hopkins, Thinking about it.
