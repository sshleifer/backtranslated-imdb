I did not destroy your life as a married child, but when I stamped your baby into a bastard, I saw this movie at its own time. Nowadays, 'single mothers' can seem far too long, but this is true. And I'm not crazy about laughing at someone stuttering, either. Between these two issues, the film was difficult to find funny. At the time I did not know who I directed or had any great reputation. I know Betty Hutton, she is very worried because she is an atheist. I loved "Bringing Up the Baby", but I find it difficult to just see this movie. I'm sure the punch at some church functions was probably spiked, but I needed a drink after watching this again. The girl should be drunk for 'marrying' and the difficulty for pregnancy. In a full town these circumstances you can, so the result of this film is really a funny piece. However, let me shoot, I do not like this "this is a wonderful life".
