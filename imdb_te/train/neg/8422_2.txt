Before I started, I worked well in this film and in it, and I acted in all things, deserving nomination along with Whitaker. It's very entertaining. . . This is a very good picture which is taken in the correct context of the function of the ficusion. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can read it at least one hundred times, without wasting your time, the entire fictitious nature of the film and the fatal, sell. In the credits we know that this film has provided us with the main character Dr. Nicolas Gayarin in fiction. Instead, it provides this role in a true historical setting and allows the viewer to think that he is actually true, and what they see is true. <br /> I do not have any problem with the combination of reality and fiction - but such a fraudulent thing is not true. <br /> <br /> Africa and many third world countries are filled with human suffering and suffering. Hollywood has long sought to portray people's sufferings in the film. But Hollywood also has its eye to earn money. <br /> <br /> But with the only persevering experience everywhere, the West needs to experience it, or at least it should hold in the honest documentary. <br /> <br /> These fairy tales of fictional characters can only make a lot of real historical settings. At the end of the day, they will tell the viewer about the facts he has to decide on, and to tell you about the image from the image and to throw your head over, "Look, we're sad!" Anybody who is willing to see the documentary on the DVD can find the seminal example of sitting on the film. The most awesome movie of the film, Kay Amin, sees the body's view of the second wife's wife, who killed her when she dislikes her. In this movie, we see that her organs are cut and returned to reverse (arms and arms for vice versa). The director, Ganges Bam-Bad! You understand that this is Ameen! <br /> <br /> But the documentary is not a myth that it is true that the minister sitting on health while actually telling us it is true. . . What. . . Are they just making these things? Why? Because Hollywood has the lowest impression of our intelligence, hence! They do not believe us to come to the right decision. Look, she was killed and sliced ​​and Amine is enough for us to conclude that he is not the one who likes the media - we do not need to reinforce those technology inspired images of this technology! And it's just the tip of the iceberg. Casual viewer is not even described, the main character Gaianin is fictional. There is no young Scottish doctor who took under the wing of Ameen. Moreover, Garygon is only clear to help us understand the African world. The producers are interested in us if there is no white face in a film about Africa. (Ironically, even the nominal character is portrayed by an American black actor!) This issue does not reveal the image of Amine and his regime, but a whitewash thriller coming to all Africa about a white westerner has caused many terrible mistakes, many terrible mistakes, and then three more innocent lives , "Receiving" himself. I honestly say that I am almost guilty to prove that Trimmann's real tragic death was the result of a fictional Scottish doctor - it became a morbid joke for entertainment! I really want to stop jerking us for our money in Hollywood. I first recognized its nature, which is a beautiful manodela, Ron Howard and Sugar-sweet adaptation of Akiva Goldsmann's life of John Nash, which is not enough to remove the man's dark side. The sad truth is that Hollywood has sold these counterfeiters over the years and we are very lazy to understand and understand, or the boggling viewers who buy these fake portraits hook, line, and sinks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To be honest, the truth is very surprising to persuade man's cruelty, why should Hollywood go to such fictional length? Why do Hollywood take hold of our hands by insulting us and insult us? Why can not they believe that we can think of ourselves! Can we make honesty the pictures on the screen and determine the audience? I would like to ask you to continue to see deliberately "real" movies of Hollywood, I can not imagine that the truth is always on the screen and that the truth is always close to you!
