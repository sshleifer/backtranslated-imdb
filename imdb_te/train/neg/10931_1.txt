I went to see this movie with very little expectations, which would be a good piece of grin. Sadly, this is not the case. I sit through the movie without wanting to go out. I've gone with my two children (ages 10 and 13) and they say "how long?" Asked. After permanent until the end, I kept wondering who would approve this script. Reliable Fred Willard also could not save the common dialogue, state jokes and simple stories. Whoever wrote and directed this film (I use the loose word) should take a classroom or a online screen writing class by their local community college. There are many books on movies that teach them about at least, directing, screenwriting, construction, plot, dialogue and acceleration.
