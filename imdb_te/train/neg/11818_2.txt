Mental illness on a distant planet is run through a blank space. He releases some fellow prisoners and breaks out of jail in a spaceship. They do a dock on a simple, enormous spacecraft, orbiting a supernova star. This huge craft is only three people, because the film's budget has not expanded to many actors. However, in order to minimize a long story, three goodies end up with cat and mice in a bad game. <br /> <br /> The psychological disorder in the film is a painful one. 'Frightening' is usually not a word - a lunatic - unhinged, frightening, dangerous possibly to describe but 'annoying' but he is. The three men wearing a huge ship are responsible for these important characters - this ship is practically the size of the city! It is somewhat positive that such a massive man-made effort exists in existence, as the film is expected to be set in the future for about 50 years. Despite the vast size of the spaceship, the band is impressed, small rooms and plastic table and chairs appear in the dining room. But there are a lot of corridors. <br /> <br /> The film is very well-played and it acts as an average psyched-fi thriller. But nothing great.
