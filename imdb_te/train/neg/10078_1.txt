Sequel with boy-girl love affair / songs, this time she's a punk and he's straight arrow. Is this movie like the movie that has fans of it? I mean, the mind will reels out ... "Grease 2" is a real lame company that is also a courageous, maxi or pure gallbladder ("Jaws 2" or "Exorcist II"). No, it slowly plays whimpers along the move and often dead. It looks and feels cheap, with a large cast lost in the worst direction and unnecessary management. This is the first time Michelle Pfeiffer's glimpse is, and she's not forgetting, even if she does not bother herself. A low flame of low level. **** from stars
