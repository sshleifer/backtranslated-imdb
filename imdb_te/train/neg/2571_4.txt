You can not understand this mistake in a film with Goldie Han and Peter Sellers. But what can I say? This is a terrible misfire. The film is an older gentleman about Peter Sellers, who does not tell Gilty Han about the hippie that he is hippie hippy. The picture is very confusing and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Han were very funny people but this film did not prove it. <br /> That song? The song about Crabrella is very good, but it is. I recommend this movie, I like to see a new novelty, which is the definition of one. I imagine that these images are a signal that is, with all the methods around perfect experimentation and neglect, the problem is entirely portrayed and the writing, direction is not simply mentioned there. <br /> <br /> Particularly, Peter Sellers hit a lot and missed, he went from Dr Strangelove and was there throughout this career and dumb films like this, magic Christian, context and style, but that movie had some funny moments. This is a wise one, and I'm sad in this film as anyone great like Peter Sellers. Not recommended for anyone.
