This is one of the best of the demented films I have ever seen. It suppresses almost a lot of thrillers and makes them all mess up. <br /> <br /> There is not a good line or character in total chaos. If there is a plot, it is not advisable to say nothing until it is remorseful and acting. Honestly, this kind of nonsense can be understood as how it is produced and can actually be released, and some people do not even think a little, 'Oh my God this is really the loading of the shit.' This garbage trailer is a completely different picture that people are importing, if you download it, you do not waste your time or money, do not waste your time, it's painful.
