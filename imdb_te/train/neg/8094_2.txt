As someone who has read the novel and has seen the movie, I have a different take on why the film is such a flop. First, comparisons between the novel and the images are completely surface. They are two different animals. <br /> <br /> This novel is probably a sarcastic, but it will come as a cross between tragedy and arguments. The subsequent comic strips of the later version of the film version are merely contextual to the author's uniform chronic thrust. And the author's supernatural white suit thinks again if you do not fool into thinking this another mark Twain. The best hat and tail is the more literary literature of Absus Bears. Tom Wolf is more like a clown and hacker, equal to the writer, always looking for a new grist for his self-absorbed mill. <br /> <br /> The production of the film has started producing remarkable productive skills and direction. It is not very well portrayed, rather than a genuine satire, is not one of the worldly surveys available on a form or other human behavior, but in a single-minded attack on specific individuals - true or fictitious grasses - has earned the writer's anger. <br /> <br /> Any attempt to create a hit or narrative that has been successful in such a beginning should have a pure start, without the author's influence or intervention. <br /> I also said that it was wrong with casting. Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith measure inequalities, but true talents such as Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham, and Morgan Freeman are entirely sarcastic or simply contain characters related to satire. There is enough topical thing for really great film satire, but it also failed to come close.
