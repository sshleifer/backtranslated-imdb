I do not generally think it's encouraging to comment on unwanted movies, but in such cases, I have to say something. This film is terrible, logical and stupid. There is a lot of flaws in the story that I'm not sure that it's time to leave this feeling. What's most annoying is when reading the bacon's insane impulses for someone with a power trip or physical response to his condition. <br /> <br /> The exceptional grant effects are impressive, and in the past Paul Verhoenen did some good things (the Robocop Directors cut on DVD was great). However, the film is stupid and usually does not come close to describing the point or technical aspect of things and instead settles for an imaginary action without any pleasure. <br /> In short, tell me here (I wish I had read them before) - stay away from this film!
