First things first: I'm not a conservative. Although I never refer to a liberal or a democrat, I have opposed the war in Iraq from day one. I think John Cusack is safe to say and I see the eye in politics. Of course, I'm sure Adam Curtis is talking about how great the BBC docs are. My opinion is this: Do not be dissatisfied with this review thinking that this team is not a part of the Cook's War. There is no question of appealing to my population, but problem tilting is low and Cusack co-authored, produces and starts cheaper than stars. <br /> <br /> "The road to hell is flat with good intentions". Cusack, his co-writers, director Joshua Seftel and actors, unfortunately, are intentionally trying to make every bit of anti-bit film with Robert Altman's M * A * S * H ​​hitting and making funny every bit of the American politics , Foreign policy, war "effort" is already irrelevant, resulting in tragic and curiosity. And, unfortunate humor - just look at the Daily Show and see for yourself. Bottom line No matter how much the book administration has not written us, why do you try to compete? <br /> <br /> The main problem with WI is to stay in a hurry. To complete it, Cusack primarily mired in Grosse Point Blanc (one of his best films), changed the setting and crammed into a list of ideas that came from Naomi Klein's collected works. Most of these ideas will distance your voice in your first nine minutes film and there are no clear signs or hits or Iraq's US invasions intentionally intended for a US invasion of Holliporne, Neo-Cons and Iraq. Clever or funny. Their writers opened their eyes by their own doctrine, simply by suggesting that the film was just funny and fraud. Trouble ... it's not. Now these thoughts are yesterday and you are living or under rock or ignorance, denial and pure stupidity (read: a right-wing Christian), unless these jokes have been disultingly disappeared by the usual. <br /> <br /> The WI works even if it is more active, destructive, dangerous, and detailed research / awareness in the profession. Likewise, jokes and focus garments are all superficial and very good, with a little bit more tactful, sensitive or satirical evil, they have done a little bit more than mourn. Homer Simpson once said "It's funny" and "The Daily Show" proves that this is a night of war, but it is not funny because war is still true. It's a big joke. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
