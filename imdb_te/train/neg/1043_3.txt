What a bad, bad image! I can not believe all the hype is appreciated this pretentious, amateur excuse for the real actress !! I eventually left the theater, and I was surprised at how well the film's direction and camera work was! A breathtaking attempt by cheaper and cutting through the pull of wool on the eyes of critics and festivals for reading and reading the lawsuit that claims to be true is true. At least this film has made me the full dance jacket of the Sun Dance Festival and a label that is badly illustrated here. <br /> Avoid all costs. You need your time back! I know.
