It's the worst movie I have ever seen in theaters. It is just a compilation of recycled material. It's not funny to hit the head. People kicking are not funny. A third time later a boy also got a knock on the balls that the little audience member does not laugh anymore. <br /> <br /> I have gone with my younger sister. She actually laughs out loud at King of Hill but this movie work bored her. I was not surprised. The story is very lame. In the history of Hollywood one steals a big diamond in the case of the easiest disciples. Then he acted as a baby and hid it with a family. I know it sounds wonderful but it's the whole story. There are plenty of speculative jokes that tell you those two lines over and over 1.5 hours and you will get the movie. I felt really ripped after seeing this. I did not expect much and I was still disappointed. I want to appoint some good writers to write the Keenan Jokes and / or his next script. If possible, it is much worse than white chickens. <br /> <br /> There is nothing positive about this film. Not my fun.
