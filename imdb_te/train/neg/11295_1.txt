I understand that this film was made for a child and I sat through a number of movies that parents do not have my interest, but I appreciate it from my constructive place to get my children. Parents should be encouraged to participate in their children's program, and parents will be encouraged to supervise the quality of entertainment, and some children have to appeal to adult audiences in movies. <br /> Technically, sound editing is terrible and all the conversations are over-dubbing and unnatural. Personally I hate that, but it is doubly considering that the dialogue itself appeared while writing a 12 year old for a school project. "Acting" reminded me of a school play and no child emotions have any emotions. Thankfully this is a very small movie. <br /> Now, just like a video geek is measuring a child's image with an adult yard stick, positive message. This is not my time to determine how long the message should be delivered correctly. <br /> If you are lost, do not worry, you will definitely go home. <br /> <br /> And you are my favorite, the last message left in this movie: <br / > <br /> It's OK to disagree with the statistics and you think what's right.
