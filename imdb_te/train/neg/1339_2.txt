A sad and sad sight is actually The Munster's Revenge. Munster's last time (Fred Gaidenne received a huge pay to return to Herman MÃ¼nster's role) in the TV movie produced on this TV, the city prepares for the exploitation of mummy's robbery in a show of "intimidating" robots about Wagon and Hermann's wax images. With the police on their heels, two elderly televisions try to identify those behind the crimes to clear their names. Like a waitress (a little wallet in the movie) is to be seen in a drag and a grandfather with a wired attached wire (one time he flies to Transylvania, and I often imagine him flying to Miley Cyrus), and a most annoying relative "Phantom" nousium sings and breaks down! What's Right is Right: It's Ginnenne (Especially) and All Lewis is so hideous in every scene and that the material is no different. It is the hokey costume of robots that look at them as school production values. Perhaps this is a ridiculous script. Sid Caesar's silly, mostly unfunny antics. Or perhaps it's something that brought me happiness and fanatical memories when it was treated to a super-k-mart fashion makeover. However, the result is a disappointment and frenzy to Munster standards. For the rest of the cast, Yvonne de Carlo fits in a very strange role (though she is more aggressive than a woman of her age and experience). K. C. Martel makes the most endearing Eddie Munster. Joe Macdonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings appears in a very absurd manner as the above mentioned phantom and works and speaks. It also has a real cheap feel for the TV movie of the film.
