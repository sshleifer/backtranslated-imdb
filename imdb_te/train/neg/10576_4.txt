Very happy when performing this series in 2005. The mantle is very simple and attractive: each episode is a one-hour short film directed by the famous, important horror director. Then, it's a bit daunting when I see them eventually. Some good episodes emerge from that first season, but all were mixed bag. I attributed to the curve that I learned, that season 2 is quite good. <br /> <br /> Boy, I'm for a shock. There are some good stories in at least one season. Season 2 (except "Black Cat" featuring amazing Jeffrey Cummings) for me total and total loss. Episode "Sounds Like" may be the worst thing I have seen on TV in the past 10 years, and most of the other episodes are not much better. I really hope that season 3 will change this the next year, but I do not hold my breath.
