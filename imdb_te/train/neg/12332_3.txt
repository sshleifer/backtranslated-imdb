Picture looks super on paper. <br /> <br /> Laurence Cassdon was very scared to give a lot to his two stars. They go to the cord and hang them. The script of Adam Brooks may be very blameworthy, but you expect from Kevin Klein of a fish called Venda. Instead of the two ping-pong one and the rarely growing romance is never satisfactorily satisfied, since none of them are surrounded and rounded in France. <br /> <br /> Jean Reno co-stars-a-heart as cooperating and he wishes to predict he is a star-a part. You have read that pink panther remake (s!), So perhaps he is exactly like this ... 3/10
