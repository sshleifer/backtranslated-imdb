This series of CBS networks has responded to the Big Valley success. It is 90 minutes Western as ABC show. When it comes to answer, it does not have things to do last season 2. <br /> <br /> This issue is actually a reality. For example, in one episode, Johnny is eye-thrown with a knife. Amazingly, with the end of the show, Johnny was completely healed. Along with this there are no strong stories like The Big Valley. <br /> <br /> It is a program that I do not want DVDs. Think of since CBS is running out of us, they have reused many familiar settings. It was the last Western series produced by CBS as the Western people in the late 1970s.
