<br /> <br /> Entertainment: A worst script written by intelligent people before the typewriters before the typewriters .. Thousand times .. Stimulating enthusiastic acting by the story ... Well worth the product <br/> <br/> Social Message : There is no social message for this movie. It's freely thought ... but if I'm acting I'm 10, and my IQ 70. I feel the message: do you love it? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Generally speaking, good, nothing is falling -8/10 <br /> <br /> Total Rating 4/10
