I saw this bomb when I hit the theaters. I laughed the whole time. Why? Because the foolishness seemed to be a fancy to me. I look back and realize that the whole picture is not a funny thing. There is no deliberate leak. It's a piece of Lizzie cn Nurplex and has become a giant, carnivorous monster ... yet her itty-bitty little dress put it is perfectly intact, despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times more than now. Or a person is surprised with a delibilator and only come to anomalous image type and return to conciousness without any medical attention. And they do not want to start the ridiculous task of "villain" and assume that they have decided to create a "controversy". <br /> <br /> The disgraceful parts of the film have been condemned to a person targeting children about Disney. Do we really blame Jeff Bridges, who have kirky video tapes for Darl Hannah? You're Disney and you have no plans to appeal the movie to the top 8 people without writing a more intelligent script! I believe that the Disney ratings pays off, so films can stay away with murder and still have family-friendly ratings. <br /> The waste of the DVD format.
