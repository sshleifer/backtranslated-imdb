You should give it to Steven Seagal: Any other flaw, he has good taste in women. If you choose a seagull image, chances are that one or more of the most beautiful women will be. Generally, they do not work like eye candy; They learn time to fight with the armor of "Fury of Fury", to shoot guns, kill with Kills, Ciara Peyton (a very sexy face, match with Angelina Jolie) and Katie Jones and a cowfight and a little gay! And if I feel that I spend a lot of time talking about them, it's the rest because it's civilized, it's very unpredictable because it's harder to talk. Ironically, the weak aspect seems to be that Seagal himself is not bothered to try to pretend even labor. It is a military-type activist, where there are very few fights, and he does not fit his role (obviously a stealth fighter pilot, "the best in the world"), which is his almost hazardous sleeping.
