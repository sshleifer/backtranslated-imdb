After Spike Lee directed the trailer for this movie, I'm glad to hear about this event. I was not alive at that time, and I did not live in New York, so I guess more about history than anything else. I have some interesting acting, very sexy, and 30-minute film that has something to do with Sam's son. I guess the film is not about Sam Son, but it is a peek in the summer of '77. <br /> I'm frustrated
