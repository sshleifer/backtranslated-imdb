The Indie film I really want here is, but not the end. The absence of the script (dramatically announced in the main characters) really shows the picture and kills. There is a frivolous mess that's not worth trying to figure out the story. Within the best of hope - I was quickly bored in about 10 minutes after 40 minutes in the first stage. - The chapter stops at the end (merciless) at the end of the hatch ... no extra effort is attempted. The OZARK SAVAGE tries to make it very difficult to be clever, EVIL Deadlines 2 and Trains the Best Range from MATRIX. As a result, it is very small and good at the unprepared OZARK SAVAGE. The film was very fun, it's a 10-20 minute short, but as a feature, it feels thicker and forced. However, there is no money in the shorts, so I understand fully all the financial reasons that I've inspired for expanding up to 75+ minutes. Director Matt Steiner shows great promise, and I wish him good luck.
