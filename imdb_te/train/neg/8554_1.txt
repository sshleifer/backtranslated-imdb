The motion picture was released in 1931, in all likelihoods of 1930. I guess I have had a lot of difficulties with the talking films in the transition to the silent age. However, this particular Jane Gray plot is very weak. Also, Gary Cooper may probably learn to work. The result is something that has not been approved by today's standards. In 1931, perhaps. In 2004, it was not acceptable. Some actors acted well. Unfortunately, Indians in these early Western countries always get a low end. They live on earth before the white people, but according to the distorted history, they do not have the right to defend themselves.
