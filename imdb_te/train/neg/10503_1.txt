Yesterday I saw the movie .. I rented a DVD from blockbuster .. I actually knew one of the actresses in this film. (It kept under wraps ..) But I must admit, I thought it was not so good .. Tom savi? <br /> <br /> Well, my sister has had 3 DVDs from the blockbuster, but it's not a shame. I paid Â£ 10 to rent. I chose this one and I was disappointed. Anyway, thumbs down to me ..! Tea is not my cup 10 to 0!
