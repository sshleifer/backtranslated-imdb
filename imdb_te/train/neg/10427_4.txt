Well, they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I do not know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nomenclature, but she certainly has sex with men. She still can see what her life and what men wants, trying to find "more information", although she should have a pretty good idea now as she is of age. (I can not agree that it is too old for anyone who says I am Young). If she has, she should be as good as usual.) Most of the film has left me cool, and you will see it anytime. And unlike some recent 'Ice Wide Shut', this is done at least one.
