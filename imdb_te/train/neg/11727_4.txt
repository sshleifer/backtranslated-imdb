I'll call it frightfully in this movie, but nothing in this movie will shine, and it is associated with some seriously unreliable basic plot development. It starts well, but once the main hit is completed, it's a long subfield around a little girl, which is not compelling and has some action scenes which are absurd abrasive theater. For example, lighting has a long shootout at all stroboscopic airport. There is no explanation for this. Is an airport storage area lagging and confusing lights and how is it possible that Snipes is enough to allow his incredible escape baby? <br /> If this is the case, it is one of the fewest action sequences by failing to stop believing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the United States CIA team will shoot this place in the entire campus and avoid Britain by saying "national security". This is perfect for being far from the gimmick reality, <br /> <br /> There are very good action films. Better was designed, better executed. This is entertaining at times, but there is not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes very boring - a good action film should never happen.
