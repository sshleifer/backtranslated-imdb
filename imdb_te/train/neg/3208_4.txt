This film is very disappointing to me. I waited for years to spend this film, and I was a loyal follower of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. They cut the story of half a story, but they changed the information. The lie that Lucifer is the father of the false is false. He ruined his father, but he was not his father. Voices are not consistent with the characters and you hear the voice of a beloved character, you can not get back the voice you hear in your mind. I can not remember everything about this film that was wrong. The bottom line is if you love Lady Death not to watch this movie. It's not just comic justice!
