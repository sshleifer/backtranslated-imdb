Before watching this movie I had very little expectations and just went to see the cars. Finally, I was also investigated. The plot does not exist at all. Character development does not exist. I have come up with a lot of cliche and very jaw-dropping cheese film and it is also surprising that it was released. If not exotic, I did not rate this movie as 1. A coherent plot's attempt is to be destroyed with the absurdity of this elite racing cult and the ridiculous characters that make its members. In fact, the plot of the film is so predictable and simple-thinker about the majority of the average baby storyline. Bad acting, bad storyline, bad jokes, bad image. <br /> Do not see it. Instead of playing Gran Turismo HD and saddate your thirst for faster sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste.
