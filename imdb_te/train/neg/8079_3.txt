<br /> Get a true stinker rating of the boring direction and performances (exquisite Annabel Schofield, a black man and perhaps the best thing to do, and the caretaker Charlton Heston). <br /> <br /> Heston is surprised at the performance of his usual park and shows how bad the film is. He plays in a sub-plot that kept me interested to see how the film's main line tied back. The way they ended the solution is that they are not. <br /> It really does not end. Do not waste your time at this time.
