In the opening sequence of "Malta Story", I have a terrified resemblance to Mr A.Guinness Noel Coward, and I hope his first words are "Some women often hit the throats" or some expect the world - hoping Ban Mut. His conversation is rarely a deathless prologue and the master also brings life to trouble. Moreover, Mr Guinness is looking for a focal point and wanders through the film if one fails to recognize it. There is also a serious weakness of the entire film. Mr J. Hawkins also gives the beginning and ends individually a "Jack Hawkins" performance without an ounce. It did not grow from a dozen British war films. In the early Fifties a lot of common suspects turn into a lot less benefit of their research. Luftwaffe failed to cross Malta as it failed to bring its knees to London. Malta's courage was recognized by King as an uninterrupted danger and given to the island George Cross. The valuable thing you can assume for an image, but "Malta Story" is not even worth the word "valuable" in its most inspiring concept. It will have to live with the appearance of a round-tripping encounter with a deadline before it quickly lose the actors.
