The little assistant of Satan is one of the best B Horror movies I have ever seen. I understand this story when I say goodbye. This film is not a clich√© in the new plot, horror style - something is fresh. But there are some ridiculous questions that accompany it. <br /> <br /> The film first caught my attention when I was doing a cruise in the Harrier section. I was tired of all the "awful" Hollywood blockbusters and wanted to have different wishes. The cover art for the little assistant to Satan has caught my attention immediately. If you look at, the picture will attract you - spraying it! I knew it was a direct DVD release - but I took a chance. I mean, I saw the "Boogie Man" the night before - so it's no worse! After watching the film, I was satisfied with semi. I loved the movie plot. It's really creepy how the killer's little boyfriend deals with, so he can kill. As some shamelessly, he felt he and the little boy were involved - the duo of terror. It's a great idea to set the movie on the night of Halloween. In this way, no one will think of a masked man next to a small kid. They think he is not his guardian. <br /> When your son "friend" came home he did a trick or treat - that's fine. You do not think about it - if he is 9 years old, at the same age as his age. However, when he appeared with a strange man in a pursuit, you will be frightening and protective of your child. You removed his mask and asked him to recognize himself. You ask why he is with your son. He did not know him. You tell him for leaving. He is not a family friend. He is a stranger. Now we want to teach our child not to talk to strangers. In this case, mum is totally fine. Huh? They do not speak "man" - at all it never seems to be a tad odd. <br /> <br /> In this movie the son is beat down. <br /> <br /> The film moves from there to the hill. The thing that most came to me, all mum said "Do you want some cider?". I can not say how many times she has said this in the film. It's like, oh you're dying - if we cider, it's all good !! The film is guaranteed, and has failed. This is a big part of a horror / comedy, and it fails. I call it "dood", "flap" etc. <br /> <br /> The best cover art is the cover art. However, it tells me that it's not worth 12 dollars!
