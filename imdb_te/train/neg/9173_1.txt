<br /> <br /> Mistake 1: Absolutely no connection was made. Characters. <br /> You are not in any relationship with any characters in the film because you do not have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Except this particular character, the result of the film is not meaningless, because all the characters are lifeless from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Wrong 2: The worst gun scene ever. I love the gun. When the heroes opened in Badgis and the clean house, I loved it. Heck I sometimes like to see a badguy clean house. But I hate this gun and I think it's the best way to explain it. "Apathetic" While I was playing video, I was shot with more sense and emotion. <br /> <br /> The "actors" in this movie have just walked through the shooting of everything that has moved without emotion. Where is the worst talking? Where is the snare of excitement between the gunfire? <br /> <br /> These are real mental traits, and virtual soldiers exhibit their humanity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a solitary house demons, I am reviewing Sam Rama's Evil Dead range. Do not see a catastrophe that is dead house. They hope that they will be the owner of this film and burn all copies.
