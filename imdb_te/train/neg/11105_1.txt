It makes no sense and it is terrible ... I have a lot of movies in Hollywood ... you can not see it. What should I tell people that people cutter or eaten it ... This made me sick! Oh god! We do not know the movie but it cares with humans! They have teeth bla bla bla ... that's not familiar? I saw in another movie. The cast was great but I felt really awful in the scenario. And I say that Bradley Cooper is absolutely fantastic ... he's so talented ... in fact I'm terrified, but I think terrible scenes ... explain it. Do you ever have a tongue? But a guy in the movie did it! It's really awful ... anyway I think the film is so good without the horrific human eater or cutter scenes ...
