The film has introduced the first half or more characters and a series of their relationships. None of them does not produce interest or positive feedback. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do. I'm not worth explaining the action. The story is not bad, I can say that I have some problems with the script - i.e. I felt strong. A Look at Credits Here is a pretty strong cast, you can use it will be used. The old pros is very good jobs in the film; I did not appear more than most of the actors I liked prior to Deborah Cara Unger. I can say that it's good to tell about this film.
