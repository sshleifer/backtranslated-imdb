<br /> <br /> Cheap-looking and ugly, this film lights children in the audience, except for the most entertaining toilet joke. Christopher Lloyd is in the lead role in this role and is really confusing, although the authors do not forgive jokes. Elizabeth Hurley is inappropriate in a comic role. Jeff Daniels and Durriel Hanna to remove the shame. There is no reason for this film to necessarily be comparing to Robin Williams's often remarkable improvements in Mork & Mendy. <br /> <br />
