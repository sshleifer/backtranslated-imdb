Turn your backs away or you're getting big trouble getting back to my BOYFRIEND! The happy ending can only bloom your innocence that is full of darkness and doom at the very moment you're watching this. It is safe to say that the whole film is broken apart, a trivial approach to confusion and a zombie performance. We get a name like "Johnny" everyday, and there is no way to go to this "Johnny". There is no special reason why our "dead corpse" causes survival from his grave to a practical night, so the film is totally useless. Without mourning, his mother persuaded him to tell the dead doctor. Johnny then takes a bite from Eddie's shoulder. The viewer asked me a tough question: Why is this cinema cool? There is an answer. What kind of comparison to all those who live or die is completely coincidental. "Living" is a coincidence. Nothing to "Dead" Show this one to your girlfriend and she'll skip out of the senior prom, turning your life into a deserted tide. Blah !!!
