I saw this movie, thirteen years old. I had a lot of work. In New York, I returned to the film because it was 16 ratings in Germany. It's boring. Then I realized that the husband would kill his wife. Today I'll do it via internet and you pay for instant access. It's already 20 years ago, but with this film I will waste my time. It's soft-to-school for schoolchildren. To translate Bo Derek and her color painting - is nice. But they should be named Undressing Boy and her painting of the film.
