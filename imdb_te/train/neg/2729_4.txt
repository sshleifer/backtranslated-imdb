The All-Star Warner Bros.'s origin has begun for patriotism and song, as the real-life philanthropic gesture of actress Ruth Roman who wants to go to the Korean War at an air base in San Francisco. Most celebrities play a guest role, but love-hateful love is developed between a junior starlet and a strongly green and bathing air corporal (Ron Hagghey, who will deliver newspapers from his bicycle). When the horns (and flying out of harms, he thinks he's happy to be out of harm's way, but instead he thinks of the battlefield when she thinks she's like it), like a baby boy in the 1950s film.) Doris Day will be around for the first thirty minutes or so, and her various laughter and plucky song songs are very pleasant. Roman is also appealing here, James Cognie sang his screenwriter and Gordon MacIay in a fun baritone. Jane Wyman also praised a hospital bed after Doris Day's lead, "Do they run out of sets?" An interesting flashback for Undemanding viewers, another time and space. However, "low cost" production and just enough technical items "Starlift" provide a second biller. **** from * 1/2
