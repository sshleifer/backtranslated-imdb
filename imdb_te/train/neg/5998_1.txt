The basic principle for the original series; Take one and like the audience and send them to mortal criteria. This formula worked for 32 episodes between 1964-68. <br /> Now, we're going to go back 40 years to 2004. We've introduced his friend, Fermat, a youthful know-all, Alan Tracy, to a somewhat attentive college school kid. They are whisked by the Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird of the Island Family Paradise for Family Lives, the school's holidays. Immediately, they go to rescue John from Thunderbird 5, which was hit by Kyrano and his daughter, one of the adults who took care of the tin-tin. <br /> This is all part of the hood scheme to steal Thunderbird machines. <br /> <br /> This conversation is simple, (fiberglass) puppets, effects, anything but unique and more acting than Hans Zimmer's score. Barry Gray's splendid background shone through Zimmer's pale bandwagon. The remaining score is memorable. In fact, the part of the score was broadcast on the radio the next week and did not recognize it! <br /> <br /> To be more fun, Ron Cook worked well as Parker, while he and Sophia Miles were wasting Penelope. With the right thing, they could have stopped the show. CGI work I called the leading edge - 5 years ago. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the main craft are just wrong; <br /> In the case of another product, the total production is considered to be the total long-term production recruitment. <br /> <br /> My son (9) enjoyed the movie but this cross between Spy Kids and Clockstoppers, Thunderbird Legend, aimed squarely at his age. Star Trek sucked into the whole new housing franchise of life when it hit the big screen with 'The Motion Picture' in 1979, which lasted for 20 years. <br /> <br /> With this film, the frames of the Thorbubds franchise have lost the Golden Opportunity. <br /> <br /> In the six months' time, the original series left its' classic 'status, with the movie' The Avengers' and 'The Saint' to sink in the dark.
