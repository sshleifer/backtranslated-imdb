Oh god! Please, for all the sacred love, do not watch this movie! It's 82 minutes of my life I'll never be back. Sure, I could not have stopped looking through the half way. But I think it's better. It does not. In fact anyone who has enjoyed this film is seriously ill and distorted. Not surprisingly there is a deadly reputation for making films in Australia / New Zealand. From acting to editing everything about this film is horrible. I usually do not write reviews here, but in this case I'll do exception. I wish that someone warned me before I had put this disaster
