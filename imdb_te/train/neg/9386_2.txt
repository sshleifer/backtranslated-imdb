In many films I saw Warren Oates, and I came to the exact end, a good guy here. In the 1960s television series called Stony Burke, I first saw Mr. Oates. Since then, I have followed his career very closely and he is directed to great characters. In 1974, Sam Peckinpai gave him the best billing of 'Bring Me the Alfredo Garcia Head'. However, his great role in 'The Wild Bunch' is his great role. I always thought I could come up with any magic of any role, until I saw him in this flaw. The film is called "Chandler", a tribute to iron-heavy detectives created by Raymond Chandler in the 1950s. Because, compilation it's about a hard nose private eye, I'm immediately interested. However, I was patient with the whole picture, which was a disappointing, interesting, slow pace, twisted, confused saga, a background or plot that would have to remain in the back of a dark background. With the Hollywood best supporting actors like Alec Dyer, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scottman Crotter, the film has enough power to reach five, but it is confused in the laboratory. As a result, one of my favorite actors was stuck in a poorly constructed vehicle, which was never on the ground. **
