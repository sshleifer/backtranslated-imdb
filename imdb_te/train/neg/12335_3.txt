Kevin Klein and Meg Ryan were one of the middle roles, and I was always interested in the reviews. <br /> <br /> I am a beautiful and attractive actress in almost all of her roles, and Kevin Kline is always worth watching. <br /> <br /> First, Meg Ryan does not play a preferred role, she begins to wear a weaker whiner after the initial credits and starts to rotate on your nerves Days later. Kevin Klein's character is more disturbing and less fond of the character. So, even if you like these two actors, I would recommend this film to give you your pass.
