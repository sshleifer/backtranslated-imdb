The only reason for casting this image 1 is zero selection options. Slightly with the theme of recession era cabbage soup, horror acting and the special effects that appear to come from the "Thunderbirds" TV series, the critic is surprised that the director did not kill him to keep this black mark on his resume. Unlike some of the underwater submarine scenes, the special effects are worse, even through the 1950s standard. 20,000 leagues under the sea and THEM! Except, nobody is affected by it because I can assume that it has been nominated for the best special effects. This is certainly not competition in Disney if it's their only competitive. The most realistic scenario in the submarine I do not recommend this movie for sea water submarine motion picture buffs, only a shot that can see dribbling dropped above sea water upstairs. Other than the 20,000 leagues mentioned above or the torpedo run are other, better, sub-movies you enjoy in this era.
