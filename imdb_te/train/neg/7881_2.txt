This film is the image of the young boy Benjamin of half-spazzes who will visit a boarding school because his lousy marks in the monastery. He did not have the best experiences in his life and was confronted with self-esteem. After a hard start in his new school, he makes friends, falling in love with a girl and some American pheish teens stuff. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the story boundaries, save your time and look at someone else. If you do, please read the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin total defeat. Whatever he is, he makes a terrible mistake, then he goes for self-pity at all times. He did not like that kind of "lovely defeat" who you feel sympathetic and laugh. Instead he and his behavior really got irritated me and I could not see myself with my own teens. <br /> <br /> 2) This movie seeks to evolve and the story is not just as experienced characters from me (except perhaps Janosch). Yes, I know that the movie depends on the autobiographical history written at 17, but I have some experiences with German schools and German youths, and I do not trust him. <br /> <br />) Showing a sexual awakening is really an important issue for the film with this subject. But I suspect that I would make young people "epic cookie", where everyone would have to eat a sperm-wet cookie when the dog hit the sperm with his sperm during the mass-muscle and in the woods. <br /> <br /> 4) There is a sub plot in the family of Benjamin and his father cheated his wife - still, I do not know where it is and where to put it. It's frustrating for me. <br /> <br /> I have personally hated Benjamin's character, dramatic and intense efforts, without message, concept, and scheme. However, some people are intelligent and seemingly impressive. If you like "The Other Sister", you probably prefer it too. <br /> <br If 17-year-old boys do not write autobiography, they do not seem to be the best to take the film out of it. <br /> 10 out of 2.
