Be clear to me. I've used IMDb for years. But today I have suffered the difficulties of registering on this site, so I gave the film a very low rating. I've seen hundreds of movies, some of them are bad, some awful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is the princess, but Fokio, a young boy is completely unbelievable. Fiona Shaw has always been an entertaining role, but even worse, than the origin of dialogue in the film (which until now has never reached Hollywood until Marivaux, and we should be that). <Br / For example, Lionine is a brilliant, emotional philosopher and scientist, showing the names of her famous scientists by pouring chemicals from poppy seeds from beaker. And romance between Agis and the princess is also played sillier. For this, the couple should receive a joint 'Claire Danes' award awarded in a mere world for the gratuitously unhealthy and uninspired return of the curious teens from the literature of Brats (see Miss Dance in Les Miserables) in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> Apart from the worst plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic movements in the shoot. For example, there are cases where some spectators and actors are sitting in the chairs and seeing the main characters deteriorating. The director wants us to realize that she has taken the drama. I understand. But it's not much of a movie. At that point, after a moment sitting in a chair and seeing the crowd of people, disappearing, creepy and attention. They're sort of un-scary zombie audience, filling us with destruction and appearing through compliments. <br /> <br /> When you look at the horror hype and the end of the film, you would like to jumping your own audiences and poisonously destroying your mind for 112 minutes. <br /> McGuire
