Okay. See- I've seen a lot of people and I am the lots of this kind of movies. Did you know that the DVD cover is not just a good and scaarrryyy, is not the WAIT language to see it? Well, I got GOT again. And I'm so tired. But I'm turning. It's pretty simple. It sucks (I know, instead of childhood) but it did. And if I sit through SO boring thing, why do the other poster agree why the main actress should be so unnattractive? So distractingly so if I add it. And helped her lessen her unwanted pain / grief over the death of her daughter. I mean, Jesus .. Oh, but the crawl-on-her-back-daemon thing is beautiful ...
