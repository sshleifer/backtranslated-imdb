Oh my God, I gave this film more than ten reasons. The final scene is once again very effective and it is absolutely cheerful. That's what it gets that three points. Something else is different, it's worse. This is very clear, not understandable, but dabbing, acting dubbing voices, they say dialogue, where often the happiest. Actions performed, and / or will not be displayed too happy and / or throw things on the screen. Such a whole town is slain and a small group of people like when they stand on a balcony looking like a cooking glass, or as if they are looking "escaped" from the church in which the hole is. <Br >> Meyer: You should go upstairs Look at the window. <br /> <br /> Hero: okay. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "I'm going to have a baby boy, <br /> <br /> Hero (Upstairs): He again tries to escape and open the door, he's crazy, it's a bed <br /> <br /> Where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> Hero (stepped now): I do not know, I can not see her <br /> <br /> <br /> This is 10 minutes later, when someone threw things on the screen, so to see the first picture with a pair of friends, have some drinks, and you see this one Be sure to get out of time, you are sure blindly drunk and laugh all the stupidity just like it brought it up and no good gore, no such shame.
