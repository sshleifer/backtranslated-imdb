Why? !! It's a thin, uninspired and awkward image. The trouble comes from the city they make ... Pittsburgh PA! <br /> When this film is first released ... it's a romantic comedy ... and no robot-anything. Disney's pruning has changed all along. Why ???? They have made terrible commentary on this classic comic character. Matthew Broderick does not have to look at his own films. Shish !!
