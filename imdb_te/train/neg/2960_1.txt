This is, without doubt, the only worst image ever created. There are no arguments here. This is the same. End of the story. The story is childhood and sub-Chinese, which appears to have been created at the age of three, attracted by dinosaurs. The whole concept is just plain dumb. It's probably unthinkable how anyone thought of something stupid and think it's fun. Jokes are completely dull. If you do not see this movie yet, you are feeling lucky. If you're furious about how bad this movie is, please do not explain it. Words can not express how well the words are good. This is not bad because it's a bad image. If entertainment is not worth it, they will also be cohesive. D. . . It is. . . Oh, no! By now, the bad story is told to increase the level of its wickedness by 5,000, and the film is not as bad as it is. After giving a point to the Pokemon movie, giving the film a point seems like voluntary little nothing. How bad it is. Producers and directors also took cinemas? Because this is a good example of how not to make a film. This film seems to have done some amateur high performances. If you rent it, please take it back and ask for a refund. And it does not think about renting again.
