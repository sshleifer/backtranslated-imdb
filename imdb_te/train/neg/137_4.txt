It's plain to see why scary filmmakers make it so easy to stimulate these 'teen slasher' movies. They are so unbelievable in principle. If Valentines were released a year or so ago, I'm sure I'm spoofing this movie - if you find any original original material to separate from the screens, you're late summers and urban legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine is a must leave our room for an endless sequel. As always, the mental killer masked a pretty young man, killing the main character's friends one by one, killing each other, and generally killing him in the top style. <br /> <br /> I can not stand on the type of films they are doing, and what they do is their own. The point is that after the murderer has been merely intentionally revealed and friends are the main character of the murder now. However, the fact that the film is not clearly visible (eg, the mother's uncle's fishing partner, his friend's father kicked the dog). Everyone who is alive throughout the film is 'suspicious', but they are more 'red herring' than the suspects. As we all know this time, the main character performs a frightening parachute and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the intent is revealed. <br /> Valentine sends this formula to the north. *************** Spoiler !!!!!! (Small spoiler anyway) *************** Valentine's purpose is not revealed, but more, the film is a typical 'teen slash' way. This is the only solution. Moreover, the main killer's goal is bloodshed and almost everyone can be killed or not. <br /> <br /> It is still not a good film for Valentine, instead it is not as bad as it is, it is still not counted for so much. Please do not let anybody think of making a different film like this. Realism is very important, and see what realism is coming from this genre.
