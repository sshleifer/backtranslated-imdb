Tenants looking at me was an interesting experience. This is the first film I was shuttling at speeds through (non) actions - and I normally see anything from the Turkic Action Movies to any Blue-Croat Indie and see them attractive. <br /> <br /> Tenements are frustrating, slow and overwhelming. One of the main issues of the script is the dialogue of a very realistic character, which is a very conceptual setting, rather than the characters 'dashed' sets (for this to work, the film is required to have a more conceptual feel). This leads to a realistic development; <br /> <br /> This is the character of the outrageous Bill Spear, aka Snop Dogg. I recognized his role as very uncomfortable and very apathetic. At one point, I also stopped the film because of the character's aggressive, violent and unilateral delivery, lack of other personality layer, some of the later behavioral processes (which I would expect after a while), and I wanted to have a lot of symptoms. However, one reason for this jar is the vague time of the film (probably the 70s, it seems, and with more early nutrients). If it is more secure in the 70s, his role may seem more understandable. <br /> <br /> The light of the image is also embarrassing. By all means, the soundtrack tries to provide a specific sandy, jazz-inspired atmosphere that does not come just because the set is very well-lit. <br /> For me, an unbelievable picture. It does not classify real people or offer any interesting ways of thinking about the race, identity, or author's life, whether white or black. <br /> Surprisingly, David Lynch needed; His novelty, claustrophobia and obsessive look and feelings were both amazing and took both the actors and the script.
