I saw this film yesterday ... I can not believe reviews on this site. Buffaloes should be given to the same star. Well, I am a Buffy fan in the first order, but when I see it I know the worst. At each level, this movie is terrible. Technically, the movie does not know where you are, even in one scene, it's a crazy POV without reason. There is no logic in the cinematic rules. It is tragic for the emotionally bleak desire and tries to be a psychological thriller when it's just confusing. Throwing nasty-looking red necks in your image is a cheap way to provide "atmosphere". I have been out of patience for a long time before the last act, but my friends have a lot of fun doing Mst3K riffs to turn it off. Since leaving Buffy SMG has 2 successful movies, if you can even list "Scooby Doo" on your reboot. Gellar is a good actress, but she (or her agent) certainly does not find a vehicle for her. Mr. Shepard, if you are struggling to pay your trouble, I'll send you a few bucks if you make a promise that will not appear again! (Also, claim that the estate of Patzi Klein is defamatory!)
