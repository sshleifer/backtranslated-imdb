'Deep of the Tower' / 'Game of Death 2' has a lot of stupid moments, but you're really surprised if it's a spoof. <br /> <br /> In order to be honest, the film expresses dissatisfaction with 'Death of the Game'. If anything, it's a sequel / remake of 'Enter the Dragon', incorporating several elements of that movie - especially footage. Bruce Lee's role in Billy (apparently) investigates a portion of the film about the sudden death of his friend and the man's daughter left. When the body was stolen (the body) was stolen, Billy was also killed and his ailing brother was to take revenge for the death of men. <br /> <br /> Tang Lang is a kind of movie that looks like the younger brother Bobby and does not really make the film. His combat capabilities are very good. Bruce Lee clearly deleted the footage in cash on the Legacy (thanks no longer). Overall, the footage was actually edited rather than 'Game of Death', but it did not stop the film from being a mess. <br /> <br /> Okay, fights are actually very entertaining (courageous I have said) and the film makes it at least viewable. But there are many movies that really test your patience. First, there is a villain living in his delightful estate ... or that mental institution? Seriously, dirty raw meat, drinks deer blood, have a monkey on his shoulder and some peacocks and lions (?!). <br /> <br /> In fact, when the middle part is terrified and the scene involves, he feels sorry for him. I came from a naked hooker and a lion suit. However, I finished the film and made me happy because all the reasons for the end of the battle scenes (like 'god'). While the story is embarrassing, that action is great and has an amazing dancer. <br /> <br /> But in any event, the end will be disappointing. We say 'Death of Death' is a pagoda that is upside down and underground. It's great like a twist in Bruce Lee's original idea with different styles struggling at every level. Could it be the 'Plan of Death' originally planned? No! The film is to be named "Death Generator Room", because the dome goes far beyond. Yes, there really are only one or two 'different' styles ... There are grunts, leopard-skin ball and stupid sank. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ' <br /> Once looking for fast paced fighting scenes, but stupid hurts sometimes. It was meant, then fine. However, throws for the projector room to recreate the scene from 'Enter the Dragon'.
