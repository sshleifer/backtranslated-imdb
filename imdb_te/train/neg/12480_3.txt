... or, more precisely, it is very painful to have your donkey smiling while you see your life! In 1983, James Sartellatti's "Deathstockler" was one of the most awful structures that certainly brought Sword & Morgan Sub-Generation, but it was very fun. Performance is terrible, the plot is pure garbage, and the effects and photography are not more ambitious. <br /> <br /> One day, a good witch to free the country from his brutal ruler, the evil king and the magician Munkar, His powers to combine the three powers of chaos and creation, knife, amulet and a skull. It is easy to get a knife, but in the possession of the mantra and the charm of Mumkar, fortunately, the evil royal The tournament was set up where the county's most talented warriors were fighting each other until their death, and the winner would then take the king's place. Is the three forces of creation <br /> <br /> Fortunately, for the tournament, the beautiful woman fighter Kira (Lana Clarkson) was allowed to hunt for the film, Bored to go. Stupid and funny scenes.

Gore has a fair amount, and a lot of male nudity to keep the viewer entertained. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly awful movie, but I still highly recommend it. People with a sense of humor have a lifetime of their lifetime!
