<br /> <br /> This form and stereotypes only wanted to believe after the form of this mainstream comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, this has been done in a completely different way - on the other side it is quite a bit to show. I bet a little seed went nuts for this. <br /> <br /> You have to remove any of the main characters from the humorous chops. Danny K is also a good time. I'm really serious. <br /> <br /> Whenever they introduce a bit of character, I say, "Darn, take this guy!" <br /> <br /> Independent camera work is not that terrible. Black and white did nothing for this film - it would be more damaging by taking a frustrating respite with such a flat conversation. Black and white is not even crisp. Compilation is terrible. The use of music is terrible. <br /> <br /> Why are the errors in this film stick in my mind? <br /> <br /> I do not speak to Carney (who is more ridiculous than Leeds) and not David - see it and you understand. I have landed guys who can handle Oppikoppi. Nobody thinks there is nothing. I came to the conclusion that someone was filmed back in the garden. I know simple boys who have very ridiculous, raunchier and screaming conversations over these "comics". <br /> <br /> SA Want to stay a little longer in the rocky age of comedy. Nice work guys.
