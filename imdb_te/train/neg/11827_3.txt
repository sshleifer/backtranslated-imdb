Just got back from a free screening and I'm so glad I did not pay to watch this very sub-part film. The theater is packed and the crowd are mixed with children and adults. It all seemed like kids who are laughing while all the slap-stick and fake jokes (good god they liked to punch this poor mice too!). The film is pretty juvenile, unconscious, predictable, and more painful. <br /> <br /> The letters appear to be thrown together to fill the vacuum, and the relationships between them have no charm. </ P> <p> Visually, the film is really nothing. They did a good job of simulating the clay form from Wallace and Gromit, but it was more than a memorable picture. <br /> <br /> I am really frustrated with the whole picture, I chuck twice. It's not a complete failure, but I'm not sure I'll see it again. If you're a parent with children (and do not mind if you do not mind your children's mindless cheap jokes), do not hesitate to see them, but not everyone should waste their money.
