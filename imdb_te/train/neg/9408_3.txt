<br /> <br /> When I first saw the video tape replay of Spiderman Cartoons 8 different 1994-1997 I realized why I did not fall in the stomach. <br /> <br /> I'm from the old school in 1967, the Spider-Man cartoon is the best and still remains the best. <br /> <br /> "Paul Souls, where are you now? For this guy Spider-Man Voce is a very good idea for a small cartoon short-range, wins me, like Doctor Belle Lugosi's comedy version, with a red skull and dock ok, while ok is huge Russian and red Germany to Skull The old Marvel Comic Hero series has a very good voice acting since 1966. The Iron Man alerted the iron mask, while Captain America alerted the power of some teens kid as Paul Thiece as the Thing in the 60s, the oldest voice actors were pioneers And nobody will ever be with them forever Mel Blanc <br /> <br /> The animation is clunky, so they all have fancy character shadings and fine paint backrooms. They sometimes become robotic when they capture computer movements. I really do not think this animator knows what's in the middle. <br /> <br /> The stories are written badly, and some of the lines they give are terrible. For example, why do the leaders fight together for the first time? In secret wars, it disgraces them with disagreement. The heroine is like, unknown and mysterious - I see if the hero is dark, but Thing and Iron Man can not be temporarily with each other, then the Torch meets. This is the next comic everyone wants to get to the leaders to square every few seconds, 'everyone wants to see that item.' Give them a good reason to fight, and it may be pulled, but LAME reasons are "hey what you are doing here" and "I do not know what to do". There is another badly written scene in The Wedding, which masks itself to ruin Harry Osbourne Peter's marriage. <br /> <br /> Last but not sure, another reviewer calls the Juvenile Violence - no punches. In Secret Wars, Lizard carefully closes the charge of Thing. But Thing hits the bad people in the entire block of comics. He will have to recover the huge things by catching him in the cartoons and suppress the bad man. Certainly, these cartoons did not make us older than 12 years of age. Mummy and Daddy can not punch because they do not believe in violence. But you can blow things up, these cartoons are those. Before the political correctness came in childhood fashion I saw cartoons on each other. What's wrong with a punch of chops? Is there really little violence in today's world because these soft and crafty new cartoons punch? It's more insulting than when I see new things. "<br /> <br
