John Corredrine does not get a film in the funeral procession of his character, just a matter of 5 minutes (the script & plot collection read) in the film. This story is the final determination of his character & clause. It specifies that his estate is divided between its 4 children and servants. Children split equals $ 136 million, but if any of them die, it breaks into the remaining portions of that part. If all the children die then it is divided among the servants. They are entitled to live in a family estate for a week. It sounds like a regular plot of a reality show. <br /> <br /> There is a small subspecies about the nature of the dein. They are a powerful and seriously dysfunctional family, but the real trouble starts with that dog drowning. From the earliest voice-over by John Caradine you will lead a Machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist that ends with this movie. <br /> The journey is painful, slow and nonsense. Misuse of the "fish bowl" shot, persistent dialogue between men wearing silk, persistent bickering, false circus music, expressionism of fox-German memory, expressions of horror aesthetic and dramatic overtake of 4th grade. This all leads to an expected & ungratifying end. You are still happy to stay alive, but the pain may be great to be alone. Sharing children, sharing. <br /> <br /> Keloid rehab
