The easiest way to describe this film is a sarcastic. The satirical target is widespread from the United States to corporate America. <br /> <br /> Think about this film as a mix between the Kentucky Fried film, Airplane and Police Squad series, with a much smaller budget. Funny. I can see how this film is surreal to many sci-fi disaster scenes from the 50s and 60s. The film has a big impact on Tim Burton's Mars Attacks. <br /> The plot is simple. Genetically engineered giant tomatoes went "foolish" and started attacking people and cities. <br /> <br /> ఈ సినిమాలో పాత్రలు మరియు పాత్రల స్వరూపం నడుస్తుంది: లోయిస్ "ఫెయిర్చైల్డ్" (లోయిస్ లేన్ క్లోన్), చాలా ప్రతిష్టాత్మకమైన ప్రెసిడెన్షియల్ ప్రెస్ సెక్రటరీ, క్లార్క్ కెంట్, మాసన్ డిక్సన్ (బే ఆఫ్ పిగ్స్ నుంచి పని చేయని FIA ఏజెంట్), ఒక నిష్ఫలమైన The marketing chief executive of the president (who can attack his name and attack on New York), and Mason's band, an East German "lady" swimmer with a obese Scuba diver, an African-American cloaking a kruded WWII paratroopers and expert (George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally the tomatoes in disguise) is the pseudonym. I also forgot to say, lots and lots of tomatoes? Tomatoes from tomatoes, tomatoes juice, tomato juice and finally tomatoes are all kinds of tomatoes for tomatoes. <br /> All of this above, the musical numbers are the same. They are not good and dubbing. The theme of the best tune movie ("Attack of the killer tomatoes"). It's very impressive and you can finish singing in humming or public. <br /> <br /> The movie is very fun and shows the absurdity of various real-life situations as well as various recreational arts. I believe that I was a laugh, but smiled on my head. I definitely recommend this movie to fans of B and C grade films, but only rent. <br /> <br /> Sullivan rehabilitation
