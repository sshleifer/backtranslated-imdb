I've seen a lot of stupid movies in my life, but this is very bad in this regard! I usually like dumb films, if they're some entertaining, but I can not even think of a good thing about this movie. I like "Teen Witch" for Heaven. But S.I.C.K. The whole thing is terrible acting, lame romantic music, and even sex scenes snooze! I have to compare the image of the film to "Twin Dragons", "Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys" or "A Braille Brady Sequel". However, it is much worse. I beg you, do not waste your time. Believe me, its 2 hours you will never be back.
