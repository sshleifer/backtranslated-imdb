Oh, brother. This very frustrating movie is the whole "bomb" from me because it is at least historically noticeable because it is the first three Stooges film (when they burden with their own yet painful unfunny Ted Healy). But as a longtime stooges fan, I used this young Mo, Larry and Curley as the three fools' assistant to Mr. Heli's long bass guitarist. They were not regularly demonstrated by the film and painted like their stupid cartoon characters trying hard to be more entertaining with their silly on and off-back stunts. <br /> <br /> Barry Munzausen (Here's a good example of comedy: "I object!" "no grounds?" "coffee grounds!") Perl tries to get some cookie from the audience. There is no other than his follower Jimmy Durante, but Schenzes is also a bore.
