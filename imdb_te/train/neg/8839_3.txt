Nice effort and good ideas (Redemption of Adultery, Humans for Each Other Help), but a poor result ... The director obviously tried to imitate his French colleague Tran un hong ... The only problem is that this Vietnam has gone and the "green papaya fragrance" When there is a historical background ... this kind of atmosphere (muffled sounds and the life of life The pace of the project was trying to worship. ..) leaves the concept of pseudo-modern days. <br /> <br /> I think this action is going to be only in Saigon or Da Nang because Harvey Keitel in this film, former sea, was probably founded during the war ... but no one or so few actors in south Vietnam speak north voice ... even odd odd for a bad Vietnamese speaker. <br /> A farmer girl who reads and writes extensive Vietnamese poetry, ... more skeptical (with his condition is not a disease for people) ... old poet with leprosy ...
