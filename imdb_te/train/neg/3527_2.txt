It had to look at this COS which appeared in a great scary premise - prisoners finding the magic book, that's wrong! <br /> <br /> But with a great idea, it does not look like a story to go. Apart from the chilling / physical horror, it is based on the effects of open-fire and OTT body horror- if not more than 12 if you do not get scared. <br /> <br /> The logic at the end is ridiculous, with the characters being killed without the exclusion of the body. Good characters waste - great about this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a low-budget, does not damage it, the movie really goes anywhere - needs a remake of Hollywood. You just loose in this version. Definitely not the least in the same league as in other French films coming over the last few years will not be visible until the end to be at least sighted / entertaining, malefique honesty like Crimson Rivers. And I bet you can predict the end before you see the movie. Really really disappointing- is impossible to recommend.
