Yet another "son grows" movie, and other recent entries. What's the third time Hayder chooses Napoleon in another bad one? Anna Faris is always unforgettable, as always; Jeff Daniels telephoned it from another state, at least; And Diane Keaton ... How is this kind of lasting one in a career? Do not be sad. Never been covered many times here. I will say this. This is a hundred times better than "start failure". There are a lot of fun bits in this movie, unless you feel that Eli Wallach is funny. Hah, hah! He was an old man and he knocked off the f-bomb! Tea, hee, hee. Pitiful!
