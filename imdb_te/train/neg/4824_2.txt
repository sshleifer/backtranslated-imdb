I wanted to like this film, but it has destroyed many things for me. The use of the edgy and choppy compilation is not a feeling for me to be in the world of Meta, but I think I'm looking for MTV for a few moments. The film did not go anywhere and acting was really a wonderful example of acting. I love movies that give us a glimpse into the CD underworld, but this film does not decide if it is a bad horror movie or a worst serious commentary on addiction horror.
