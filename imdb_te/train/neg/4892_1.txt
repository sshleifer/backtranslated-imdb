<br /> They have sex with watermelons in Asia. <br /> <br /> First, I suspect that, but after seeing the wayward cloud, I convinced me to change my mind and eventually people have sex with watermelons, dead or alive. Secure sex of course. After a dead lady (terrified ugly) celebrity, she fires in the lady's mouth. Never heard of HIV? <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is mainly frustrating, but it is very enormous. In fact, one thing is that it does not take off my virgin eyes when it comes to very disgusting in parts. Sex with dead people! How much is it And what is this behind the message? We need water, we need watermelons, should we be dead to have sex? Sorry, but these sticks!
