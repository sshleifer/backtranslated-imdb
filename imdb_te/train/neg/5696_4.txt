I've finally kept my attention without scrambling the movie for anyone ... When you fix a fridge by getting a book from the library, you know how the movie ends when you go back to the library, a book on self defense and murderer. The film, myself, is worth nothing .... A murderer has really become a solution for mental illness or another symptom.
