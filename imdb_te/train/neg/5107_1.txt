The show has a UK edition which is less than the US version. The relative will get a new kitchen or perhaps the bedroom and the bathroom and will be awesome thanks for what they got. Everything that can not be reality TV is the US version of this program. Residents can rebuild the whole house instead of making some improvements to the home that they can not afford or do for themselves. I do not know if this program is trying to show what a lousy welfare system is in the US or if you receive enough hard prayer. Especially the disgraceful production placement by Sears will not be disrespectful. It is good to build a family for millions of people who are targeted, rather than spending hundreds of thousands of dollars for a society. Maybe the DII and Power Tools are a boutique to take on borrowing and building materials, so that everyone wants to do it. Giving one to all, causing enormous resentment in the same sunken houses in the rest of the local community.
