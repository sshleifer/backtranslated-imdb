I fail to see what's funny in this movie. This humor is meant for the dead. It's slow. The story is very simple to be true. The characters are not very sympathetic, as well as some important characters. There is nothing surprising. What are the authors of this script? "Oooo funny! Let 's make them make some old woman' s pot .... Let 's grab it! Let them make ... behave like little kids! Oooo, yes, that is definitely brilliant and original! <br /> <movie This film has made me very frustrated from all the movies I have seen in the last five years.
