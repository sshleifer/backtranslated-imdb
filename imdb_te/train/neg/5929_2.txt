I am at least hoping that Leonard will see some better of this as Leonard has embezzled away an organizer years ago and he is now over 70 - a real disappointment for people who are laughing at this film. But this film is just terrible. Initially Leonard himself was not about his past, and later the hour and half of the film emphasized Leonard's songs all the worst sentiments. It is very serious with its endless perspectives that are slowly wounded. Cohen's interview is all done in lo-fi video short clips and I want to see the medium or long shot of his whole body! I was not less concerned about performers, especially those overblown ego Boys Edge and Bono comments. One of the best songs for Leonard's own music is that there are no performers in this movie, and if you're looking at it, and have any doubts, try to target them. It's a time PBS Special, perhaps, to show a time. But I will hesitate at getting a DVD of this. Bono wasted a poem when Leonard performed a partial performance "Song Tower" at the end of the film. The occasional good performances (the first number of Anthony, Rufus, Martha's The Trouter) have been spoiled in the context of this tragic blog. Forget this, and you would like to buy Leonard's most recent album.
