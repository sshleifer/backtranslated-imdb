Notable Japanese director Takashi Mike does not seem to move in with this tarpid thriller, following a narrative of Yasushi Akimoto's book about a nasty old woman (and kid's abuser!) Who is part of a new urban history: your cell phone with grotesque tone rings - and you say 'one missed call' - You only hear your own final words before your death Tailor-made to replay the message. The most successful part of the film is a pivotal cinematic reality of reality TV cameras infected with future victims, but notoriously extensive deaths (the hidden part of the red candy!) Is frustrating and frustrating. Often the shots of the dead bodies are actually intelligently displayed, and the whole etiquette may be the cause of the film's end. Hollywood is predicted in a distant platform in 2008, and the U.S. The version is not improved. **** from stars
