In a description of a painful Milanese underclass, the film is probably apparent in its day. Nevertheless, I thought that neorealism was not actually a bag of director di sika, because here an old beloved decided to try and create a modern fable around a boy found in the cabbage patch. After spending most of her childhood in an orphanage, she lives entirely in a Shintown town in Milan. He carries out residents as community action, and puts their spirits on their face with a frustrating smile and testing them on their time tables. There are many important things to know about where his patriotic watches are coming from me, because this pot noodle is coming from. Anyway, de Sica then uses a subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly where these poor sods are. Furthermore this leads to capitalism, and to explain this, he brought the oil fountain to their land in trouble. Brilliant! Nevertheless, for his credit, this time he was taken seriously, and all investors seem to be tough satire, all fur coats and cigars. They seek the land, but our mathematician does not support such nonsense. Good luck through a bizarre stroke, cabbage patch days from his old, dead guardian sky and gives him a magic pigeon. He used to shower gifts on his colleagues, who proved humble as Cigar men. It seems to me that this film is missing. To solve the background of poverty, many filmmakers have not done it since then, have been caught up in the fairy tale, and I find a bit daft. How do the 'great' directors get away with the plots of children like us? Hans Christian Andersen probably argues that the poor folk of Milan are flying over Duo and come to the top of a broomstick. However, de Sica was declared a genius. The fact that these people are very weak, their faith is different, and those miracles never happen to them, and any story-hero is enough to work. <br /> <br />
