Charles Braunson continued the 80-year-old recession, even though the decade's worst film was not. In it he plays a detective who kidnaps an Asian girl and goes to great lengths to track a pimp currently selling her to the highest bidder. It's an insulting attempt at action and most probably the most depraved movie ever made. Most people think of Death Wish sequels for Bramson's worst films. Deathwish sequels are not great movies, but in most cases competitive and most viewable. Kinjite is a thinly thrill thriller separated by enthusiastic folk and child abuse. It is really a repetitive picture and the fact that it really tries to teach a "law and justice" mentality that most anything to really say is really worse. In fact, the film starts with sex early, and with Brunson suffocating, she raped her with pedophile. The Chicago Theater I saw the scariest feelings of this scene, only the pump's awkward motion for the girl raped in the film. This does not exclude extortion, and indeed the written film does not work enough to get to the level of exploitation, and it can provide something that can work. Bronson seems more things but apparently this is quite repugnant to save. I think Charles Branson is a very good actor but this effort is finally his worst. <br /> <br /> From 1/2 * 4 (horror)
