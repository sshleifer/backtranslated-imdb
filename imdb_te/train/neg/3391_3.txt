For whom, to whom is it a surprise for Richard Attenborough to make a decision to call a number of singular conversations to drive Broadway in many years? He is an Academy Award-winning director. Yes, he was dead for you Gandhi! Jeremy Irons is an Academy Award winner, do you want him to see Rocky Bulbia? He has experience with music. Really? Have you forgotten a "what a lovely battle"? In reply to your question, yes! The film is disappointing, clear and simplistic. Not an ounce of live energy, it's packed with a huge hand of operations. Each character has danced pretty dance, but their projection is theatrical. I did not think anything. But when I saw the stage I thought everything. The film should not be visible in the group with stars, unfamiliar, newcomer or non-starred, unforgettable faces. Great actors who dance beautifully. Well it was Michael Douglass. The truth is that I completely forget that you are wrong and you are absolutely right. A Richard Attenborough is not like Michael Douglas's music.
