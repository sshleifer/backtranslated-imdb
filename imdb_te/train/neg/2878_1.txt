Do not watch this movie. Bad acting and stupid gore effects. Full waste of time. I wanted to see cold murders and hot chicks, instead the director was looking at you and relied on videos that killed animals to kill animals. Disgusting. These killings are especially lazy. A woman fills worms in her mouth, puts a raw hamburger on her face and tears her. BTK = BTK broiler broiler, Burger Kings "Killer" New Sandwich .... ha ha. I do not think this film is based on realistic facts. I mean, he did not bring real BTK killer rats, scorpions and a group of mites ... and oh ... even a slaughtered cow's head. Go and find out.
