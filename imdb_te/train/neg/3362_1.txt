Huntington does not have another distinct horror remake, special effects, and any favorite redemption and cinematography on the screen, with no redemptions. Yes, reconstructions are not all bad but are directed by Jean Downton. I want to focus on the boring plot, ridiculous special effects, and terrifying attempts to frighten audiences with the A-list actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson), but we are concerned about these stories about stories and stories not tabloid No need to lie. The storyline is the classic novel The Hunting of Hill House and killing four chapters, it is boring for the film and it is unexplained too. You really do not care what the characters at all while the characters are pretty thin and good at acting. Lily Taylor gives her a horror performance and when she distanes her lines when she delivers her lines to her terrible screamer she sounds like it's 8 years old. Lily Taylor does not prepare for the horror genre at all. The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they are a group of a friendly ghosts of Casper and the ghost Hugh Cain appears as a fat man dressed as a fierce reaper for Halloween with a smoke machine. This creature has one of the rooms in a large purple mouth, and it is not accidentally fun just plain. The only good thing about this film beautifully and well designed is that it looks nice but it's not saved from it's cruel everything. Honestly I can say honestly I can not think as long as I waste my time watching Haanting on TV for any price. If I paid and paid it would be more Pi $ $ but luckily it's in the scream chanel. Overall, Haanting is a boring remake, which tries to kill you with an unpleasant attempt in the evil special effects, horror.
