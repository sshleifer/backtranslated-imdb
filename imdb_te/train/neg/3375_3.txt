Hi, everyone, if you see "singing in the rain", remember the scene of Jean Kelly Dancing in the rain. Remember the number of Donald O'Connor's dance number, "Make LaMF." If you look at the "Royal Wedding", Fred Aster Dance will be reminiscent of the roof. If you see "jailhouse rock", you also recall the title of the title that led the king. <br /> Not here. This show may contain some blockbuster dance numbers. Chick McGow's "I Can Do That" is near. Some talented people can not just make a great dance when moving on stage. Richard Attenborough is responsible for this failure. He pointed to the camera on stage and thought it was a good thing. <br /> <br /> In the audition of the public to participate in Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas is just as bad as he is in Western or comedy. When he's in a Michael Douglas film he's OK to see the word someone we'd like to yell at him. It does not work here. <br /> <br /> The cast is good except for Michael. <br /> <br /> After that, I hope they will call me first. <br /> <br /> <br /> Tom Willet
