"Sleeping with the Enemy" is predictable, the 'Thriller is before', which shows how much cast and crew is stirring without inspiration. <br /> <br /> A group of my friends did not believe I saw it at the movies some sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> Ronald's bass screenplay (based on Nancy Price's novel) does not help, or the average performance from Joseph Ruben's old direction or Julia Roberts. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast, including Patrick Berggin and Kevin Anderson, is relatively small to help. <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - The Hayes Film Center Melbourne
