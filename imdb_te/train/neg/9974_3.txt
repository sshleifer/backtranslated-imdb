I have attracted this network in the USA network a few times. That's just something, well, the perfect stupidity of this film makes when it wants to see it. Yes, you're right about the sub-par acting, the plot that's only about seven years old. But I will sympathize with some of the actors. Then again, some of these actors sign up for a more outrageous sequel.
