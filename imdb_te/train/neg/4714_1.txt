Unfortunately, I want to be very bad to give this part of the garage, occasionally, how rare this horrible cartoon is! The characters appear to be pulled by pre-schools, nothing, wait, I saw pre-schools much better! I do not like this terrible for the cartoon "Missed Offers of Flapjack"! I've probably said what others do, two words: rip off !! Recall the episode of Dexter's Lab, when they attacked the go-kart on the volcano? Yes, Mr. Fellows also sank upon that idea and failed! They also removed Shadow Lugia in an episode of Pokemon's funniest episode! (He also ruled out of the franchise!) This character is a cheap split from Mandak's Dexter Lab! Mr. Felos must claim suit for legal breach for this piece of garbage !! Everyone has their opinions, but in you you have a jockey (RIP-OFF) test, you are just lying to yourself. Help yourself, change the channel when you try to insult your screen!
