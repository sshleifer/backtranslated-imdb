This documentary film is based on the incomplete considerations of evidence, in which Brian Fleming, perhaps deliberately and incompatible with failing to mention important evidence. Perhaps this is his most crucial mistake. The key arguments about the inability of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ probably do not ignore such important facts: ** The existence of some of the doctrines of Paul's scriptures. The main arguments about Jesus in a few years of Christ's death and resurrection have already been made to the advertisements of faith. ** The testimony of the early Christians is not just split into fantasy. There were many who were Messiah in time, but only one of them remained: Jesus. Why? Anyone believing that Christ is the Messiah, and if anyone knew that he was not resurrected, it would have been unsatisfactory for anyone to die for those beliefs. * Even though the Gospels are more simplistic, we are still talking about Jesus, who is written in the lives of other eyewitnesses pointing to the faults of these gospels. There are evidences that the Gospels are very early. <br /> What I say is that Fleming's documentary is very different and self-serving work, which can cause different arguments and testimony to its anti-Christian perspective. Do not be fooled by a poor trial.
