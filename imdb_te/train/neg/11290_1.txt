The worst image from time to time. Even Yaphet Kotto could save this turkey. The film was originally intended to be named "The Treasure" but changed to "Sharks Treasure" to take advantage of the excitement created by "Jaws". I have sharks in a scene of this film. They were supposed to sell tickets because they were included in this "thriller". Did not work. Any time the "good" film takes place, the band's team has been introduced to each other with the unveiled beer brand. Do you think Jee, beer might be a sponsor? Can they show it more clearly? Only if someone is prepared by this thing, the beer should break. This is enough reason for celebration.
