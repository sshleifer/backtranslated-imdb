The film first starts with a camp, hiking alone in the vast wilderness with a man and a woman. It certainly panders him to hear the man man and he will investigate it. Our killer is strangled to the stomach. He chased the girl and hanged her voice. <br /> We see camera killer in the next scenes. <br /> Next we will meet our four main characters and two couples. Men's joke brought Token Blant's ambition to leave early in the week, as the woman could never do the same camping in the same day. Unexpectedly, the men are leaving the same day and their car breaks down ... the end of the evening. When men came, they warned people in the wild through a wild Ralph Doppagangar. They ignore the warning and venture to the night of the night and play with the lyrics of the eighty-year song murdered in the dark forest. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we realize that we are not the Burning Clone, a ghost story. Women are afraid, huddling together and alone by fire. Two children appear in shadows, and Tom decides to play secretly. Well they are clearly ghosts through the resonance of their voices! Their mother appears from the hole in the hole on her forehead and if she sees the children, the two ladies ask, of course, disappear. <br /> <br /> <br /> Let's talk about two beautiful women on the river bank running around the papa's house. This causes a lot of stir and he grabs his sword and rises upwards. "Daddy's going hunting," the little girl, cried with bad acting. <br /> <br /> Here is some of the forests revealed, token blond splits, carrying the knife to the night, carrying the knife. She faces the father who describes him hungry and it will be quick. We can not understand this because of the earliest heard panther (perhaps he is allergic! Panthers is honest in California?) Wounded slightly before she stroke her head. The thunderstorm erupts and men will be sheltered, which will change the place where the Papa lives. Apparently someone lives here because there is a fire and something unusual on it. Children will appear and then warn about the baby who shows them moments. <br /> <br /> However, our killer goes to women only. He had something to eat and he invited us to tell the story about his ex-wife. As his wife cheats, we give him a break. The old man kills her and later her lover, but does not know the daytime dreams about it. We did not cause a child's death. Men sleep and remain safe. The next morning, men will find the empty campus of their wives. After a brief discussion they broke up. The other is going to help, while being in campusite is one. His leg is going back to his car. We will reunite with the children because they explain to the living woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from their mother. <br /> The following scenes refuse the logic of the image. He is also dating or luxurious marriage. Consider some of the kids killed him and tell the woman about it. She decides to see herself and runs live in the killer. Fortunately, stop him from threatening the children to leave him forever. <br /> <br /> In total, the film deserves ten to four stars. For all its suspicions, musical score is well done. It is still very much viewable. There are some camera angles to look professional, and some sets are well held. The plot is unbelievable. There is one thing to disappoint the disbelief, but the toad is about 6 miles away; I can not imagine that the token bland takes as that in the middle of the night. <br /> <br /> Alan "Skip" Bannacheck
