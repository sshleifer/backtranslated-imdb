An interesting idea for an image, showing the last dragon on the ground and showing he and someone fighting together bad. When he was young, Anon was cut in the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the Dark Lord, who gave him half of his heart. Now Ainan (David Thewlis) has now become a selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen uses a new friend Draco Dragon (Sir Sean Connery) to get gifts for "killing" dragons. But since Ainone Draco has half a half, they both suffer pain or be killed. Glekenspur Gilbert, Jason Isaacs Lord Fulton, Julie Christie Queen Ellin and John Gillgood as King Arthur. It has been nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects. Worth looking!
