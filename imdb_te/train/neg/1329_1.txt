This movie is AWFUL. In a film that was unexpectedly funny for a long time, I did not quite laugh at myself. Leno should stand up and lace to the late night tv. The cars in the film are good, but the movie also saw the movie Den Dust. It was vibrant, acting was terrible, and the plot was written for 4 years. I'm not wrong, Joy Leno is happy, but not in this movie!
