Anti Trust was a great vehicle for league cook, but the director cut off her best scenes. In her scene, she is a zombie. She participates in a sub-platform that is simplistic to the sub-plot in "Get Cartier", but she maintains a good plot in "Get Cartier". (I blamed the director) The director's tribute to Hitchcak is brown. (It is the scene that Ryan Phillippe's characteristic is the scene he finds Titch Robin's journalist, at least I think it's a tribute to Hitchcock shows scenes that cut the DVD. I should believe his instincts with the director and do not listen to the test audience.
