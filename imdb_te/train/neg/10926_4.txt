While this idea is more realistic than most sci-fi movies, hanging is not normal. Practical mummy effects are not bad, and the "Gun Nut" character is a real draw only when Moorena Bacquean and Adam Baldwin combine into the small screen, promoting the top. I suspect everything was going on. They do better when they do what they do when using some Tomb Raider style shorts in Morena's character, but in the first 40 minutes I have to "see" the movements. I do not have a film with a high swing, but you can not refuse real beauty when you see !!! And Adam Baldwin will once again hit you as a person who wants to hate you. If you want to see a couple of your favorite flyer characters, there's a good time with some sub-component, then this might be for you. If you want a good acting and character development, then you should advise to look elsewhere.
