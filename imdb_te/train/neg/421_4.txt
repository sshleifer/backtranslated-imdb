My title above says it all. Let me know it clearly. If you see the BBC's "Planet Earth", I think many of you are sure, then you're very fond of this movie. And I own all discs of "Planet Earth". I saw the rating of this movie and read good reviews about it. <br /> I went to the theater. The film is a Disney film with production companies in the BBC and Discovery list. <br /> <br /> When they opened the first scenes about the polar bear, I found them from my DVDs in the home of "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> The film continued and I and my friends put it <br /> <br /> I thought the footage was 90% from "footage earth". I can not recognize some scenes because I say 90%. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film will actually have different footages from a diverse disc of "Planet Earth", children. Yes, that story is very much fun. Let me give you an example. "Polar children do not like human children, they do not always listen to their mothers" (I do not remember exact words, but how it is) so when they show the poultry children leaving the parent. This is shortened to "Planet Earth" for children!
