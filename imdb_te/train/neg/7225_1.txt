I sat through this film and only managed to keep it my attention. <br /> <br /> If you have to use CGI, this film can be quite feasible if I do not see the awesome CGI for future reference to this industry. It is considered a graphic novel for the screen but what I see is a bad image, it does not have any similarity to a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> All of the story, the story of CGI, I was very impressed with acting and casting a little bit confusing for me on the good and slightly more character information but I thought it would have been as nice as not just as surprised as I said it kept my attention, but all honestly I wish I had given this one a miss.
