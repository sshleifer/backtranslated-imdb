<br /> It's not good, it's not good. Visually, it's great. I enjoyed the movement, camera angles, etc. However, the letters? Iah, it's so much fun. Plot? <br /> <br /> The film looks worse than any other new age. Organized religion is shy and afraid. Science is not good. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but "souls" have the power to destroy demons and bring life? <br /> <br /> That bites me a bit too much. Here we are used to create a CGI motion picture ... science ... and the message that science can destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality can save us. At least they have a decency to ask one of the characters, <br /> "Okay, so what now?" (Or similar). I could not hear the audience as soon as the break up and the break for the departure. It's a "okay ... it's entertaining enough to sit here for the whole movie but let's get out as fast as possible!" Exit type. <br /> If you want to enjoy it, this is not one of those movies. Just look at the visuals and admit your head early. Any idea, "What's that point?" <br /> <br /> Okay, follow the spoilers. <br /> Mainly, a scientist "machine" is capable of creating other, clever, robotic life. Evil humans use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realized that he was also wrong. He gave his intellect to the machine, but did not give his heart. <br /> The machine skinnet goes on the collective donkey of humanity and erases all life on earth, ultimately slowly pushing. However, the scientist will make survival and walk sock-puppets. Everyone who has a piece of the soul of the scientist. <br /> Finally, # 9 wakes up without knowing the world. He looks at a nearby device and chooses it. He meets another person like himself, # 2 <br /> <br /> # 2 is compiled by the last surviving robot of the machine. # 9 Finds Himself Like # 2 <br /> <br /> # 9 Notices that they have a hole enough to succeed. He will insert and return the machine life ... in process # 2 pulling out of the soul. <br /> <br /> The film continues to take action scenes with # 9 attempt to save his soul-yanked compatriots. <br /> They eventually succeed and destroy the machine. They released into the clouds and released the souls of their fallen friends. <br /> After that rains and we look back at life back to the planet. <br /> Huh? <br /> It makes no sense. None. Why the heck scientist wanted his spirit to be broken 9 amounts? What has it done? Was they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine is dead! <br /> <br /> Why did he expect nine small pieces to succeed in the absence of anything else? <br /> <br /> Why does not it create a second intellectual engine, but the first one seems to be possible when it comes to victory with a "soul" to fight. Have their souls sucked into the device through the machine and then released the spirits in order to destroy the machine and return the life back to Earth? Did you take back your life without pulling back the machine and pulling back the rest of them?
