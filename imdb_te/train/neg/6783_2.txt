It is surprising that 8-10 star reviews from people who wrote before or earlier in the IMDb review. <br /> <br /> I think you can make your own decisions, given the lowest rating given by other people. <br /> This is a very bad movie. I have to admit it, I thought the feeling was beautiful, and I saw actresses acting Angel and Harmony in Angel's work, but it was not long for the film's pure fear. <br /> Acting: Leeds seemed to be adequate, but not everyone? <br /> Plot: Full Chok with big holes to drive a truck. <br /> Direction: Does not exist. <br /> <br /> Humor: Are you sure people are going to smile? Oh boy. <br /> I'm Candy: Okay. There are some really beautiful women in the film. Only three major female characters, but not exactly across the board. The producers do not notice how awful it is if the producers feel the viewers of the audience when looking at the scene. If so, they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful but darkly funny camp classic in the right hands. It is not even close.
