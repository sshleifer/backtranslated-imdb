It is unfair to explain this movie even worse. At least there is an absorption hobby rooting through the trash. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon can offer a brilliant opportunity, so he must resolve the IRS bill when he agrees with this terrible screenplay. <br /> <br /> The mad scientist's story of "Hollow Man" is said before, as is well-known and not too ludicrously expensive for special effects. Men, women and dogs Transparent Body Building toys you can buy early seventies. <br /> <br /> In the UK they are marketed as 'The Transparent Man (/ Woman / Dog)', which is named after the film. <br /> <br /> The clever special effects, the Dire script, the untapped plot. <br /> <br />
