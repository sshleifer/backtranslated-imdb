<br /> <br /> Phil the Alien is one of the funniest films, based on the strange movements of everything except the original punchlines. <br /> <br /> At first it was very odd and pretty funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a low budget film (which is not always a problem), some pretty interesting characters, but in the end I've lost interest. <br /> Suppose this film will appeal to a stoner present participant. <br /> <br /> "Brother from another planet" for similar but good try
