If you read Syfy's "Dinosaurs" review, I appreciate the low-budget school created by these television films. They are stupid ... they're crazy ... but they're still very fun "very bad, good" way of the way. Hence, the hockey "Dinosaurs" risked (and for recommending) the risk of guilty, and I'm frightening people on an island with a Syfiary Original Movie about "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy", half-man, half-hammerhead monster. With the accurate shooting recipe of Syfy Channel to create a cast featuring the B-movie creature and the William Forsyth and Hunter tie, how could it be wrong? Well, that's my surprise, it really misses the mark ... not too much, but it's enough to make me not recommend it. Why? Well, the first, its nominal monster, the terrible Hammerhead-Human Hybrid, actually takes back the Fox-Military thugs, the primary villain of the film, as a group. When calculating Hummerhead's body, he (or whatever you call it) comes before the munch is made and goes straight after that. The rest of the film, put our heroes against the above soldiers. That, for me, watching a walking hammerhead people to eat is not just compelling! <br /> <br /> Please read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
