This film is an idiot attempt at a kind of action thriller. A tour bus to Las Vegas will attack the white garbage hijackers driving the Doon Buues Driving. They go into the desert and steal their valuables. The plot is constantly changing. One minute they want to kidnap a great Ranchi's daughter, who are then looking for $ 90,000 worth of stamp collecting. This conversation is terrible. <br /> Please do not watch this movie.
