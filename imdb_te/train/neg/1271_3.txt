This film may last for 15 minutes, it's not for all the dilemma of the son and father. Very speculative. Male "stars" need good slap in the face in both! Do you like a cheesecake? "Whine?" Two chuckles ... and a headache. I can understand why the mother left his hubby after 47 years ... I do not know how long that is! The first 5 minutes looked at me and I paid $ 3.99. This film is not well lit and is painful. I'm looking at my watch and hoping the time will fly faster ... it's not. This script is very repetitive, easy to fill the author's space. In the positive note ... The scenery is beautiful, falling in my favorite season. The car, the 40 Ford is also great. The film reaches a D-rating F
