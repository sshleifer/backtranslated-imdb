"Dahmer" is a very interesting movie although I do not describe "horror" or "thriller". <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner portrayed serial killer Jeffrey Dhammer, who killed, murdered, and killed his male victims. The film is centered on Dummer and "Rodney", which was played well by Ortel Kaure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Dahmer's constructive years have little to play, because we have created a human monster on screen and did not provide any insight into Dahmer's belief that he could create sexual victims of his victims. <br /> <br /> The characters are played but the story is narrow.
