Looking at Merle Brando on the screen is a master carpenter looking at the trees. Brando's performance is the only film to watch. This place is in and ridiculous (not comic). Other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to portray some of the features of humanity ... These characters contain humanity of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this film is mediocre or just plain terrible. The director throws the freeze-frame and slow-motion shots in relation to eradication. Random music will destroy any hint of cartoon and dramatic effect. That's not something I really see in an image, but also the wardrobe way. The respectable brando was unable to look away from the terrifying bag that he heard of this movie called "David Lynch-Esquire" and "Unreasonably Funny" ... it's not for anyone. David Lynch films are born out of bad creativity - the film is not creatively. And do not worry with the stupidity.
