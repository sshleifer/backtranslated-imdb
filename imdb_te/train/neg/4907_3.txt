<br /> I read the book I was reading "1st to die" and wanted to see if I followed this book. For the most part it did. <br /> <br /> Some minor differences (such as the location of the last violent scene), but not many, and much of this movie book. <br /> It may be wrong - the film is full of sharp and balanced casting-I'm not impressed with the book. Or let me take it back. I began to feel very impressed, gradually becoming more illusions and eventually felt totally unsatisfactory and nearly gypped. There is no difference with the image. <br /> There is no payment in the book or movie. <br /> <br /> "They both did nothing," but not interesting, fascinating and more confusing, annoying and frustrating. She will die (she cries out in her grave after her illness) .. And then when she suffers suicide she will cut there ... Then suddenly she was arrested after her real life with the real villain But he and his wife have gone together .... Hello! This whole thing now becomes a "General Hospital" instead of a good old fashion thriller I cheated by the book and saw the movie (which attracted my attention - a TV The film is good for acting) I hope it does not follow the book wounding. /> <br /> I still watch the movie  ిస్తున్నాను మరియు కొన్ని కారణాల వలన పుస్తకం మీ నోటిలో రుచిగా చెడ్డదిగా ఉండదు (లేదా నేను ఏమి జరిగిందో నాకు తెలుసు అని మాత్రమే) కానీ నేను ఈ విధంగా చెప్పాలి కథ అస్పష్టంగా ఉంది అన్ని బాగా చేయలేదు.
