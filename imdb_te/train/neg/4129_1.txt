After watching this half I refused and I was ready to stop it, but I finally endured it. It tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. <br /> <br /> In the 80s, T & A was more poor than acting in movies - <br /> <br /> There were many attempts at humor, which failed miserably and the film was 100% predictable. If you're a teenager, the film will have some attractions, but you will know how the movie will change after the first 10 minutes after many movies. <br /> You will end up with the rest of your time.
