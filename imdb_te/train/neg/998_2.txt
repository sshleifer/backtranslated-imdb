This is very bad when the general picture summary is more information than the picture. The paragraph-long "plot summary" written on the image page contains details, and I could not get up from watching the original film. I do not know what is (bleap) going to happen, even if I do not know anything about it. Oops, there is no benefit - this film leaves tremendous pieces of the story, if you call a story. They seem to have some kind of film here, just like the story and thinking that it is necessary to give up our imagination to relax. Newsflash for Creators: I saw a movie I see you. I sit home and imagine plot and plot for free. And Rosario Dawson never gave me enough attention to be able to name it face, and why would I see it? In any film, one of the most artifacts I played in A or B. is one of her. I painted OK, probably did not really want the role, did she get the most offer for the movie? Wrong. She is listed as one of the producers. If you produce something, do not pretend yourself if you do not work. If you are really, create a good character for which you become. Also, here someone mentioned white / latino problem - yes, I hate to say, but this movie will come across action revenge against men of white college who wear baseball caps. What is happening when there is nothing in the movie when you get to the Latino characters. Adrian's story seems like a self-confidence jerk better than the villain's story. For Maya's role, she did not look like a real person. Whatever I did for Hollywood, I was ashamed of the film.
