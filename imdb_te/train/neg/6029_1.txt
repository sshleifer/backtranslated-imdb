<br /> <br /> If there are many conspiracy theories and suspicious thoughts about the United Nations, Israel and international affairs, no matter where they come from. <br /> <br /> It is not a supernatural Hollywood film based on a Bible passage. Instead, the film was made by a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with political and religious agenda. As a feature film, the final result is the clips of the Televangelism program (full of family prayers and the windows of light can be broken through the church windows). <br /> <br /> For major viewers, it is hard to believe, but many people have presented this subject literally in the film. And, perhaps, makes the film important. You probably will not find a more concise explanation for a considerable number of peer views of your fellow citizens. So, if you view it, view it as a social / cultural document. If you are aware of all the media, you do not have to be warned about promoting and manipulating the movie.
