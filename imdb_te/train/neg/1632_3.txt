A clear Vanity project for Kareen Mani (who ??), Hatty Charles Braunson is to wipe his parents, or grandparents or some innocent, and "scum" to attract young hunters with her karate skills. In a crucial scene she intervenes to stop a rape and throws her in a moron cop, so after a couple cool shower scenes and some abortion jail-dyke seduction she has to take legislation into blah blah blah in her hands. Can I guess there are so many movies like this? You believe that the script is more than just a dumbbell. Mani appeared to be the kind of type of showbiz that produces her own Death Wish, and I'm occasionally appealing to that kind, but the film is an annoying tool. The actors are competing to be actively suppressed by a judge who acts as a uncle of the DA and producer who hates good performances.
