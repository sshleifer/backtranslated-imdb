Nothing to say but Wow! Has anyone actually inserted someone in the open field? Well this is done 25 times in the film (obviously the directors' favorite frightening strategy). The soft spoken speakers / hot shots in one of the opening sequences revolve in the back seat, so the camera man would sit in front of the movie. A few days after he came into the field, five contestants appear and it is clear at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, but everyone believes that the sun can set the minute. After a 30-minute Boolean trash, we have a glimpse of the past of the climax that we see some of his previous victims. If you see this movie, check the ladies chest .. her ribs go to her neck, it's frustrating. Most horror motion pictures take place during the night but a night vision is forced to happen during the day of confusion without camera. Several night shots appeared in the film, such as the Blair Witch Project or random shots from Director's Perard. <br /> <br /> The film ended with normal redemption. And we were thirsty and frustrated with magic. <br /> <br /> You certainly laugh at this movie in an open field. <br /> Sign in and answer
