Do not waste your time or your money in this movie. I thought it was another movie (a film about some passengers trapped in a cave) because she was renting my roommate. So, we decided it was not anyway thinking it was bad. It. I can not believe that this film has really been produced and I have made it to people. But you can not make yourself as it is an accident scene where you're almost going to be away. Feel honestly and emotionally spots. A college girl in which she went from a semi-low budget movie she will attack a boy dating romantic movie all out. Not really good. I tried to offend the woman's rape. Almost. All in all, an awful movie that is certainly rated NC-17 for a reason. Do not waste your money. And do not let your children see.
