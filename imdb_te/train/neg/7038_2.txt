Yes In the 1980s, Rigonomics and Sly, Chuck and other action stars hid commies hidden in the remote forest. At that time, I believe how to earn movies like RAMBO, movie office and UNCOMMON VALOR (and who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN?), When they made money at the box office, and they were very badly dating. Tromas War There is a tongue in cheeks on these types of movies but should you ask if you want spoofing in the first place? Not at all. TROMA`S WAR is not sophisticated - though it makes the point that there is no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wings - and sometimes it feels the grade z movie than sending up. Maybe it is?
