His first screenplay is based on his own short story "Turn About", and William Faulkner gives a peculiar story of credibility, sacrifice and really strange relationships. The story was originally only about Tone, Young, and Cooper, but MGM Zone Crawford was required to fulfill his contract in another film and Faulkner was responsible for creating a female role. Croftford insisted that Croftford wrote in his style of co-stars 'Young and Tone' in a style similar to that of a Monte Python sketch (in the Semaphore, which resulted in some random pleasure as these three dialogues in short, such as the soundtrack, such as the sounds of "thundering heights"). Ernest Hemingway read almost as Henry James. <br /> <br /> The film also reflects some of the familiar Faulkner themes, which have an almost unrealistic relationship between brother and sister, his "sanctuary," and elsewhere). In the presence of Tom, when Young suggests to Crawford, instead of a slummer ring, three of their childbearing rings are replaced with one another. The tone and louis of the Tony and Young are particularly noticeable. <br /> <br /> This new Yorker is not creepy, but the huge cockroach Crowford is holding cheerfully, Wellington's repetitive background (and gamboling in her hands - I turn away!) and Young turns into a warrior. <br /> There are some good performances. Young is particularly engaged in a scene taken in Cooper's fighter plane, and is delighted as Rossco Cornes Cooper's flying friend. Tone is a good moment to round up his own tearful tears on the fate of his friend Young, despite the inability to express himself through the original dialogue. Croftford has removed meaningful dialogue, often seen as wood or dramatic, which is a more balanced action for a character. <br /> Battle scenes - Howard Hawks movie - The most exciting part of the whole movie. But not enough. I am very worried, it's 75 minutes in my life.
