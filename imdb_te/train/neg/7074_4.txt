This picture of my God is very boring. I was a big fan of Gina Gershon, a romantic drama and some great performances from Gershon when I rented the film. Gershon is as good as ever, but she is not the right actress for this role, she is very good for Rada SergeDezza. The love between Gershon and Serpediazza characters is unbelievable. And I completely disagree with the character of Sergeadziza (winner of the organizer), and in the film he is not pleasant. How Doctor Lauren Graham (Gershon) is beyond my comprehension. Perhaps Sean Connery, Robert Denario or Harrison Ford would have done better on this role, but I'm not expecting Europe-Ish. In any way, I danced in the movie. If you are looking for a good Gina Gherhon film, check out his best picture so far. If you are looking for a romantic movie about a young woman and an old man, try some Harrison Ford or Sean Canary movies. Gina Gershon is much less esteemed, and she deserves better than her, and I want to make a good choice in the future.
