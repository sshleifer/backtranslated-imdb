I have read a few comments on the Internet about this film ... "Hostel Hostel ...", "The camera is never open at all the cruel occasions ...". But none of them is true. The camera is not always open because there is nothing in the screen. The same scene repeats a hundred hundred times again. In the women's table, the killer rape women sometimes, and the killer cuts women into pieces (which you can never see in the whole picture). The police arrested him. Killer jury fools. Film Over. In Germany we say: "Veil Lorm um Nichits". All in all, one of the most boring films I ever see. Absolutely non-certified.
