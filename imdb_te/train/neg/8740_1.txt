My friends and I had rented the movie last night and we were a great laugh for some time. The film does not have to be funny at all, but it's just ridiculous and it does not have any realism. First, Phillippe (I call his character I do not really care) uses his regular employee ID to go through all the common security terminals. That's a reminder, but his enormous efforts to discover the terrifying Lego-Room that hosts super computers. This is plain funny. The tension we have to experience is that the room where the boy's mind is completely hidden. The end, like all the time, is pretty much cheesy, especially when the bad guy's lawyer shows up 'the right time'. Anyway, this film is a good laugh. If you'd like something to joke, be sure to watch it.
