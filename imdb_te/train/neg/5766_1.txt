It is considered as the main source of the open source community, with the open source tools being stuck in the marketing trap with our choices, standing up and shouting at the media in the world. After the basic version download (in the dial-up modem where the hard fan dies) my final snag was finally hit here. Media Player, Mplayer Classic & Winamp failed to open in my xp box, and then Totem, xine & kaffeine failed to open my Susse server. Mplayer was able to run it flawlessly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> <p> Beautiful soundtrack, excellent lighting, master camera work and flawless fabric. Everything is true. Then the two main characters were moved ... and talked ... and the film was dead for me. Lip synchronization and realistic animation of both main characters (except the prog in the dance scene) are everything fluid and completely alive. <br /> <br /> I am surprised if there are any games on the market with cut-scenes that are less realistic than these two films. Excellent .. as a frame, and if the actors are moving the subject is great. I'm so glad I did not really recommend this to anyone. <br /> Oh, and the final fantasy has a more follow-up and fraudulent plan. <br /> <br /> Get this movie 10 stars. Tragedy sitting there on the screen.
