Occasionally a new entry from a foreign film is offered. Their great attraction. They take from life and serve the knot. American films rarely dare to touch things that are forbidden by society. Many hang ups and the unhealthy fear of financial failure. The Almighty Dollar determines their options. Something that invites European directors. Moreover, viewers around the world are hungry for "different" films, especially a humorous bite from the wretch of the human race and the body of suffering. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences have beauty, poetry, and natural scent. That means "the left hand side of the Father" provides an interested audience. A family that is confident that the unity of the family originated from the unity of the obedience of tradition. However, when the patriarch's family forgets its members, when the flesh and blood are filled with humans, tension, unbridled dreams and dark intentions, the two move moves. Andr√©'s son Celestine Mall, who wants to control his father's totalitarian philosophy of his inner desires. Raul Cortez plays his father role. A young woman named Simon Spolodor tries to break through the banned stool from family waters. Leonardo Madieros Pedro, elder brother. The picture offers a lot, but it takes time to say a very absurd time. ***
