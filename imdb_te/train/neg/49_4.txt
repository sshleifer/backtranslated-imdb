A very cheesy and dull road film with hip and modern intent is shown in the style of editing and some strange camera angle, only as a result of sleep. <br /> <br /> The cast is ruined, the writing is stupid and majestic. The only thing worthwhile is the soundtrack of Top Stripe Lalo Schifrin, really cool and opening scene, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> If you like, bad opinions and comments about this film are completely eligible; It's really pure garbage. It has its charm, watching a movie, if everyone leaves the beer glass, if it is in sleep, it can not do anything else.
