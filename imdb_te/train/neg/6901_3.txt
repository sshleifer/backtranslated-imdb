The most positive thing I have to say for this sluggish local "comedy" product is that it is useless. In fact, it was astonishingly dramatic, and it was a surprise to the extent to which a person was removed by a dozen of the elected committee members. It's not witty, it's not entertaining, it's not clever, and it's not beautiful. <br /> <br /> You need to change their ways to make their best friends come to the wedding and change their attitude towards them. The local amateur dramatics society is tired of 'Allo' Allo's latest forty years with a plot line tired, and joking like watching funny movies, Sione's wedding is no more than ten (yes) nominations in the NZ movie <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Some people have seen the concept and have not succeeded.
