There are tons of good-looking women in the film. But alas, this movie is naked. <br /> <br /> <br /> A story in this film takes place in 1971. Why are Kio Sporties leading to the main characters? Hello? <br /> As you know, the film was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it's the most hideous effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure if someone breaks this work, but 3D is missing, just double vision is unclear. I do not have the same problem with this company's other 3D movies, Hunting Season and Cap Bled. <br /> <br /> In this case, 3D was also very absorbed, but with them I could see a comparison of 3D effect. <br /> This thing is not a big ball. Dame girl Dame, the daughter of Yum! I want to see her more. Movies, as well. At a young age, it looks like Janet Margolin. <br /> <br />
