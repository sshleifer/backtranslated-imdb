<br /> <br /> The direction, writing, lack of plots, constant mugging (with the help of stable straight camera strokes), and a .050 jock batting average, which is still completely waste of time. <br /> <br /> This idea is guaranteed, but lack of humor and you lose some of the worst direction you have seen on this part of this tube. <br /> <br /> The Mexican film is very negative. If it's no doubt, I do not really think this movie is intended to be racist. I feel like a "creative" team trying to find something funny in this "mess". <br /> <br /> You can listen as you knock the camera: "Hey look, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, love for all things, in the daytime!" <br /> <br /> Accused next to racism. When you come down to it, it's time to see this heap of leftover refilled beans that are supposed to undermine good money and money, IMO.
