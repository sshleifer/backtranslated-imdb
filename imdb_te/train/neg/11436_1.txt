I had to go out for fifteen minutes in the film from the end ... in a phased phase and into pure boredom. I am really scared of myself, I am really disturbed by myself, indicating that this goal is people 'happy' or 'must see'. <br /> <br /> The truth is that it is written by the plants of the industry. <br /> <br /> The truth is that this thick film does nothing to make it entertaining or light. It is absolutely unfunny, poorly written and power of all pace and cool, canned rice pudding. To be kind to Ms Kramer, it's a missed opportunity to say, for reading the compilation before I saw it, I thought it was something more challenging. The closest brother and sister co-dependence, the unexpected awakening of the sister's sexuality, have all the obvious things to refresh for such a sibling competition (for the same girl's love) comedy abilities, a reflection of the fun, and <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The absence of direct control is unbelievable; On the one hand, Moyanahan, Cavanagh and Spacc√© provide many pedestrian appearances, while at the same time Heather Graham and Molly Shannon - specifically - have been overwhelmingly damaging to damaging damages. The director can blame the case - perhaps Sue Kramer thinks that if her actors are over-acted, they will force a big smile from the audience. But again, cast is a popular one; <br /> <br /> Sue Kramer really wants to make any kind of movies and think carefully about anyone. Gray Matters cites possible issues, and in the comedy context she did not allow her to be able to analyze them or herself, perhaps considering writing her plays. Though it is not easy to make movies about women and women's issues, especially if they are expected to reach a wider audience than women, Gray does not have any irresponsible, gray and incomparable characters.
