Simply, I found all the repetitious, pretentious and biggest sin, and, of course, the TV show "Mash" the banal, preachy, oh ever "politically correct"? It (too) is dull. Alan Alda has the main character, "(star)", he is in love with himself and his intellect, which is really a try through the episode and sits me uncomfortable. The original series consisted of both McLean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers, and I'm happy to have a unique style and style for their character performances. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan, and Mike Farrell, both together with singular and concubically, are eating caviar and fresh sisters with the Wonder Bread. Loretta Switch, even if I had no dishonesty, was not surprising, and Gary Bergoff, who was fine in the film, was impressed with the look of her face. It showed me a presentation for a year. Jamie Farr was just a little brow "comedy" and did not really mention all of them here. Anyone who reads it now is surprised that because I do not give it a rating, no rating is a subjective call, not relative. Except for a slight exception, television, such a crude. Relatively speaking, Mash has some product quality in that era and current day (through television standards), so it is suitable for both. Rob Ritter
