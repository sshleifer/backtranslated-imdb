Unfortunately, it was shown in the Star Weeks in Thailand last week. This is the worst performance. As another member points out, this film is a good example of how not to work. I have not seen the film that has been a long time. Actors (you call them 'actors') are completely flat and deliver their paths with the passion of the dead dog. <br /> <br /> If you really want to understand how bad it is to act, you will have to watch the movie ... but it will be harmful to violence. <br /> <br /> I will act as a prominent woman. , And their voices (duplicate or contrived) are equal to the other cast equal to mischief. Another actress is beautiful with a fake British voice, yes, but the good Lord her voice is terrible. Stay tuned with her and you have a disaster. She just did not say anything and I accepted it as a pretty girl. Oh my, we are just the lady's lover of "really me?" After a crying scene forced from her, it's ridiculous, not really, I laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> Sets and art directors offer some saving to the film. The sets are colorful and some scenes are very good (actors minus). <br /> <br /> What is an old magical drink lady? What else? <br /> <br /> I understand that the film is considered a big budget in Thailand, and if I'm the producer of this film I will be deeply disturbed. <br /> <br /> I'm 10 to 1 , But the costumes and sets can be saved from such a film - a rating from 10 to 2.
