I look forward to the B-Movie French musical. After all, Daryy, Blanche, Defunes at that time low budget super stars for French films. And it's in color! But I have a mantra in this unbelievable hour with 30 pure mediocrity. Musical numbers are awful, humor is totally boring and stupid. And songs? What songs? This is the array of bad numbers one after the other. The rare thing about that is the nakedness of women. It was not known at that time. In fact, some of us women are not showing us. It adds mediocrity! And in his first film, a bit as a musician, try to find the French film's greatest actor, Michael Serrault. Good luck!
