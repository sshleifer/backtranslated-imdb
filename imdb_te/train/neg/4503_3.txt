I admire Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Geisha's memories are yet another failure for a mix of Western and Asian arts. Overall, the scene is beautiful, but the exotic-based scenes are bored with some after they are out of sight. High cherry blossoms, frankly, overdone. It's probably not the kind of ultimate beauty showy, perhaps the most beautiful Geisha film is not over the western pumpkin: it's probably the cultural difference here. <br /> <br /> Some other comments have correctly mentioned the biggest errors. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt that the actress was great. An actor / actress can play a role in what role he plays. Gong Li is great, but the emotion of power shown in the film is not translated into Japanese style. I saw a sweet bitter and jealous Chinese Woman. Michael Eo, one of my favorite actresses, did not even look like a Japanese. Some commentaries have commented on the remarkable delicate and feminine features of Japanese women, and I do not agree more. All of these are sensitive, I think all modern Japanese actresses are not eligible for Geisha, two Chinese and a Malaysian actress, grew up in different cultures and Japanese culture is probably unknown. <br /> Geisha is a good shot of the curiosity of the American audience. If the film is the best, Best Director or Best Actor Oscar win, it is also an insult to the film and the art.
