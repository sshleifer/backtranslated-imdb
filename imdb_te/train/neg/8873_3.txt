Do you know what someone else is doing here? Now a former Coffee Officer will have a family comedy right when a cadet school is joined by children. Wrong. This is a gross comedy intended for young people in very nasty taste moments. It may be quite a dumb track at this time, but Damon Wean's voice is frustrating beyond belief. Did he speak like that in real life? If he did, he had my sympathy but could not get my money without watching his films
