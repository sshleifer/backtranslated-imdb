This image. . . I do not know. I do not know why they will play an unrequited role as PP Longstocking and cast a singular Tammy Erin. Why they spent money in the direction of the art and some not all bad special effects, do not bother to correct it correctly, I never know. Why sets and clothes are sometimes sometimes not awkward, why they handed these bad songs, why not make any sense of the script (even on a silly, child image level). . . . What are they thinking? There should be nothing about this film. Every single piece (and not always correct) may sound a little different, each editing is in the wrong place, and each performance is somewhat bad. It can handle all of the difficulties, but create an appropriate atmosphere, but it captures the magic that is the creation of Astrid Lindgren.
