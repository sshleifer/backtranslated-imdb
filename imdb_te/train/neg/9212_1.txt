The only value in this film is to really laugh at how bad it is. Your average middle school writer is a plot to look good, and acting is good, which will get my bottom score. Tom Hanks is one of the very early movies and he does not have the pleasure to be naturally picky. The best special effect of the film is that it involves a man dressed in a fake rubber monster eating.
