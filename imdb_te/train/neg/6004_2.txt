The best thing about camp films is that you know what you expect. It's like looking at a professional wrestling match or a one-day time soap opera or a Jerry Springer show: you can immediately follow the skimpy plot, identify cardboard letters, and look in satisfaction while all the clich√©s are fulfilled in the trend. However, sometimes, the director does something unexpected. This may be an exceptional stupid, or something unnatural or anything intelligent. Director Makinen is with the best camp directors, and this is his best film. <br /> <br /> In yawn saltage, everything seems to come together. Nothing is good about it, but still a coherent whole. Anytime the movie does not slow down - actions will flow and punches. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that there is no time: some roles spend only one hour in a bar while doing something for a few months. <br /> <br /> The summer is partial in summer because you can not always set sun in summer, so you do not have to turn around in the afternoon to midnight. <br /> Finally: There is a plot there somewhere. Even though you have to watch the movie three times.
