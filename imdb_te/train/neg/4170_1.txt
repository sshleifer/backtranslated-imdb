It's unclear. If somewhere there is a story here, it's indiscernible that it is buried under the deeply buried characters and jarring camera work. There is a group of vampire hunters circulating around their work and the vampire who killed them are small aliens. They repulsed their heads and spoke like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine the blood and gore covering extraterrestrials that you can thoroughly throw in the heart of a cowboy dude, here you are. These are loud, obnoxious, violent, and very painful. There are then some anti-human beings that are impossible since they are very impossible to stand in CGI space. Hillary Clinton is seen as a moderate terrorist compared to these. They are some vampires or friends with someone ... <br /> <br /> Then camera work. Everyone hated a thousand cuts-one-minute garbage from the recent Rolleball remake? The people who made the film have loved them. <br /> <br /> There are enough three videos on MTV to play snippet videos. This issue smells. In comparison, Dracula 3000 is a master.
