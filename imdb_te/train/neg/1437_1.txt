I recall some characters from Patrick Swayze and other actors (Roy Marsden, for example) but they were all disappointed because of a very weak script. "Kind of Solomon's Mines" ... The very small part of the film inside the "mines" is about amazing as looking at the paint powder and I'm also spell-bound by spell-bound by watching a pre-school kid fight. "The whole film is produced by cheap American TV I remember the series.
