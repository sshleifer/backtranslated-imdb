Kerry is a remarkable prestigious science fiction from Canon, for whom it is clearly the work of love. Unfortunately this is not good. It all starts well - with a fun but engaging score, a combination of Lucas and Hitchcock's style editing and Spielberg's glossy cinematography. The film also refers to different pulp science fiction novels, serials and movies such as The Earth Stood Still, Superman, Metropolis, APS, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me. However, the film explains that it is not good for anyone for many reasons: this is the main worker in love, so throwing everything on the screen and creating a brave new world, Coron is actually a movie. There are no tensions, atmosphere or magic on offer, despite the set-pieces of aerial battles, dinosaurs, and race-against. Noir items are also flat. This is an extensive way of looking at things - nothing actually fails and obviously is a duplicate because those elements are basically failing - green-screen is just half the time in a video game and the actors are later pinned. Many of the actors can not make - Jude Law is wood, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasting - and all because of an awful script - that's sort of like to describe everything. It's a good feeling and some memory experience but ultimately it's not a sense in the world today. But Nice ended.
