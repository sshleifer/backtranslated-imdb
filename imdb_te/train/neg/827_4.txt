Blazing Saddles! It is a fight between two separated brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arlis Howard), both of whom may be mentally ignited by fire; Dippy was caught in the middle of the Debra winger, as they fell into squares on childhood differences. The film is very soft, with the film's fifteen million grants, as director Glenn Gordon Karen (TV Wuzz-Kid behind "Moonlighting") is screening in a screenplay of Vince Gilligan. It has the prickly power of a big business feature, but the bizarre style that does nothing from the characters, except for their weird eccentricity. These characters are not even, they are plot functions. The film is much less released to the theaters, though it is a disaster, though it is an example of style on style material, which looks good. The winger is only in a cast that is really confused. **** from * 1/2
