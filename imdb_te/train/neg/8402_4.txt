Three Stooges in Western Comedy - Music Probably "Rockins in Rockins" is intended to combine the Stooges comedy documentary with Western music in a mensini; If so, it's a fun way to break up on Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (like Rusty) is a beautiful young hero; And, Mary Beth Hughes (Blonde June) and Gladys Blake (like a black hair) are pretty women. The hoosier hotshts are a harmonious group; Their songs are very sweet; However, this is not more than the 1940s and 1950s, so the film is not exactly "rock". There are some smashes; But Stuges' branded comedy is much smaller than usual. The horse is not even used to speak. <br /> <br /> Rockin 'in Rockins' (4/17/45) Vernon Keys ~ Mo Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
