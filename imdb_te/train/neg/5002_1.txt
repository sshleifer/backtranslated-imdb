How did this cast of such a terrible script have caught? Ridiculas, speculative and totally unbelievable, this is well acted and slickly directed, but the material is still so bad that I deserve to be one of the worst thrillers of all time I've seen over the years. Amazingly bad, and a fun way. If you're a fan of someone in the cast, avoid all costs.
