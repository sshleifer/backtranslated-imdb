This girl is there and she runs in the woods but she ends up at this woman's clinic and she wants to miscarry. Her Daddy is out in a van and is all angry about that. This episode takes place at this abortion clinic and outside. I was not really a positive choice but I wanted to choose to kill this episode. I was laughing when the baby came out and went into the corner. The part they're ultra sound is pretty funny. Really sorry to the poor father in this episode. He just wanted to save his daughter and I can not really blame him for what I did. I do not know what happened to him in the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. I'm very laughing and I'm suggesting to see "pick me up" instead of this episode. It's not the worst part but it's not great.
