After reading the last comments, I am happy that I have not been the only 20-minute confused person. John Caradine walked twice into the tomb and showed him the lid closed after him. I look forward to some kind of explanation for this peculiar behavior ... Naturally, I thought he had done bad things at home, but the first growing corpse (no longer a zombie # 1) did not fully understand these scenes. Please, if anybody in there knows why Kareid's get to the tombs, let us know the rest of it !! <br /> All actions are limited to the last 20 minutes, so I am trying to capture it. John Carradine comes out of the cemetery to investigate, and playing through Zombie # 1. So far everything is fine. But we find Caradine's dead body, to get the confusing scenery where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler get out for filming in the little moonlight in the cemetery. The striker repeatedly seeks Ireland out of the tomb from # 1, but instead of moving Ireland into the open tomb and Priesto! Striker comes like Zombie # 2! Yeah, I can not predict why the Strickler was dead all the dead (a witch?), But why the zombie # 1 changed from the general look into the meat version by flying into the grave. (I think the zombies are slowly moving slowly, but I'd love to stay in the "normal" form until my business ends). This scene also brings a question in mind - just heck is zombie # 1 ??? <br /> <br /> The original assassination victims shown in the early credits of the film can only think of zombie # 1, but who does not know who this is, or why he has a special revenge against film crews? <br /> <br /> In any case, Ireland is looking at this transformation, as we see for Zombie # 1, the exact same time of zombie # 2 shabling through trees. (Which leads to a quick confusion over how many zombies really are). Then the best of the 1950s frightened film fashion run in Ireland while traveling. He is conveniently pressing his head on Faith Domager's dead cat's small helmet (John Cordrine's good guy died for a cat for a cat?) Meanwhile, Zombie # 1 is destroyed at home. He easily sends three filmmakers, then the stairs begin. Faith Domermeue listens to him, and is thinking back to his beloved John Ireland from his night-shoot, going out. After seeing it as just zombie # 1, she takes a title and carpets into a bedroom where she will retrieve Ireland's revolver. Carroll Wells does not bathe and listen to the screen at this time, her co-star Charles McCowley (her hair in the bedroom and hamming in the bedroom). Taking his sweet time (and after some more swigs from his hip-flasks) he finally decides to investigate. (One thing that strikes the viewer in the last quarter of the film is that the stars will suppress the stars and make gun sounds). Domergue Hallway is armed and ready, but the zombie # 1 blows Macauley and shoots him six times! <br /> <br /> Carol Wells broke out of her miscarriage and was dried up when she heard it. Guns and shouts of Domerme; She also has no great need to carry out the investigation. So this is the time string up Domergue from the neck with a rope of Zombie # 1. Wells killed Dargar's hanging corpse and dead. When we are broadcasting her next door out (???) - but it's more then. Meanwhile, Ireland found his feelings and traces in the house vulnerable, where he found the bloodiest of zombie # 1. Although Ireland has only killed 3 people, his film was revealed and ruined! He (and the audience) throws some cinematic equipment on his head from the relentless, zombie # 1 second floor. This is the last of Zombie # 1. At this point all viewers are driven to die, showing new ones as "mirror". <br /> <br /> Zombie # 2 At the same time, the zombies (as molasses in January slowly move these zombies) he carroll Wells floating in a stream, and the fish out of her. How did she get there? Zombie # 1 Throw her down, take her down, then zoom back to the jerk just jerk off the Ireland Ireland? Apparently the original victims sank in a tub, so Wells was drowning too (but why in the tub, never in a flow, explained). Zombie # 2 makes it home (although everyone is dead now, however, thanks to zombie # 1) but instead carries Carol Wells back to the cemetery. The end credits flash on the screen, we see his dead still sitting zombie # 2 in his hands, descending into the grave open. <br /> <br /> Leave the wondering viewer: Yes, but this is not the zombie # 1 grave? Why is Zombie # 2 taking a residence? And if zombie comes along # 1 and wants to climb back - zombie # 2 let him know, or there will be a zombie fight? Will the Zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased Carol Wells? And where is he now about dead John Cordrin? After all, from the previous scenes we know that he is clearly at home in the grave ... the concealment of this plot of conclusion does not worry you are not alone, leaving the chaos.
