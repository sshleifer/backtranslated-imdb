This film is probably the worst I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad script, everything bad. Comparing two other films in this genre and almost as interesting at the same time. Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are both very good and look more strong in both story and direction, and it's also directed by Albert Paine! The story is not original. World Environmental Disaster or Nuclear War is probably a terrible place, and people live in medieval conditions. The robot's special race (cyborgs) live on human blood and the story is ... Cyborgs need to get a lot of people to accomplish so many "human beings" and humans need someone to stop them. Together with the robot-maker Robot (Chris Christopher), a girl was assigned to preserve humanity. <br /> <br /> In this film, the Hong Kong stylish fight scenes with the participants are flying high and very jumping. This film fails in this effort. <br /> <br /> Many people would recommend this film as the new "worst ever" film is available. And for fans of the genre I would recommend "cyborg" because I think it's a much lesser predictive film than a very fun factor. <br /> <br /> If you can not keep Van Dam, check "Nemesis".
