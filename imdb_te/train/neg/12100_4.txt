Now I'm not wrong. If you need a brilliant summary of everything that is wrong with a flawless way of brighter future for a better human being than a comedian and learner of pop culture along with the history of human civilization? Because you are silent, the reason why religion is beneficial for plain and sound reasons is to turn to Sagan or Dawkins, but not for bil mahr (b) for God! It's a good thing and it's in it. <br /> <br /> In this film, he discarded how his warrior, art and science survived. To take his opinion when it seems experimentally and wiser. Unfortunately, his intelligence is not up to the task. <br /> <br /> Maher can laugh at us but it is not a bright bulb in the box. As an example, he is a representative of an interview (and I clearly use the word "ambushees" as a simple word) that the existence of Jesus is a historical fact that is "not," not the innocence of the subject (a device discourages hearing this movie). The problem was correct and in his statement that Jesus was only mentioned in what he regarded as a historically suspicious gospel. <br /> <br /> Mehr has never read a contemporary historian Josephus. <br /> While doing other fictional writers like Michael Moore, the masses move to this fake documentary and they are the worst and most mulay-like brining at approximately 70% of the previous one, Anti-Christian Torad, audiences dedicated to criticizing the religion itself which described the peace itself at 10% of the Totter. Hmmm. Criticism about Islam is contrary to hip and liberal target audience or just afraid to laugh. Too much to say, either way ..
