Why does this film come down to scales? In the end, the answer is in the poorest, ridiculous script. Travolta (slowly I'm with a big mullet) and Grosce both look at the youngest two young men as 'slick'. However, New Yorkers were eager to open their own nightclub. Moreover, the rest of the film is just boring to look at. It is not really valuable to know what is happening in the film climax at any level. Kelly Preston explicitly expresses sex appeal and is one of the pleasures of a sexually charged dance with Travolta with her husband. Charles Martin Smith is very fun to see KGB honcho struggling with "Bob Smith". Personally, I think this film is improved if this platform changes a bit, because these settings do not change from the NY to 'Indian Springs, Nebraska' (which is in the former Soviet Union) - do you know if you watch a movie ... Clearly, Ready to be released in 1987 Paramount estimated that the film was released until January 1989 because I did not expect a plot. It was reported that they felt "unreleasable". Nevertheless, this $ 6,000,000 was imbalanced by $ 6,000,000, which was released only before direct-to-video in places like Texas and Colorado. This is the rule for the overall BAD quality of this image.
