<br /> <br /> When I saw the film, I never laughed a lot of hard work in the horror film. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a completely written horror movie with stupid dialogue, the plot and the useless scenes are confusing. <br /> <br /> Make sure to focus on the classic "food processor" scene and the completely unsuitable police investigation scenes <br> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stupid, daring or brave.
