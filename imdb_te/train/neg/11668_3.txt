There are pretty landscape shots. The authors put common mouths into the mouths of the mouth. The program will be a little sophisticated with fewer actors. 'Art should activate humanity or it will be BS.' Therefore, the art of those mentioned is not merely moving humanity, but expressing a dark degree. The main character also tells you not to hide on the shadow side. Wrong, being a dimensional he does not expand his scope to other than landscaped and subdued by his dark side by living and drinking in the dark. His work does not have the expression of his breathing creature or pain. All artists have limited themselves to a dozen landscapes. Grade school discussions between the characters, the author has always wanted to give the character a role. After reading the first Wow comments here, I like it. I had to dig deeply to see those who agreed. There are great comments from the movie's connectors. In the end I only moved once. The kid path is very inactive. The scenery is nice and the music is ridiculous. My opinion but I did not show me somewhere.
