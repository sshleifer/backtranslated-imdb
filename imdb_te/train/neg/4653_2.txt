She is a vampire's assistant after falling in love with a five-dollar hooker in this very low-budget horror-comedy. I can not explain all the good comments in this picture. I chuck it for mass hallucinations, but it is nothing less. A ransom factor (and it's very generous here) may be a semi-favored grandfather in this whole mess. Do not waste your money or time. Here the Troma keeps on the DVD, but it does not make it even worse. <br /> <br /> Troma DVD Extras: Commentary with Omar and Kirk; Removed scenes from the second commentary with cast and crew; Noodle; Thomas interactivity; Radiation march; Clip from "Terror Firmer"; <br /> <br /> "My grade: D" The Reddie Girls "," Teenage Catgirls in Heat "," Cinnamon: The Musical "and" Toxic Avenger 4 "
