The film has so many downsides and I can see everything. It is painfully directed long and terrible. I was totally impatient with the whole audience and I waited to finish it. Run time is over 3 hours, which was revised to less than 2 hours. <br /> Transition mean between the stories. <br /> <br /> Govinda is doing a fair job, Anil Kupur disappoints me and we will rest as we can imagine. If it is unlikely to expect any closer or closer to what is close.
