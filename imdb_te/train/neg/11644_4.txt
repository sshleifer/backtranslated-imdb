Yes, I'll get "Possolini" and his surroundings, but at the same time, I'll overdate his "Decameron", and some are upsetting. He introduces anticipated "reality" (milling groups, inferior architecture, etc.) using the absurd and clear Goofy way of character. In harmony with reality, Pasolini has used a number of actors, but their deer-in-the-headlights are passionate and painful awkward line delivery that gives terrible off-kiloter and staggering feel. <br /> <br /> And the "Decacerone" of Pasolini is a disturbance of common and prevalent homosexuality (at least for me). I'm prudish or homophobic (I'm no one), but because the importance of keeping pasolini on homoeroic images and circumstances is because he is incompatible with the actual reality, so it becomes irrelevant and forced. He can hear what he says, "Oh - I wanted to make a beautiful, naked boy in this scene!" Pasolini is trying to play a homosexual angle to crush his nose at critics, and at other times he enjoyed the subject regardless of what he liked the audience. <br /> <br /> 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolini's "Decameron", rather than fail as the storyteller of Pasolini, rather than the factor of neo-realism. He was frustrated with each story and he was unbelievably and less confident. There is also a final line dialogue of Pasolini in the film which is seen by some people ("Why is it so sweet to create art when it dreams about it?") - is not it difficult for me to make a film if he thinks this? In my opinion, a very well-designed movie (and with homosexual content) Fellini's "Sutarsian". It is filled with overwhelmingly visible people and absurd situations, but it is succeeded by its panning, direction and strong heroes, but "dicomerone" fails the same elements.
