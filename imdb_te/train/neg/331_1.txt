Going overboard is the only worst movie I have ever seen, and yes, I can say without a doubt the shadow of a doubt that I saw Kazo. Adam Sandler is a haughty comedian who works in a cruise liner, as skicky Moskowitz. This is the same plot. <br /> This is it! Nothing in the film makes sense, it's like a mad man snack, and the way is a wacky naked gun kind, but more of a frustrating, 't.v is the kind of way to throw two shoes. Even General Noriega makes a performance, for no reason I can comprehend it (it's certainly not comedy). Combine a mixture to the mixture, I've always had the worst Australian concentration, and there's something I do not call the worst movie ever since because the film's basic definition is not enough. I appreciate you watching this movie, as if you are standing in the face of every bad movie you see anytime. The first thing I say after seeing a bad movie is "at least it's not like going overboard".
