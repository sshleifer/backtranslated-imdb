Even though this very old show (2002), I saw my first episode last night and I said it was a bad show. . . <br /> I'm not for comments, but I'm pretty shocked, I'm clearly trying to show it, and this is their target audience, children older than 12 years old or less with average IQ. <br /> <br /> Last night, I had a lot of confusing lines of episode episode, trying to teach about the essence and friendship of imaginable stories, family, religion and politics !!! <br /> <br /> The primary story they cover in the episode: Frau House is a very bad mistake by the alcohol - Death FBI turns into a son of senators who want to investigate. Death was originally assassinated by a peanut allergy senator who feels he can become his best friend and best friend in early childhood because the senator ultimately got a conscience despite his laws. The general Alibi (a former girlfriend student was fed up with everyone else, the frustrated student was actually changing experience, senators did not pay a disappointing student to kill a student who was sworn by the enemy, and the students were liberated freely). The heroine of this dribble keeps her niece at 'that age' and has a love for the boy, she eventually dared to talk with Aunt's help, but only "in" girls said he was not good enough and she dumped him to keep up with her. When the Sue and her FBI team find a murderer, she will return with the boy after learning the truth about her life and the girls leave her, and Aunt is really the only person who can truly rely on herself (I'm almost ill at this time) 'Play' gets better. . . This laughs at you, I'm sure. . . <br /> <br /> It took him only a year ago and his real father was an international terrorist and fraternity boy who found out that he was trying to find a real daddy that was shot by a boy and killing a funeral at the funeral. . . . . . . . <br /> <br /> The characters are cardboard. Cardboard is a continuous cardboard and the bottom of the story. Anyone that they love this show has a cardboard for a brain. <br /> <br /> Why these writers have tried to pack in each event in a show show that they clearly carry a simple plot line that does not believe the character development or the ability of actors. Watching this show is like watching 'Last Action Hero', with Arnie killing 5,000 people with a dental pic, with Arnie being a good actor (Wow, I never thought I would have a day!) Simpsons' beloved character in the words' Comic Book Guy '. . . . <br /> WORST TV show. . . . . Ever.
