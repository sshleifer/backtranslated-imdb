Oh, no. This is very bad. There is no evidence that the play is going to be transferred, especially the people who have not decided on how to treat the theater sources of the material (for the occasional glance of the theater audience we'll notice.) And a proudly arrogant intent that you remember a movie Make sure to continue editing style , But by the very thing that it's very little you will be reminded that you are looking at very poor images. Mira Sorvino's Central Performance is poor to breathe: Stage-I and Plumma, playing through the merchant Ivory Ou√©r of Helena Bonham-Carter. Only Fiona's Shah presents the performance of the note - and her theater pedigree may mean better ability to maintain her material - but that performance is light, honest, and even harder to see a movie for a show alone, as a whole Shah. Ben Kingsley revolves around an average and broken twist, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling, plays her supporting role. Unfortunately, if the film is evidence, Bertolucchi's magic does not bother his wife.
