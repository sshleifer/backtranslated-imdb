The film is mostly chase scenes and special effects. The plot is very weak. Most of the computer talk is mumbo-jumbo. This is largely based on computer realism and real computer communications, since I am a big fan of virtual war games. There is nobody in this film. Computer scenes are far from impossible and are not unrealistic for virtual computers and networks, which are just lame. <br /> <br /> The immense game is dull and is only an arcade game. What is real hacking, so what's the point? The movie is boring. Lame sequel.
