A pot - boiler if I've ever seen. A thriller thriller taken from "A Time to Kill", "Silence of the Lambs", a bigger degree, on top of all, thrown in a "In the Heat of the Night" thrown in a "In the Heat of the Night" with a slight reverse murder . Namely, in the distribution of the thrills. The plot appears to be frozen from a large book, which makes the story clear and unheard of, but does not direct pace and verve. Adhere to any splendor, distributed along a major twist way and here it is palpably very unsuccessful. Canary is clearly slowly slowing down at her old age, who struggles with her voice with the voice of the U.S. and looks more like the father of Hope Lange and her father's gosh - horny father. He seems to be younger than his father. Laurence Fishburn is given the chance to live in his role and you are confused from the beginning that he is a bad guy or a good guy. Someone once said that flashbacks should not lie - they are confusing here. The rest of the players have an average cast in their underrated stereotyped rolls. Assuming the climax was too much, like my seat's front edge had not been, roll me through my back and leave me. The medieval sloping Hollywood film is definitely made.
