<br /> <br /> It can be a fairy tale based on the ancient people of the cat people, but it is not. <br /> This work may just have been; Surprising and filled with mythical references. The main characters (Charles Brady, played by Bryan Cross, and his mother, starring Alice Craig) are deeply depressed, not the personality's deep and rarely fond of or drawn. The role of MÃ¤dchen Amik (who played Tanya Robertson) into that explanation is not fit. However, as I mentioned in Stephen King's novel for TV many times, you just do not write for his books on TV and that his screenplay does not slander fire and depth as a novelist. This is another painful attempt to take the magic of Stephen King, whether it's his novels or original screen placement. Simply cut and paste his work on the small screen. His novels are completely bastardised in the process and everything that ends up is a good image. Nothing less but absolutely nothing. His screen placement hit and miss. Unfortunately, this screenplay will miss translation. <br /> Sorry, sorry, sorry cinema. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br
