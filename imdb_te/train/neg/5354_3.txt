Lack of good platforms, good performance, lack of good cinematography, lack of special effects ... Can I go? Review includes SPOILERS. Actors appear to read their lines, and they are not very good at all. Many of the "actors" have appeared because they are in "SECOND GRADE PLAY". The story appeared to be written by one of the second graders mentioned above ... it really is not all that irritating ... It's just that they think that SIMILL and DUMB should be missing something so that a person thinks they are foggy. That's not it, it's exactly SIMPLE as you want. I understand the "movie", how can i see how it stands! Most people in this movie talk about talking (reading their lines), trying to see the evil one. The narrator is ill. "Special Effects" are laughing. I love low budget films. I'm also not in the film ... nor do they pay for their talent in their hearts, or even Caroline Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry, and Michael Berrymore. I love Tony Todd ... However, he only fits in the film. In fact, I gave Tony Todd's performance only 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was only two minutes (seriously) it was! I suggested speed up the DVD to the two-minute Tony Todd section. If I went to the theater and paid more than one dollar to watch this movie, I would have been P.O.D and demanded my money back. Hopefully after these people do a good time.
