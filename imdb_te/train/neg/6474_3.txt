The first sequel I saw was (except the Return of Jaffer) and I felt honest before I saw that it was really close. <br /> <br /> The storyline is fundamentally the first script and situation with some extra characters. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody is not satisfied with life on Earth. She wants to become a mermaid. However, she wants to save her from her daughter, because she wants to save her-and Melody is upset and angry when she learns. And she decides to flee, and she becomes a mermaid. So she is a joyful swim around, and Ariel makes her find a fisherman. <br /> <br /> The story does not come too bad, but clues and repetitions are very clear from the first movie. <br /> <br /> Melody sum is very annoying, and the film is almost unbearable. <br /> There is also a whole load of other new characters-tip and dash two of them. They are not very bad in their roles - they do not think about Timon or Pumbaa! The songs leave a lot to stay, the songs from the original song just do not have the same magical power. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Animation does not clearly have a whole load of work, but it is jumpy, and parts of the characters are not very intuitive. <br /> Another suggestion - Ariel's original character is looking at this film. Beautiful, rebellious, curious young man is 'all' a tough, boring wife and mother, and her trademark reddish hair. <br /> <br /> However, it is not the worst of all - it's not exactly sure. Other sequels like Cinderella II. But this is not in the original league. But if nothing else for your collection goes like this Disney they will lose their old fans.
