Here we will see, here are the "highlights" of the brain machine: 15 setting up a pool and a house shots; Establish shots of a non-official office building; 5 Countdowns by a Blonde Technician; 7 scenes of the scary guard; <br /> <br /> Various posters commented on the difference between the 1972 copyright date and the release date given in the DVD box of 1977. It's easy to explain. This dog was sitting on a shelf that had not been released for five years, and when it was dusted, it was thought to fit in the post-apocalyptic watergate mood in the government. Now after seeing the brain machine, it's always great!
