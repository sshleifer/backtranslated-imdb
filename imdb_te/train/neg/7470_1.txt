In Sao Paulo, the upper middle class young men joined Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel University and during the early class, they would go to the party with drugs and booze. The next day, after their classes, Cristiano came to her home on the previous night and raped her three girlfriends. The girl dies, they are scared and decides to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother starts with Gabriel and breaks her neck and goes up the stairs. <br /> <br /> Controversial and shameless "Comma di Gato" Overtreat about the alienation of youth is far worse, and that's exactly the worst Brazilian film that I have seen over the years. The unpleasant, tragic and dark story is actually the black comedy humor of bad taste. The screenplay is not funny, stupid lines and dialogues, and boring, manipulating and silly footage with interviews with morons in the beginning and at the end. This act is evident with many postures, but does not have any talent, and I was disappointed with the good Caio Blate's presence in this trash. Camera, framing, cinematography and edition are enthusiastic and very low quality. The sound is awful and it is not possible to understand what the actors and actors talk about in many areas (perhaps this is because the movie is success). The gang bang is very real and sex-exploitation is used to promote the film in poorly marketing. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Comma di Gato" ("Cat's Bedding")
