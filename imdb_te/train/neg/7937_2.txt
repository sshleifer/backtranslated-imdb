After 30 seconds, you realized that there is no real budget for this cheap knock-off. The story is taken from great images such as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Hills Eyes". I like that kind of movies, even if they are fake (Roundturn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But the "Side Show" is hard to see: the actors are really bad, the dialogue cheesy and the music is stupid and totally incorrect. You do not care what the characters happen. The so-called bad guys are also interesting and rather simple at all. So how about blood and gore? Very low, but the action is much less implemented. 2 points, not just for gore and blood but also for gore-hounds, it does not mean that the look of a look is rare.
