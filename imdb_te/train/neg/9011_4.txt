Pretty standard b-movie stuff. Seriously, for anyone looking for a "dragon fighter" with Dean Cain, some of the people making their first film are better than expecting real quality or moderate intelligence. B movies are available for popular re-work formulas. If you give them a token analysis, you are destroying the movie for yourself (and writing some self-important, scandalous review on IMDb). <br /> <br /> I love feminine Kristin Byers. She had charisma and I felt her attractive. It's a memorable B-film performance. Unfortunately, I do not know what movies she has ever produced. I'll see her again.
