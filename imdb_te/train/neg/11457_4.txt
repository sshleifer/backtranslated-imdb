As well. <br /> <br /> The expectations of the film are pretty low. <br /> <br /> When I was sitting by this trash, I sat through the 80's Rob Lowove film with no nudity and sex in them. <br /> <br /> If you've got some wierd Alley Shadey or Amanda Paes (or I do not guess, a definite humiliation of Oxford, and unexciting, uneventful, and uneventing roaring scenes The characters are boring and flat, Rob Lowe) fetish, there's really no reason to see this one.
