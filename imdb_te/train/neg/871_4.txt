The local town Rivendran, who married Nicholas Walker Paul, Martha (Ally Sheedie), but decides her own death to run away with a habitual woman and her current affair, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). But if he did, he got the Amrita (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also a silly old coat, which is pines for a good Riverland in a shades of "reality". Worried like this is sad to see a pretty good cast. At least a bit of a horrible unforgettable role as a detective private investigator is not John Savage. In a movie called 'black comedy', it is necessary to bring the movie to a movie. When it occasionally buried, it's nothing sinful. Moreover, you can not emphasize any characters, so there is no selfish interest in them. Not technically bad for all, it is very unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dara gets without Tomanovich; <br /> <br /> I saw where I was: Showtime Showcase
