A schizophrenic escapes from a NYC mental hospital and soon teachers begin to get off at St Trinity University. The new mentor Julie (Francis Forbes) has to deal with Red Harris's mess. Despite a 78 minutes running time, this cheap o slasher reveals that you and the suspect are killer from going into the guy and it looks like it drags to the end. Director Richard Hynes splits a sweep with some spoiled stalks-slash performances, but early 80 viewers are probably satisfied. For all of our enthusiastic anthropologists there, at the beginning of the 80s it was filmed in New York, so you can check out the culture, beliefs and practices of people from faraway places. The film received some credit to overcome "Final Girl". You'll rarely see it. Moreover, the horror film is always good to see, priest murderer. Do not you believe in my beloved film industry? Thankfully, this is a fraudulent priest and he will be attracted. He is still working on a moral high ground angle.
