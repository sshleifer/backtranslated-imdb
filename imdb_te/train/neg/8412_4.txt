I saw DreamGirls yesterday, and I was really underimpressed. Despite all the Oscars buzz, this is nothing special. Anyone really impressed with this film is not bothered to see any of the real movie music classics. Except Eddie Murphy's great musical and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is just a glimpsal TV movie with style or skill. <br /> <br /> Now, the first half hour is good, but I'm fed up with Eddie Murphy's amazing revive shows how Montez slashed and interrupted. The best songs and best performances in this film are easy. And the part of the film's "Upgrade" episode is the only part of the film that has either stable or any speed. The remaining hour and 45 minutes are simple, the rambling is confusing, it's wonderful to be realistic or interesting. It is visually dull and has tunes that sound too much. <br /> <br /> I thought the condom would be a big showcase. In the second half each number is closer to one another than "singing" one another. And the way they shot Hudson's big "love me" number is criminal! Condon burned his stamping on stage - no play! <br /> <br /> "Sing speaking dialogue" will work on stage, but it will not work in cinemas (see embarrassing and disastrous failures of Phantom). All "I'll give you something!" The worst editing room should be left on the floor. <br /> <br /> Except Epic Murphy's spectacular performance - this film is no more than a glorified TV movie. There must be megabaks behind PR work in this movie! I wondered how much money I had spent on the pre-release "Oscar Buzz". Overall, this film is not only with the exception of Oskar Caliber, except Eddie! (Except Eddie) I like to rank right up with Grease 2. BIG frustration, after all (much i expen $ i) hype!
