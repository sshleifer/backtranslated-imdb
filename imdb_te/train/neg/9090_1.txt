Palestine is a promotional film for "cause". If you are looking for an impartial documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you should look elsewhere. Contrary to the support of the Palestinian goals (for example, mass murder, the destruction of Israel) is a documentary for you - an anti-Semite (or just a Zionist anti-nationalist - is not wrong to ask for a country). In the college campuses around the UK and the US should be entertaining evening. However, any information and intellectual honesty will be indignant in the false image presented in this video. I really do not know the situation and hope for those who have not been corrupted by this anti-Semitic cutting.
