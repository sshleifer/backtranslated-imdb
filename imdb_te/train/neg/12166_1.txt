Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - Yes she is related to Bruce), the first movie killer, to her old tricks. She is one of the advisers at Camp Rolling Hills. The girls at the camp are good and are better off from sex, drugs and swearing. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepway Camp" was a bad and nasty spool image but it had some good points - killing them on the line and angela for a few feet. It's very bad and it does not have very good points. The plot was death and it was nothing new to Formula. There are many ghory murders (people are burned alive, heads are cut, strangled) but all gore is actually a ridiculous. This is also a small amount of campers I've seen and everyone is very old for their characters (especially the Higgins). As expected, there are inappropriate female nudity (provided by Valerie Hartman who is not too old here) and the best girl / good boy team (Ren√©ne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the exception of Springsteen and Higgins, acting is lousy - even slasher film standards. There is also a brutal edge in the film, in which a character sinks out! Boring and sick with a stupid plot, meaning nudity and bad gore. Skip.
