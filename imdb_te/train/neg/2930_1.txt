I like British humor, I believe it is the best in the world. I like almost every British sitcom (okay ... not monthly python, some jokes are great, but some of them do not understand me.), But this league of gentlemen is just fine. This program is fine in some way; I lost some weight because it makes me feel this piece of garbage is not hungry anymore. This is really just disgusting, sick and even funny TV show and I wonder who really laughs on this stuff. I saw it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It is very frustrating to see the men wearing a woman with yellow teeth and watching the kidneys in the car ... This makes me feel stomach. No humor, just disturbing pictures and cheap, toilet laughs ... I do not know ... if you like this ... go ahead ... See it ... People who are honest, watching and enjoying should have some emotional problems. Garbage.
