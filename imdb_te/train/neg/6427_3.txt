So I completely thought this documentary was fantastically and really understood. I know I got awards and things, but I personally do not enjoy it too much. You do not have humor or play, you're interested in it, just wierdos and a group of their jobs. Some people are different from this, it's not a bad thing, it's not a good impression on me. I was completely bored of this film, and my creative teacher was not guilty of any crime. Circus theme throughout the whole film was very cool but I did not get it, and robotics and lion taming was definitely not my thing. The green animals thing is neat, I really liked lots of colorful flowers garden, but how to connect these four jobs? I do not understand why someone is making a movie about it. But if you are in such things it will enjoy you. Who am I to stand on your way? I'm warning you about the possible suffering.
