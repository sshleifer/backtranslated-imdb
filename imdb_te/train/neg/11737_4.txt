Well, I do not think the film is as bad as most of the reviews make it up. . . <br /> <br /> Many problems are in the script. There are a plot - but not quite the story, and certainly no one is calling it an acceptable call; It's self-conscious, strange and / or stereotypical characters, lines, moments, and finally, most of this section is not added. Sorry, but I could not care much about trying to solve Forceworth with "social illness"; When running around plants trying to steal ammonia, or those morages, there is something that cuts their brains, there is always a public sector. So, as an image, you can not find me calling "Iowa" "Important." But, at a stylized level, the picture is interesting and some beautiful, happy, and unhappy in Francesworth's choices to paint the vet-out state of Meth-Head - yes, I said - inspiration. /> <br /> Acting is unequal, but it can be a risk to approach the prestigious stylistic. See, Rosanna Arquette is a good actress - but it's not very good here, so a member of a detailed audience, "What happened?" It is unnatural that Diane Foster is lucky to be a simplicity and kind of other actors so can come anywhere. For example, I was a probation officer at Michael T. I will seriously examine any explanation for Fernworth for Weiss's over-the-top turn, but I doubt that I will ever buy it. It just does not work. <br /> Again, this is very alive and in the years I've seen John Savage appeared in years. <br /> <br /> It is a work that will break the Lord, but not promise - and that's OK; Forensworth or anyone else does not need to create movies. So, if Farnsworth did not see another film in him, if he did, it would be much more fun. In the latest phase of "American Idol", when people are planning their lives, at age age, we can not be frustrated with Forceworth's legitimate and rejectionable flawed image. <br /> <br /> What's more, perhaps we do not wish to congratulate us, his powerful and sometimes sacred fantasy imagination.
