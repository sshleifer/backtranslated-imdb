The film is not as terrible as most science fiction channel films. I am used to seeing amateur special effects such as gray CGI blobs and close-ups of fake blood that are very clear that blood strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation. Nevertheless, I thought I saw all the frauds that I could lose on the Size-Fi channel. I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Do you imagine a hand in a rubber pile with a syrup? The film has major foreign vampires. You can clearly see the fingers inside the rubber sock guns. The spoken hand comes from the victims, and the Rubber Sack puppets can speak in the Vampire Transylvanian in the Vampire Hunter's team. How did Alien Vampires learn Transylvania? And Transylvania in Romania? So they do not speak Romanian? Why would some small town be their own language? You can suspend your gag reflex temporarily and use the rubber socks that clearly speak with moving fingers inside the heads of Aliens; Then you have to deal with other alien vampires. "Leatherfaces" are worn on their faces. Then there are all the simplest uglys, all of which have facial scars. <br /> <br /> There are also annoying valley girls and their boyfriends who penetrate into human traffickers and space forces so that they can destroy the defense systems that attack the space vampires. <br /> <br /> In the end, funny and a smile worth above, you will face network TV's third rated cast rejects the stereotypical angry leaders who are constantly fighting among themselves. Almost every size-fiction channel film should use main characters that are why annoying, abrasive, crude, or simply totally unsympathetic? I seemed to have won rubber socks to speak.
