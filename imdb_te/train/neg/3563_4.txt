For the most part, the film feels like "an attempt made for TV". Directed by Ham-Fist, acting (except Fred Guinea) is tired and soap. Denis Crosby gives her lines to read her queue line card. Just one thing makes this movie worth looking at, and once the gauge comes back from the "cemetery." A small child is unhappy about seeing anyone killed, and this could be more than a film can handle than for some reason. It is bone-chilling. The film only makes the same thing, but it will eat an item from the park to the right. The value seen in the last 10 minutes or less.
