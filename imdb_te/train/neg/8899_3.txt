Where is it written that sequels should be succeeded? Scream 2 did not! Others did not! But this one made sure ... there are terrible actors (only Christopher Walken can work in the whole film), bad writing (you never understand what is going on and I have research on the idea of ​​Nephilim even before), and terrible options for casting. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts makes my life foolish Archangel Michael. <br /> <br /> If you are disappointed to see Christopher Walken, <br /> <br /> In the film, move fast to the parts in the picture and keep others out. <br /> Yech !!!
