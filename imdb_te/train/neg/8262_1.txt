It's really terrible: the grooves and innocents shot hard at the endless showcases do not have any purpose at all, in the beginning, in the middle or in the endless sequences that are strongly absurd conversations, some absolutely interesting and almost unrecognizable "story" cut together without any clear narrative or cognitive intent. Suddenly there are wip-pans or wobblyhand-organized departments without a clear-headed crane shot spies, and suddenly without any obvious reason: all this "style" works just to improve the project is almost unreliable in the almost unpleasant vacuum of massive misconception and material. Definitely made a candidate for the worst image.
