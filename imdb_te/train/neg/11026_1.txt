I finished reading a book about dillinger. This film is not scary. They got a list of names and just like everything was made up. His exploits and traffic were well planned both - when the time elapsed, they left off whether they had all the money. There are notes on each road they have moved. He never saw him at the Purwis restaurant, saying he had paid the dinner after leaving Dillinger. Pallis never before SAW Dillinger was killed before his death. The death of his gang members is fictitious. Like he did in the film, Dillinger did not rob him of a bank. If I read the book, I enjoyed the movie. Acting is a bit over the places. This action has also been exceeded. In the second thought, I suspect that I enjoyed reading the book.
