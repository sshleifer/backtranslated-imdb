According to IMDb Takashi Mike's master of horror-segment, Imprint is prohibited in the US. <br /> <br /> I do not find any expectations in the Masters of Horror in the episode of Killer-director Takashi Mike from Ichi. Series. <br /> <br /> The story takes place mostly in the remote Japanese bordeaux, in the 19th century, a journalist Como, a woman he has left, who promised to return. Tired and bored he comes to Bordello, hoping it will end his long journey. It is one of the prostitutes, an optional and quiet girl, who knows about komo, and the desperate man tells her where she is and what has happened to her since she left. <br /> <br /> What was the first thing that hit me about the episode, the Japanese cast was the most fluent American-English. But I will leave it, this is not a big deal. One big deal is how painful it is. The story of Mike moves at such a slow pace, and in 63 minutes I can not watch my watch several times. The stretch torure-scene taking place somewhere in the middle of the film, so unmotivated - and sexually unreasonable - that scene has become even more interesting. I thought it was just violent for violence - because there was no style or purpose. The only scenes that triggered me of any kind of emotions are the images of rapidly flowing underwater bloody embryos ... And in all honesty, they are provocative emotions. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to be relieved, <br /> <br /> "I've always found that Nitty's dragon's character is very foggy (and I'm in a good way) and that's why I found him a terrible one (not a good way). His acting behaves as if some feelings or consequence. When his character responds to terrible acts, I'm sitting on the couch <br /> <br /> I am very grateful to you for saying Yokohi Kudoh (Remembrance, A Geisha, 2005), which plays a very strange astronaut. <br /> <br The finale is perhaps terrible, perhaps rebellious, but I kind of ... you know ... "blah" (and I looked at seeing myself again, for the innocent time, just crappy Psyched has waited to end) I probably did not get a little smile, but I could not help thinking of the Red Dwarf episode and Craig Charles and Danny John-Julls's upside-down nuts and eyes they would look like aliens ... when you look at the episode And now you want to see the print Lucky for you, I will destroy you for the end of the scene. My first thought was finally closed, the only thing that made the pain of looking at it was worth hearing, the main title theme by Edward Shearmur (the same music I believe is used in every episode of this series), and that - if anything - <br /> <br /> Michel Kimuraura can suggest the appearance of costume, at least there is no style and refinement. But when showing Japanese "Geisha-Fashion" there are so many movies and TV shows. It was not inferior, I was disappointed. Taraashi Mikkiles Masters of Horror-Episode Boring, Undisputed and Meaning. In other words; Really bad!
