I made very little reviews in the IMDb and this movie never saw the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in this regard is the mel Brooks film, called "The Quellient". In other words, his image, his image is small. Think about it - Producers and Young Frankenstein are great pictures and he's shouting all of them. But, like the Life Stinks and Spaceballs, Mel's full capabilities and pretty dopey movies (yes, I'm not like spaceballs - but this is not a place to talk about). <br /> <br /> Second, unlike cancer, heel itching and mental retardation, I can not think of less funny than the homeless. It's just a comedy breaker. Think about it. In this movie FUNNIEST (?) Scenery is in Mel Making Hoop Whip with Leslie Ann Warren in Delster! And how is it funny?
