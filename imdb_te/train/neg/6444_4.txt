Many college students lose their educators' babies, who will be eliminated from studying and living communities. Their conversations are held with their classmates and college faculty. Steven Green Street's documentary is a prime example of a fated college student, which is considered by the whole community to have a limited association with its whole members. <br /> <br /> In this documentary, people who are filmed on a small group indicate large groups of populations. In the same way, many listeners get a lot of media attention. The documentary did better, than its misrepresentation of the film-set society. <br /> <br /> The controversy with me is that the feelings and confusions in the film are attributed to the total number of people rather than the total number of individuals. <br /> Naturally, it is ridiculous to examine such controversies and to confront the entire community of people in the actions of some radicals.
