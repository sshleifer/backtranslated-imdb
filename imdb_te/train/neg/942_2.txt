This night was seen on the cablo night. I do not know that the girl called "Shannon Wilse" was actually a romantic star called Savannah, but she was really pretty for sitting through this brain-melting motion (and thankfully thank God). I like cheesy flicks like the next person - actually more than the next person - but this is still a bladder in the refrain. The mad scientist and the director's writers, writers and special effects are really abhorrent, neglecting the inaccurate nudity of the people's actual inability to save only the image. Savannah is really interesting to see her before she became a romantic queen, and she is really gorgeous to see - she's gorgeous at times, uncontrollable at times, blowing off the camera off and smiling and generally a better time, than for the audience . Although Savannah and her colleagues are naked, this picture is a fair amount of money, and this is still a very stupid, bad and annoying movie. If anyone in the video is familiar with you or if you have a few nightly cable, check it, but do not waste your money for rent.
