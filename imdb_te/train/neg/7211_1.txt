I grew up looking at the Inspector gadget. This is one of my favorite cartoons, not my absolute favorite. I've learned a lot of geography and history from the field trip of the spin-off inspector gadget. <br /> <br /> This film has destroyed the reputation of an amazing cartoon. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, is not exactly the role of Inspector Gadget. First thing - Inspector Gadget is good in the picture. That's not in the cartoon. In the film, the gadget finds himself very secretive. In the cartoon, it's always a penny, brain, and awesome book (I still need her book!). If the gadget is secretly resolved, it is in danger. <br /> <br /> The gadget in this movie is an effective detective, but there is a lot of humor in the cartoon. <br /> <br /> In the movie "Good Guy V Bad Guy" It's not just a crazy Saturday morning cartoon. Also, the gadget should never have a love story, but Disney Corporation is fraught with idiots. <br /> <br /> I will miss real gadgets and gadgets that have gadget. It is a chick convertible in the picture. In the cartoon it becomes a sedan's police car and a van. <br /> <br /> The terrible thing about this film is that it's a movie. Inspector Gadget is a silly Saturday morning cartoon. <br /> <br /> The film is very serious, very intriguing, has plenty of platforms and it is not even funny as remote. <br /> Tip: Never see. Ever. Look at the cartoon, it's a real classic.
