X-Men movies are great. I've understood all of them, including the long-hated X-Men 3. They have great characters (magneto and javier are in my opinion) and have a good story tilt. I saw the film, all the excitement when the film was enthusiastic, and my expectations grew bigger as long as I saw the film. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best film is the fountain, although you do not hear them when they talk about this actor), and his performance. <br /> <br /> The film is plagued by all meaningless characters <br /> <br /> I am a fan of XMen, I have read many stories, many of them are stories and This film did not respect any of them. None. No continuity. It does not honor Weapon X project or has a relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth or Emma Frost, motivations for Wolverine are plain stupid and millions of movies: Revenge for the death of loved ones. /> Oh. Stricker men came and he was alone wiping out the enemy forces while he was expecting a boraxer shot for Wolverine in school in X2 I imagined a whole hole in the movie, but hey, it's Fox, this family flick and you can not see clear violence from the most violent and fierce Marvel hero. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, the film has a continuous d√©joule feel because Wolverine's Origins is already described in X2. <br /> We already know that it does not make sense to film. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that Wolverine is one of the few characters that do not require a small back story because of the nature of the mystery character. Want to know how the Joker got his spots?
