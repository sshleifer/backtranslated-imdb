I'm probably always going to see a Woody Allebe film, he's never known when he's just returning his last greatness. One or two great moments or lines may be worth it. Sadly, this film does not make any score. Ther is what makes me sad and makes a little guilty. My reaction is much like Woody's other fans, but what can say? It's probably time to focus on his clarinet, which in my opinion, he's very good. Saying all of this, I probably will probably come out with any new film Woody's future. There is always hope and I'll continue to respect and respect the woody!
