The bride dies at the altar and their bodies are vanishing. Nobody knows the researcher's report (Luna Walters) that everyone wore strange orchid and interviewed Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now d Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffin, with her aging wife (Elizabeth Russell) in a fluid feeding to a young man. <br /> <br /> The Corps Vanishies Interesting mantle and a small enough run time should it get boring. Unfortunately, it starts very well, it begins to drag before half-point and instead becomes boring with its clich√©s and speculative plot. <br /> There are some good things about it- Bela Lugosi handles beautiful and brilliant and brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, happy, away and very creepy countess; And I'm always with Angelo Rosito. <br /> <br /> It maintains a bit of a gothic atmosphere and sets are good. <br /> <br /> Overall, keep my interest in the whole picture, for that, I have to rate it low.
