I was amazed at finding this show the number of fans. Friends did not say that the best 'average sitcom, and not as great as others did. It was not until the casting of the Katyn Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston, and Matt Le Blanc, that the show continued as long as the show ended. I am very doubtful. Despite the progress of the series, although my friends were more gradually imaginative, dirty and bored, I could not care less about the characters - most of them were in TV history or their plight, or they were sleeping. And it occasionally went from funny to the first four seasons funny. And even though it's this A-list Hollywood actress in the world, I have not yet been tuned. Friends started writing, I lost interest in the show since the sixth season. It lasted for ten seasons, but only a few of my favorite shows lasted for three or four seasons, and finally abandoned and wind washed away. At the time of the casting of big wages, the program came to the instant Hult. To be honest, most of the series is bigger than actors, not the other round round. <br /> When it ended in 2004, I was relieved to see this sitcom behind. Now, a friend's reunion program is very likely to come to our TV screens very quickly. And yet, for that I'm not looking forward to it.
