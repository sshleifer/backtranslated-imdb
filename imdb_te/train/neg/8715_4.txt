Primal species come from B Movie Legend Roger Corman and it knows and everyone knows that this is a low budget B movie. <br /> <br /> The high jack of terrorists believe in killing a lorry and the whole army and trying to catch uranium, but not ..... It has a flavor for two dino human flesh ... then a crack called delta force <br /> <br /> Okay, it's not Jurassic Park, and Dino's apparently never been seen, because it was a costume in a costume that was unparalleled to Barney Dinosaur Ramey - just a little terrifying for Jurassic Park, which is about 1% of the budget and what it ceyyagaladanedi. <br /> Need to be in the bottom 100? Hell NO !!! I think this is almost half of the voters to give a 1 - WAY WAY is very tough, it's close to 4 ... It's actually better than a whole host of other movies in the lower 100s, and the value of the product equivalent to science-fiction channel production. <br /> <br /> It's not a fun B movie - not for movie snacks <br /> <br / > ***
