Unfortunately this film, the pathetic effort of the true story of 54 studio 54. The only thing that's good about the film is a joy to watch 'Mike Myers'. 'Neve Campbell,' her character is unfortunately bad. The bottom line is that the film has good performances from actors, except for one, the true story's conversion is a disappointing effort for better screen play.
