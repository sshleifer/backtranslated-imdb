I will list this film under the horror film genre. I do not know about the genre called terrible because I did. I have decided to put in this category so that the genre came in horrible horror. Acting is inappropriate. You will be in the first scene of the villains. The heroine in this movie is shaky. Movie Making Pupils should take as an example lesson what can not be done in this movie. This is bad. The divine word is not bad. The villains hijack an ocean liner and require $ 10 million. They would like to distribute money on the island of Roses, living in the Pacific. They are sitting ducks after the money comes. There is no escape plan. How dare woman cruise director, former police, naval seal, kung fu I'm scared. Hilarious part time is a way to defuse the bomb. He learns what he's doing and he pulls all the wires one by one. He puts it in his pocket and according to the picture with all the connections in place. Is he mad? Who is mad about this assassin? If you do not like M-i-L. She rented this movie for rent and pretend you enjoy it. I promise to tell you that you have exactly the bad taste and I promise you that her son / daughter is married to a person below his family standard.
