I have seen many horror films in my time, they are absurdly bad, but this trash is also reduced to me. This film was very angry and angry when I tried to write it on my head correctly about this film. Now, after I watch it, I understand - sort of - what's going on and why, but it's a lot confusing to watch the movie while you're looking. Yes, thanks to any kind of unwanted violence, its characters ("The road belongs to me ... me!"), And the nakedness "plot" adequately for us, but still wanting to leave this picture, you no longer wanted and like a puppy left in the side of the road side taken. Blech.
