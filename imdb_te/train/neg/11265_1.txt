There are quite a few moments in my life, I was frustrated and disappointed. <br /> <br /> One of these is sitting by royalty aluminum. <br /> There are warning signals. No Premiership (even stars did not want to attend) and reviews in magazines. <br /> <br /> I hope I'm sleeping because there is nothing in the film. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in the movie. The story is blind. When I portrayed the main character of the film, I was happy at one point when I was disappointed with my disappointment and realized that he was not really killing my pleasure. All I participated in the film was executed for this aggression. <br /> <br /> There are some positive elements, mainly spontaneous moments humor. For example, the main character, a certain toilet in a toilet cubicle, has a need to relieve the man in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears for some unknown reasons. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ranch Aluminum: Unfortunately, waste and reregional ones are only for those who want to be tortured.
