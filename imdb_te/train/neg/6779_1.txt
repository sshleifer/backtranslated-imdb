There is a high level of expectation when you sit to watch a comedy with Kare Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walton and Werner Klempare. When the film is directed by Stanley Donnen, the comic touch is very clear, Dam Anchase, Bedazeld and Chardie. The first five minutes, or, seems that might have met those estimates then ?? Nothing. <br /> <br /> A new modern relative new entrepreneur Suzie Parker is often criticized for his acting or not being one and not as a minor comedy in the movie, but the great Cory Grant is also often flat and wood, Parker is unfair. Good luck to this thick, frustrating, and totally nonsensical script, like the bright light of Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day, pulls it out and pulls it down with the interest and tolerance of the viewer. The rest of the cast, particularly Ray Walthon, is trying to breathe life for some life, but the terrible script is not beyond the Renaissance. <br /> <br /> The film was disappointing to pull half the heartfelt laughter from the audience believing in the final moments. <br /> <br /> The film is not only a major disappointment at all levels.
