This is the biggest pile I have ever seen. Do not rent! The filmmakers must be a band without constructing another film. It starts with a plot and does not matter anymore. I think I would rather see the paint dry so much of looking at the cover. The actors were terrified, the plot deteriorated rapidly, and filmed to perform a lot of work. It's not a good thing to say about this bad image. If you rent this movie, you will waste your money. I really enjoyed the movies of the National Lampoon, but this was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to work, learn to produce, direct. I think this will make a hole in this film made for the rental cost and the lost money.
