I went to the film's screening and a few moments of laughing at me, there were some big drawbacks. The first real-life that first attempts to find love in LA provides divorced comic strikes. What is the morphs into a depressing, arrogant and unfunny romp by film director's love life and career life history. Jokes are worn thoroughly and you will find that you can not take care of the dates of this person suddenly. The funniest director is a very annoying and heavily flawed character simultaneously and we want to be concerned.
