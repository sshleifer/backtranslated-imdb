I saw this last week after the DVD was made cheap. I wanted to see from time to time, it was difficult to look like a plot boundary. My disappointment is very good. I thought the main actor was very readable. This kind of episode requires Johnny Depp's The Ninth Gate (which is almost entirely shot), but I do not always have TV budgets to expand this acting capacity. I also thought I was working only to remind myself that in the direction of chaos and dull, the Carpenter did not make a good image from the Madness of Madness. For the story - well, I was disappointed there as well! <br /> There is no way to meet my expectation that I expect, but the payment and the explanation is poor, and finally the opposite of the film he says. <br /> <br /> You can say that he is one of the main actors of AICC, and he loves his movie, but I have a better result from such a good start. <br /> <br /> I took the DVD to the store. That day!
