I'm sure this is a minority opinion. "The Hurt Locker" has won "Best Picture" awards from critics' groups earlier this year. However, I did not like it, it was not hard to sit down. <br /> There is little plot and little character development. They disarm bombs, fight, and disarm more bombs. It's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the camera stops constantly when moving. It is a recent passion in filmmaking and is considered to be more real because it has a cheap, documentary look. <br /> <br /> I usually do not care for war films and "The Hurt Locker" is no exception. But critics would like it if you do not have to take my position for it.
