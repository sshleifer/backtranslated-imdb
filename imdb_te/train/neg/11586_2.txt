A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child <br /> <br /> It's a bad image. Do not fend off any. I love the series and I think Freddy is always the best character in horror movies. <br /> <br /> I can not help in being a favorite man but this movie is normal. <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to build an interesting story and strong characters. Now they just come up. They do not even try. They are hoping for some more easy dollars. <br /> <br /> The story does not attract your attention. <br /> <br /> <br /> Alice is now pregnant. Freddie's baby is coming back through dreams. In the beginning we learn that Alice will stop his mother. That's it. <br /> <br /> This story is slowly progressing, it becomes quite boring after a few minutes of bad words and awful acting. In fact it's only scary thing, acting, since deaths are not even a little cool. <br /> <br /> The characters do not work harder for us. <br /> <br /> The girls are not as attractive as possible. The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I saw good actors in school plays. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox will bring some classes. She has beautiful, sexy and some talent. But the thing does not let her shine. <br /> <br /> Stephen Hopkins's work is somewhere close to the magnificent direction of Renny Harlin in Dream Dream. <br /> <br /> Deal Child is another unexpected sequel. This is the kind of film that gives the horror series a bad name. <br /> <br /> The end of the scary Freddie once. It's very sad to see him now. Not a clown funny. A bad joke. Goodbye Freddy.
