I liked the first half hour of the film. The obvious junior romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer is pretty cool and I want to see it happen inevitable between them. However, after Ingrid's fianc√© turned home, it completely fell apart. Instead of romance and charm, we see some annoying dopey parallel characters emerge who destroy the image. The sort of companion from the Old Love Boat episode, like the subclot, was stupid to compete for the caretaker's son and the attachment of the military attachment. The charm and elegance of the first part of the film leads to Dopius. After the film was changed to the domestic estate (as in the other film), it was a clear attempt to succeed Renoir with the rules of the film. I'm not a huge fan of gaming rules, but Ileana and her men appreciate the artistic and nuances of the original films.
