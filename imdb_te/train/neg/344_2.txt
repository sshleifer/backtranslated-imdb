Please tell me about this movie. I did not see this movie because the plot, I look for the sexy sex scenes. In fact, the film is a very horrific god, I look at Tracy's divine body (Mandy Shaffer) and turn to pure pleasure and crush my eyebrows for the plot disaster. <br /> <br /> The first scene of the spoiler warning is already cringing to me .. You see a cute girl approach, something painting something by laxide, then approach a pretty girl and ask her to be painted next. When they were finished, they showed each other what they did ... and she filmed the woman in a choreographer, which she sees the infra of the lake. What kind of screw-ball director is making this mistake? In another scene, Tracy kills his master's girlfriend, he kills him with sneezing, and then she swims, and no one in town's police suspects her. I mean hello? MANDY Wear a Glow DID SHE? God Worm Prince After that, when it's around Mandy, the worst comes off, "Chilling" has a sound effect, it sounds like a cat in a hey fit. It is also a real pity that this film of Rosanna Arquette is. She's sorry for having a star in this super-low budget soft-romantic no-brainer. The same goes for Jurgen Prochko, which is also a misfortune to star in the film. All in all, 2/10.
