I do not know where to start, but there are a lot of penalties on the title of a very bad Valentine. I will say this. Here is a picture that takes me long for the complexity of Valentine cards that we want to give in elementary school. Those with Batman are "You're Super Crime-Fighting Valentine!" You know. <br /> <br /> Valentine is a short-term reference to irony, one of the few horror movies in recent years has reduced the screen effect. The villain is the omniscient and the near barrier. Leaders are easily scared by the people running around the corners and holding them tight on their shoulders "heyyadleftphitikotbitbind!" <br /> <br /> This affordable plot follows many childhood friends, now they grow and are very curved. If the film does not let them do anything else, they stand around and wait until the masked stalker kills them all. Jeremy Melton, who claimed to be an unknown incubator, was constantly rejected by women and was beaten to high school. Near Valentine's Day, women get frightened cards of fright about their doom. Melton appears to be a clear suspect. With many roles warning, there is only one problem, and in thirteen years Melton has been able to see his look and feel pretty. <br /> <br /> Insert the gap that frightened here. Everyone suspects! <br /> Here's one problem. To have a sense of suspense when looking at Valentin, you must accept a reality that is capable of becoming a high school and as David Bournez. The intellectuals do not turn into the angel when they grow up, they turn into older, bolar intellectuals. He is not a terrible actor, but the script, less than four authors, gives him and the rest of the cast to do nothing but scream and out. Denise Richards (the greatest actress in Hollywood to star in Bellevuev) was particularly exploited; The most insulting is not the need to blame her for bathing just before a crucial suspense scene. Self-Note: Always take a bathing suit to a Valentine's Day party. Just because of February you can not feel like taking a little dip. <br /> Slasher in Valentine's dresses in the toe from the head with the cherub's mask. The problem here is the number two. The filmmakers apparently thought it was a disturbing image that had anyone's head whacking people in the face with these hot faces. Plain and simple, it's not. Instead, a man with a mask that masks his entire face, including his eyes and ears, moves his chins or charts without burning his shins. Again, if Manmad kills the things that he can do, perhaps he can travel with tears and his eyes are in his hands. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad, the killer is not sure; Last "turn" more "huh?" "Ha!" If you do not hold your head tight, you will stop, then you will groan, and then search for the nearest departure. Do not see this movie. Whether you're alone on Valentine's Day, anything or something you want to do. You will be happy.
