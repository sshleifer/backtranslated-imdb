I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. Granted, it takes Shakespeare and interest or a certain opinion. But this film has exceeded any barrier of tall soliloquies, which can prevent many from preserving Shakespeare based story. <br /> <br /> The flatness of the biggest roadblack characters for this product is flatness. Often during the interaction of the character, who is the harder to spot who is the lines of who. Of course, I believe this movie is dubbed in English. <br /> <br /> They have received voice actors who can add a little more drama to these classic and literary lines. <br /> <br /> The movie is harder to estimate than the previous one, perhaps age and very low budget. Still, it is totally painful and boring. If you press on the hamlet, help yourself and read the book again. 1/10
