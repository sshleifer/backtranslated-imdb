I saw this movie last night and after a couple of beers realized I was really looking at it when this film came out of me only giggle. In a word, it is unfunny. Unfunny. I totally believe trivia tidbit about jack black apology for this rubbish. I can not believe that Barry Levinson did not tassel this script when he read the first page. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I have seen more than ten minutes in length. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, the horse "Corky," is actually just as ridiculous as it is by simply being a character in this film.
