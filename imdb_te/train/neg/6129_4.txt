From the film and the Strong Man judging, the same year, I will put Harry Langdon on the list of great silent screen makers. There just is not enough. Perhaps as he was going to develop his style, his first big wins made him vigilant by taking it very hard. In any case, his tricks are reminiscent of all the great funny men, but he does not have Keaton's acrobatic skills and Lloyd's amazing ingenuity. He also weakens his own personality by dressing and walking as Chaplin's trumpet character. His trademarks are a moodless innocence, alertness, and a kangaroo, a tendency to battling his eyes or responding to a catastrophe by folding his lips with his peepfinger's tip. In the Langdon films, comedy attempts to overcome Vimini or innocent paths or physicality by throwing various obstacles in his way, thereby throwing on the tornado stones, two-four-four or deading bands by lifting a foot, and they come down to him. In this story, the son of a Schumacher, who joined a cross-country walking race to promote the footwear of the rival company, succeeds to succeed. Big Three did nothing here.
