The film starts very slowly, but when the action is finally launched, it's a little more to follow. I could not understand why some events were taking place and many events took place before it was explained and they were confused. The only thing that can really happen is that it has a lot of blood / hole, but there are no special effects. Blood looks like Cool-Aid. Skin tearing like someone is the foundation in the pile of sticks. Again, it has an enthusiastic feel to the story, and the author did not take it long enough. I feel as if the effects are better and more time taken in the script it might be a good movie. I honestly wish I did not recover, because I was not gore but I think I have wasted my life for 90 minutes. If you like a lot of Gothi movies, this is for you, if not, stay away.
