Unfortunately, the combination of one another in the effects of special effects has not been fully understood by keeping the crazy and equally nonsense plot and inadequate, clutch screenplays. <br /> <br /> The characters, thought and action sequences (especially the lift shaft!) - the only impressive feature here is the film's impressive special effects. However, this is just the same special effect and will happen again, and death will also be done at the end of the film. I'm hoping before looking at the man in the hole that it's invisible, it's not the original original, the newer and more interesting. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> This film is almost as impressive as the mound of clearest piles up is not too long before it becomes a very bloody blood bath and mass of the film. <br /> <br /> On all of this, Kevin Bacon does a pretty useless work and his assistant cast rarely make their best effort. Good points may be a serious Jerry Gold Smith score (but it does not compete with his better efforts), thermal imagery and special effects are very interesting. <br /> <br /> I tried to give this film to ten, but the effects would increase the merit of the man in a row with a line. <br /> <br />
