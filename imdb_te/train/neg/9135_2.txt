Oh, Sam Marwick, we know you tried very hard. This is your glowing work, a shining example of the rest of us for you is definitely worth nomination in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (the state on your 1998 Web site). Alas, it's good to be silent rather than to be silent and talk all the doubts and talk. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> With Ben or Arthur, you will do that. <br /> <br /> The film critics are really strangely looking at each new scene, while bizarrely summarizing the lack of teaching or education. This may be the best friend of the film to be this madness of the story. Ironically, homosexuals Ben and Arthur tried to marry, in the shadow of Vermont's finest palm trees, so far to fly across the country. But, all of this type of blood is just as important for blood. Then more blood, and more and more blood. I mean, the last third part of the film should have at least $ 20 with fake blood. <br /> <br /> The film features a complete technical gaffe. Composing music from sound to sound, which features a mess bass note placed on a keyboard, which will fit into whatever media you see. <br /> <br /> This is not true, some good amateur shows are wasted here. <br /> <br /> I made five people in the movie rentals or driven the poor souls (like me) to watch this picture. Sadly, we do not laugh with you.
