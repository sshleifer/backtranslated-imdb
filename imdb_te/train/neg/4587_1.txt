<br /> <br /> Similar artworks have been left behind for artworks such as "The Banman Man", "The Doon Masters" and "Merlin". "And fourth, this is going to be the only deadly movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of modern cinema has two interchangeable parts, much cheered by the crazy and contrived plot. And forced to reduce the resistance to survival, and quantum physics were their new It's a group of people who talk about how Kyu supports the pseudo-philosophy, usually if Enya and Kenny G is starting your day with you, this movie is for you If you have a group of people who know how to have fun and happiness, then this picture <br /> If you do not know what to do, ID thing, it was full of cheap weddings, pink heart-effects of the camera, the computer-generated shiny sparkles, and other assorted silliness. This is anywhere near a theater release to the public is a mystery to me. I guess this is what Kenny G will do for you too. The film has expanded with cheese GCI, but I would like you or me to produce over-the-counter video editing software on our own computer, but it's just so ridiculous, because the script _obviously_ is written by someone with any writing experience . All the characters and conversations are not cumbersome and confusing, but "writers" felt when they had to undermine every part of everything, information on everything, or instead of faulty information, your voice. Well, given the target audience, an idea is not too bad. The main character, for example, spent half the film popping pills. Apparently, however, it felt she was not convincing enough, so she takes small white pills when she feels she has at least two of the dialogues in, across the crowd, which indicates her anti-anxiety pills, especially in the event that she could not connect to the overacted pain and suffering. Acting ... well, I have seen good acting in Ed Wood films, and not, it's not an exaggeration. Heck, while I was 12 years old, I had a much more stimulating acting. <br /> <br /> This story is just a man or woman by their own fact of participating in the experience of life in quantum physics here and there, with a bunch of coincidences, a whimsical combination of cookie scientists, cookie doctors and self-declared spirituality Provided "explanation" for what has been created. The reality is, you see, a potential-field of a group of different possibilities, and the Observer will be set only on the stone after selecting it. More than one Observer is not what they say, but who cares again? Listen to Enya, meditate, and note, and you will be a god and nobody refuses to think about silly and antique stuff, such as complex ideas, logical opus etc. People get trapped in their paths, "paradigm shift" and "go down the rabbit hole". <br /> <br /> The Hedelberg uncertainty theory is alternate realities, parallel universes and the evidence for them. <br /> <br /> Speaking about rabbit holes, the analogy expanded into the film. All these people continue talking about going down hare holes. I do not know what they say, but what I mean is some kind of pornography. Actually, the image is _extremely_ anti-gender. <br /> <br /> However, talking heads speak, the main character achieves cognitive and enlightenment by showing the hearts on his body with the magical marker. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "I'm sleeping. <br> /> <br /> "I thought I was unreal, it was very real for me, I actually thought it was true, it was true. <br /> <br /> "Some people are talking about the spirituality of Quantum physics. <br /> <br />" What should a person take for a consent? It's just a thought. <br /> When she's looking at the mirror, "I hate you! I hate you! You're hating me!" Fat, you're right! I've got you! "- The main character, fat and ugly photographer.
