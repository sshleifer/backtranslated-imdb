Now I loved Bela Lugoshi, do not make me wrong, he is a film that is never interesting, but he certainly did his share of clunkers. <br /> <br /> Lugosi has a doctor who has his medical license. Lorenz plays a doctor who is pulling up for a detailed reason. But his wife is experimenting to keep young and beautiful. She is 70-80 years old and Lugosi has given her a bride at the altar, but if they give birth to some sweet smelling material, Lugosi and his assistants steal the body on the way to some bodyguard, Taken to his laboratory, where some sort of suspended animation or a cataclysmic position. Then the body of Lugosi's wife and beauty.Wukosi needles sticks or he breaks out the brides but we never really see where something really restored his wife when we ever stolen bridges rushed into their bodies somewhere in the neck, and then the needle. Because of Lugosi's age you will scream with pain when the wife is screaming back to his princess. Lagosini in his laboratory is the only good thing about this film .... the weird old hug and her two options are ... A young man who is quietly looking quietly with his fellow mate Snooking brides and a small little dwarf who loves the other .... a little guy , Politically correct in today's world. Night Three This type of building is up and sleeping in the frustration of the lounge. <br /> <br /> In this film, the horrified assistants of Lagosi, never mentioned many things in the film. <br /> <br /> A female reporter is one of the most common brides in all the stolen brides to find out where all the stolen brides are going. There is a rare orchid found in them. So she asks around her and a world renowned orchid expert near the developer of this special orchid It is said. This expert is creepy to Dr.Lorenz.She quickly tracks him down and the horror hits his little home. The police do not know where they are at this point, but the journalist is all duty duty after all. <br /> <br /> It seems that Lugosi films have always had unnecessary silly plot lines. The whole thing is awesome. Did you know that I developed the orchid? Daoh! <br /> <br /> Then young people also revealed that the bride is not the work for the work, because the lounge would place kidnapping brides from the heavily guarded churches for his experiments and all the attention and newspaper highlights? Why not wear a street prostitute like a typical weirdro slander? This clunker reminds me very much of another Lugosi stinker, "Devil bot" .... same crazy plot and bad acting and the same crazy 'reporter gets the bad guy. <br /> But lugosi is always good - he is creepy and bad enough to keep at least enough interest to keep you looking at him. Reporter Play Woman is just a terrible actor .... She has no emotion, she's just a machine gun. <br /> <br /> When it comes to good actors it's great for everyone. <br /> <br /> If the subject is only for fans of Bela Lugosi, the film may have been known to have made terrible images even though he was a dog. However, if he gave it to him, if he gave all of his bad, and all his bad intensity and bad performances, then he was right - the horror fans would always love for the beluga Lugosi. He is in front of the camera.We have to give you two f ** ks, Bela.
