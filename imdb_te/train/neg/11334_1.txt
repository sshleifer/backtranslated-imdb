Another bland here is the European story in which they explode the religion of their country. (This anesthetic filmmakers are merciless.) Here we see the brutal explosion of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I am not Catholic). <br /> <br /> The film won an Academy Award, along with a foreign film. The story claims that Catholics and religious beliefs are very weak. One of the main characters is a priest and he asks about more food than anything else. He was an idiot but nothing. <br /> <br /> Also, some Phool fool, who has been playing a man who corrupts his religion, can also marry one of the four daughters in the story. The daughters dropped a "seminary" student (he says he is studying for six years, but says he is an agnostic). <br /> <br /> It is a disgraceful and another glorious example of the secular-progressive superstition of a worldwide business (not just Hollywood) film business.
