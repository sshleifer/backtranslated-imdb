Shortly after the release, I had enough luck to meet George Paul (who had signed him with my DS: TMOB poster), and why he decided to make a "Camp" film. Before he could answer, two studio flaks intercepted me and described how the studio was "well aware" and how "no images would take seriously". I read a Bantam reprint for a few years as a friend (Blackhawk and his band of the Camicon in 1970s recalled that I had been with him for a few years) and had more hopes than what we came from <br /> <br /> Flax insisted that any major expedition could be seriously organized, Thus, 'Camp' is the only way to do it. Many fans jumped on my side, and Paul listened to his best. <br /> <br /> At the end of the small incident, Paul came to us and apologized, and he could do much better. <br /> <br /> <p> After a year after Paul's death, Starbucks and Lucas dock Savage have easily proven that they have the next major film rights ... it's not for Flax. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <br /> </ p> </ p> Dacaw Savage is still on the screen, and Indiana Jones can withstand unwanted comparisons with unhealthy information, but it is all intensely and harder to get back the greatness that we expect from the first American superhero. <br /> SIDENOTES: Yes, there is the second script for the ARCHENEMY of EVIL, and it is very serious. Yes, footage was fired at once, but mostly shots and fewer actors. And, yes, there's a sheet of _is_Ron Ely leaping on a brick wall and a specially constructed bronze pistol explodes something on his shoulder. Ely wearing the duster on the white shirt down button with a bronze tie, and the words "DOC SAVAGE: EVIL ARCHENEMY ... COMING ON THE COMING!" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows Studio Flax with San Diego for a meeting with George Paul in 1975, suppress idiots on their heads and call them idiots. At that time, they were working dorkknobs and fu frosts in stripes and bagged canvas pants, and carrying paramount portfolios.
