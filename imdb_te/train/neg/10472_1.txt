I'm in trouble with Casper van Dim. Words can not describe, how terrible they are to the film. You try to explain it with the feeling of horrible acting, fierce dialogue, clogged conditions and so you are forced to eat beliefs and practices from the Trinity Broadcasting Network. A weak attempt to show Hollywood is a movie that is fun and has a deep, religious message related to it. They have failed miserably. This is the worst thing I have seen in a long time.
