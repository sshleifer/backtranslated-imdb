... I thought I would throw a few words about William McNamara. It's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours if you want to see him in his tighty-whits - it's clear he's pump for this character and he looks pretty darn them - or less. There is an extended sequence in a cave, where he must turn to his eyes. His hands were covered by his hands and there was a nice bit to chase after Miss Elenac in the only cup. William McNamara has a bit of bathing, but he is a nice, liberal, some broke. Moreover, there is a moment when he's out of bed, if you pause the action at the right moment, the whole enchilada can be seen. If you are inclined to do that, and come on, there are half of the people who choose to watch a movie about Navy men on a "road trip". I like to thank Dennis Hopper for inappropriate dance to his equal opportunity. Can William McNamara act? I know heck.
