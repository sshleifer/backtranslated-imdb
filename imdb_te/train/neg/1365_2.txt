The legal gray area in Love Crimes contributes to up to 10% of the appeal of the film; The other 90% said it was a bad bad nose. Seen Young's performance as a district attorney is a gross description of the wood. With her blonde suits and excessive hair gel, Young men do a good job of convincing her devotion to the men who hate her. Why would she want to take a different prostitute so why can she arrest the cops trying to capture them? This hatred also haunts an extravagant photographer against her, giving her an acceptable thrill and driving force for women behind this bad movie. Going from adolescence to frigid to nudity is a little lower in interest, but the ostrich stroke stands next to a lake. She does love crimes worth her dramatically and rave rental fee about self-hatred and sexual frustration, but there's all downhill from there and out. Although she has sought to bring Patrick Berg's role for justice, her police skills are totally avoided by her own tired pose and passionately. Patrick Berggin makes a good job as a thick social science; If it works in sleeping with the anemi, it works as hell. But I can not help but wonder if Young brings the film friction with his sliminess to lack power and unrecognizable energy. I'm guessing it and the result is a "thriller" thrills that are completely bad and yet funny.
