This video was dirty in Britain and allowed in November last year without cuts. <br /> <br /> It has playboy playmath of the month of October 1979, Ursula Buchfelner. The opening between the boufflehner and snowy forest pictures moves backwards. I do not know what that purpose is. <br /> <br /> Laura (Butchfeller) was kidnapped in the forest for ransom. Peter (Al Claire - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and deliverance. However, one of the kidnappers (Antonio di Cabo) takes time to spend time, and another (Werner Pochat) is curiously curled. <br /> <br /> The ransom goes to hell and runs in the lava forest. Will Peter save her before dinner? Oh, yes, in this forest there are cannibals. Why do you think this is a nasty video? Muriel Montes Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) appeared on the kidnappers' boat. Montoise is very comfortable cloth. Peter leaves them alone, gets out alone, and finds Laura now. They do not pass sexual lust time, and look at approaching danger. Guts, anyone? Better fight between Peter and Naked Devil (Burt Altman). <br /> <br /> If you look at the movie, "Blood, Beheaded, Dummies, Complete Frenzy, The High Priest of the Prophet (Alain Mess) and the Line, Let Her Heart Ever Die."
