I recently saw the first Guinea Pig film The Devil's experiment, and I have to admit that I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film will surely be included in the list of "Noststed" films and maybe I'll expect more because of the hype. <br /> If true, I do not rate it. <br /> I believe that the beginning text is true ("I found this tape ..."), which is a bit disturbed, and I'm thinking of it. I learned that it is not true, even without knowing the truth. <br /> <br /> The girl's reaction to what happened to her is not just what they do. She should throw ashamed. She does not mean that she is not true. I do not want to see that it is real but if she is more convinced in her acting, the film is more disturbing. <br /> And then there are brutal scenes: nothing has not affected me until the scalpel in hand up at all. Heat oil, maggots and innards just do not bother me. I'm not saying "hard"; <br /> <br /> The scalpel laughs at me but the hammer hand is hand rubber just by hand. And the final scene for the eye was a little bit of success, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> This film is about twenty o'clock, or maybe I'm frustrated. <br /> <br /> This is a workable thing to do when watching a loop as advanced art installation and removing characters. , Story etc. and just leave it to violence, it works on certain levels. <br /> <br /> When I saw a guinea pig with my wife, I thought it was "just a picture." About Fas. Why I see these pictures and why they discussed my reasons but also the desire to influence the film. She told me that no film could have hurt her, and she challenged me to do it correctly. <br /> <br /> "It is a movie that is more disturbing than any movie ever.
