The film was named for the most successful films in the history of history of Switzerland, which shook my head! It's true, but at the same time pitiful. <br /> <br /> Antonio Kerry (Michael Koch) forces the army to abandon his military training. The church is married to Laura Morty (Mia Agater). <br /> <br /> Some actors have been drunk from some recruits and are not actually different from rocks. Melanie Vinegar plays her role as her Michael Bluntchi, and I personally recognize her as an actress. <br /> <br /> The storyline consists of comedy combined with an unrefined romance. The romance episode is a lot worse, and the comedy piece is not funny at all, it's just a little bit less and does not change across the entire movie. It's not for those who are looking for a fun comedy, it's funny for the preperorcents of 12-13 year olds. <br /> <br /> <br /> Cool! Stealing? Cool! <br /> <br /> If you want a good deal of Swiss RS, make sure you can not stop your military training, and do not even expect too much! <br /> <br /> I'm 10 stars, because Marco Rima is very funny during his screen. A hell of a very screen time
