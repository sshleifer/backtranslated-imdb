This installment of horror masters is terrible. Apparently, Mr. Carpenter needs to learn a thing or two about the dough and good, acceptable dialogue. There are times when I literally scream for something happening on TV. He probably intends to build a suspense, but Carpenter has to take a little forward to the movement of his (or his son) musical movement. How many times the girl says, "Oh no, I'm not this baby!" And "Oh, what is it coming here"? Carpenter takes on things from improved movies (the assassination of 13 and the Thing) and throws them here in order to recognize and appreciate his trademark style. Here's a real suspense and power. This is as though he is sleeping through the filmmaking process. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> For good Carpenter movies, tried and true lyrical things - Thing, Halloween, and they Live. For best masters of horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: Family, Genefer, and Dreams in Witch House.
