I can not really think of any riddiming features of this utterly bad description of Asimov than art direction. Forget the incredible performance and extensive plot-holes from product placement disaster, Will Smith. It's just ridiculous and not painful to see. Even the action is boring. MTVI inspired product values ​​and totally bad conversations targeted many young children. <br /> <br /> We find the Blender, Minority Report or Dark City (by the same director). It really is in the bottom 100 list. Really awful.
