Did you know when you see a collection of older, video tape movies, you only see it once or twice, and do not remember if it's time to get to see them? Alibi is one of those films; I found it long ago, and I decided to give it the opportunity as well. I'm not sure if I'm happy with my decision ... On the one hand, this film is really bad, the other is now another free tape for me ... Yes, you get it. The plot is speculative and not realistic. Pacing is bad. Acting is good, but it is not really surprising, the two main characters appear to be former Soap-opera stars ... they are used to overturn. The characters are written poorly. The film also managed to screw up the easy curse way to impress me (by film): court scenes. There is no cardboard-thin letter or any emotion on it. The film does not have any riddiming features ... dialogue is also bad. The thing is so funny that it's so funnier. And one thing that looked like a rating of 1/10: Comic relief of many clocks and stereotypes (though unexpected). I did not pay much attention to the film, but every time I saw on the screen, there was something to laugh. One last note: I thought, like a line summary, "I can not work with Tori Spelling," but I think everyone knows this, so I'm looking for more information and selected for the present. In all, a completely bad movie, but if you have nothing else, it's on TV. Some are good to laugh, if you sit by it. 3/10
