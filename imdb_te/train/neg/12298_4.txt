But, fortunately enough, it has some compensation features like spectacular gore effects, a joyous musical score and some awesome casting options, although the "Witchery" 80's might be quite absurd and lamentably scriptive horror movie. Honestly the screenplay does not have a meaning, but Linda Blair (with a bad hairstyle) filmed another girl with evil powers and a hookah photographer (who has not been cast) constantly bloody voodoo, pierced ship lips, upside down, vicious flames and overly-used but pure creepy tune. Eight random people are integrated into a deserted holiday resort island on the Massachusetts coast. The young couple had to investigate the dark history of the place; The dysfunctional family (who is the father of Linda Blair who is pregnant and where he is) is reopening the hotel and the typical female architect is just tagged for casual sex. Will they stay the night at Ramshakel Hotel and suddenly force the previous landlord? Who is a black actress or something ever black dress? It starts taking them in different ways. Everything is related to the introductory scene, which shows a woman jumping out of a window. However, the plot is of little importance in an Italian horror franchise that began as an informal spin-off of "The Evil Dead." The atmosphere is occasionally undisturbed and makeup films are undoubtedly the most exalted aspect of the whole movie. A chimney is something arrogant and unsettling about looking at a protective woman who is hanging upside down and waiting to get fried.
