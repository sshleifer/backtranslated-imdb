I went to see the film yesterday and although I did not have much hope in this film, I still am disappointed! I believe that watching this movie is 96 minutes in my life ... It's bad !!! The storyline is insulting and acting is terrible (though it has big names like Uma Thurman). The film relied on its special effects ... but they did not effect me personally. I honestly did not see iDid and I strongly warned everyone who saw the film. It's a waste of money and you'll only be disappointed afterward. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself, go and see this movie ... you regret it lol!
