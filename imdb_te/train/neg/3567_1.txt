Father Lewis (Dale Midkiff), Mother Rachel (Denis Crosby), 10-year-old Eileen (Blaze Berdal and 3-year-old Gauge (Micko Hughes) go to this beautiful home - down the road 90 seconds or more down the road! Neighbors are a wonderful place) They feel at home ... Show a pet burial place for children to fill their pet <br /> <br /> "Definition Spoiler ** The novel is good by Stephen King - it's a holy ground, but for the long time, you have developed the characters and situations that have taken care of what happened. The camera camera (I knew he was a duplicate but still repulsive) was ultimately damaged and in his casket fun (I was wondering how 3 year old she was able to hang herself); a ghostly jogger (do not ask) tries to help the family for no reason ... Every one of these pictures It will work audiences to shake the gruesome death or violence towards your face. This will shock you. ** END SPELERS ** <br /> There is no help in acting. Midkife's father is just as terrible - he's cute and hard but completely blank. Crosby is not improved. Two children are just suffering. Guinness will save this picture with good acting in his film. <br /> <br /> The film is a great deal of logic for audiences and the characters are very stupid (especially at the midfiff). This film (inexplicably) hit a huge box office in 1989, leading to a more deadly sequel in 1992. I later saw in the theater and how the audience encouraged violence and I was scared of what I saw. Unhealthy repulsive horror film. <br /> It sounds like everything and does not get worse Ramones title song !!!!!! ("I do not burial in a pet graveyard"). Really beyond belief.
