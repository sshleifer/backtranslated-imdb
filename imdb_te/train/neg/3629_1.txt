(Follow different spoilers) <br /> <br /> Jean Kelly. Georges was not a guitarist, and he was sometimes criticized for being too young and un-french. She is not Leslie Coron, sometimes criticized for a very green show. <br /> <br /> No, it is definitely Jean Kelly. Is very cherished and a penniless artist in Paris, something about his screen personality convincing frolicking content with very small and old women and painting on the streets, content to keep him off facing indefinitely critics. That's what he's done in the Rain and so influential in other movies' SINGIN he has played prestigious, focused characters. Jerry Mulligan falls in love with a lovely European place, with Kelly walking with a Kelly, a relative of Tommy Albright in Brighgan, and an innocent woman with its virtues. Other than that, Jerry did not like the poor Dodge Tommy. It's a different thing about this film. Jerry is sometimes even worse for Milo's Cod, and Lee's. When he first visits the club, he pulls a dirty trick to dance with him. She pulls an even dirtier trick to get her phone number when sitting down again. When she calls her the next day, she takes a queue to fall into her office. And all across this all it's clear she wants nothing with him. When she began to laugh her jokes at the perfume shop, it was reliable about Milo's interest in her paintings. He looks good and fun, but why should she separate her when she comes to Henry? <br /> This is partially unpleasant due to actress. While playing the role of Lee's, Judy Garland claims that she is angry and angry with Jerry. If she played Cydis Charisse, one would admire her guts. But when she plays Leslie Caron in her first timer she looks and acts like a shy, vulnerable youngster, and as a result Jerry is just like a creep. The other two young actors have been selected when the story of the two young pedophiles of the old two young men thrown themselves out of their loving commitments, although they have chosen these other actors (although I personally will solve them by changing the main character). Jean Kelly is not only a few years older than Guitar and Foche, he is aged enough to be Kouron's father. <br /> <br /> Shortly, I might not want them to be a young joke-relaxing type of jersey, usually in musical aid roles ... eg Small McDonald's or Bobby Van in Small Town Girl, but somebody loves them. Follow the lise and make it feel playful without harm; The person who is truly happy in the chaplainsque hole-in-wall; Anyone who is joking and unlike someone is against the satirical illusion of Oscar Levant. It probably made the ballot seem less spectacular. <br /> <br /> It gave Gershivin a vibrant voice. <br /> <br /> I think Jenny does not like Kelly. I love him. He has more feelings in his movies, just this person (well, some more). I did not deny AAIP, either; It has good points like art direction. And Leslie Caron, who is really lovely though despite her sensibility, and looks really like she just stepped from a painting. Georges Gutari is a fine job and is my favorite figure in his "Stareway to Paradise". Nina Foch is beautiful and touching and should end with some people. But Jerry Mulligan is not. I do not like her.
