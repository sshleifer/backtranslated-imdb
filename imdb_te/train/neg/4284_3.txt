Jason Lee's Peck is back! If you're looking for, look no further. Otherwise, good move ... <br /> But about the movie. Clich√©s are plenty, a bit beaten shot, but with exceptionally exotic combat scenes (JKD used) and bad acting and cheap effects. He lets poor people appear to have pain throughout the film, and does not wonder. Not a pleasant return. <br /> <br /> The film does not even cut the B-movie - obviously, the whitening blonde Ratzinger-Wannabe is a bad guy in Germany, but no ungrateful sex scene or a single exploitation shots. None. Zip. Nada. There is a general feeling to be included in Starship Troopers 2's essentially nourish scenes (see the outstanding part of classical film excellence in my comments, see our upcoming review in our minded sequel ...). I have received the feeling that the writer will get his revenge on the subject - so I can not get much of the film's "plot" or anything about it. <br /> <br /> There is one thing for this film - no Jean-Claude :)
