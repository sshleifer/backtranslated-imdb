<br /> <br /> Do you want to see a documentary about destroying his own life and abducting everyone around him? They are in many forms. But do you ever want to see if you can ever be able to do anytime, despite the appreciation of a artistic "genius"? Well you can just capture a camera and find a person in any local scene (I know they are everywhere and I can not follow the local scene) or you can save the trouble by watching this trip. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the premise, it is good and honestly, that film producers who are considered to be one of the difficulties in documenting are not sure. We have prepared two teams to follow Brian Jamestown Massacre, Anton Lead, and The Dandy Warhols, Courtney's leadership. I heard of Dandy Warhols before watching this film ... Brian Jamestown is not the massacre. Why? From this documentary perspective, because the Brian Jamestown Mascakor's intergraph disfancers did not really deny the ability to make them in the music industry. However, it is more about Anton and his insanity that can become an analysis of these two different bands and how it can be successful. <br /> <br /> Anton is a "genius" because he is playing rock music because he really "understands the evolution of music" ... because he plays a very rock music of different music. "His music is a post-modern retro but not of the future "Because it's rock music, he wanted to get out of the" revolution "through the Rock Revolution, okay, let's look forward to twenty minutes and it One of the first kids I care to look for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Anton's talent, as the documentary itself shows, is because we do not have time to really focus on the compilation of the two hours of the 2000s quarter, Genius ", social-maniac defeat, two jumps a jerk and he's really great music I do not know whether he did or not, because there is enough time to prove its documentary, and I know that we are talking about some self-centered bad twist around the country, calling himself a god of music and not back. Why is that even trouble seeing? Individuals like Anton are not eligible for what they want, after a failure for the hope and appreciation of all different individuals, and especially for the lost potential. This film works like a two-hour tough cut VH1 specification: he goes about the music, but it's about film and attention. Look at the person, see how he works, let's see how he works, let's see how he is trying to create a controversy because he can not be marketing. <br /> <br /> I am honestly the only character in this film is Joel, and Joel is the only person who's funny, because someone in this documentary. This is probably because he is a tambourine man. The rest of them are "rock stars"! They deserve our attention, and appreciation, and interest, and engagements! They were there to "protect rock and roll". Do you recall when White Stripes "wanted to save rock and roll"? Yes, because Anton is, and it's not me to say (anton) an inspiration for them selfish. " What load People like Anton have forgotten the best. The documentary describes why mainstream music is discouraged - because music executives have to deal with people like Anton and ultimately dismiss their support behind those who are safe and passionate. Thanks a lot, Anton. Your locks have wasted music for everyone you touched, and there is a contradiction. <br /> When "when he's" about people who are different about Anton and if he's really a genius, this documentary still shows that it will be reduced. <br /> - PolarisDiB
