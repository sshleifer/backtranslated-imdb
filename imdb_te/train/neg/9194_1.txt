Okay, first, I'm a huge zombie cinema fan. I love all of Romero's films and I am absolutely delighted to make Dan's back in the dead. So when I hear every critic in this film, I'm still positive. I mean, the critics have resorted to Resident Evil, and enjoyed it if I was for the fact that it's a fun zombie shoot-em with a half-good plot, though not particularly great movie. But this is pure garbage. Terrible conversation, half assured plot and video game sequences are included in the film. They thought it was a good idea in their right mind. I enjoyed Jurgen Prochkov as Captain Kirk (Ug) about the film (I use the word loose). If his name throws the window virtually, he can see in his show, he's in a horror film and he can do the best. Everyone works if they're doing Shakespeare. And I can add a lot bad. Majority of people who want to see this monstrosity is only if you have one.) A huge zombie buff and every zombie should make a film or look at b.) MST3K, like to play the home game. <br /> See it with friends, make up for tons of unexpected laughs. <br /> <br />
