It's a good story, but not very good. I liked the themes and the main story line, and it's not as clear as that. Perhaps too much going on and it's not all of the rule of governance. Chesty does not work properly, others are stronger than others and strong actors have low quality performance. The whole movie took me a few months because it did not hold my attention and flow was just bad. I'm just glad I've done it only and I'm finally moving and have some continuity at the end. Again, the good story, but the delivery sub par. The story line and maybe a little eye will recommend for candy, and I mean, a little bit.
