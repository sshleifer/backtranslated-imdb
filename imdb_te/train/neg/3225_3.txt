Children love dinosaurs. This is part of their culture. But they got The Land Before Time. Original. At least that movie is heart. D. The film is plain curiosity. If children love dinosaurs, you can kill an old story and not show children. The plot does not have plots, the whole campus is stupid, and it is more about the subject. Theodore Rex is not a soul sucker, but it is not a land before time.
