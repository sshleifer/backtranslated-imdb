I do not know Steven Siegel's movies in the rest of them, but I'll see them because they are crazy, they are always always good at least laughing. Why do you rate this movie from 10 to 1 depending on dubbing? That's the kind of thing you can laugh at when you paint the interest in the movie as a fictional favorite. The attack force was not a great movie, but most of his other films were Steven Siegel's vehicle; In fact, I did not consider myself one of the worst by a long shot. It's a lot of time, half-way coherent plot line, and it's basically exciting, much of the time. The end really sucks, but also has some enjoyable trashy elements. In the end this story was not promising, but I actually thought the acting, the character (I was using such a big word) and the production studios were exactly distributed product values ​​for the Seagull fans. Seagal specifically the man of the stone face, the man of the no-nonsense, as we look forward to, the rest of the cast led him all the way and did not keep him forever. This, people, makes a Steven Seagal movie. To deal with it. Or even better: laugh it. <br /> 10 to 4.
