I really wanted to like this film, but it's impossible. Ultrasonic acting, plot hacks, and pace SLOW, sooo slow. Wanted to sit in the theater and end the whole time. Twenty minutes into films and I'm praying for one end. Certainly some of the visuals are nice, but c'mon guys, I really mean! And it's not much music to talk really about a guy about a guy guy monitor practice. The music is annoying, and boring there. There are sounds of sound noises at all times, and they are also annoying. <br /> <br /> The film has suffered me and kills me at the same time. <br /> I'm happy. I want to see "tid land" and wash this bad taste from my mouth.
