I finished the movie ... I had to rent it because it was the Nick Stall Fan in the video shelf. In all honesty, it should probably stay on the shelf. The concept was an interesting one and there were many very many smart twists and turns but something I guess almost all of them before they got together. And the film just went quite a bit in my opinion ... you'll see what you mean if you suffer through a view! <br /> In a positive note, Nick Stahl's performance is great (especially considering what he does). Eddie Coy Thomas is also good but he plays the same character ... Paul Finch is very fond of "American pie". <br /> Finally, the worst part of the film is to have Jones' emotional performance ... I guess I would have a pretty face in all things in Hollywood.
