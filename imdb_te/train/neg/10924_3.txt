I was hoping to see the first 30 minutes of Oblivion Sands. I seemed for Mommy's cheaper version. This second made its work of ten commandments in Cecil B. DeMille in 1920. They are using an ancient Egyptian masterpiece for an old and terrible evil (they're not always?) DeMille learned of the neglect of the orders, burying the entire set of killings instead of the general setting. It will be buried for hopeful evil all the time. Then we are trying to excavate a team site (the first mistake of a sample, but hey that costume is expensive and this is the size of the fi-fi channel). We work well with the first views of Anubis monster and they have a dress that they put into a simple cheesy CG effect and put a few tries. Then body counts begin. This film went south to me. The fact that people are dying in the gruesome and strange ways reflects the supernatural reaction. Once they realize that the ancient evil is restarted and killing is what is the stock issue that leads to man and lady? They do not have the general stop to "know the truth but someone who has never told anyone". Will they share it with cameras on the dig site after receiving that important information? No, they stop at a hotel for a refreshing shower and for some fun little talk. I'm not really a very motivated person but if you know a monster from ancient Egypt, it kills everyone in the eye and me, I'll put a little hustle in my step to solve this problem. After this lengthy and nonsense second section, they stand by the pipe of phosphorus grenades by shooting in Doon Buggs and firing a rocket launcher to destroy the anubis monster in the usual way. They are not too bad for a size-fiction film, they are on top of the common trash that comes out. If someone wrote a good script for me, it would be very disappointing to me.
