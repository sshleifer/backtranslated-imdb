What a terrible picture. Acting is good, passing is bad, cinematography is not bad, directing is bad, "special" effects are bad. <br /> <br /> The last incident that created inspiration for killing lasted for 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. <br /> <br /> Then, all the victims were invited to a "reunion" at a retirement school, which still opened all facilities. <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> This is not a reason to see the film, unless you want to see some chest, and that is not a very good chest. The film is made almost out of sight from Citizen Kane.
