The film is essentially dealing with the curfew of the Inspector gadget's Doctor Claw, who returned to the city of Metropolis's peaceful city several years later. The Gold Plan is designed to design the gadget's plan for once and for all, using new "cool" criminals to help destroy the gadget's popularity. Sadly, the film fails badly, the series is great, but has been revived with tragic results nearly 20 years later. Don Adams's voice is no longer cut as inspector gadget; Dr. Cla is not the least scary in sight, but his real threat is more like a wrestler than the self. It's a children's film, but the platform is weakly weak (the animation I say about animation) that compares with the original series. Someone decided to upgrade the penny to raise someone for two decades to speed up, now she has some partial rebel outfit and has not played a half role in the TV series. The gadget focuses on mobile talks, as well as all the talking cars, including the plot cone. Maybe I was a kid who liked the frustration, but the live transmission was more painful than I could bear, but now they reveal the water in this full quality TV series. This is more than I can take.
