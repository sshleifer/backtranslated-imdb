Wow, no snooser. One of Bacon's worst films. Even if it is not reliable, the formulaic bad acting, I wasted while watching cable cable. A basketball scout is determined by a basketball game (spoiler), belonging to a segment of the war that falls on the edge of the war, he attaches a lot to the recruiting person, and I can not say about it. Grade: F +
