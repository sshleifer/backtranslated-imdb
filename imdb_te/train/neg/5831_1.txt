This film is heavily boring and solemn. A sailor has a good moment when Mr Barney's (purple dinosaur-low acting) removes eyebrows. Music is relentlessly cloying-it's sad that someone with the very inner beauty, Bjork brought down the pretentious mistakes in her art. The enthusiasm of tea service can seem like a beautiful ritual. The legendary and the culture are not respected in the film they are deprived of. From the Japanese culture but from another filmmaker ... In the moment of "perfecting" the perfect "stability of life" - the crew of the ship finds a huge chunk of sh * t. What are the viewers in the theater? There are a set of pieces that are not composed and cheerful --- then I'm preparing for spoilers with MR Barney <br /> <br /> The Emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney you have outted! I've seen Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain. And the BS your thin, fake wheel is lifted. You've stolen your images and your whole art catalog from this person. Now that sacred mountain is released Finally the powers at the Art Councils of the world remain uninterrupted! Peter was defeated in the economic struggle with attorney-beetles attorney when he was Lennon / McCartney of film-making. Jodorowsky Beatle and BTW You Mikey! Kitti likes college students to make it easier for a cheap and sophisticated child. And BTW I am a filmmaker. If you are interested in making a reality film - I defending you legally a Jodorowsky defender-you, completely defending the thief.
