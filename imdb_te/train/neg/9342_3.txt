1929-30 All-Takiev "Hour Gang" released the schedule, which features two heroines, "A Tough Winter". First, Weisser and Mary Ann, decide to make some taffes at home on a Vintage Day. Little Weiner offers commands to Mary On from a radio cooking show. Problem: Soapping over the various shows and the Weaser Relays information from Mary On! <br /> <br /> The Gangster's neighbor / murderer, Stephen Fetchitt deals with the second storyline, <br /> <br /> "Tough Winter" is not shown on my knowledge and television, it is available on home video. The reason is Stephen Fetchit's character, which shows a shifty, sly and slow motion character. "Our Gang" producer Hall Roach FÃ¼hpitz was called a "skillful comic" and was used as a pilot for a Fachit comedy series that never saw "Light Gang" entry. <br /> <br /> Despite a few funny moments with Feetet and Taffi, "A Tough Winter" is a planting and hitting effort. If there is a positive view from this film, Hall Roach Studios is confident and enjoying the talkies. The sound is good in the movie, and it is good to use some sound effects. For this reason, the film has paved the way for the amazing 1930-31 "Ma Gang" films. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 3.
