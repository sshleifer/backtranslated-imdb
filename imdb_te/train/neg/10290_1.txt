I've bought bloodbirds in ebay a while ago. I saw parts and thought it was very dumb to review again. Initially, the 'high blood' in the water is not just used for a long time - "whip-around" noise sounds. <br /> <br /> If you make mistakes in this movie, there is a way to calculate. I know one of the stars - believe it or not, he is my theater teacher. HA! <br /> <br /> This is the final verdict: Do not worry about this "horror" image. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (73)
