### Spoilers! <br /> <br /> What is this movie offer? Control modification and cinematography are fits with terrible plots. Denzel Washington's talent is sad to look ruined in trials like this. We are absolutely hinted how Mexicans can not save themselves, needing outside forces, perhaps military, Americans. And we know the father is a shadow character, unlike the widow who he praises the crease because he is American, after all there is a Mexican. He killed them by thinking of dying. And she? Of course, she is not, she is a little kid and you are not supposed to hurt the sensitive of the Hollywood fan. The scene trademarks me from ratings under 'taken' by "certainty" (as some critics mentioned). Such films may take time to get nauseous. This ratings of IMDb are credited to the credulity.7.7 for the film and 7.0 for my Own Private Indie. Go and find! Mine is within 3.5-4.0 range
