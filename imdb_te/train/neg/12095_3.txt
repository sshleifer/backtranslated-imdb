Elfriday Jalic, not much of a home name, was the Nobel Prize winner in literature. Her novel was the second prize at Cannes and the movie went on to win the top prizes for female and female leads. <br /> <br /> 'Goble, Gobble' is a preferred scriptural representation in Britain of a Turkish-made bubbling sound. In the film world Turkey is a monumental flap measured by box office receipts or critical reception. <br /> <br /> The disturbing illusion of this widely acclaimed film is not highlighted. If the viewer is hurt, it starts off badly. Credits disturb more than 11 minutes of interactive scenes. We were introduced to Professor Erica Coeht, a well-known author's nickname Ego, a beverage professor of piano. She lives with her hushy and dominant mum. Dad is the executive madman, and dies if he sees what's going on. <br /> <br /> The piano teacher is difficult to enter into its discomfort. <br /> <br /> In this movie we see (in the book, I know), a move, exploitation, involuntary story, whose name is less used, initially shown as a serious musical sensitivity, but completely oppressed. Most, because the scene of the two flops ends with dirty apologies on a handbags that ends with her majestically-voiced maman. <br /> <br /> If a critic (a instrument) is to take a litmofe (do not use a word of speech when making a simple one), this is alcohol's violent alternate mood. <br /> <br /> A young hunk Walter was a 'low-voltage' engineer, and in any sporadic period he also played ice hockey, a talented pianist. He is faced with the lack of Paris in an old-style bracelet in the luxury apartment. <br /> <br /> In a very rare film, he immediately falls in love and starts with 'Cherchez La Femme'. <br /> <br /> Walter maintains a brilliant audition and is envious as a private student by Erika, whose teaching style is distance, animosity, discouragement and humiliation. <br /> <br /> He soon announces his love and kills long lasting Erika in the ladies where they participate in light hockey panic and incomplete oral sex. Erica retains control over her love swine. <br /> <br /> At this time, a rehearsal for a future concert for rehearsal before the rehearsal is a nervous student of Walter Karu because of his envy, fills student coat pocket with erased broken glass and loses the sensitive piano-playing hands. <br /> <br /> The next big scene (including genetic self-mutilation) is part of the apartment's eureka with her mother. <br /> <br /> Eric is insulted, committed to killing and killing. Sensible Walter, for the moment, leaves the night and refuses. <br /> At this time there is almost hour. The viewer only fears the worst. Erica tracks her snow hockey practice Walter to the skater rink. They will be retired to the back room. Lust will not be able to resist luxury hands at his pants. His 'baby gravy' is soon exposed to other stomach subjects. <br /> <br /> Despite repeatedly refusing to take revenge on the ground, Walter will return to Erica's home. Can you imagine what's going on now? It's not too deep or difficult. Yes, when Erica is a victim, he becomes brute. She closed Maman in her room, a moment to repel Erika, kicking her face, sexually dealing with her and restoring her advertisements related to love. <br /> I am unfair this summary? <br /> If you are in the right mood then anyone can see the eternity in the grain of sand. If I wish, I will expatitate in the picture of the challenge of human relationships through this film. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that I would like to love the so-called " <br /> <br /> <br /> When it is obscene, obscure when she is wandering around, underneath her nose, pink and sore throat, her sadness, blah, blah, blah is that she does not feel late. <br /> <br /> The reasons for the world are not explained, she is low. She seemed to love a monster that looks apparently - but surely we all know that any person can be violent coercion because he is trying to keep himself and the world even though his nature is nature. <br /> <br /> At the end, if you have patience there is a little twist. Prior to going to the final scene, she exhibits an injected ligament pupil as a substitute with locker hands, and Erica carries a knife in her handbag. <br /> <br /> Yeah, you're in front of me. She will have nothing to do with her deadly life and leaves. <br /> If you earn a second prize in Cannes, how bad are the other entries?
