I'm a fan of the comic book series, but this film has fallen below my expectations. I guess it's a heavy metal 2000 feel it ..... slow-moving, bad dialogue, our o 'blood .... But it's worse than anything I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> The plot line is nearly to make fun, but the good points will stay there. The characters do not have the power or spirit to attract my attention to the comic series. The film only contains a small piece of comic, and the portion used is slow and boring. <br /> <br /> The main thing in the film is to replace the whole story in the comic book. <br /> <br /> It may look great with the right people who work on this project. Sadly, this is not the case, now some horrible film is still a few looking and less love. Finally, I will get my copy of dust until years after I deny it.
