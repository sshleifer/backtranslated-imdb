Well, I could have enjoyed this film a lot of its culture values. It is a B-movie Action-Flick by the director of "Commando", which is not considered a good B-movie with a very dull and frolic good entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The film's' 80s action movie 'The First film of 90', this type of B-movies must be remembered from time to time at high levels. These films have always gone over the top and have never paid attention to its story or performance. It's all around, big muscle heroes and bullets are flying around. This film has all those ingredients but yet I really do not like watching this movie I like looking at some of the movies. In fact, it is difficult to tell why the story, the acting and the same since in the same genre were bad in any other genre. <br /> <br /> This film is very crazy too often. All these films have its silly movements, but this film is just full of it. Fighting, the characters running around the dolph Lundren Shartles, the story. It's not all very good because it's too lame too often with words. The story at times does not make a bit of sense to make sense and what is the main plot-line of the whole film? Its story is really on the place and is only for writing scenes, gunfights and the creation of such images. And those scenes are not really good to see. <br /> <br /> This is because the big action hero named Delf Lundgren played earlier. Buttocks kit with seemingly relative ease, knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course gets the girl, who also played Tia Carrere. All of this also brings us one of the worst montage sequences in action movie history and is definitely one of the worst sex sequences that I have ever seen in any film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> Good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like one. They are not interested in killing, arresting or informing anyone about their discoveries without being responsible for anyone. Despite finding a large Japanese criminal blend, L.A. Trying to take over the streets of the city and work a beer brewery for a drug factory and a large scale drug trafficking. Think about it for a moment, what is the whole purpose of Brandon Lee? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br />
