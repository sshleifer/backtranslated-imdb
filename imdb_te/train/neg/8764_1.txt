This film is absolutely torture. First of all, it's a whopping 4+ hour time! Of course, the Kargil War may have many points to fight and fight, but not one of these battles has been shown. So this is probably not a commercial film like a documentary, propaganda. Definitely not such a background is found, there is not enough background information and there are some errors. The war scenes were much less implemented. I was disappointed from the person who gave the scenes well in the border. Every battle is accurate. It is predictable. (This may be a spoiler.) The whole army rises up to five or more soldiers five times each (each time using the same cassard), one of the main actors, the actor for a stretcher, "No, do not get a stretcher, it takes 6 people out of the battalion ", And then an actor dies. The exact thing is done over and over and over. Oh, and the songs are very bad and very long. Casting the film is very good. Despite such a long film, all of the characters are well developed. There are very few characters in actresses. They all dressed up and filmed. Two of them are crying. It's very ridiculous. They move their hands and heads at the same time and then make a bit of their blanket. <br /> <br. The list just goes away. I still forget. However, I painted this picture correctly.
