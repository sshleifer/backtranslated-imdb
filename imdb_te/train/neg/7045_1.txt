This should be the worst, and I always understand the trash biker image! <br /> <br /> Now we know what happened to Ginger after protecting the island of Gilligan. A frightening vehicle Tina Lewis (she is afraid she will probably see someone this mess!) Is a piled vehicle tormented by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in movie history. But fans do not worry! Batman, I understand Adam West, a hook town town doctor arrives! Pow! Crush! Boom! Holy Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The good points of this "bomb" are some beautiful women, some ridiculous fighting scenes and yet "sexy" Tina Lewis!
