This film is a film stock waste. Do you believe that you can run a map in a daylight with someone with a zoom lens to see the map binoculars of a military mission scheme or a camera? This is done in the film. A DEAF person is actually in the "Negro" section to sign active tasks in Europe during WWII ... cooking, supply services, burial details etc. This is done in the film. You are a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer with the same DEAF K.P. Will the Germans be part of active warfare to save a dam from being destroyed before the Allies come? This is done in the film. Would you be surprised that the DEAF commander did not realize that a German plane was withdrawn and that he would straf and kill him? This is done in the film. Wondering that a group of German soldiers were in a barn in a farmhouse? German emigrants outlined their emotions in the eyes of German soldiers who were just 50 'away. They did in the film and left the entrances to the foundation that Germans could be insufficiently inspected. Will the captain of the tornado and the clear English rank of the English speak openly speak his name, in the English language in the English language, the English language that the dam is protected the next day? They may have sent a message to tell you what the American attack is just about in order to be a little bit easier in Germany. The film is listed in the list of top 50 worst films. If it is, I'm sure I'll do well. Look at your own risk.
