Scary Movie 2 is a scary movie franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 are all good but this is kind of boring and not too funny. Fortunately they chose their action afterwards and made two other great scary movies. <br /> <br /> The film lures you about a group of adolescents who go to a haunted mansion by their professor for a night. They start to get things wrong and they realize that they escape. <br /> <br /> This film is not terrible, but it is very small. It's a bit of fun and if you like other movies on Scary Movie franchise then give this one a watch - but I do not think you like almost how much you like it.
