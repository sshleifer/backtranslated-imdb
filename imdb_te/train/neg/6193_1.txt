I can not believe that seeing such a weaker film I spent just one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> Robert was a young man who died for anyone. Hence some have started to assemble with local anti-social youth and use drugs. All of this is gentlerly more violent and tapping past texts <br /> <br /> The first thing is that I can not find the feelings or trace of the great emotion in this film, no single character. <br /> <br /> I have seen the director in the last two minutes. It is very serious. <br /> <br /> Using cinematography is not only for adults. Most of the time I did not see any facial expressions from the actors and that the body language was not enough to be effective. Perhaps the staff is just tired to fix the camera they have in everything in the arrangement. <br /> <br /> The plot is particularly weak. There are a lot of unrelated scenes and the need to speak but unless they're written by you, maybe you are really random to never pull them all together. <br /> In one and a half hours you will find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all the others walking, talking, and moving. So I can not really comment on acting here. <br /> <br /> In the last few minutes, Nice was selected. <br /> <br /> I have never given 1 film for this film but this film is definitely worthy (you smile at scary movies). This is a movie when a failed attempt to depict troubled young people encounters a very disturbed audience. We hope you come in any group.
