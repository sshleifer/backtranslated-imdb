We brought this film as a joke for a friend and our trash jokes. The film is just watchable, and the acting is terrible. The worst children's ever-used actor and Hasslehof gave a classic performance. The plot was insulting and was boring so we were wondering what the hell was going on. It tries to be terrible in places but is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's just terrible
