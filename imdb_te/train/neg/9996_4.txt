Although the production and Jerry Jameson's direction have been definite improvements, "Airport '77" is no better than airport 1975: the soft, commercially dirty sink (literally) good cast. Jack Lemon is a pilot's pilot of the aircraft, which is the artist and crashes in the sea (hijacked) (all campaigns claim that it is near the Bermuda Triangle but does not mention it). When sailing ships get out of the water, all cranes fall into the sea (rather blindly) and it is not difficult to laugh (guessing cranes that fill the plane, passengers and water). At least one hour of extra-footage in the process of dealing with "gilligan's island" episode "NBC" as "Directors Cut" with mostly flashbacks. The most exciting moment is the flight risk, and some players have some fun: Le Grant is a bad drug, Brenda has no meaningless stewardess, Joseph Katen and Olivia de Havilland flirting with older people. Nevertheless, personality conflicts and fascinating military details eventually demolish a patience. ** from **
