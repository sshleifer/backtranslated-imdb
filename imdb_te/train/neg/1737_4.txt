Ernest Lubitchch's final film by Otto Pimingser after Lubitsch's premature death at the time of production, the confusion and sandiness of a juggling, romance and music, fantasy and textile plays. In a castle in southeastern Europe in the 19th century, Countess comes to the hostile, Hungarian rebel leader for his swornness; Her ancestors came to life with her painted picture, amazingly. Betty Gamble in the long blonde wig, decorated with flowers, is never beautiful and her songs are very fun. Unfortunately, this script (with Samson Rafaelson taken from an operetta by Rudolf Sachsenzer and E. Velysk) is struck with different ideas that fail to mesh. The results are good, but unattainable. **** from * 1/2
