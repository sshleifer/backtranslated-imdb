I am surprised with some reviews from this movie. The only place that is true is RottenTomatoes.com. This film is awful. The plot is too lazy. It's not scary. The people there thought that Sarah acted as Michael Geller, that Grudge should not forget about it. The film is like Dark Water, which is more speculative and slowly moving. I was disappointed with this movie. I'm not afraid or I'm not interested. Let's face this, at this stage the plot has been exploited for this kind of death. Dead Water, Darkness, Changing etcetc - Dragonfly, What Lies Bailout, Ghost Story, Dark Water. It seems to me that writing these original horror films is only Japanese and Koreans these days. The films that come from Hollywood as such are weird exercises in earning money without respect for the viewer. They're just churning
