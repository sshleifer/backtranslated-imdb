All the films of David Prior are terrible on all topics: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, budget (the director's brother is usually played by the male lead). But they all have amazing entertainment value due to their entertaining pleasure. Almost every David Prior is basically the theme of the "movie" (I would refer to them). Manly All-American Commandos team until the Communist bands were blown up. But unlike other cold war games like Red Dawn, all the early movies were actually funny because their over-the-top campus and acting. The best part of Jungle Assault is Becker (or other Dude?) General-Mitchell for a high-profile mission in South America. The funniest line in the film is then given to the effect of "This is my roommate, I trained him well". WHAT. Did you train your roommate? <br /> <br /> If you find these gems in the video that you use anywhere, buy them. They are funny and ridiculous after some beers. See them with a group of friends for a true MST3K-style experience. So far my friends and I have caught up with Night Wars and aerobistist "Killer Workout". But I would highly recommend them all to the final grant, with Robert Z'dar, who looks frequish.
