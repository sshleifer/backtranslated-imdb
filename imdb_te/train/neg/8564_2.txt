This film is very exciting. It was a frustrating to people who heard deaf people. True, some deaf people are careful with hearing people, but they are not angry throughout the story of Marley Matlin's character. The deaf did not go to the bar and do not dance as Matlin did. Overall, the film is even more boring than curiosity. It's so boring to believe that it is an insomniac-cured image. If I had a sleeping problem, I could sin in the little boy's children. It slips me. <br /> Remember, this is a deaf person.
