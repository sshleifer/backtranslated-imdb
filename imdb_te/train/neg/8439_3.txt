I mean after seeing it again for the first time in many years how it will be considered one of the worst Laurel & Hardy's. For me, it's not as bad as "Air Ride Warden" and "The Firefly", but there are also some big bugs. The film was set up to show Laurel and Hardy as owners and teacher of the dance studio. Hardy surrounded the "London Bridge" dance, around 20th Century Fox Starlets, and in the next room, Laurel teaches the early ballot when wearing a ballerina costume. A clumsy carpenter sprinkles the glue on the floor, ending Hardy Lucy. Then, come racketeers, now selling insurance covering their defense racket. One of them is very young and beautiful Robert Mitchell. <br /> <br /> It was the end of gangsters and the last time we saw the dance studio. The rest of the film was supported by Laurel and Hardy's wealthy patron Trudy Marshall and her creator, Robert Bailey. They first try to help parent (Matt Briggs and Margaret Dumont) and her hopeful boyfriend Allen Lane, whom we say right off, hide their relationship to the good pawn of her refusal. This leads to Brigh's hidden strap tea-total Dumont, and literally removes a rag from the wealthy patriarchal and drops his bed in a pond below. Conflicts occur when the boys use the help of Bailey to showcase his Kiran Gun. <br /> <br /> Hurdy then wants Hardy to use the insurance policy to earn money for their dance studio rent and hopes to break Laurel. That's a leg to do. There is no indication that insurance salesmen are gangs and actually not invalid. (Although they are legal insurance sales man, after their arrest, their licenses may be canceled). Laurel ends up being transferred by a rush dog driver (Olympic is a big beach roller-coaster somehow the bus is out, setting its wheels on the tracks. <br /> <br /> "Go to Abbott and Castello Hollywood", roller-coaster hypocrisy It's a fun but anticipation. <br /> <br /> When the story hits, all these dresses The point is that it's a sequel to recapitiously simultaneously one another to make a full-length feature of a double-bill. L & H lost most of their luster after leaving Hal Roach's job, as I said in other reviews in their next films Surprisingly here, they look old and tired Because they are made from films of the year. Some of the gags in their other films, it is definitely a "3" as opposed to "2" will be.
