The film is the worst ever seen in my entire life. I'm not even kidding. It did not work properly and the actors did not work. This is my time and money waste. It's my friends and I have seen a movie that we own. The case came with the film is definitely a disguise. Nothing in this movie. It seems that the director or make-up artist is just a zombie that someone would put a black eye liner under the eyes. At the beginning of the film the credits take about 20 minutes. Credits is the best part of the movie. This honestly was an awful movie and I could not believe how badly I was together. Scenes jump from one to the other, sometimes "what's going on?" The audio is terrible and action shots appear as a joke of teen around a fake fight scene. <br /> If you're thinking of renting or buying, I'll see at least the trailer and show how terrible it really is. I viewed it before I rented it.
