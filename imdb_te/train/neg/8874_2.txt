But there are not many. Perhaps the worst "main release" film I have seen in my life. Certainly this year's worst. There is no point in commenting on the plot, cast or acting. The problem is far beyond that. It refers to the kind of annoying kind of screen (not kind of funny) in absolute stupidity. I do not know why I gave 10/10 instead of 2/10. Perhaps, due to Steven Martini. He really tried. Bottom line - Some brain cells are washed with a toilet for 95 minutes. Avoid at any cost.
