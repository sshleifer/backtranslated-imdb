Wasting time to cast a big star cast well .. I have a bunch of talent wasting their time on a big screen with some curiosity comedy which will appeal to all who I can see? Some curiosity songs that can be heard? Who are some pathetic sudden turnings? Race against time? u mean waste against time? OK If you first spoil your kid, then you should give him a clever new concept perhaps other human being than a human being Let me come up with a comment like a human being Who else is this fact so the ignorant should teach a lesson Wow but this is a stranger who is sitting with you Granted, you are already very much in Hindi films To learn cabaddayani such waste going for the film, and waste my time writing about anyway!
