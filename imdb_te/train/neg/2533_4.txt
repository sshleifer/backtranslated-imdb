I agree with all the previous commentator Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). <br /> <br /> The Zatachi series is a great knife combined with great sword fighting and enthusiasm. <br /> I'm Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe that I have not released in Zone 1 (USA). Jotichi outlet was disappointing. The storyline is complicated, and many previous Zatoichi story lines seemed a hodgepodge. <br /> <br /> The film was disappointing because it was less of the effects of the effects (head rolling, blood transfusions, blood) and upper roots of the Zatoichi character. <br /> <br /> The rest of the films have been successful based on story and action and have been a great success without improving the results. <br /> <br /> I believe that the rest of the Jottachi films will follow the same trend. It was the first jotocyte film from his studio. I recommend all previous Zatoichi movies earlier - and recommend them.
