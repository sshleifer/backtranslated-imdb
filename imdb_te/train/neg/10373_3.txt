One of these films I only sit alone. Charlotte Henry is good - in fact, all the actors are fine. The problem is in script, dialog, direction, editing, sets and special effects. It's true, it's 1933, but it's actually made up. Part of the problem is Richard Arlene, Gary Cooper, W.C. Actors like. Fields and Carry Grant are not recognizable (shouting for an identity that is not coming). The image is clumped along with just unification. The spirit of Lewis Carrolls, humor and continuity is not much. What a pity! This is a great book. I recommend the 1951 version of Disney.
