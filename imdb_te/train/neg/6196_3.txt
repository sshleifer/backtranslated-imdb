I saw this film at Rotterdam's Film Festival (Jan '06) and then there was a discussion between the director and the public. Many people marveled and protested. He gets a lot of negative criticism. But: The world is cruel, it's not funny. People do not like it. That movie is not bad. I can see that difference. Do not shoot the messenger who shows the world outside of our 'hub'! Yet I think this bad movie. The film is technically good. Nice shots and script, good fitting music, great actors. The director pretends to make a mental picture - but psychology is shaky. It is not art that describes such powerful violence. There is a powerful description of the art of mental processes behind that violence. How does a cowardly baby come to such cruelty? <br /> <br /> The director repeatedly referred to the term "teacher" as a teacher. Only: This teacher is selfish, not - someone in many roles, caring for his students, and worry about his script. I call him selfish. The atmosphere in the village is creepy, and the mother has made terrifying mistakes ('Do you let me down terrible?') But it is so painful for me that there is so much suffering, that shyest boy comes in such terrible things. In fact, realism is much more complicated than the way, does the picture explain? And it needs good interpretations. The interesting thing is: how does it work? <br /> <br /> In the end, the director has suggested that an alternative approach be indicated. It's other intense, directed me and screenwriter writers are encouraging bad psychologists, black / white ideas. The connection between films and violence in society has proven. The use of such violence uses the right to responsibility. There are enough black / white thinkers in the world, there are many wars and difficulties. I hope, this film will not succeed.
