A little girl found dead body recognition all possible fired. When one leg knows that it is longer than the other, it is considered the body of the couple's missing daughter. After this injury, the couple separates and the mother shakes the tranquility and leads to a tedious presence. One of these changes is one day, many years later, she receives a phone call from her daughter! With the help of a former police and a reporter, she sets on a journey to determine if her daughter is actually alive. "Los Sin Nombre" moves with vague slow velocity, completely absurd. Careful Emma Vasassa makes an unusual job as a disappointing mother. The best part of the film is at the end, but I'm not worth the rest of the film. Beware of the English subtitles in the recent R1 release - they are not very clear.
