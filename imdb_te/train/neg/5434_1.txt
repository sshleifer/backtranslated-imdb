Wow. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are some goggles. - Two major characters were removed from the screenwriter's book. - Plot Groatsclub changed. - If voices are lifted from the passages directly written (though it is well-read, spoken, especially with Chaban's writing style). - Acting is more wood than a lag cabin. (Esch Bachstein) - It was set in 1983 <br /> <br /> As of 2003, most people feel. <br /> <br /> I am not able to finish watching this film, so it is possible to liberate myself ... (irony). I really hope at least anyone (read a la wonder boy) who reads a hoping book that nobody has paid to see this, or something decent. <br /> <br /> I like Chabon as a writer, but he must be an amicus for this adaptation.
