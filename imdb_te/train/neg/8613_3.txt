I almost came to tears watching this movie. Not a laugh but a great roady from Dangerous movie memories. Candyshack stole his first and first movie, Easy Money had him in his best, and back-to-school was a 80's classic masterpiece. Then there was Ladybugs and when it began to show. Poor Rodney is the old man (Wamba Sparks has gone from the ladybugs to the lowest, but did not say much). <br /> <br /> In my 5 wives, Rodney Monty (she wants to love her from his name in the easy money) is wealthy (he is not always) loves women and plays a marriage mate. Since he has now gained a huge land and driven the land, he gets 5 wives. This is a great idea for the film Dangerous. The problem is everything. The script Radini camera seems to be talking to one of his liners and it is very poor that there is nothing on all sides. The movie appears as if it's really shotgun into some really poor stunt scenes that are not Rodney. Andrew Daisy Clay plays the role of a gangster who looks like he is dying to say F (the film is rated R but it plays as PG) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2 minute guest role. Sometimes I do not like it, sometimes I laugh at Rodney Jokes but it's too old for the poor and very slowly slow. We can see that his jokes come from miles. And thanks to the horrific 1990s film it turns into a very PC, Rodney of the 70's and 80's does not work anymore.
