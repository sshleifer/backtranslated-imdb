Inequality is really a step, as the original film is in original story and special effects. Jason Scott Lee (If you remember him, he is from cinematic dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.) Jason London, he is a fun kid as Luke, a kid who loves him. Dracula's body from the very slab stolen. Diane Neil steals Dracula's body to find a cure for her dying boyfriend, and Stephen Billington is the greatest Dracula. Better performance than Gerard Butler is counted in the original film. The rest of the cast includes Roy Scauder rounds, and he does a good job as a teacher of Jason Scott Lee's character. The second sequel in this trilogy, and they are a good start off. Whether the last film closes this sequence in a good note is in the air.
