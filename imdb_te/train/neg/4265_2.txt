I'm a fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorite was Braveheart, Troy, Last Samurai and Gladiator. And after watching Mongols, absolutely awesome, and I strongly recommend it, I have high expectations from a Sergei Bodrov movie. But it is terrible, awful, even tragic in this case is not a strong word. I waited for a whole thrill, but I finally expect at least one big epic war, but it's also hopeful, some random runs around, swords ... There are very good warriors, not one of them.
