STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is a revival mission with three new young strike- After refusing to direct a direct order from team appointments. But by night before the strike, they were killed by a killer with the innocence of innocents. The French police will only go to their own investigation, searching for those who are responsible for themselves, and transforming the DNA of a person into a deadly new drug system that transforms a person's DNA and gives a terrible new force. <br /> <br /> Bad cover. Bad title. Bad post production correction. And the bad trailer. Pretty bad image. But I do not think I'm strong at all. I know it's very vigorous for me with most reviewers (probably not stevie!), But I have come up with a lot of criticisms from all the bad news that went into the film than the original quality of the film. br> <br /> <br /> I had the lead in trust. It was dubbing (it made him sound like Martin Sheen with a groin problem!) Was pretty awful and not too often but in the big section of the movie I thought was not in use. The plot was pretty smooth, and it was considered to be totally cumbersome with the original completed movie called Harvest. Another reviewer noted that the film has a good gothic look, a new touch for Seagal movie. <br /> <br /> If I were honest, I would rather look at Fury Flight, Today You Die or A Kill for a Kill. **
