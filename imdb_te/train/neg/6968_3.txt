An old man appears to have had a flower in his wife's greenhouse. He pricked through it, or was bitten by something. He is soon ill, and a large kind of white larvae spills in the hospital. <br /> <br /> The next attempt to revive him with the paddock leads to the opacity of the blood. <br /> <br /> A policeman was hospitalized because his partner was severely hurt from the shootings. Some police woman needs to be attached with one entomologist who has brought the same as one of the doctors. We have many young children wandering around the hospital, I suppose we're supposed to find the adorable, but who are the most annoying small brats. They happen to go back to the room where the prototype goes, and it happens that the growth hormone dump happens. The horror movie logic they deserve to die, but they are never in danger. <br /> The critter grows and the breeding starts. People run away from it, and for some reason sometimes come to it. <br /> <br /> The film is not really compelling characters, and many people are searching for a monster. It is very boring. Obviously it owes something to foreign films that have a lot of stages within a human being and its development. There is also a character named Bishop, and has the hair of the lead actress Sigourney Weaver.
