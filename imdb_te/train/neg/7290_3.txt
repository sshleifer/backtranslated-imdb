What a long, drawn out, pointless picture. Historically, I feel this movie is a joy but it does not grade as the entertainment passes. Ralph Fennes is in some fantastic films, English Patient, Schindler's List, but it's a divider. It is not going anywhere, initially his character is so in depth and I am amazed that it is interested in his "sister" anytime. Do not worry about renting this movie, instead buy an English Patient copy.
