The film is a prime example of abusing great resources in the film. In the future you will get SNL and SCTV stars in your main future, such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Lauren Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davies and Joe Flaherty, 70 minutes of dirty, unpleasant fare and racist jokes. The concept of a network from the future repressive community has led to some really interesting limitations, but instead of the gate out right, a lame, juvenile practice is joking and full of humor's entire vein. The more dangerous and witty grove tube or later, the happiest Kentucky Fried movie. The film is only for those who want to watch the 70-year-old Sketch comedy movie watch.
