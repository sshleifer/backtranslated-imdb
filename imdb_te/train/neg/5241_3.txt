Tell me the truth I'm a bit stunted to see this positive review, which is the main reason why I really want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> When I see the film, I'm really disappointed, it comes from the person who loves the genre of this movie. <br /> <br /> I am totally surprised at the film - nakedness is not exactly the reason and it will have to blame the young children and swear. <br /> <br /> The story about the two guys has been sent into the big brother's program for their neglected behavior. <br /> They are self-named simply not really connected with the story. They are not a role model and they do not do anything to do what they have done. This story is very predictable (though not guess) and humor is dull. And we do not already see the same characters (not playing by Mac Lovin) in many other films (such as the Saskwalk Gang). <br /> <br /> I'm laughing thrice and almost lonely. <br /> <br /> He then worked well as a screen producer. Acting is very much appreciated when you look at this kind of movie. And direction, guess what? It's the same person who brought us wet hot American summer, and that movie sucks. <br /> <br /> I'm not total refresh, but time is totally waste. Only naked scenes appear to be the best character in the film. Nobody can see anyone I recommend. <br /> <br /> Pros: Elizabeth Bank? <br /> <br /> Cons: Funny, horror story, nudity and children are not combined. <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Grade: F)
