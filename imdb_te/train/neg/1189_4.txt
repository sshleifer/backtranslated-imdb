The 'bubbling' sound effect used for the show was echoed. Very comforting performance. I think I slept through danger or dangerous places. I also heard that a set of shots for performance in the spongi divers were shot at the torpedo springs in Florida. I do not expect Lloyd Bridges to be there ever. I only remember in the back display and it makes up our own underwater parts in the lake at my grandmother's home ... even though the edge off the seat is exciting ... imagining the echoing bubbling sounds and commenting on our adventures in our heads. I have 'Flipper' a good underwater action. In fact, he's in his natural environment.
