I lost the movie in the movie but I had some idea on the back of my head that I thought it was valuable, so I thought it was time for me to see the shelves on the DVD. Big mistake! <br /> <br /> The long list of stars has not saved this turkey, certainly one of the worst films ever. An incomprehensible plot was poorly distributed and poorly presented. If I could read Robbins' novel, it was different from the novel, and with the help of Robbins, the novel was an annoying reading. br> <br /> <br /> When I think the actors are well cynical, they think that they are in these waste of celluloid and more late in the DVD blocks, for example, Pat Morita. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Thurman is working hard to look uncomfortable at times. <br /> <br /> For 98 minutes, your life is worth your attention, cutting your toenails or sorting your sack drawer. When you see a throw-away bin in your local shop "under $ 5", stop that wish!
