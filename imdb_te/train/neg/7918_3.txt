<br /> <br /> The only thing that saved me from this film is that I thought Lassi Chabert's performance in the top 10 was a great deal of good personalities. <br /> <br /> In this film, the film was highlighted. <br /> <br /> Dyna Mayer is beautiful but her character is very beautiful, so I do not think my performance is great. <br /> <br /> His commentary on the main character, Dr. Armand Assante, in the Andrea bottle, mainly to doctors in the 1980s reminded the hospital series. The horrific, terrible, terrible ending / solving, mental and psychological role also included some of the worst writing I've seen in a long time.
