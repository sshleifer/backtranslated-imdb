France (Francophone) portrays France's unambiguous problems in Africa, a young woman from France (represented here in her country) by the tumultuous and complex psychoanalytic prism. It is a frequent sinking and challenging depiction of a young woman's desire to come to a settlement with a country's desire to reach herself, in particular, and once a 'traumatic moment', and once 'ownership' and molded 'other'. It reflects the entire focus of the journey from the present to the past (or on the go); Remember the facts recalled for contemporary political and economic realities. <br /> <br /> The characters show formality, even though all the limited and incredible character. France hoped to be a visual and totemic representation of the contemporary French society, and she still felt as if she was still full of the same simplicity as a child in her childhood - she actually looked more like children in her reality. The rest of the rag-tag ensemble is simply unforgettable. The black Africans are less, exaggerating the exaggerated portraits of ex-canned people, and the director's poorly maintained items. They are looking for wonders of France and the ones that can never be seen in Cameroon with the wonders of the world, in a dark and dead background, the world that she never knew.
