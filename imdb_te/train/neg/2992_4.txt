After slasher films of the 1970s and 80s, they are probably the second most popular horror episode about the walking dead. In the sensational films "Black Christmas" and "Halloween" are complete, George Romero's 'Dead' films include Zombie Flicks. And surprisingly soon after his first two wins in the series, other directors wanted money in. The Italian directors were particularly interested in Lucyo Fulki, which brought us 'zombie' a year after the 'Dawn of the Dead', in Italy and in some other countries called 'Zombi', and Fulki's film called 'Zombi 2'. Walking is not associated with the film, but it is a good film in its own film, rather than dead. It was a huge success in Europe and a sequel was born nine years later. <br /> <br /> Pros: Beautiful, lush scene. Awesome score. Acting is not perfect, but the cast game and experience seem to be enjoyable. After a slow start, the pace moves like an action flick. Plenty of bad cinema lovers are cheese and random pleasure. A good job on makeup effects. Lots of blood and some good gore. <br /> <br /> Cons: The plot is low. You have not already seen it. From the first couple of pictures of 'Return of the Living Dead', it is clearly sharper on some issues. Cardboard letters. <br /> <br /> The late 1980s rock music (not all rock music at that time), the first of all, is not the true sequel of Fulki's cult classic. In fact, I do not know where to choose where to go. For those who do not know, Fulci was ill at the time of production and was left out and replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mathi's films are pretty ridiculous, but it's a very good campie like this movie. <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (So-bad-it's-good rating) 2/5 (Serious ratings)
