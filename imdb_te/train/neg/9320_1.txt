If the film is comedy, I gave it to 10. Oh my, where did I start? Keep it this way - I've seen horror horror films, but this True 2 Freakin 's private Ryan saves. The group of porn producers decided to make a horror film, changed their thinking in the Middle East and decided to make a comedy, then returned to the horror, and then decided that they would have trouble with porno. Everything about the film is terrible: a musical score (a man who invented the Yamaha keyboard), script, direction, cinematography, acting. There are no words to describe this topic. Oh wait, yes are: sacred $ *%!.
