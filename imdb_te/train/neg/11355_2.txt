"Knott" (voiced by Trevor Gagan), his brain friend "IQ" (voiced by Philip Bolden) and always starving "scooter" (David Gore) with big children. They want to be the first flies in space. And their dreams are waiting for its historic trip to the launch pad near the Apollo 11, where three drops to land on the moon, which promotes the first spacecraft to land on the moon. <br /> The first thing you notice is the animation of the movie. I've done very well. The scenery is so deep in it, things seem to be really far away as they are behind the scenes sight. I did not see the movie in 3-D because it was broadcast on HBO. However, I can see no scenes used by 3-D effects except the characters in the end. I'm not really impressed with the design of the characters too. For me, they do not look anything similar to a fly, especially in coloring. <br /> <br /> These actors were exceptional blue gray and contrary to me. <br /> <br /> Performances from the cast are not bad, but this is not good. I focus on my computer more than the story. Writing concert with funny moves to laugh at young people was written perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is not the history of the film. In fact, as I mainly concentrate on flies, I think it's totally neglected. I also hated the opening of the famous astronaut screen and explained that the story of fairy tales in the film was a work of fiction, and no flies were in Apollo 11. <br /> You are an adult, not for you. It was not made for the whole family. This is definitely for kids. But save it for a rainy day.
