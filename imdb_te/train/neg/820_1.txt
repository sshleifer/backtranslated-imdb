What did the producer / director Stanley Kramer do in a very confusing screenplay by Adam Kennedy's novel and producer Kennedy? Are there deliberate few pieces left? And what about Jean Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? <br /> What did they do in this tragic role? <br /> <br /> And why should Candice Bergen, who gave a terrible performance, accept the role of such denial? <br /> <br /> Domino Principle misses the mark by the same persistence as the parallax view or the Manchurian Candidate and with a much wider margin. A big quarrel by Stanley Kramer.
