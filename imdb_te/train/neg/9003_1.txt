Really this movie, I really understand, sucks. Its get platehouse holes are very large, and 30 feet dragon fits. Not to mention, even in the film produced dragon, inevitably the garbage film virtually never put. That means, when you see something like this, "Wow, someone really did this movie, then let's release it, it takes the buds". <br /> When I rented the movie, it was not on the DVD, so I (reluctantly) video. The first thing that appears is the Lord of the Rings trailer for Two Towers. Putting this trailer in the video is very clever action. This gives me 1 star (reluctantly) to justify, otherwise I would have given zero stars. <br /> <br /> If the star of Deep Cain is an attraction, the producers (you will spell it) will draw in groups (i.e., to the video store). <br /> They later consider this part of the worst picture as a split screen technique (like the Hulk) (I imagine) a worse. In the box, we see the picture of our hero and dragon. Is it right for Dragon Dragonhard or is it me? In any case, it seems to have been rejected from Dragon Gremlins 2 in the film, and the CGI of a Nintendo video game villain from the early 90s (worst). Also, the Dragons movement haunts its victims - the same f ## cking monotonous movement- right leg, left leg, right leg left leg, dom, dom, dom, dom dom, dom f # $ king dOOOOOM! This pushes me off. Probably the filmmakers may think that it is thrilling and has the same effect of jazz. Then why not dragon POV shot. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain appears to have brought many ideas in the film. Perhaps this movie comes with the fact that he can end his career. Do not expect Superman here. <br /> <br /> For this story, it's so bad, my 5-year-old brother has come up well. While he was there, he undoubtedly was trying to find out why he was in trouble in my room. Oh, and I did not mention that people who made this rarely STUPID STUPID CRAP ATROCIOUS FILM F * #
