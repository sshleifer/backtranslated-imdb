Cameron Diaz is a woman married to a judge who played Harvey Keitel as a former judge. While watching this film, I have been watching this film a lot of times why I'm doing so .. The movie is very ridiculous and blah and poorly scripted without any belief. The audience really does happen to the car .. Even the lovely Cameron can not save this from one to ten levels.
