OK I'm not an American, but in my humble Scottish view Steve Martin is never, never, and never a funny guy ever since our posters were in a southern direction. There is no doubt that Phil Silvers as Sergeant Billy and other talented characters in all of the characters in the series, which contributed to one of the funniest and deadly comedies produced by skilled writers and directors in America and so far. How would anyone dare to try to replicate the role of Phil Silvers? In Martin's inappropriate effort to combine matters, Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau exercised his work to rebuild a disappointingly useless career with another absurd attempt. Steve Martin, who claims to be 'Berardasch', says he will name his own stamp character, and Silvers and Sellers will forget his films for future generations.
