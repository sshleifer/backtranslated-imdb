First, I apologize to my English. <br /> <br /> Everyone agrees with me from the former Yugoslavia, not some serious Serbia radical. This film shows towards Serbia, and just the Serbian side. No Serbian crimes were represented. Fortunately, everyone can see that this movie was made by Serbians, so there is no neutrality. All the "experts" interviewed are not experts. <br /> <br /> Even in Slovenia, the film is facing charges. The total war in Slovenia lasted for a few days, and there were not many Serbians in Slovenia, and YNA Slovenia Croatia failed to reach Croatia (after the start of the Croatia-Serbia War). Each Slovenian is angry with all the allegations in the film. <br /> Every reasonable croht will agree with one subject: Independence begins very much. Perhaps all major clashes can be used. However, it is a really thrilling attempt to justify everything, referring to WWII and some unrelated things. Just imagine Japanese throwing atomic bombs in Seattle and Washington and say that it was justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will find no clues about the YNA soldier, and the Serbian citizens near Vukovar killed. But you can find reporters tape that his claims about Serbian citizens near Vicor are lies. All on the internet. And I forgot about YNA's total bombing of director Yakovar (now 100% of Serbia and Montenegro's side and Serbs and Montenegrin) and did not initiate the Chichnik movement. In the beginning, it was just the resistance movement. But the director forgot to mention some of the Nazis, Ustache, ethnic cleansing and Yugoslav Partisin again battling. There are other things, but all of them can be easily inspected. There are many misleading things in this movie. Only some of the allegations are true. Each film is angry by the film. <br /> <br /> I believe that I do not have to tell you about Srebrenica's carnage denial, the carnage that has so many testimonies. Imagine the film about the Holocaust rejection. This is the film. The Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo were bombed by the film. Every Bosnian Muslim is angry with this film. </ span> <br /> The director forgot to mention a small piece of land by the Serbas (FYROM) land. <br /> <br /> Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians and Macedonists did not enter the Serbian borders. If you are not Serbia and if you have really started believing some of the pictures, Serbs has somehow promoted, Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians actually created their history. <br /> <br /> 50% Cerbers say the film is a little more serious and pro-Serbia. <br /> <br /> And the Serbian Radicals are very proud of this film (roughly 40% of the votes are voted for radicals) <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my points here. This documentary is very truthful and my advice to everyone: Please tell me before watching this movie. After that, you only laugh at all curiosity charges. <br /> See real, neutral documentaries about the death of Yugoslavia.
