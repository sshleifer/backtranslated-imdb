I gave birth to three small children at night and their mother showed me to be caught at Wal-Mart weekly for the weekend. Three kids are actually physically ill. I'm pretty much the pizza they ate, or they all have gained something from the school, but really this movie. Absolutely disgusting. How can the trash make this skill? Fortunately, I stopped the film by noticing that the children did not respond and did not act. For any parent there, I told them to prevent these children from seeing this film.
