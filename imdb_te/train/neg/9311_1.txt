The cover on the DVD and the disc is awesome, you think they made a film about sweet dish from the twisted metal block which is still a great idea, but Ben's performance in Pearl Harbor with the actors of this film is good, with good quality of porno and good actors. I bought a DVD but luckily I rented the first one, the plot and the script were also terrifying, and never feel like ever, so the movie never really makes sense. There are poor efforts to deal with those used in the 80-minute sitcom displays, and eventually you want to bang on your home wall.
