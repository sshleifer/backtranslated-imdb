Director Warren Beatty's intention to turn Chester Gould's famous comic strip into a live-action cartoon has a sweet endeavor of innocent nostalgia - with an extraordinary and mysterious come from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the ham that needs the picture, is fun for fun but finally tired. Dick Tracy cheat attempted to break Big Boy Caprais, a love tess truhart, and dropped by bad Breathless Mahoney. For the first half hour or so, the Oscar will begin to conjure things (like a real sting in the work), like the fabulous but predictable writing creaks to absorb the art direction and set design to win. Al Pacino was surprised. Bad Boy Caprais, and Madonna (mostly cinematic) sang Stephen Soondimes's "Sooner or Later (I've Always Get My Man)", a song for the Best Original Award. The heart is thanked to the botte, dedicated to his vision - but the picture looks good and counting. It does not have heat. **** from * 1/2
