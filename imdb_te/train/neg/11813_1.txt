Before Stan Laurel became the shortest part of the All-Time Greatest Comedy Team, he worked under Braunacho Billy Andersen's contract, including many of the hilarious Hollywood films. After the controversy with Andersen, Laurel continued with the names of immoral rows in Joe Rock's short (and more mild) production company. <br /> <br /> Laurel's parody of the movie is for the modern audience who do not see the original, much less funny, laural parody of the time. 'West of hot dog' is a very simple simulator of cowboy shoot-ups. It is a specialization of the West of Peacock, which was released by voters without major actors two years ago. Since the West of Pecos has never been a big success, it is more difficult to see why Stan's film unit chooses to select these special images for their luminary, which is why they wait for a short period of time when they are released. Where did they come from 'West of Hot Hot Dog'? Maybe it's 'hot dog!' Sexual conversation was made by American scholars in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> The collaborators of 'West of Hot Hot Dog' and collaborated by Joe Rock. In many of his other accomplishments, Rock Laurel was introduced to Louis Nielsen, and was the best man after their marriage. Complete disclosure: In the last years of his life, I was a friend of Joe Rock and had great privileges to interview him. At about nine o'clock at the time, rock memory is clear ... but he did not remember any mention of 'West of hot dog' and I can not blame him. <br /> <br /> The name of the famous lady is named Little Mustard: I do not get it to be a parody of 'Pecos West'. There are some 'impossible' garments, including Laurel's method for horse mounting. For just a moment in the film, Stan Laurel suddenly went on to remind me of the great Buster Keaton. The theme of 'West of Hot Hot Dog' and Keaton's short comedy 'The Frozen North' is unclear, but Keaton's version is very ridiculous. The film's story is somewhat worse for Keaton's character in the 'Our Hospitality' but it suffers in comparison (again): Here, the two tough Warmint brothers have the chance to gain the legacy of Last Chance Saloon, but the previous owner has helped to weaken the tenderfront Stan. However, Stan's death would be the legal heirs of the brothers. <br /> If seriously, however: is such a lawful act? As soon as Stan acquired the property, any questions of the owner or inheritance take his decision, not the previous owner's decision. <br /> <br /> At one point, some raw animation is directly dragged into the image stack. <br /> <br /> This hot dog is not a winner but a winner. My rating: A Point Out 10. Hang On, Stan: In a few years you have half of a comedy legend.
