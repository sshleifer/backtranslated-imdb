This reminds me of a believer who was born when I was a minster. I never thought I was either graduate or graduate from high school because I was always positive, and I would rapture Heaven before it ever happened. It was before I discovered that a group of Christianity was the worst. I am an atheist now and Christians tell us that "once saved" doctor is more than those ghosts. If this is true, why have I been born again after years of believing in God? Yes, I was really saved. <br /> When Christians read their Bible, they think that rapes, misunderstandings, miscarriages, and many other atrocities are in harmony with her. They are surprised to learn where the word "rapture" is.
