My friend bought 5 for this film? (Which is not even 1 per cent), because they wrote on the American. But we'll soon find out that there is a long way from American to top to the worst piece. It's not even a comic, really really like really bad documentary. The story is not bad, the film and the sound also sucks. They put some alcohol, chicks, dwarfs and sedatives in teens. And the outcome is a disaster. If you do not buy this movie, spend your money on something else, that's fine. If you want to harass yourself, do not invite your friend / friends, if you really hate them and you would like to get rid of them.
