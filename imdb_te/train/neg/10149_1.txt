I can not believe Steven Seagal's career will be a lot less, and he has been reduced to make 4th film films with 5th Rated Second Actors. I saw this move that some people look forward to removing the trash as he usually does. Using a single judo ax between the shoulder blades to expel an opponent and he will make the bricks a bit like a ton. <br /> <br /> The story is unbelievable, if you do not forgive visuals, and if you read this story as a novel, you may end up wondering why you took the book. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal goes through the movements, doing only this because he is only under obligation. <br /> <br /> I hate to repeat other people's comments, but I hate using stock footage for cut scenes and scenes. Flights in the airplane are curious. The scenes that are cut in those scenes are unstable and the scenes have deteriorated over time. <br /> <br /> It is true that you can not waste your time watching this movie. It is not up to the standards in his work. Glimmer Man or Exit Wounds The film is a 12 million dollar budget (paid 5 to Segal) and has read a review that the film is still in the budget. It's not surprising that the dramatic owner of the movie is playing this movie and it's a DVD movie.
