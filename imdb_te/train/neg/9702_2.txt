I do not think this film is rated correctly. <br /> I took my copy and blocked the PG rating and wrote the R. It has a scene in the forest with many Indian women. I do not know about you, but it's not for the little kids to see. True, it might be a traditional "dress style" of African (?) Indians, but ... I want to give partial nudity a ray rating. <br /> I did not see the movie recently, but I guess otherwise it is alright.
