The birthday girl does not know what it wants - it's a comedy, it's a play ... it just does not know. Very funny or touching film ends in any human land. The premise contains enough script that is filled with interesting scenes, but rarely distributes and pets. If you look at the cast this is a real shame - it's great, but they are not likely to shine. Very frustrating.
