Seriously. <br /> <br /> Plot - Without a mother and 3 "dodds" family to grow 3 small girls in San Francisco, California. The characters - Neat Freak Danny, cartoon beloved Joey, rose jessie, spoiled bratle Michel, stupid DJ, and almost ordinary Stephanie. Do you really want the creators of this show to really hate characters? <br /> I do not think anyone would see this presentation. <br /> <br /> I chuckled in a few moments in the entire run of the show and instead of killing injections, all criminals were forced to see the show, 10 or: D
