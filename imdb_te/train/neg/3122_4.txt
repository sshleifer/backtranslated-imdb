Robin Williams and Toni Clayte: I have not given a bad rating or bad review for two reasons. The film is a thriller and some minor underpinnings, which are prepared for mental issues, and the film can focus slightly. Robin Williams plays the role of Gabriel Noon, who plays the role of the time diazey, who goes through personal problems: his girlfriend moves and appears to be a case of Gabriel Storytellers Black. One day he reads and reads a story written by a 14-year-old boy named Pete Bolland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and the story of his parents' suffering. He lives with his adopted mother and social worker, Donna Bolland (Tony Collate). Gabriel is fascinated and starts friendship with Pete, but Gabriel tries to meet him and finds that Pete Bolland may not exist. If I do not want to spoil the picture, go to the details, but I will tell you: this is very imaginable. The fascinating atmosphere for telling the story and good performances from Robin Williams and Tony Coletters is that I think it's the main character of the film. Collette is the most talented and lovely actress without question. Her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of her characters is very unusual and I hope she will see an Oscar win (hell, I think this might be the best supporting actress's approval to get this one better if I get the script better). The film begins as a mental thriller, but it is predictable. If you're interested in knowing the ending and twists of the film, look at that picture, otherwise I'll rent another imaginative thriller called "Suppose and Wish".
