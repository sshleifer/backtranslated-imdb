<br /> <br /> Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam's (John Abraham) characters were not properly built before Mac's owner was hit with three air hostes. . <br /> <br /> In the cast, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor and I thought I was wasted. In the role of a moody cook. Akshay Kumar is reasonable, John Abraham is very bad and stays firm on furniture, while Rajpal Yadav is the only survivor in the film. <br /> <br /> Film is funny at times, but all in the DUD (songs are boring) and let go down if you're hoping for some perfect entertainment and comedy.
