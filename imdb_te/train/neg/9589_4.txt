This film is terrible if you care. If you dance colorful images on the screen it's the right film - everything that does not have a clear connection to the next. I rented the movie because I was a David Bowie fan, and I really appreciated the music. In the end, Bowie is in the film for ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences are contrary and remain desirable. The moral value of this story is really serious. I can not say if in the 1950s about the racial issues in London or not. For the first half of the film I was chuckling at how cheesy but I liked the campiness of the "selling" message. When blacks were murdered I thought my tape had come in a mess. Have I rented half of two different movies? No, there is a "Put White White" song and dance scene. Sorry, but WWII does not mean you can write about a music. I thought many times in this review, not at least a musical called "musician". Overall, I will say that the film is very good if it makes its brain and cast good actors. (And for goddammit it put David Bowie!) My Grade: C-
