In short, the film has some weak acting and somewhat confusing rhythm and speeds that contain a part of a weak 1st law, some of which can be somewhat confusing and intrusive, casting some staggering moment and some low performances, and the 3rd Act ... No 3rd law! <br /> <br /> About the 3rd act, the film just ends suddenly. There is no resolution from the climax of section 2 and there is no way, so there is not much 3rd law. Bad guys die and that; The end credits roll. There is nothing to show what's going on for the hero and the supporting roles and so on. The audience left the theater after the movie, "It's been?" <br /> <br /> The song has been working hard enough to provide this song, but it is absolutely nothing. It's just functional, but it can be achieved by simple and derivative. It is obvious that some percussion of the score is planted with the use of synthetic tinpani for some. What impressed me about the score was some of the tensioned musical movements that emerged from James Horner's "48 HRS". <br /> <br /> In spite of all this, the heroine's good looks, it's good for the film, with weak acting and a little different move. </ p> <p> </ p> <p> In fact, the third story has not properly completed the story, and this limitation is important and unforgivable because it does not allow the movie to satisfy satisfactorily. This is probably the screenplay or, perhaps, the image of the budget that has to be taken to make the 3rd step in the picture (but I guess why I do not have the 3rd law). Whatever the reason, the sudden end really hurts the overall picture. <br /> <br /> If you are interested, this view is good and you have 3 laws (starting, middle, end). <br /> If you do not receive the MST3K version, do not waste your time at least if you do not laugh.
