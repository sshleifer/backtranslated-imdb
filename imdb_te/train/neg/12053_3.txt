As always, it is an inappropriate image of the homeless. TV says it's too much about panhandlers in the early 1990s and everyone says it's bad, and we've all made $ 100 a day when we're close to reality $ 20-40 a day. Wherever I worked, wherever the worker was taking, I worked, and if I could physically do it, I worked and took the job. If I gave 100,000 dollars, at least 2 years, and kept a lot in the bank and still $ 1-200 for $ 10-20000 for $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash games in casinos. I have always won and I can get better if I have bankcrail. Instead of winning $ 1000 per month, it's always a minimum buyout because there is no risk of losing it all. I was frustrated because I could not spend my money and broke, and sometimes I had $ 1000-2000 in my elegance when I was sleeping outside. Anyone wanting to talk to the sevenord2003 contacted on yahoo messenger.i I admit it is different than most homeless I actually, as I drank smoke or took medication. I'm still homeless, now in the government home for $ 177 a month and getting SSI and spending most of my time at online poker. Mom and sunflower worked hard to get me SSI extensive. It's been my day to hide in the night's sleep at the Casino Convention Center, ending with a sense of security in the end. This TV staff took me very quickly. It is not good for anyone to whom they choose.
