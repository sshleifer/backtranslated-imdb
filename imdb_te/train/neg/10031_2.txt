I saw the movie in the theater. There are some good points to talk about the movie. Kareena's beauty and some songs. That's it. This film is full disappointment in all areas. Anyone who is associated with the film is disappointed, and the Mumbai Indians (now Chennai reached the semi-finals). <br /> I think about the movie. Now Bollywood tries to copy the action scenes from Hollywood. But they forget that the Hollywood directors are very effective in their appearance. But unfortunately Bollywood directors do not have much time. They spent their songs singing. Such a stupid action scenes can be worked in the South if some of the viewers are just killing a favorite actor. But it does not work perfectly in Bollywood. I sent all the action scenes. In the end, there are not even some Chinese to fight Akbar Kumar. The height of this stupidity. The audience does not pay to see such stupidity. I think Bollywood should now forget about Action Movies. They can not do that. The last good action I saw came from "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyan Ka Khiladi". The current scenario in Bollywood is really sad for fans of action movie like me. Will these people see their movie after they are finished? Can not they determine that the slow motion action (which is done using the ropes) is quite unrealistic and childish? If you can not handle it, you should not have the views of the scenes. I want to go to the Amitabh Age, which has thrilling action scenes like Zanjeer and Deewar. The sound effect was not effective in those days, but visually it was much better than the present-day scenes. <br /> <br /> The film should now open the eyes of Bollywood film directors. Please do not take more action movies before you can get the real art of making.
