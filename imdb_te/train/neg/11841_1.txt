What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a wise director, a trail blazer ... is now scrambling too ... this is the same person who visited this "The Last Picture Show"? Here, he takes a bit of interesting (but far away) campus and turns into bubble gum, the moment you take the first bite will lose the flavor ... Dante is not bad, but Izzard Chaplin is wrong and all the other actors appear for their "looks" , And not because they are right for the episode. Very bad. I'll go back to "Paper Moon".
