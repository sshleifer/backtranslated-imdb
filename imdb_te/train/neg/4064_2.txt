The film is very boring, it's a female gas station owner and tells the story of her life. Exciting occasionally happens. The director really "actually put" and treats her as a camera around a woman who has lived her life. I had to see the other director of this director for a class, others are not boring. This film is also looking for an assignment ... it's a good array of boring good! Overall, do not watch the movie, except for sure. But do not disclose other films through the film director because they are not bad ... and do not disclose other movies about Africa, they are generally good, especially when doing a western director.
