I saw this in a lazy summer afternoon at risk. It is played on HBO's Family Programming Channel. At first I was drawn by what I thought was a Disney animation. But, after a few minutes, I found I was looking for a remote, so if you could find the 'Info Button', to find out what's on my TV in the world. I do not have anything against Harvey FC, I am very happy with his movies, but one thing he is a voice over artist. He is definitely one of the more unique voices in Hollywood, but it works only as part of a larger visual package. Attach his voice to a cute duck looking slightly more difficult. The rest of the cast is uninteresting. <br /> <br /> This weak voice talent, strong animation ... Who is the target of this film? Gay turtle ducks? I can not get it. There is really such a famine of role models for young people and upcoming homosexuals, we need to resort to animated ducks? Beautiful story, and as the title, this film I found it difficult to love, like an ugly duckling.
