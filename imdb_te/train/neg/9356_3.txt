Marilyn Miller made just three films before his premature death - a wonderful Sally (1929), comedy her MAJESTY LOVE (1931), and this exaggeration - Sunny (1930). It was very poor in the opening actress and a musical effort - although she had four dance numbers, she sang only two songs (WHO and ONE MAN ALONE). The spritely dismissed the remaining score, including the title tune, yet we can hear in background score scoring. Miller is overweight and unhealthy here - the quality of all the stars. Her dance is also hypocritical. The film is very bad, filled with old and untold jokes and stupid situations. If you're interested in Miller as an actress, check it for everything, but stay away for a general fun.
