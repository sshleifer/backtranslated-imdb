When I was away at camp, I recall when I was young and we would be camping under the stars. There is always a good story to tell you to take part in forests around us and they will kill me forever. Well, when I found Wendigo at the library, I checked it out as hoping to be one of those movies that had a supernatural chase in the woods people like stories that were told at Camp. Well, most of my anxiety, I have been so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. This story starts, and three families go to their winter cabin, there is nothing like your normal suburban home and a cabin in the woods, and they run on a deer. Well, it seems that native rednecks actually this particular deer hunt and are pretty upset at our city folklore. Instead of moving to the point of the film, the family spends a lot of time following daily activities. It's really up to the last 15 minutes that we really are "Vendigo." My suggestion is that you have to stay away from this film too. It will leave you wanting to return your hour and a half.
