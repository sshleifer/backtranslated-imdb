Apparently many people really like this, but I found infantilising and reasonably offensive codswallop, saving from Oblivion by Jane Russell and memorable music numbers, especially the opener (but later was a noticeable dip in innovation). I do not dream with Monroe - she's not dumb, it's dumb, but she's just dumb. Russell is not very convinced when she says she's never been in the gymnasium, but it's not amazing. Men like the plot, are staggeringly uninteresting. Not bad, but haphazard, if it is a tradition, God helps us all.
