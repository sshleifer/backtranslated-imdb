Wendy Wu: The Homecoming Warrior has a very good, strong storyline but is ruined by cheesy detail throughout the movie. I'm still young and this film is not very fun. I think the effects were terrible, but they seem to be fun for little kids. Matrix destroys movement move, you know it is completely fake. Then there is in the yen, home in which an evil spirit temporarily have random people and strive to win silver. Wendy's and her Buddhist monk cousin Shen Yen (when ever permanently destroying him) is a good feeling to all. So Wendy learned a lesson ... Blah, Blah, Blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
