All of the love for it (named after the weekend) Captain St. Ives is a romantic drama involving a French officer in the Napoleonic army captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland. Young maiden who visits prison <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] Somewhat episodic but I have done well for all of this and it is a good cast featuring Miranda Richardson, Anna Farrell, Richard E. Grant, Michael Guff and Jason Isaacs. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised if the film is not received after the movie is broadcast on BBC2. Captain St Ives is on the couch with a whore that completely separates a prostitute and is not clear about the murder of a French prisoner's baton with a full frontal male nudity. You really do not worry if the BBC schedule has any type of clue what they are doing
