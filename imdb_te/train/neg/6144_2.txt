Ironically, although he can "splits", Thomas is full of an actor. <br /> <br /> The film saw my memory and was one of the most striking and ineffective films I had ever seen. Also, I really like it. <br /> <br /> However, the reason is that the actor has a great look and its small, muscular body is more fun to exhibit a variety of gymnastic skills on rocks and columns that are unusual in shape, including the eastern European country (including the innocent "pommel horse" Thomas is in the middle of the village square with a very dark figure, including his face in the face of various mad villagers Used to plant). But let the poor man open his mouth and try to emotionally, and the illusion that he may have a movie career is immediately drawn to bits. <br /> <br /> Thomas did not necessarily mean he was not really the actor. Actors, directors, editors, camera boys, etc. all those in the movies are at least bad or bad, and most of them are experts. So you might think Kurt does not come off as bad as a lot. <br /> <br /> If anyone ever asks me to star in a martial arts film, I will kick a guy on the face of Thomas.
