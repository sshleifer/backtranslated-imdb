First, the film is slowly moving Glasse, and I'm losing patience with many viewers in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> The subject matter of this film is a fantastic picture; <br /> <br /> I see a mountain-like lion by the writer Launford Wilson, because this is very unfortunate. <br /> <br /> I am a good script for this movie, a similar filmmaker, with the same flavors and the same actors (I think) who really does not have the opportunity to impress me), an old boy goes through the boy when a powerful "love" develops Pains and struggles may have been able to present a meaningful and touching description <br /> <br /> Without this Foundation, And, with no narrative, intelligent structure (for example, after looking at it, you can not climactic scenes, and instead, without a good plot, we will never be interested <br /> <br /> <br /> Without a good storyline, dramatic devices and surrealist liberties spread to story-line   డానికి కాకుండా గందరగోళంగా మరియు గందరగోళంగా మారాయి. <br /> <br /> "లేహ్" యొక్క సృష్టి మరియు నేను చాలా మంది ప్రేక్షకులు ఆమె టెలిఫోన్ కాల్స్ చిత్రీకరించిన సాంప్రదాయ పద్ధతిలో పూర్తిగా అడ్డుకోవచ్చని నేను నమ్ముతాను. ఉదాహరణకు, నేను అన్నింటిని సిఫార్సు చేయలేను అని నేను భయపడుతున్నాను. Instead of all the usual restorations of the original films in the first release, what did the film like this film not be rebuilt by an enthusiastic filmmaker? It's a good script written by good writers with good writers, and I think this film has become an unforgettable classic about the aspect of the male coming ages that rarely deal with in drama. <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ br> I look in very few comments saying this movie to people about something "gay" thing, and I think I'm mistaken. Apparently, the "crush" is a newly teenaged boy from an old teenage boy, but Logan's role is settled in specific sexual choices and in his handcrafted imagery, sexually and sexually explicit and all stimulus, we expect him to be a very young kid. I believe that Logan was "torn" in adult male adolescents who wanted women to take a decision on sexual partners.
