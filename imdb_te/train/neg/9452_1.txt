I'm looking forward to seeing this when it's in production but it's big. Far away from Dr. Suss's weird world. I did not think that Dr. Suss had accepted that it was uncomfortable and unpleasant. How nice Christmas is that Grinch has stolen. I mean it has some miniature adult jokes but my kids still have to catch up. Cat dishonest shots in the hat while they are much more than I liked. Dr. Suss is growing up It really bothers me to see how this timeless classic trash on the big screen .Harton A Who I hope is that they do justice to this doctor suss.
