Yes, this movie I feel real horror, when I realized that I paid for it and spent more than 1 in my life trying to see it. The bald man was just a mental-jackie seal to me and the girl was the worst actress I had ever seen. Avoid this picture of me if you appreciate your time, I need a film that needs money and some movies do not have that money but it's not a stupid plot and no justification for bad acting. I always support independent movies, when it comes to support, but movies like this have badly named these films. I'm still suffering. I do not believe in any good cover anymore.
