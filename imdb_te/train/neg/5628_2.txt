I'm not artistically inclined. I was a science-minded woman and I felt this film was probably one of those campy arts genres in a budget. I saw a part of my fiancé and my future daughter's daughter. We tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest. My fiancé and his daughter voted for it and we went to the 13th of Ocean and another story. I woke up the next morning and gave another shot. I started watching this film again. I can not get it, I thought I would get it. I wanted to find the blades by the stove used as a vase for the appearance of the dead flowers and to make the layers of the scorpion and salt to be flattened. Interestingly and still it is dead stuff inside. This is an odd and strange picture. Maybe this is what they do next, but I will be betrayed for the second time!
