It is a very soft and inexpensive product in Shakespeare's most powerful plays. I can imagine that it is intended to be easy and accessible to audiences who are not open to Shakespeare in advance. If this is done - each line is clear and intentionally clear - they have spaced the life of the play and converted into a flat sarcasm. <br /> <br /> Benedick as Don Pedro and Douglas Watson is the best act - Sam Waterson is unforgettable. Others, however, do not behave well. The hero of April Shawnham is a pouty, breathtaking flare-up often stimulates winces. Jerry Meyer's Don John is a staggering cartoon character on Snidely Whiplash (Snydley is very enjoyable). <br /> <br /> Murray Abraham (who killed Mozart) is not in this version, but if he is not disguised and his name is removed from the credit. <br /> <br /> <br /> The producer, Joseph Pop, is primarily a theater god, this product is disappointing but scratching over the head. <br /> Do not be bothered. Instead of Branagh's Much Ado see - his version is filled with vitality and humor, to say nothing of amazing performances.
