I see this in the Science Fiction channel. I can not stop seeing it terrible! I'm a videographer and this film makes me sad. I feel bad about anyone who is associated with this movie. Some camera work is fine. Very questionable. There are some good actors in the film. They surrounded the director's relatives. The only way they would have qualified to be in an image! Music is better than acting. Hope this is because I'm definitely not the other choice if you get around looking at this! The sequel (yes sequel) is now coming ... I'll skip it! Jason
