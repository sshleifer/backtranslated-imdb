I was already one of my favorite role-playing games in The Dark. When I was trying to escape that house, I had spent the entire nights facing the PC screen and reminded me that I was afraid at times when I was actually surprisingly charging monsters. Now I'm thinking of you - I'm tired of "computer game-created" movies. I do not recognize the only success of this new Hollywood generation, although some people like to be watchful. And yet, I'm a big fan of the inexhaustible game. My rationality is that if the film has a very similar platform, it will be okay. <br /> Man, 90 minutes of my life (like 300). If I had that chance, I would have happily spent repetitioning my sock drawer instead of them. It is also not in the "funny bad" category. You feel that the Christian slater also has some feelings rather than joining this stump bomb. Now, Tara Reed ... I do not complain about her existence. However, the intention to keep a romantic scene in this chick - I fully understand and support (hey, I'm a man!) - I saw her in more magazines. <br /> <br /> There are no plots to talk about. I'm sticking to you your time. The credibility of the story drops down 'I'm not sexually linked to Ms. Lewinsky'. <br /> <br /> In this film, there are some actors on 'Street Fighter' One of the worst movies I've ever seen is video game. It's good story, acting and more thrills. For the film, there's a spoiler - it sticks! Wait for the porpo version.
