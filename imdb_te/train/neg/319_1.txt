The friend of mine bought this film for £ 1, and it was also over-priced too. Although the big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the most talented Burt Young have been featured, the film is taking a chisel and moving straight from your throat. <br /> <br /> Adams Sandler plays a waiter role on a cruise ship that breaks the audience with the sundler talks, and breaks the fourth wall intently. It wants to be a successful comedian to succeed women. The ship's resident comedian - his unmistakable success to the opposite sex, is thought to be defeated in the shadowless 'Dicky' - the sea, where Sander's role is a big break. Dickie did not die, he was locked up in a sea of ​​illness rather than in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Maybe he wants to get all the worst pictures from his mouth.
