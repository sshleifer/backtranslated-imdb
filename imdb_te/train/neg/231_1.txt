It starts with bad, junior high school wussies their gin tells the story of the endless cigarettes and the best 'man' sitting around with sitting around with the caramel chocolate treatment, and it gets worse - - spoiler warning = - When Andy was 14 when she was 14 As the young student of the student is falling (she is the head of an English school, Mmakam or not), the adhesive phral-hell 'girlfriend'. .. And from there, it is basically an unwatchable claptrap: she ends up with 3 women as her 'ally' apologize and organ player's love child and they started, more drinking gin and more cigarettes blah blah blah smokers. Andy's role throws Caramel chocolates on the street, in an exciting attempt to point to growth. Show mercy.
