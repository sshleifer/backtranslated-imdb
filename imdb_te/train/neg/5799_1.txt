The film was mirrored by the fact that I had the most rented art and jacket behind you. After popping up on my DVD player, I've tested the jacket cover and though I was covered out of the plastic viewer, I could not read any product details about the film. The film was named Jaavette by the name of the film and it was spotted by visiting the Faith Films website to find any link in IMDb. <br /> <br /> The painting and the special effects are good in the film ... Then, the line-reading actor spoke. Oh dear ... The actor's reading has sounded like a high school joke faced by some acne, whose voice was able to change the pitch and there was no effort to read the lines from the script. At first I thought I got a bad disc from audio synchronization, then I got a foreign film survey from it since I could not read the jacket ... dubbing English dialogue. If they cast the right person for dialogue dubbing, this picture is fine. I'm not going to kill the bad line reader, but after I found out that I should be consistently a major player I gave it 20 minutes before the outside. Yes, it's bad! The art of jacket cover art and the art of the film is very good, so give a star, but there are 1,999,999 stars for the collapsed dialog. I do not recommend this one!
