American has gone far from the first. At first I do not have a clue what their actors do and instead believe it's just a remake of a college party gone nuts. Story Two freshman college boys (featuring the young stifler) Just Late Night parties, sex and course booze to establish college dreams to attend. Plots come apart from the stupid and original top. <br /> <br /> Fortunately I work in the video store and can rent it for free. But if you do not enjoy boorish sex movies with absolute nudity and frantic drinking, keep in mind that time is wasted. I'm in the teen and I also believe I'm a good choice instead of Evan Almighty.
