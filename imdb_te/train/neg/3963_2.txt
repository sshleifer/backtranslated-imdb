How many times do we see how to move and walk through the reflection of the mirror? This staggering, poorly completed film has been a recent memory & four dozen times in two dozen films. Only two fantastic movements are appreciated .... When the devil occupies the personal places of the two characters. Talking about the characters, acting is flat as dough coke in 64 oz. The cup was drawing from me. Side roles were pulled from various Scooby Doo cartoons. Friendly, aged sheriff. Cookie Weirddo, who lives in backwoods with the Alabama drum. The baby was the worst of the worst film ever since the development of 'Chakras'. But it's more interesting to learn about the murder of the child, they learned that she died & her parents were hard to co-ordinate with her community and the death of one. When they arrived in the cabin, the scenes rarely flowed in the same way ... there's the glass of the dead daughter's pictures. Oh ... and strange sounds are also overdone. I know what you say ... opening up the doors that open themselves, the cricket in the forest, and so on. Ooooohhhh. It has not seen before. Again, let's look at the excellent self-door door in the movie. Director Director: A scary scene is only scary if not every 5 minutes in the same movie. "It's a wrap!" Think of these things before calling.
