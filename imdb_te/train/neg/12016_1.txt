If Bob Ladlum sees this mini series, he is crying. Time and money are completely ruined. While I have read the book and movies are not right, CBS wasted time and money at this time and was embarrassed to say that it was Ludlum's work. <br /> <br /> Poor Mira, Blair, Angelica and Colm, why are they signed in to this low level? <br /> Horrible !!
