When it first came into the 1970s, the movie hated, hated, hated! The film I have never seen in my life has been so easy. It is not known that Lee has inspired him but this is one of the films you want to shake the characters to open their mouths and get them to communicate. There is no savvy movements in the film because longtime silence is long with people who can not feel how long they are (unexpectedly) feeling. If you want to see something that you take to drink, this is the one for you. If you do not have anything good to do for two hours then stick a tok for a toaster: you will be infinitely more enjoyable than anything you will get from this! Yes, Lai came up with a lot of really worthwhile stuff after much in her career but give this a miss.
