I'm ashamed to have this movie in my collection. A small image of the most redundant factor bonus features to own the DVD. My vote for this film is big fat jerly. Do not misunderstand me, I'm a horror girl. But I want some meat on the back of the story, I can not be fooled in watching, not to say that humans prefer bad happen, what made it look like forever, animal snuff clips. The actions of cruelty inappropriately disrupted silence and poor performance. If I was forced to make another image comparison, the only one who comes to mind is a Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, pointless and a completely uncomfortable watch.
