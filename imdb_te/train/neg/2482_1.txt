(Plenty of spoilers) This is a completely awful movie. It was originally from that medium. I guess he made a career in playing super dancing dods. Okay the first time he tried to frighten his son by pretending to be a monster ... but then 10 minutes later they cloyingly made it again! So it goes, this picture separates at the time of truth. At one point, I started shooting for a few days, until the story was only the next day ... early afternoon yet! I do not really know what this couple should be in real life. First of all they have grown up the Manhattan yuppie couple and have a kid. But they drive an old blue Volvo. Those varieties have stopped driving decades ago by Volvos. Today they drive prizes. But in 2002, I'm still sure they did not drive volvos. <br /> <br /> It's OK, it's silver. A "mysterious Indian man" boy gives a little magic Wendigo statue and tells about its powerful magic. Simone ... We are still ancient Indian mysteries. To drive home, they pan every Indian statue in every tourist trap of New York City. American Indians have been filmed in the film which has not been seen in decades! Oh and about silverie. He was not actually the cause of horror. He is the most terrible thing in the film which does not kill Kid's father ... he just murdered a simple hook with a revenge and a high-powered rifle. Wendigo only comes out at the end of the film to take revenge for the man who kills the father ... oh, but wait, it seemed that he was kind of insane at Wendigo's father because perhaps a deer was killed ... so then Wendigo /> <br /> <br /> Previously unhealthy, boring and involuntary. There is no reason to see this movie.
