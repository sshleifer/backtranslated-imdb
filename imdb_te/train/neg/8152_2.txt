"Do not drink water" is an unbelievable bad picture. It was created based on the 1966 Broadway drama by Woody Allen. This is Jackie Gleeson, the comic genius behind "The Honeymooners". Director, Howard Morris has starred in several Mel Brooks comedies (Life Stinks, High Ambition, Silent Movie) and he reminisces in animation ("Foo", Jughead (Archie) and Beatle Bailey. > The problem is that I've worked very seriously before it's effective. Allen's realistic drama is in the tongue-in-cheek, which has worked on Broadway and works in Allen's 1994 remake. R.S. Screenplay of Allen and Harvey Bullock beat the mantle of death and made many changes from the original game. Creating a media for Gleason's wife in this version is her originality, an example of why it does not work. <br /> Acting is not better. He is physically happy, but he can not save it. Gleason is a comic intellectual, but he is a good actor when he plays in "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain". His surgeon could work here, but the lousy script did not give him the chance. Very bad. Estelle Parsons' airhidden wife will drive you nuts after 20 minutes. Take it as soon as you can get her throat. It was also a shame because she was a good performer in two extraordinary performances in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel", and none of the other actors played well. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hates the film earlier, and in 1994 he rebuilt the film with the heroes of himself and Julie Kvner (Marzie Simpson). They manage to hit all the right notes and the image itself is a comic masterpiece. This is finally in the video after a long struggle over the rights. Go out and see that version. <br /> <br /> 1969 The original is unwanted by the guests. <br /> <br /> In the 4 stars,
