Well, during the last Thanksgiving break, everyone decided to see a movie together with the whole family and went on to say that Fred Klaus voted as the majority. <br /> <br /> There are many plot holes to start the film, which is curious. The general explanations for what happened to a specific event have been emptied. Example; Who is heck trying to close Santa Clause? Is this a sort of corporation? A little explanation is lovely. <br /> Second: This film throws silent characters that have no sympathy for you about your feelings or actions. For example: Elf is the only elf in elf and elf village. They see each other twice and after that they are a couple and I can not think of it because I do not care about this movie. <br /> <br /> Third: I thought I would think this is a family film? Its rating is just low at PG. There are many articles of reference dialogue for family image. It does not bother me, but if I am a parent, I see the problem. <br /> <br /> Palm Gammitie is very bored with his role through the whole movie, but honestly he is the only one in the film. Vaughan has some funny moments, but he has played the same role in the last two films. Mouth freed boy. <br /> <br /> There is nothing against Vaughn, he is good in other films. <br /> <br /> This film receives the fourth 10 stars from me. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I will definitely pass this film, or if you want to save it for a rainy day rental.
