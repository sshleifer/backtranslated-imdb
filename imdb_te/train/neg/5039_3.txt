Rex Reed said of a film (specifically "Julia and Julia"), which seemed to have been filmed by pomegranate juice. I remembered that I was stabbed by purple butterfly. <br /> <br /> The story is boring and the scenes are a large number of actors' faces that come out of focus or focus only after long time. <br /> Also, everyone looked the same, so it's hard to distinguish between characters. I call this "Dead Poet's Society" Syndrome. <br /> <br /> There is no one to dramatically interest, and this movie is a very interesting time and set <br /> <br /> The whole frustration.
