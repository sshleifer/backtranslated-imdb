Another case of a good DVD case has cheated shots on the quality of the video in the movie. <br /> That's not bad. Rochen is a servant job and Damon! The cast is good. I have never seen a lot of muscular boys staying together regularly. You wanted to think this film was really Rochen Killer, but it was not. My biggest problem with the film is that, finally, I did not take much care as a killer, and the real killer is less than you, from blue and filmmakers thinking hey, beta sucker! Yes, there are continuity deficiencies (mainly with MS Rochen with a changing wardrobe), but it's not bad for an indie slasher. I'm pretty sure at the beginning it's not just a thinly veiled to go without the girls, but it's just a gimmick. <br /> If these conversations do not happen, it's not bad. And Lloyd Kaufmann Cameo was awesome.
