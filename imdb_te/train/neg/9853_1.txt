I think most people believe that everyone has exceptions and the film is unattainable to try that absolute exploitation. The performance is very interesting, well presented and the status of graphics art, but does not work from the scientific point of viewpoint. Is hydrogen flying bladers? They should be used as a mock truck size. And then there is a possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, do not actually pass it. Some people always misunderstand it. All of the movies are all fun, but I found it constantly saying "oh brother, what a load ...." If you like a duplicate documentary, this is instead a spinal pump. Or at least off the sound.
