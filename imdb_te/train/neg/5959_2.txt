<br /> What three words can guarantee a horrible picture of you? Cheap Canadian production. Brain is perfect for those words. Terrible script, idiot acting and happy special effects make this a must for every BAD movie fan. The horror is fun. The post-production team looks like it's given. In the second half Bryne does what is admirable, it tries to be really good! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke? <br /> It is at Christmas time. One of the villains was always murdered by a mother and daughter. <br /> <br /> The next day, a rebel will face difficulties in sending for a psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> When a police head was thrown into blood, he had a stranger with blood on him and who did you believe? When the brain is trying hard, the funny starts to get thicker and boring. A child can not threaten the threatening moments. The brain is very funny to try and make a feeling awkward. Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and its colleagues get credit for pulling some of the worst performance I've ever seen. The viewer's discretion is high.
