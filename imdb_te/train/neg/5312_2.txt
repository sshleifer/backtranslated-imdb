The horrible trash from director Fred Olen Rei about the female cyborg hunter (Tigan) set up by Warden John-Michael Vincent to find and execute the escaped alien explorer Ross Hagen on the geographical chart. Soon the forest ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect the group of obnoxiously hammy college children who are unpleasant Richard Wiley's who ran Hagen with his RV on a camping trip unfortunately has gone. Cyborg would soon be laser with his hand, with an innocent alcoholic doctor (Robert Quarry of Count Yorga-Vampire Glory), who had decided to hide the exploitation, whose caller tracking device would undermine his body. <br /> <br /> Lome Gordon finds a friend in an old Vietnam War vet that has many weapons in his cabin. <br /> Maybe delusionally terrible, these "amused cinema" effects, acting, and mantle. At least, for the film PJ Soles for some eye candy .. Even in '89, she is very smoky. That laser gun is definitely funny .. When firing at the Cyborg Law, it burns some places in the house and marks the vacant spot.
