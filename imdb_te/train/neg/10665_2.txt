For about three minutes I started fast forwarding, only pause during nudity (why are such good women in bad movies?). I'm done in ten minutes, and I think I can get my money back from the rental store. People who write these movies must be granted MPAA. Raw on the writers - bad guys always get into the bombing car activated by the remote person's remote control! It was completed from the days of the Ottoman Empire! In addition, the inclusion of injury as a disgrace, in the end, "Twist" has come from any action film written in the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds is good, but he should focus on real films. <br /> <br /> This movie just wasted time - run away! Gone!
