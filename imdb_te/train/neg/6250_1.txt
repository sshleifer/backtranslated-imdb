I did this really once. I mean, I have understood all the errors. This is unreal. I'm fiction, but it's not a bit bit reliable. Here's why. ** Spoilers Are Moving Forward ... ** Do you really believe that a child like Yugai comes from the pharaoh of ancient Egypt? C'mon! He is the biggest nerd on the face of the earth. And what is the hair (a.k.a. Atem and / or Yami's) hair? <br /> I saw the last time, Pharaohs were excluded from the small hair on top of the head and wore fancy hats. <br /> <br /> And how can a fairly wealthy boy-intellectual genius sito-sieba and have a time to go to a clameless little school like 'Damino Hai' can run legally successful business? Puh-leeze! First off, he'd run an organization legally to be an adult. And because he can only grow adult in his class, that makes him a kid genius all too much. And second off, why should he attend a school like 'Domino Hai', when his business has succeeded successfully to his business to attend a fancy snobby academy? Plus, the side plot with his little brother are so sappy and lame. Every time you are going, you kidnapped the kid for kyans. <br /> New nothing is new. <br /> <br /> Joey is a poor boy. Joey says he can make all the money to attend his school, because his father is drinking, but you do not always see anything similar to Joey's work. He did not even mention the work. And his sister is full of mourning. Why did she choose a snap like Duke on a nice guy like Tristan (wearing her brother in a dog costume and publicly insulting him on television)? Is not she really clueless? Various characters in this program, demon possession, demonic forces have been stolen, and suffering from mental illness. (Oh, it's not child-safe). Tea is a typical girl-side door type, whose purpose is Yugai / Yami's girlfriend. When she has some cool points, she does not have enough time to shine as the main character. <br /> The animation is just awful. All the characters look sick and anorexic. <br /> <br /> "The Millennium Puzzle can send the souls back to their body." In this way, he stole Pegasus his soul, and saved himself in retrieving it When Yugi's grandfather did not save in the first place? <br /> <br /> It really is the trade of itself. <br /> <br /> It's the only plus side for "Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abranded Series" Little <br /> <br /> Please do more Anu. <br /> <br /> <br /> 1/2
