Reid Diamond plays the role of a man suffering from mental shelter for a decade after the surprise of blood-stained roads in his hands. Doctors want to test an experimental new drug that will return his lost memories if it works. But when drugs give him the ghosts of the ghost, he tries to escape. <br /> <br /> Outside, his stepfather (Greg Gr√ºngberg) friendships his mother with a misleading young man who can not be near the dark room in his basement and is generally suspicious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p> msgid "It is easy for a tad to figure out the general 'Mystery' film, I found acting to be enthralling enough to keep my eye on Mr. Diamond.
