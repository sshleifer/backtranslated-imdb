This means that this film kills me from Hollywood for a long time in Hollywood. It also makes sense when you think that people who love this movie just spilled countless songs in the story. However, the film is overrated and overwhelming. Eddie Murphy just looks ridiculous. Jeffrey Hudson and Beyonce Knowles had an overarched rate performance before the film. I can not believe that Condon was nominated for a directorial Oscar, when he put together all of an album. Glitz does not replace a storyline. A group does not make a film of songs.
