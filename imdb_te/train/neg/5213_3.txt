As others have said, the film is similar to THE FLY (two versions) and lesser known science fiction flick replicated states. The big difference is that these two films have done well and are good to know what they are doing. Metamorphosis has no benefits. METAMORPHOSIS It's an interesting science fantasy story, it's wrong actors who play wrong people and characters. <br /> <br /> This story is a genetic remedy for aging and death by scientist Dr. Peter Hausmann (Jean LeBrew). When the university works he threatens to cut funding, he decides to inject himself anti-aging serum into himself. Consequently, Dr. Houseman turns the rest of the movie slowly into a lizard. And oh yeah, seeing the good doctor is going to go through the process of becoming the lizard is great pleasure. It's great, it's fine. Some lines classic: "What is it?" <br /> <br /> Many reviews I have read on this topic are how stupid and ridiculous for the last five minutes of the film. I'll go ahead and spoil it: A good half-man, a half-man, appears to be a man in Godzilla costume that has been rejected from the half-lizard, when the police finally dropped him down. In the final scene, some bad kid tells him he will die forever, and the film's heroine Sally Donnelly (Catherine Baronov) decides that the little lizard is Dr. Hauseman's final incarnation. The camera then gives us close to the lip's face; This, I suppose, the path of the director showing us that the lizard is EVIL for us. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie because I was part of the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Megapack I bought. Most of these readers did exactly this because 50 DVDs were the only way to see the DVD in this DVD. If you have recently purchased a box set and can not see this movie, it's time for you, I've ruined the end for you. It is also possible to find this movie online for free.
