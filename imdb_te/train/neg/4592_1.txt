This film made me very angry. I was disappointed at the "scientists" and the missing film-makers. It's very painful to sit too. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way. The small good information on brain function / chemistry and quantum theory is the new ace horse sh * t in the ocean. Rampa and Joseph Dispensa cracked the worst offenders. Miss Dispenza informs us that many people lead to the lives of mediocrity and indicate us living on the other, obviously, the higher plane. I mainly admired the ideas and attitudes that I had a desire to refuse in such a huge hand, clumsy, superior, proud, and preheated manner. What I did most angry with me was that they really highlighted the depth of scientific thinking and destroyed them with their new age hokum. Many of them are based on the rotation of Quantum Theory's perceptions of the gross world. <br /> <br /> The dramatic episodes with Marley Matlin are inhuman and are in cliche. <br /> <br /> I would suggest people instead of a survey of the science of bill Bryson: "A Brief History of Early Everything." The truth is, in established science science, life and the universe are great.
