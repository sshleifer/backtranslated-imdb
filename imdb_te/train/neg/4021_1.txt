This is probably a bad picture associated with the name of Roger Corman. I was able to understand it in his early years when he had low budgets but nowadays there is no excuse for giving this birth! I put a "B" image wrong and put aside "Regular Audience" from all the people I love but this one takes my word, the Vampire Club makes the top of my list the worst of the worst thing .Imagine the vampire with no fangs, the music score is entirely in place , The sound effects are not just effective and finally Mr.Savage he is a wizard of all the witch There does not seem to know that it is looked very bad, "the career of any" bad "because of reasons. I'll forget about a good image when i do not like a picture I''f let's i'm hard for this one reason.
