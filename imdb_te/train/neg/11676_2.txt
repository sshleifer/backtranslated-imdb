In its cast, no movie can be seen with Madeleine Carroll. I added that this British film came close. The story takes place on the board "SS Atlantic" and is based on Titanic's unfinished voyage. The term "unsinkable" speaks, the liner hits an iceberg, and we hear you are a heavenly singer and you are the Lord God. Prohibited passengers eventually catch up with the tune of the song. But the year after the release of the film (1929) is to admit that many modern actors, such as Aboriginal sound and silent films, and many of the theater. These are not problems. The main flaw of the film is speeding up, and the pace is well developed in silence. However, if the dialog is distributed at realistic speed, half of the film's running time will be cut. The intentional effect drama (and clarity in a new medium), but as a result the indiscriminate is now tiresome. This film is different and unpredictable. In contrast, I have found some details of the most modern editing in technology: from one part of the ship to fine, sudden cuts, and sometimes sound effects. From the first shot we were on the board in the Atlantic, before we actually found out about 4 minutes. The ship's dance orchestra has long and intrusive music lines. (Entertaining, easy sound.) Individual stories are completely unbelievable and unbelievable. Not even think about entertainment. Berg is a small thing and it is an external damage as a small dent to the hull's hull. However, swarming passengers swarming into lifeboats - apparently demonstrates on a real liner, tied up to a dock - generating great excitement. Unlike the amazing Miss Carroll, these scenes are the best places of the film. As the power generators fail, the screen and the ship close to the end of the screen are very dark. Their final, ending blackout film tacked on a sunset / sunrise, a clumsy signal effect. The curiosity of the `Atlantic 'film. <br /> <br />
