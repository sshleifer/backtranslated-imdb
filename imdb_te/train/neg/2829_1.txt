The full potential of the worst, and fully aware people (the cast has six scissors). It was designed in 'contemporary' Africa, (which was made in 1979), and about slave trade. Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden reach the lowest level in this career), and no excitement has taken place. It is also ludicrously plotted. You do not believe in a minute how the characters act in these situations. Richard Fleischer directs you but you get the feedback on the telephone. It gets so bad.
