I remember when this piece came out of the trash, all the newspapers were brief about how the Barbra Streisand had taken years to get this picture. It did not take many years; The play began in 1975 in the past eight years. It was a Broadway actor of the great actress Tov Feldshow, perhaps the cast to star in the film, but NOOOOO ... Great Star Barraa told how to do his way. And less music! The whole catastrophe from the beginning of the film. Moreover, Barbara was old and she saw every minute. A young girl is eager to study Torah, and she does not have any chance of swallowing her. And when she dressed as a boy she would be camping. I am unable to stay unattractive, so she played with makeup; She is more beautiful than herself as a boy. And she's not enough, she's resorts and she does not know what she's doing when her school student Avigdor (whose best moment is the shot at the end of her naked) and her fianc√© (a normal schtick poor woman who is usually in general sleep, always the director ignores her). The yesteryear goes to the girl to marry; <br /> <br /> I do not care about the "wedding night" scene. <br /> <br /> Then there is music. <br /> <br /> "Straitsend does not shine of promise as director here; Some scenes are beautiful (especially on the back of Patinkin), and a good eye for her balance The problem with this film is not in her own way, and I do not trust her for a second in the title role; she never added songs, and the whole mess goes over two hours and fifteen minutes The. <br /> <br /> Forty-five minutes later, I'm sick of the whole sorry. <br /> <br /> terrible, awful, awful.
