OK When I saw the previews for this film I looked really scary and thought it was very happy to be grouped with me. I'm looking at things that are very cheating during this election in America, but this preview is top of the list. I can not see many people frightened by this film. I really saw two real jump scenes. The overall picture is quite predictable and maybe in some confusion with the jump scenes for me. I thought many people were afraid of sound effects, they thought it was funny. Where did oh and UHH slaughter come from and why? The worst sound in the whole image must be strange moaning. Will anyone be afraid? I can make that sound easier. Now that I'm not always wrong, those really terrifying films laughing at you laughing at all, but I did not understand this, it just went bad.
