I rarely believe that this idiocy, fierce, and badly demonstrated film is the filmmaker I have worked with. Feeling experiencing the experience of LADY and DUKE (and any other term "uninterrupted") is left in a relaxed mood, only by reading the IMDb user comment by ALi-112. Roghler tried to see the world through the 18th Century France genre (not only with success), as Eley highlighted (with the cost of separating her audience) and her inspirational inspiration by a dislikably elite woman of her times. The director was undoubtedly harder, but to question the discouraging results of his workers - I questioned that such an attempt was valuable for him.
