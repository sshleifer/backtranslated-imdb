This movie makes a lot of mistakes. In Spain, some American actors and Spanish actors speak English. 'Spaniards' is okay, but the act of acting makes it very annoying. The dialog is very weak by the whole script; It may be a Spanish script but it is misinterpreted, who knows and who cares. I can only imagine the famous Spanish actors forced into this English language, they may be good, but not with this defeat. You will find the movie in the first 5 minutes, and how exciting it is. The rest are just bad. A lot of time waste, UN-needed plots lots. Oh I told you one of Baldwin's.
