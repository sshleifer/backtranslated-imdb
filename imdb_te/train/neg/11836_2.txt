In the end it is very silly and meaningless. Yes there is a gold garage metaphor but most children will miss that. Forgettable. <br /> <br /> Animation is super-real as we can imagine. The plot-line is best described as a thin, good memory. <br /> <br /> The sewer underworld reflects disgusting attacks on the world, in some way, has a lot of wealth and money. Oh yeah, and the woman's ingenious, more awareness and the couple's go-to get a romantic interest - it has become a tiresome (anti) stereotype faster. Perhaps your kids will love it though.
