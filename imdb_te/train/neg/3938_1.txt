Timothy Hutton or David Ducov could not even save the film's dead fish. For starters, the script is essentially designed as a B-film, but somehow Ducovnoy (looking for a star to ride himself on television) and Hutton ("two" of "two punch" imagines he is going to define his career after "ordinary people") . Cheesy lines and scene from the scene are the big bad wipes (come on - who use the gloves after 12th grade telecommunications class?), And plain old bad acting in the film. Duchovin is also a film that does not prevent plague action. Only Timothy Hutton grows above material. When he read the lines that voice is over, I must admit Dachow's suffering. I'm sure the director feared me, but I did not do anything for a voice-over finish line for Ducheven: "If you need a doctor, call 911." If the studio calls just 911, this dog of the movie will never be done. Avoid all costs. <br /> <br />
