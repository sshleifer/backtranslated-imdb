Honestly why the rates of these films are not well understood, or why Baksh is not the best film ever. I was a fan of the early work of Bakshi - especially 'Heavy Traffic' and 'Wizards', but clearly 'Wizards' (1977) was his last good film. <br /> <br /> 'This story is inspiring, the quality of the animation tv - it's much worse than its 70s - and' wizards 'True imagination, quirkiness, some gorgeous background art and underground, adult sensibility,' fire and ice '<br /> <br /> If you like gore books, you might like it. In my view, 'Wizards' is another quality of quality after being unable to get back (although he has done some good TV team items for a while)
