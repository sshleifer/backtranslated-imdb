The film resolved what to do: how does a young man meet poverty and how to grow into her maturity. However, for most of us, the matter is adequately explored and in many cases it is better than the full. The film was corrected on the breasts, which soon became boring and I lost interest. If it's on TV, I will not change the latest news about Star Wars. I know how to find this movie.
