<br /> This is one of the worst worst pieces I've seen since the Hulk. This storyline is very predictable, you probably come. But if you are looking forward to 24, but on the big screen, you immediately flush the toilet hopes along with the money used for the ticket. The acting is terrible, in the end (so "twist" is totally untrue, I should say that the conclusion is not about the plot twist, but rather in the effortless manner they can be considered only a scene of somewhat better action in the whole film They rolled credits and at that time I also realized that it was <br /> <br /> The casting feared for some reason. Firstly, they accidentally changed the allocation of characters, Michael Douglas as Kylie Sitarland player To be screwed around Douglas agents, pressing phone lines, hacking into systems, and And then he's going to be a favorite of all his favorite Jack Bauer. <br /> <br /> The film is desperate for all fans. I promise you. It is better compared to the remake of "The Fugitive" / "The Line of Fire" but is written by those with mental disabilities
