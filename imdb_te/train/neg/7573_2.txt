The movie is a vehicle for Schwarzenegger-clone Alexander Nevsky. His film is not enough to lift the film than the poor script. <br /> <br /> Michael York is very enthusiastic as Beijing diplomat. I feel uncomfortable since he was a good actor when watching his D'ARGGAN-ACT. <br /> The story is filled with holes and undefined relationships; In this bill, Vlad's Informer, like an American woman, appears to be working for a Russian government department from the context. <br /> When the story ends, the story takes place. Communist rule, all Russian characters are still very communist. In contrast, Vlad is permitted to drive all utility vehicles like a police car. Action scenes are poorly filmed and therefore lack of dynamics. <br /> <br
