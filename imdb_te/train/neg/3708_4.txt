Down to Earth to Lance Barton, a black comedian was hit by a truck. He goes to Heaven and he gets another body. Lance Charles Wellington, gets the body of a white mentor. So Lance makes some things in Charles's body. The film is laughing at some, but it is nothing special. Good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, 2005 animated comedy, is good. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock did much better than this way. It just laughs at you 4 times the whole movie. And it's not really funny-out-loud funny. You laugh and you can laugh, but you're definitely not laughing at the ground.
