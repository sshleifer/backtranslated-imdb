I spent a few years studying this program on "Tracy with Tracy". CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 pm! <br /> I lived in the north for two hours to Toronto and we could not get the CFTO, but you know what it looks like - we should never be. <br /> <br /> Wanted and I wanted to know what was "tracy with trouble". Is it a beautiful girl in the role of the actress? Is there nudity? Have a suspense? Not comedy This could happen if some of the show's promotion was present. At least I knew what I was missing. But not! The mystery made me bonkers, and the CFTO began broadcasting "Trouble With Tracy" at the same time until CTV affiliate CKCO was building a transmitter in Worland at Orienta ... at 6 o'clock on Saturday! One Saturday morning I got up and opened the TV at 5:59 and finally got to see "The Trouble With Tracy". Yes, "Tracy with Tracy" is stuck on Canadian content and the 6 am spot, so no one can ever see how terrible it is. <br /> <br /> After a few years after the Talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died, he argues that he is the first to live "live dead" for the first time. I first saw on Saturday morning and when I was disappointed with my bed, some part of me died.
