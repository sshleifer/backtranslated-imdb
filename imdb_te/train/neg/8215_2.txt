I felt really bad for actors in this regard. No doubt the high school drama class could have done a good job or at least a job. Actors thought that they would be doing their big job in this film, which is not sure. Terrible acting is rather boring and boring for the most part. One concept of remote control has not been made. <br /> <br /> I have everything I want to support low budget films and make a suitable opportunity for new filmmakers, but this is a waste of turkey time and an insult to the viewer. I saw only some good comments posted here. They need to plant people who have film relationships. <br /> <br /> At least I've given it to 1 instead of 1 because the boxer tried to warm the heart of the story. It certainly failed miserably, but it tried. "<br /> <br />" I just wanted to.
