I love most people "A Christmas Story". I never heard about this film and probably for good reason - it's awful. This is the locale, the same hero, the same director but the lack of a warm mess of reality. Charles Grodin is a poor choice to replace Darin McGavin, but I can not imagine anyone who could replace him. The story is not forced and does not have the sweetness of the original. Interaction with neighbors, the bottle, is ridiculous. Ralphie's siege with a BB gun in "A Christmas Story" looks pretty but his obsession in the film is boring. Scudware, original neighborhood violence, replaced another kid with braces and whimsical caps, but the Scudfurce masked appeal is a little lower. Although the film is made with the original crew, it is very difficult for the original inequality.
