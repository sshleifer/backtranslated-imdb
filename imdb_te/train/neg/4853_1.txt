I'm a huge fan of martial arts, and have some experience of technical details like Vietnam combat vet. I've worked more than once with the bomb boys and they have nothing but respect. Other vets, and especially Iraq vets, are well documented in this movie. Poetic license is one, but this film is a complete fantasy, and it is bad because of the failure. No bomb disposal unit, or any unit, no more than 5 minutes to this rogue operator. Military units for a reason reward verification and discipline, it will save lives. The opening scene was particularly embarrassing to me. The person was immediately shot with a cell phone. However, "stop dialing" is not an effective deterrent. It has been down further from there. The scenes with sniper are particularly extreme. As others have said, your average EOD guy does not know about a sniper, and it is good to guess what arab sniper is good. Abducting the Arab businessman just did not happen for a form of personal vengeance. Anyone can shoot him, but this kind of risk is limited to movies. I have gone, but as I said, others have described these things in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it won any awards, why is it called "La La Land" more reflection.
