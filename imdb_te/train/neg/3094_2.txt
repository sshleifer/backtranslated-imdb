**** Small spoiler *** A bad movie connoisseur I must have watched hundreds of bad movies and yet "hoggoblins" stands unlike all others in it's own unique way. Classic buddies such as "The Creeping Terror," "The Mighty Gorga" and "Manaus" are uniform bad from start to finish. On the other hand, "Hoggoblins" starts from bad and is gradually reduced when it goes. During my first view of the infamous Rick Fight Sean I felt like this was a really bad movie. I'm not sure that this is the best thing I can do. The film takes its biggest nosed into celluloid hell, the continuous string of an unfunny joke after another in the "Club Smm" sequence. With the film, director Rick Sloan, Coleman Francis and Bill Reebne are among the worst directors of all time. How bad is the bad image? See "Hoggoblins" and no longer wonder.
