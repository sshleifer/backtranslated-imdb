I like the time, I like the effort, but watching a movie I'm looking through a coke bottle gives me a headache. If I play computer games that focus on this opacity and focus, I will upgrade my computer. This was later seen by the director, but it could hurt the eyes and that you did not want to leave after 10 minutes. If I take someone with me in this film, I'm out of there. Although it is not a film for the series and story, the band of brothers has achieved this. They are made like WWII footage, which is just a touch of grain, but it is still happy to watch. Movies with real sets and real locations require real people; Use CGI when it's correct, not for the whole movie.
