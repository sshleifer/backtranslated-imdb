This film is a classic Bollywood fare as Star Power, Jallian's and Love Triangle of Emotions. The really worried about this movie is the absurd feeling of surrogate mother's manufacturers. A miscarriage is not a mother who has sex with a man (a child in a sex). She is not a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I have more intelligently handled Indian films and television programs from 10 to 15 years ago with this problem. The whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and totally unbearable. I realized that most Bollywood films are not acceptable, but they can not act. The film wants us to embrace characters, but it can not be done with such ridiculous, controversial confrontation. I thought better from Abbas and Mustaans.
