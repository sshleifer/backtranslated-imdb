No laughs. Yes, I saw this whole train ruin, but I'm surprised that Cleisce understands his feelings in the next episode. <br /> <br /> The British "humor" may have been historically interesting to young people as described as "black jokes" thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it makes me even more surprised, it's reading the comments of other reviewers, it's not good, but it turns around and gives a lot of votes. If the ridiculous majority you saw is worse than this, I will definitely have your torture. <br /> <br /> The comedy level of this show targets young children, although not the subject. So who is this? Repeat & drawn out double-takes, presents, Drug jokes (the only 'small' trip to '77 ') and other "less" jokes. The three stews are still funny, and even a kid myself. They made a few attempts to work with jokes. But it schulghed off schlock. If it is worthy of the matter, I fear that the end of civilization. You tell me that you've got tabloid TV popularity. :(
