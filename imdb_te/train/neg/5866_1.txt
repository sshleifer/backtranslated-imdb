I remember the age of 13 when I was 13, with a group of school buddies as well as the reviews AGE 13. We all want to see Billy Crystal in his first film, and this has come down to general commercials telling us a great comedy. About 45 minutes we woke up and all left the theater. It's odd and trivial, and we have a lot of laughter from Billy Crystal, we laugh and we're not laughing. I damaged this review of the accident and decided that if you were to rent this, if you ever frightened what you have earned, I would just like to register the rat-gut waste of the movie to the rest of the world!
