How can you get Disney Preppy Rich girls work like idiots, buy a bunch of stuff, and teach a lesson. Will Disney try to send the text itself? Maybe it's still a human being when it's all bought? Whatever the psycho-analysis is, the film is absorbed. <br /> <br /> The girls want a great party for their richest lives. But then the money disappears and they should use their money to get milk (yes, milk) to employ workers. They are floating until Daddy's home. And the man in the beginning, who is a visible one, who takes money. But the end is dumb. Webcam at Cayman Islands? Huh? I do not value my time again anymore. <br /> It's better than Howl Moving Castle. "D-"
