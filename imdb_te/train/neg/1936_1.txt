Spoiler warning. <br /> <br /> As the main character's sister stands on the stairs, the killer breaks the vodka glass beside her, making her look like a drink. But before she dies, her sister's business partner (Teri Gerre) says she has no drinks in 4 days on the phone. And yet the police have never told the results of the toxicology report! And, when she fell on the stairs, the characters drunk and talked about her. Huh? Overall pretty horrible this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> Thinking about the great cast, it's surprisingly bad. Some errors: The writing is not very good, the TV is bad, and the pressure from the first scene in the movie is no pressure because we already know the answer to the mystery.
