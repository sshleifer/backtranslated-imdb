Dynasty revisited in Hawaii ... complete with clich√©s, highly predictable, dubious and sometimes stupid. If you do not do anything good, it's 40 minutes simple, detailed entertainment, with great masculine and feminine musings and a beautiful photography of a wonderful Hawaiian scene. <br /> If you work in a hotel, you have two options: 1. Every two minutes you feel sick every day and show show hotel hotel how to do it 2. I like science fiction comedy I saw it!
