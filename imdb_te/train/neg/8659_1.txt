There are some things I could never understand. Like this picture. If you have created a really cheap and agile looking Dino and Crocodile Polygon model in Maya and cut and paste in that amateur video clip, do people cry out and drink aloud the same thing? A completely duplicate CGI dynocack space is entirely visible, how can anyone believe that it affects the events of the film? I know that its B-grade, low budget and all but producers could do anything better than making a piece of garbage that no one ever sees or sees. It just does not make sense. Are people really stupid to sit by this? Clearly so. Laugh? No, this is not even worth laughing.
