I can not believe the film was made in 1984 recently. It has some laughable performance, never mentioned one of the stupid plot. Who asks Texas Sheriff Joe Don Baker, who wants to save Italy, an Italian illegally arrested in Italy? <br /> <br /> The title of the film does not say you have nothing to say about it - in fact, it is a simple title for a Wenbee Action / Cop image when I think of it. <br /> <br /> <br /> I am happy with Mike in MST3K and a bolt like a shield. They regarded women's core similarity as Seinfeld ("None of them is spontaneous") and L'N's constant on Baker's weight. The film is probably not worse than "Michel", but Baker's reputation definitely ends here: his title comes at the beginning of the film, Tom says, "I want to be illiterate, I do not need to read it."
