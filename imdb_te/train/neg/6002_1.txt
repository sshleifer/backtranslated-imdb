"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is a worst thing. Acting is terrible, the atmosphere does not exist and the characters are uninteresting. The only horror about this type of scam is that the majority of IMDb users gave it 10. It's not really terrifying. No suspense, no violence, nothing. Bruce Campbell ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder") is absolutely wasted and supportive. Yes, some people may like this picture, especially a mainstream society but hard core horror fans or gore-hounds can not enjoy this piece of garbage. Personally, I hate horror jokes, I like watching horror horror films like "Canabal Holocaust" or "Lost House on the Left". Opinion, a horror film, scary and disturbing, is usually a horror feeling without stupid humor, which usually destroys the whole concept. It's not scary, neither ghrey, it's not funny as comedy, do not waste your precious time.
