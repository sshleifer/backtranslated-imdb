Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, who is part of the classic "The Warriors") is the first person to realize that there are slugs in his small town. Just what slugs, you mind, but the carnivorous killer then transition through bigger general, toxic waste slugs (it's still as fast as a normal slug, which I'm not frightening). No one believes at him at first, but they will. Yes, they will. <br /> <br /> Okay, killer slugs are mentally depressed and Marck's baby is an active agent under the Johnnathan Winders. Hence the impossibility of everything is very clear. The film is somewhat fun and it is 'good to be good'. Slugs: Children's Game or Slugs: The White White Meet. Perhaps it is not worth seeing more than once and forgets it to play away from the hidden trivia game immediately. Director Juan Py√©ur Simon has become famous for his previous films "Pad People" (mocking with MST3K Eligibility) and "Piece" (which is the most ridiculous bad movie ever made) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari <br /> <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Theater trailer for the film
