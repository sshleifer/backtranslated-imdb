You already know how painful it is to watch this movie. I'm wondering why even the most beautiful cars in one of the worst films should be included. Why the cars are not the victim of the infringement, but it is only true actors and performers. So you have to be able to make Porsche, Lamborghini or any of the cars in touch with your cars and destroy the fame you give millions. Make car loans and earn money in their chests. Those who love cars are sad. <br /> <br /> It's sad for those who love movies.
