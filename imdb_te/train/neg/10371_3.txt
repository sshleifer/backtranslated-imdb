Or "Marlow at Sea". Old movie overdraft with another ironic bogey. Many church too. Boogie basically plays the same role in Marlow; Always controlling the situation is always nervous - how dangerous the situation is, women are called "thin" and "dams" and other absurdity, the only male in the movie is "alpha males". The man is the head of the Gestapo - but he is just a fat alpha male), and - obviously - every attractive young woman who comes to her can not prevent her charm and wants her penis within hours of their first introduction. The character cliches are here. Bogai is considered to be the same Sinac-to-Reform version of "Casablanca" and naturally he often denies them money or other valuables - but how does it fit with harsh hatred in him? It is not, so he is not a hate; Hawks wanted it in two ways: the "cool lonely sister" and the more meaningful humanitarian character. I do not feel like that ... Baakal is the first time she does the "cold babe" routine and all of her so-called "sexual reception" between her and the bouquet are not too overtreat; These dialogues are silly sound by today's standards. "Just your lips and whistle page ...". A worst loading ... it's made at the age of 19 but looks very old, and is much less attractive than the day's female stars. Her rare face with its worst features, a Heaviland's feminine beauty, the cutting of a marna lai, is somewhere closer to distinguishing the love of Irene Dunne. Bagel is not fit to play vampires, not Femme-Phallales. (She is like her face in real life: Hollywood bitch.) Bachal has a break with tears; She is not well suited for her role. <br /> If you are interested in reading my biographies of Bogart, Pacal, Houston and other Hollywood personalities, you have two or three bad music numbers.
