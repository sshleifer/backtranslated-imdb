The storyline is quite simple and it is easy to follow and has a point where no brain comedy is too boring. Some of the audience seemed to have found it funny, but I like more intuitive humor. <br /> <br /> There are many Swedish actors in the movie and their performance is good for the script. <br /> If I can not remember the original film, I can not say it is better or worse. <br /> <br /> You may be worth a look at this film by SÃ¤lsskapsresan.
