Another example of why Stephen King's books should not be made in movies. (Cary, one of the finest ones, has been scrutinized from the book to the screen.) The story of this story revolves around a fat counsel, always killing the old Gypsy woman with "food," with food. In court, with the help of a lawyer and local police chief, he does not care when he is driving because the risk is the reason for his fault. The dead man puts a curse on the woman's father 3, with our main character, Billy (advocate) being thinner and slimmer for the day. Along with this movie book, most, and although your distinctive king is out, acting is weak and felt compelled. We have gone from one drama to the other without any of the steps we read. The film strengthens my belief that the writers and the writers should be the only one in the film that the king has played in his role (as Dave Barry) in a guest role. Leave acting to actors. Not great for anyone in this movie. I've seen movies as the main characters and they are very well.
