In this direction, intellectual naveau, the main disappointment in painting, as shown on the plot and its subject. It is a slow moving film like the episode of Wonder Years, but lack of depth of depth. <br /> <br /> The approach to the subject of painting is very good, limited to the obscure and subjective words "beauty". According to the filmmakers, the Bob-Ross-style kitschik landscape films can only be 'aesthetics'. According to the film, good art can be achieved by the basic principle (such as the primary school level) discouraging color theory and sentiment. In some episodes, this film is violated, e.g. In one case it is said that mentally emotionally mentally disabled or expressing them by painting is a defining 'bullshit' of their writing (rather, celebrated by singing on the charts). <br /> <br /> I can not understand that I can not get such a high rating, then again, so many people have not rated it so far and they have chosen only a very, very low level.
