Okay, I worked hard to put it on the fact that selling it as EV was actually lying to me from the get-go. <br /> Hell, I do not believe in vampires, but I still liked Dracula, so I was able to live. <br /> <br /> However, it is not good if you agree with the film. It is competitive and starred, but it really does not capture you all. There were many "jump" moments, and I looked at them and said, "Oh, I did not expect that" in fact without the slightest jumping. <br /> <br /> Also the resolution does not make sense. If the power behind it is capable of what it does, then why does it use the proxy hell? Plus, the ending title is irrelevant. They apparently put it to be part of "give all the true credibility of the film by all the true", but for that to work it really should be in the beginning. But they can not keep it in the early stages of giving away the plot ... it sticks to the end and it sticks like a thumb toe.
