While Charlie Chase is totally disagree with a critic who has been described separately, he is perfectly in the film. It's a shame, as I suspect the other reviewer should have only seen some Charlie Chase duds and felt the man was not funny. Are movies like a mask and no expensive? Good chase movies, he could be really funny given the good physics. Unfortunately, he did not give anything in the film. General Oliver (the boy wants to marry the girl but the boy's father thinks he is a relative) and the inclusion of Olivier Hardy as a foil has not been helpful, since the curves are very weak. <br /> <br /> For those who have appeared for Charley since the 1920s, you are very surprised. Chase sports like glasses or mustache - and much less you'd expect.
