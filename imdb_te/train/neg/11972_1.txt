The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" really directs the direction of the movie too. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14-year-old boy living in New York in 50 years. He has a desire to see two people having sex. Who is good for those in his heart? Well, of course his own mom and stepfather! How pleasant it is. Unfortunately, he sees anything and leaves the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle's wife. <br /> <br /> Lenny's next plan is to look at his uncle and his wife's sex. However, the wife is very pregnant and they are not sleeping together right now. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his girlfriend spend most of their free time. They all sit and sit in the small club to talk about sex. The problem ... it did not sort of an innocent, beautiful 1950s. No prude I prude by any means, but I found these kids talking about auditioning masturbation, blowjobs and anal sex. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mole is totally wasted as Hidey, a former brand model. Lenny's carnal desires. Jason Alexander needed to stay as far away from the chair of the director. "For Better Are Worse" (1996) is awful and now this is. No waste. 1/10
