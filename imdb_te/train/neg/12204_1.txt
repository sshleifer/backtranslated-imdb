The ghost of the Vietnam War is now thrown into the American mind for thirty years. Otherwise thousands of American soldiers went to MIA in Vietnam or treated in return, as it was said to have lost the United States as the first war. Many men came from the war to the shadow of their former men, and the first blood gave a little insight into their problems, as they say, trying to reverse the world. The second part of the blood, on the other hand, is a bit more than a fist-pumping mess that describes how serious America can be in both success and defeat. When Retarded tried to capture a serious actor coach, Stallone puts it in another slow down as the nominal Special Forces Commando. If it does not undo all that is in the script, it is not good when it is called Missing in Action and Chuck Norris has acted. <br /> <br /> What is the truth in the realm when choosing filmmakers to paint a big S at the big chest of Rambo? <br /> <br /> When the film is over, it will take a little more story. The film, - the novel sequels did not allow for the possibility. In this medieval follow-up, Rambo is placed in a kind of open-air mine. As he breaks the rocks and sweats, the jail guard loses him and has a chat with Colonel Truman that his government is ready to be released before his secret effort. Rambo, a hard day can not come back from a violent work and accepts, and will soon be sent to a secret place in what appears to be Cambodia or Thailand (I forget). From there, he was appointed and filmed to find a camp of American MIA. His mission is clear and he's not making any effort to secure their release. <br /> <br /> Other thoughts about Rambo and Rambo have other ideas, despite their political developments. <br /> <br /> What American MIAs have been found by people who are doing Rambo's work. It did not apologize for the old-old conspiracy theory, and the misuse of many American families who remained without a son in ten years of running for the official Vietnam War. In fact, in the 1980s, with the inherent ginkgosam of American society, they could not work in a plot tang about the Vietnam Army because they were in the bed that looks like a battalion of the Russian army. Together, the two enemies try to collect information from Rambo, but it reflects the sound of bullets, darts, rockets, and vandalism. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the first Bloody Part II is a great photograph, well choreographed, action entertainment. The handmade battle with the large Russian commander is one of the few battles in the film which has no dramatic tension. The rest is just an example of building a fantasy for Americans to send their fist as the lead actor and director. Fortunately, all of the action films in the US have died soon after, and experimental and intellectual war films such as the Platoon are starting round. Some of the murders shown here are very creative, despite all the problems. Vietnamese commander meets the end of an action movie villain jealousy. The Russian commander is as ridiculous as it is ridiculous. In an action action film in the 1980s, one can only see a law used within a helicopter. <br /> <br /> The truth is, there are actually movie heroes who have taken action on the contradictions, but never before are these ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I gave Rambo: First Blood Part II Ten It's very fraudulent and it's so funny that it's very fun. There is no need to serve in the army to learn how fighting sequences are stupid. The only thing that stirs the heart of the participants is that it only takes on a stupid political statement. The tongue is strongly tearful and can be seen.
