Oh my ... bad dress, worse synth music and worst: David Hasselhoff. Whitchery, led by notorious Joe D'Amato, is back with a revenge on an American-Italian co-production, directed by Fazzrio Laurent's production side and small-carnival director (thanks to the heavens for small wonders). <br /> <br /> Like a sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead Series (known as La Casa) in Italy, Vicherie provided some modest gore grocery and bad acting. <br /> <br /> The ghost story, the Acquieses and the Witchcraft, the film topped with some serious WTF surprise climax of some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups, bouncing clueless from the scene without progress slow to progress. (I love the love of her face ...) Surprisingly Laurent handles some suspense and the vicious movements in the air - very few - scenes; Unfortunately for him, these few moments of little movie magic are quick and effective. <br /> <br /> <br /> Gore fans feel on the sides when touching the crowd. This section is the 80s of Italo-Gore's classic rubber and red style, which is 100% handmade, and modest and simpler modest budgets allow. All the bad characters (and actors) mangled and misused, all over-the-top ways to one that I can only see with sadistic happiness and some laughters. I am sorry for Linda Blair, it is not clear that she has attempted more than a woman / woman character who has a good old age in her career, or when it looks at her filmography. <br /> <br Well, folks - telling more about the home, and less about telling home. Do not expect too much while spending some rain afternoon with this, and maybe you'll feel at least some light fun. It also helps if the euro gore horror beat of 80's if your rotten little heart pounds. <br /> <br /> Talking about the hearts - David Hasselhoff Every movie is a picture of a large metal object and a heavily bleeding around the room and corridors, which is one of the right places. <br /> Is this you my truth?
