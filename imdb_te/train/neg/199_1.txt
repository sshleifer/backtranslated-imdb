It's a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and involuntary end. Furthermore, wrongly misused by Clancy Brown, and bad phenomena, except Michael Pollard. <br /> <br /> The picture is cleaner - you need to unload the bad image of a bad image to see a good picture. <br /> <br /> It is probably related to the father and son who does not seem to see this movie. The role of the male leader is not well written and is unkissmatic in this role. You can see that the plot is miles away. The male lead and her brother, the actions of the police, do not even make sense. Hence, this film does not mean a big action script based on his part.
