As the usual summary of these comments, the film has some amazing animation (I've viewed it in Blu-ray), but it really is smaller than any real depth. <br /> The first letters are all pretty dull. I have suggested a situation where I am dealing with Agito, Tula and Shunak, the main enemy. Maybe my mind is Wonder and it's a hopeful thought (my favorite anime, original engines dub). The characters are either really not truly lovable and as they say in another post they will fall in love suddenly quickly, poor old Minka leaves jealousy and refuses (she seems to be oblivious to this Agito, who is). However, she finally forgot the toolma and it's a little more "happy" than any other cardiac change. <br /> <br /> The interpretation is very confusing. Who are really Druids? Are they people? And who are weird women / girls who meet and forest fire? There is nothing explaining why and why they can give the superpowers of ordinary human beings. Plants coming from the moon are still not filled on these topics. This is the unnatural version of The Tribes the Day. <br /> <br /> And who is the Callka call? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to be in this movie, but that is a real character like the movie Ghost in the Shell or the Majority of that. I do not see it, but I think I did not buy it. Nasalaha? Take a ride if you have other hours, but take it, or buy it cheap! Maybe it's new to anime movies and it does not have much time to go through. It is absolutely pleasing to the sight.
