"Will you give a $ 100,000 to a homeless man?" By asking that question, they could say something morally. The creators of "The Reversal of Fortune" try to keep their loyalists into disguises their loyalty as a responsible social experiment. <br /> They take Ted, Pasadena, a man who is homeless, and see if he turns around his life for $ 100,000. <br /> <br /> Then, when they give a very polite guidance and advice, they will not let go of his merry way. <br /> What do they say? "Do not you have fun with money?" "The homeless are homeless, because they are deserving." Or about how, "Lift up a man - it's more fun to see him come from a higher height." They took a man out of nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, and then saw him crumble all. Should it be fun? They wear this piece with these tragic music and dramatic camera shots, but ultimately it has the moral level of videos of car crash - during which they engineered car crashes and asked, "What happens when you stop?"
