Absolutely ridiculous. If you know something about poker, it's very scary, but it's fun because it's clueless. Nicked made of this movie is obviously quite a lot and knows little about the poker game, but I think he has ever played over 3-6. (I think he does not know golf.) Where to start. I saw good productions in the film class and I took a new year in film school. The actors see Queen Mamma, Scotty Newuyen, and the unsuccessful losses at Poker. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * is the first film that originally started in the sequence. He does not have a line of railroad and dialogue that does not play poker, but the actor is the person who is clearly paid for the film. I can not think of more losses than the cost of money for this inappropriate product. <br /> <br /> The film has a very low poker. Most of the time was spent on the useless side, whose plot was short-lived. Queen Mamma has a show-stolen scene where she throws her losing boy through a window and tries to shoot his brains. Also give wise performances when debate whether or not to beat an old lady who robs the nameless Arabs themselves in the shop. Their miniature performances are easy in the headlines of the movie. <br /> <br /> Why do they worry to take these white people? <br /> <br /> In the end, it's totally nonsense. Plan 9 from Outer Space has a little more cooperation. If you play poker, you may want to have a laugh. Even if you're Christian you may enjoy some of the heavy-handed religious dialogue as pepper meaning pepper picture. I hate movies by religious people. They are unique to anyone who knows what they know. If Jennifer Harman and Scott Nguyen are involved in this mockery, I can not help and think less of them. They should be envious of Johnny Chan to get in the rounders.
