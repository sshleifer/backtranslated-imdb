When I first saw the Prom Night trailer, I had to admit, the trailer looked good and would be a fun horror movie like this. So my friend and I saw last night's Prom Night and did not say I was so ill and tired of the usual horror slasher movies with big noises as I did not need one to frighten people I have to say I should be growing because this is a ridiculous movie. What kind of tension, letters, how should I care about them? They never made any improvement, the killer? Oh, my God, this is a very seriously serial killer, I know it is a movie, but no one (or at least we know) was not killed before, a girl's family and friends he just grew up over? I mean, is he going to kidnap her or kill him? <br /> <br /> The film is not trivial and very imaginative and I do not know because it is insulting to true fans of horror. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She was killed by her teacher, who was arrested and imprisoned for the Donna family. It is 3 years old and she is now getting some peace in her life, she is also going to her senior prom. But the killer escaped and had Donna in her mind, she followed bad news for her friends, and the hotel maid and hour boy, because it was a good idea to kill maid and bell, so nobody became suspicious of checking this employee's here. <br /> <br /> "Love this movie, we have not had a good slasher image in a long time, but this I know this is the PG-13 movie, but who I have been dumped with death and have only a little blood on their clothes? What stabbed holes did you say? No one, no one is not recommended itramunu, youth, not adults, not knowing the true horror film, this film is not asvadincinavariki no offense, but who did not understand how to be <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> 2/10
