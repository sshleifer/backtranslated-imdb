3lbs is definitely a producer / mood deeper physician for Stanley Tusky as a self-fulfilling program. Besides the house he has absolutely no personality and is also interesting in the brain surgical cases rather than Gray's anatomy. This program has to be set at a prominent center for neurological cases - there is nothing more interesting or exciting going on! The curiosity between him and the opponent is not even displayed as 'mad' and adds something to the show and does not make such hallucinations. Leads like a father in a pilot - a brief glimpse into social life! Boring and meaningless. <br /> <br /> There is a hull of medical dramas during this show pants, and this is nothing to stand out as special.
