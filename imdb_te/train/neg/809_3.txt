As I look forward to something slightly from "K-911", I looked like a beautiful picture that I could get. I always loved dog comedy films. But it was considered to be Jerry's, rather than Jam's film. The plot was very dull and the two love interests did not really have the chemistry to start. Although James did not actually go that way, he did not say he had a whole sexist view in the film. James found me just over half of the film. <br /> <br /> Previously actors are real actors in this film. They shine the cast. But hopefully, James makes it one of his brother Jim's talent, no offense, but everyone will realize their star will be sibling. Are you taking the same advice as Ashley Simpson? <br /> <br />
