I purchased the BLACK CASTLE DVD on eBay for some bucks and did not know what it was and all I could say was that I did not disappoint this purchase. Blood castle is one of the worst European horror movies, which has almost no redundancy quality, except for being absolutely entertaining for all the bad reasons. Our heroine, Dr. Ivanna, arrives in the castle where she is supposed to help a scientist, Baron Dolmer, who experimented on dead tissue: the initial DVD price value alone. On the way to the castle 1) A man attempts to rape him. 2) The castle's house keeper fights with her. 3) Housewife wants her to die. 4) And in the end, Baron Dalmer almost put on her and wants her the next day. Oops ... something tells me she does not know me. With such a traumatic arrival, you think Ivan is going to be in a NY moment, but the worst of the worst films are the heroine of our "Headstrong" and it's a candylit dinner with Crobbie Baron on the same day. <br /> The intro is very serious (I know it's better than some of the most memorable minutes of the Canadian film, Jr.). <br /> <br /> But the entertainment 't ended up there. If he is bedtime during the day, he is overwhelmed by night, ill, naked, silent, weak and tortured by S & M's unpleasant person. Even after experiencing these S & M sessions at night, he is in the castle in the castle, and the baron Baron is worse than her dreams. As expected, Evaanna from Go-Go also fell in love with Baron even after being treated very badly. Ivanna ignores anything negative about Toto, including the obvious fact that Dore Baron is famous with the young ladies. Every woman in the castle (which seems to be working there) will not hurt the young people who do not benefit. Women are also embarrassed when someone is around the estate (and have been killed) by pulling back and killing. In fact, Baron's physically bizarre brother, Igor is responsible for everything. For a long time in the scene of the wind, the brother warned Baron, that he was very involved with Evaña or he had consequences. So what does Baron and Evan do with these things? Well, they are of course married! At a very brief wedding ceremony, Baron was killed by one of the locals (one of the dead girls). But this is the murder / rape / harassing brother here who has hurt all those dead young girls and those who amid torture around them, do not deter, cheerfully "just a meat injury" and both hurt their honeymoon in the castle. The whole thing quickly devolves into a nightmare love triangle of varieties between Ivana, Baron and Igor. <br /> <br /> You got the idea: not the least. The film is almost ridiculous in the film and when things are not OTT like the imaginary climax, things get tad boring. But for most film, the director or writer is delighted in a rape trashy moment after another. I really love this kind of movies, the subtle hit on the head with a prayer head, and literally everything that behaves like characters. Those who make a retrovirus DVD can also be realized and when you go to the scene selection section, we will loop one of the funniest bits of conversation from the dubbing film. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​will increase pretty well. Start and end credits, with a candle and red curtains ... a soupcon of the class. The music is sometimes like something from a Tim Burton film, which is just fantastic of everything. <br /> <br /> In accordance with the film's movies, when young women are stripped of their clothes, they just want to be killed. <br /> <br /> As a standard picture, I rate this 2, but it is good, I rate the solid 8 stars. If you enjoy the worst movies, please see. This must be seen. Only for me to think about it: what has happened to the woman to get out of a surprise castle?
