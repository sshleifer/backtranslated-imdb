Tony Scott directs a thriller sports film and should also attract non-fan sports. And some say that baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... very damn slow. Well perk up! Outside, he appears as an unsatisfactory trader (Robert De Niro), inside the psychic San Francisco Giants Fan. Along with a new slugger (Wesley Snippets) and a protector from sedentary. Hard-hitting Our star harbors a murderous bombardment when all the star falls into the worst slump in his career and is afraid of giants along with him. De Niro is scary. Snipes are more natural like ballerier. Other notable in the cast include: Ellen Burkin, still attractive by John Legugamomo, Benicio del Toro and Patti d'Arbunville. You are a free agent ... enjoy. Violence and very strong language assessment and you get your money worth.
