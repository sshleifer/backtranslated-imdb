<br /> <br /> "I felt very good to consider its time and content, I was worth looking at more than once In 2008, I was hoping for what they would do with the film: overcrowded military power from computers, gaming, terror, the first film, and "warzems: the dead code" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie has failed at pretty much every level, but I particularly blame the authors and anyone who has any input about the realities of gaming. "The Dead Code" is a 1990 Air flight simulator, Meanwhile, Will Farmer has a button mashing about 7,000 commands - none of which is on the screen "He wins" (no one is near the gas) by clicking on the box on the screen with the mouse to release 20,000 virtual people instantly killing 5,000 levels in 15 minutes, he defeats RIPLEY (real life war machine) with a high-level terror He is a threat. <br /> If any 5-16-year-old is able to complete this same task - the government believes that he is a fatal threat to humanity. They say he has less knowledge than those who have read the first 3 paragraphs of bio-terror's wikite entry, saying "he has the knowledge of bio-terror". The movie-length chase scene is good with about 01% of the budget and excitement of Bourne titles. They catch him and have 1000 chances to clear the whole thing .. Sometimes they just miss him mad .. But other times they let masterfully create opportunities and go intentionally to follow him. Oh ... I would write more .. But I wasted watching for 1.5 hours already, I would rather watch the Broderick and Joshua playing Tic-Tac-Toe for 1.5 hours.
