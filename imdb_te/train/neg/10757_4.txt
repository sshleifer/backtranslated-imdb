I saw this movie on DVD last night, and decided to check out the reviews this morning. <br /> <br /> "I, robot" IMDb (and also increased insults and name-calling) confirmed the complex view community here. <br /> The surprising image of this sort is not great (or better), but it's not terrible (or really bad). What really is this movie, is discouraging. American filmmakers were disappointed in the U.S., Clutch Re-Hates, and praised them for the exciting new tasks. Smith's role (Sinak with a backbone of a titanium), from special effects (Asimov and the uncomfortable mix of modern-zealous actions). <br /> <br /> "I, Robot" is a very accurate action movie for today's audience: surface plot, miraculous dialogue dialogue and lots and adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already know (he is Hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). There are plenty of holes in all of this story, but most people criticize what is filmed in the film critics. Maybe blockbuster by today's standards, but much B-movie compared to real winners.
