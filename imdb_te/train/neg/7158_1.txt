This is some of the worst performances I've ever seen. I love the gum of almerida, but it's just the perfect spill. From the moment of cinematography and a few seconds of music, the film is simply a nonstop acting and mute thing. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but nobody is far from it. The plot joke, but it's not kind of hahah. I do not even know if you can forgive these bad films. Please last hour and half of my life. How does this director lace and another girl make another planet?
