When I see this film, I will be a good Saskwatch movie. Usually these types of movies usually have a saucawach, but what is the point in this? 7 or 10 of them? Acting is good, the plot is OK, the first few sufferers of Saskwatch, the scenes that killed a very good camera work. I'm going to be a ghari film but it's very little. This film is better than Saskwatch. The SCI-FI channel really needs to make more Saskwick movies, I really like the Sasquatch Mountain, the Abominibal is not good, the review I did not review, but the movie is not a Saskwatch, but I do not review it so let me know on the track. The film is a rainy day afternoon good, but not in any other instance.
