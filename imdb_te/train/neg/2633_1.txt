I have seen the theater's trailer several times in the theater and I'm excited. It sounds like a classic action thriller made in the 1990s. It also reminded me of a cat and mouse chase between fugitive movies, Douglas and Sutherland. However, Sentinel is the most flawless thriller of all time. As I have seen, it's like a TV movie. Not sure. First, there are better TV movies in this genre. Secondly, TV movies may be very fun, but this film is a perfect opposite of having a good time. It's not visually beautiful and very important, the image is tone unappealing. This is not an action movie, but two action scenes are chase and clash. Also they are not big action scenes, but worse that action scenes are as much flavor as the whole movie. The love affair between Douglas and Bissenzar is very unnecessary. Moreover, the most clich√©s of the genre in the genre kill the president but they stressed that. And this is not the cat and mouse image as it is desirable. Though Douglas was old enough, he was even more powerful for acting in action thrillers. In the film, for example Michael Douglas should not be like Tommy Lee Jones. If you look at Jack Bourr, its role is one of the reasons for such a stunning selection of a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker, she is very inactive or even a bad choice for Sutherland. Directly in this film, she is a soap opera actress. This film is not fun for me, so I could not come back for a while.
