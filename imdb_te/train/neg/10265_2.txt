Kirsty Alley is in a mess with a bit, a bit quaker lookyak, bleached elegant hair and all the guy watching a bit slimmer. At the premise of the film, she is an elderly woman who has not been able to get the screenplay due to age discrimination, so she sends her youngest nephew writer. It is not the original idea and the most secular acting, the Ayodhya dialogue and the funniest plot is not a good movie. There is another plot about a writer with love or praise for the role of Kirsti and why it is included in the secret. The actor who filmed Kirsty's brother was a wooden and unfortunate, tortured to see their scenes. What to say about this film Avoid this.
