This film is really bad for you to be a science fiction movie, horror or comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie is looking at (and it is) inexpensive, the actors do not know about any acting and it shows clearly that the script is shooting it. It is evident that the monster is added to the room because the Life Head is not frightened of everyone - she is beautiful-and they feel something more impressive; <br /> <br /> Why did the film director Joseph Green ever be a writer and writer? He was really bad at both. <br /> <br /> "The Brain That Wood Not Dye" is a short period of time for best actor.
