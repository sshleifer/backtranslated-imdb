Very bad movie ........ and I mean very bad ... This plot is speculative, and it is really cheesy, the creativity of the battle and the dance scenes for the only reason I have not given the film is one and the other one ... I feel while watching an image not a film can be seen in a film, the idea behind the picture is an interesting one of the clich√© is tho .. Bringing to the city blah blah blah Iii bumpkins, but I thought very little from the screen shot poorly, so it's not cheesy, it might at least feel a little better. Thomas is somewhat predictable at times, I can tell AT Times, it's pretty good, break dance dance war twist is good ... i pop up the movie and see dance dances your own dialog perhaps a 5 ... lol
