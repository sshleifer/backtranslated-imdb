Set in South Africa, a young black man tries to land as part of a 'gangsta' film. But there is no awareness of street life, because he does not know how life really is or he is not part of it. He works to work in a gang that leads his old friend from school and has the opportunity to appear in the film degeneration to accept movies. But for the gang leader, the annihilation of his new friends' life represents a golden opportunity to make his own better. <br /> It is relatively interesting, but it is nothing. The first half is very thick and tedious, but only at the end of "hijacking" occurs only with a low speed running low-speed car. In that "chase", only two police cars were used, both of which were the early 90s of Nissan Sunny. Only this is not the cheapest of what they choose (and believe that in 2000, using similarly secular old cars), but only 2 participants can remember and no one of them gets a single groove. Car drives and low traffic on the roads are very low, and you're a driving driver with a maximum of 2 minutes, even though you're driving is a skillful driver that can easily escape the police despite driving. It now leads me on the characters and acting, which is equally bad. The car is running at the age of 13, and the most talented loser when losing a very inept police. <br /> <br /> <br /> The gang leader asked to steal our main character ("Soaks Moraka") in the movie scene. A car from the car park. When it struggles to open it, the police asks him what he is doing and he will reply by saying that he is their car. After a short argument they try to arrest him and he turns the guns into the gun and goes back to their car. When he was there, the police fired back and he was injured. After another curiosity chase sequence, they decide to leave the car and get it to destroy any base. This is one of the most obvious ridiculous and worse terribly distinct ones I've seen here. When the car is "explosive", exaggerated flames suddenly appear from each window, which also have terrible sound effects. It is very bad and it is hard to keep fraudulent words, and really need to be sure to be trusted. If you look in slow motion it's also ridiculous. I have seen better repercussions than murdering rebuilding documentaries. The car is a Volkswagen Golf MK2 GTi. Something not worth a big sum at all, and they can not seriously end up with the real explosion? I know how big a budget is for this film. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised outside South Africa, and I'm even more surprised at the DVD release. <br /> <br /> I know it's not a big budget producing Hollywood. The gang depicts the fated towns of South Africa that steal cars from the middle class and sell parts of the black market, but futuristic effects, poorly executed car chases, awful acting and ludicrous characters, are completely lost. <br /> <br /> In total, I do not advise you to see this very accurately. <br /> <br /> If you have a smile and want to see one of the most poorly made, amuse's low budget messages I've created for now, I will recommend it for you, poorly edited, poorly revised, poorly paced and low-budget drew pieces all counts fail . I've seen many South African movies, including lots of cheap NuImage / Nu-World Action Pictures, and despite their cheesiness, they're all better than all the scores.
