The plot is very bad and it is necessary to watch this movie. In fact it makes a very uncomfortable view at times. Unlike other mayor figures, sexual acts are low. Some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily incomplete and offensive. The plot is haphazard and some acting and lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> The film is a fantastic compound of sad and masochistic fantasy with the brutality and immorality of slavery and all counts fail. Meyer is trying to make sexually liberalization by blocking a more ethical message. Mayer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting a whip in a provocative outfit for Lady Susan and getting on by the blatant dominatrix meanings of the opening scene. Then he tries to steer back in a better way by turning a movie about the good side of the bad side. <br /> You can not do anything because they cancel each other. <br /> <br /> In many ways it is possible to taste, because it is very bad. Perhaps, it's very bad, because we're not able to accept the mayor.
