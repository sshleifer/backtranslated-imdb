Okay, first, the voice of Seagal is like 50% of the film ... Why? Because they clearly shot the script and the story, the heroes were rewritten again and they would have to change his conversation for the continuation of the story because they had so many versions. At the very beginning, the attention of overdubs is not only because you scratch your head, but they do not make sense. <br /> The story still sucks and there is no feeling. <br /> When I finally came, I was scratching my head in order to get my head clear. Not to end. <br /> <br /> Avoid like a plague. The film will stop watching movies directly in video movies, because they are worse and worse.
