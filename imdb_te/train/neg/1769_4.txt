Stephen King's King as Camppe Vampire is very strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over serious weirdness about 3/4 movie and you wonder if this movie has a cult for King fans - 4/29/2007 - 10 to 4 (Dir-Mick Garris) . This is the story of the mother and son of the sleepwalkers (changing the shape, eating cat meat, eating tuna, nearing the endangered species of human being) moving from town to town looking for viruses for food to survive. They can look pretty simple high-class folk, except for the secret lovers and cats hang around outside their home, day and night. Cats are bad for them, so they try to get traps in their yard and reduce the population. We must see that their necks are broken up when they attack (it is also the first of my cinematic experience) --- Hopefully true cats have harmed the film's production. The boy turns into a "sleepwalker" and after a sweet girl he has a passion until he wants his body. The film is very compact enough to be good if it is an all-out satirical comedy in suburban life, but instead of trying to dare you for two minutes instead of director, he can get it out and get out of the gore. Eventually that happens and the film winds down the usual Stephen King downbeat end of it. The film is interesting because the King's comedy comes thru than usual but his weirdness is also very much and you can not possibly have what his fans like and have in their collection, but it's a worthwhile film experience.
