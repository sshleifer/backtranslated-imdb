The film was really tasteless. The script is really bad. I'm very sad for the last Gregory Peck that played a major role in this B-movie simulation role of great generations in history. The film was politically incorrect and clearly unresponsive to others who fought Japan in World War I. There was a scene I had almost watched, which showed a mugger in a bunker on the island of Carlagadore, when he came across, a wounded, a caliled Filipino soldier who spoke to him as a politician who took him. The soldier sees the bleeding and dies and sees immediately and says: 'What Papa, A Mama, No uncle Sam' and Macarthur gives the Americans 'Philippines' their little pep talk ever. "In this scene, the soldier was motivated by words and gave him a smart salute. It is more frustrating to portray America as the world's greatest white defender This showed me the cake, which shows that Filipinos are suffering from deterioration and reliance to great Americans, which clearly and intentionally overshadowed the members of the USAFE (United States Armed Forces of the Far East), which included the Philippines Volunteers To have Japan joined the US Army during World War I. The Americans walked side by side with Baton's death and Marathur went to Australia and defended the island of Corrugard by launching a guerrilla attack with his famous "I will return." My last grandfather, a Filipino World War II veteran and USAFFE soldier is one of many who fought the Japanese with respect and love in the country. The film does not respect them and others rely on intellectual preparations for his famous arrival in the metropolitan landing Gulf Landing for thousands of people.
