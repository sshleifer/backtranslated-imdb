An incomprehensible mess of an image. He was shot in a glass jar in his bathroom (about a fifty times more shot and now killed) and some five or six incompetent soldiers will go to Mexico. It is not clear whether they were deliberately sent there or really really lost. And you'll never hear another screenplay term "butthorn". Gary Bassie attempts to play Mel Gibson from "Lethal Weapon", and Bassey is an acting actor who treats the whole movie as normal. William Smith made another turning point in the Russian soldier, a few years ago he played the same role in "Red Dawn". With the biker playing heavily in the late 70's, it is good to see his range playing the Communist burden and expanding its range. Unfortunately, he always reminisces Clint Eastwood in "Whats up to You".
