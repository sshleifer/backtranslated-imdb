I thought I could give the movie zero or less, because it deserves to anyone. I can never come out of a movie honestly, but it's a scary scary, I could not stand another minute. Please, please-please-for humanity-skip this movie. <br /> <br /> It leads to attractive, simplistic, unstable structure, ridiculous dialogue, and in every predictable way completely unreliable. At a strictly fundamental level, it failed to entertain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a good thing than the student film I have ever seen about "Mango Kiss". <br /> <br /> Not enough, the whole movie is constantly (and I mean certainty) on the commentary. The script writer may have also written a novel because they insisted on everything and instead referred to it. Although no role is developed to describe this scenario, we need to assume that Lu and SassFords have the best and unique connection of friends. In addition, the film continues to introduce new characters for the first five minutes, and not in the natural way, but in the freeze-frame of the characters that are written on screen. There is no introduction, no roles do not develop. <br /> <br /> I am a very enthusiastic film I have ever seen. <br /> I'm a gay woman I've seen this woman. My roommate (another woman of homosexuality) and we both seemed to be a discouraging representation of the film. I am starting to think that there are a lot like lesbian and gay movies Christian rack - it does not matter how futile, people still flock it, and the winner, no matter how low quality. Please rent this! Instead, do not be swallowed at targets at homosexuals (ie queens like folk), but let's encourage the production of Quality Gay and Lesbian films by renting "I'm a cheerleader" or "fire" or "heavenly creatures". .
