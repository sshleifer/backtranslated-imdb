It's rare that this terrible, this annoying and come across an image of this irritability. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, when it's unclear in the confusing and confusingly smooth alteration. Why did Domino become such a bad-donkey tough bitch? Her golden fish die when she is a child, and this "painful" event mentally depresses her and hates everyone. When the conversation is not clich√© or uncommon, it's filled with such ridiculous lines: "There are three types in this world: the riches ... the poor ... and for all". Prior hunters at one point have some person tied behind their bus with a combination of tattooing on his arm. Due to a confusing mobile phone call, instead of moving his sleeve and reading the number, they swing his hand with a rifle. On another occasion, bounty hunters took a bomb to the meeting that met with the mafia and threatened to stop the bomb to prevent them from going to the mafia! <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley is an incredible, terrible mistake. Mickey Rourke can handle some credibility from this mess. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance, was a pleasure to me. Complete idiot.
