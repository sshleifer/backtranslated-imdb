The film is the best. Angie hormone is funny as the hammer bag. Bitch's attitude from "Law and Order" meets in a failed attempt at the comedy. Charlie Sheen is quick to come out of this horrible anti-comedy. The only positive thing that came out of this mess is Charlie and Denis. Hopefully, that effort produces good results.
