Love that is not feeling, without point (or drama) play drama ... This film is all and fails in every account, it's not trying. Or the director / editor / scrip writer team is not really trying. Actors can - they need good support. <br /> <br /> George Delarrie is an element that does not score. Beautiful and moving. This is what happened in the film. A good film actors' words and movements and music are synchronized and improved. This editor filled the music with regard to dialogue and movements. Love scene is particularly hated in this regard: it is a disgrace for the main actors' talents. <br /> <br /> Photographing in the film: There is another aspect of another movie. A moment in Grand Central Station. I'd like to guess what's going on before; But it is breathtaking how the film is portrayed. <br /> <br /> Some commentators on this board have actually suggested McCarthy's intimidation is that the combined combination of criminal Nazi scientists in these years has actually been suggested. The film seems to be looking very serious in American society, which turns to traditional love; <br /> <br /> The film is insulting the talent of the actors, and it is a disgrace (and failing) of the problems that it plays. <br /> You are threatened.
