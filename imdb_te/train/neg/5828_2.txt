<br /> <br /> I agree with another reviewer who thinks Barney is completely boring and enthusiastic about "subject matter". He makes the candy to the eye (and I like the candy), but its pride and basic artistic vacuum reduce all the happiness. <br /> Many people are frustrated by the ending scenes (but really on the surface only) in linear makers like Jardorrosky or Tarkovsky or Kubrick (I love the 2001 Odyssey) ...). That kind of art in the form of M.Barney adds chaos and fends off the audience that otherwise the experimental film will start to appreciate. Simple space post-modern "conceptual" art. And check out his interviews. I'm sorry, it does not buy. So boring. <br /> <br /> I was frustrated by Alejandro Jdravoski's movies, but learning 9 was disappointing. This is something unusual in the simplest way (the beginning and the great dance dance and ships on the ocean "meeting" on the ocean ... Ideas (if the feces) Object of the stool .. The "Pearl" divers ... Everything is great Surreal picture but it did not. Also terrible majestic scenes and fake tea <br /> I have some great lovely nicer <br /> <br /> It does not like slow movies but it's boring in some scenes - because it's pride and fake - I'm a long time The scenes of artistic pride forced to witness ... <br /> The kind of art and the movies Spray kill my eyes. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
