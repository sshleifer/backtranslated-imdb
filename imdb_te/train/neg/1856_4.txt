I am very happy and excited that this film is very interesting! My introduction to films produced and distributed by Jack Frost AP-Pix Entertainment, and without exception, everything that deals with this company is pure trash! The first one, and this is the most important, never seen this movie intelligently! Why would you do it Unlike many other enterta evil bad movies, I think this one was intentionally bad. The snowman could not get a duplicate, which is always shown briefly, this is the best way to move! This film is much better than the worst Michael Keaton piece of Waaaaaaaaaaay piece, becuz is also a very good movie, and that version is as bad as this.
