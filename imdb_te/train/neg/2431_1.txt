As a turkey who lives in Sweden now, I watch Scandinavian movies often. I can never understand them. I think actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood. Last week I saw a picture of a Polish ally called "Polish Wedding" and we both saw it a worst picture. Unfortunately I was wrong doing this movie "Angels House" worse. No actors can work, certainly not the lady so star Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so silly no one can believe. I feel a mess from the beginning of the whole thing. Very bad acting except from Selldal and Wollter. Ahmad Cell
