The film features only real death scenes. This movie is a big dude. We have Kim Basinger, the meleering awkward housewife slowly through the local mall for the first 30 minutes. Picture, it has not added anything. The film grabbed some of the 4 buddies who took 2 parking space during this busy Christmas day. She chased her after stopping a local security guard trying to help her. Since then, this film is worse and worse. I know its only one image and you've gotta go with the flow but she got about 5 minutes. Headstart and she can not hide or find anyone for her help. Instead she goes to the subdivision of half built on the forest. In a distinct way, she allows her followers to easily track her easily. But now she turns into a tough mofu. You will get the point. Do not take this movie or rent for any type of situation. It is invalid because you are questioning each scene. It is difficult for Basinger and Craig Shefferson and the other cast, as well as for consumers.
