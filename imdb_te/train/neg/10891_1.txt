I saw the trailer for this movie and it looks great, so I went out and bought it. What's wrong, acting is a shambles, special effects (if you call them), look like something that is not at a school play. Some characters in this role are the minute you are on the screen, which is unfortunately very often. For a story, forget to do this. This is a warning, do not waste money in the film, it's one of the worst things I've seen. For some reason, if you like this movie watch trolls 2, you'll probably enjoy it as well.
