Worst Bob's funny comedy (and having some heavy competition). Hope in an island with sailors, Geisha's girl dreams of being in the bathroom with "steering her ship". Some people have guided this hoop-hacker on the hill, which contains Phyllis Diller and Gina Lalobrazzi, and still does not work with any laugh or enthusiasm. Where are you when Bing Crosby really needs him?
