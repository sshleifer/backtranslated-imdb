I've had almost every seagull image (yes, even like this with a low budget), and I must say, it's worse than all of the movies made so far, not on his movies. This film is only highlighted, and I gave it 1 star instead of 2 stars, A. It's Seagal, and B. Seagal have some sweet-action scenes in the store, and the whole army survives with a knife when he was taken from time to time. The next time I gave 90 minutes to Seagal killers, the story was not bothered because the plot was not, but acting was F-18s of F-18 and F-14, and stealth was faster as an F-16. Never even Stealth has refuel ??? And when Afghanistan is considered the enemy territory from the standpoint point standpoint. Finally I checked, Afghanistan does not have an Air Force, we (USA) control the skies. Furthermore, all the staff in the room had this secret secret, and the admiral was still confidential and the voice of the other person. Also, how did the Seagal truck go from the bottom to the top? Why were they punished by him, when the Air Force pilots were a great commandos (except for Owen Wilson?) In Arab countries when drinking drugs and drinking alcohol after taking into consideration the Muslims? Also, when are you listening orders from women like Abbaze Charge # 2 above? The highlight of the film certainly killed those in the store segments and killed 50 people with a knife, as well as a very brief and completely random Lesbian scene.
