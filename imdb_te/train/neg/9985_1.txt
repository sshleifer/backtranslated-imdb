Did I see the movie more intimidating? I can equally think of this one equal, but no one to manage it to overcome. All terrible stereotypes of the cast are filled with flat dialogue. I'm ashamed of all the people doing this. Everyone watched the expression of fears that were not created by this plot, but this project found their job easier. Ms. Diaz's many mantras also do not give you a reasonable reason to comply with this. Avoid, surely the style of the film that Americans do not really understand. You see the final result, you see what I talked to, but do not say I did not warn you ...
