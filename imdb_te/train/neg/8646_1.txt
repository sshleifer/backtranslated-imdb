It's the worst movie ever seen. I went to the tape 4 to get up, but I put it outside. I feel like a magic now! Afghanistan? You friends! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide Sanskrit billboards? I thought the main actor (George Colley) was particularly inadequate. I thought because of a bad acting and zealous camera shake, the insulting and unhappy "Larson The Lanatic Imploses, a near-you screen" for the victims of 9/11. Using phone call from Larson's wife Sarah, one of the terrorists on that day, one of which feared. The camera shake did not feel sick for me, that cold heart stunt.
