I thought this was a great idea, but, boy, it was poorly executed. We'll get a broader understanding of how complex and challenging it is to off-screen activities of a show, but virtually any specialties about any work. The producers do not seem to find any way to tell a story or to give the viewer a "line." (It does not say they have not tried, but the platform of the story does not do anything to inform us about the nature of an opera mounting physically. <br /> We see many things happening, but what people are doing and Why is it said a little about who is, or how and what different product sections fit For example, many of us have heard about some sort of problem - for example, we expect one to see the problem and its consequences and / or how to fix it.But instead the filmmakers are usually pretty simple footage of something (usually, stuff pushing or talking into headsets) ). Overall the movie you like the images are like a pastiche Ling will end up looking at the end credits of a program, rather than worth looking for its own merit.
