You have to watch my comments on many images under Ewen Beudkuk. One minute to talk to me is worth it but I'm here to make another comment on a movie .. The film was basically duffy for two hours - almost literally - until death. Surprise in this movie is that there is not enough evidence or character knowledge that you may be surprised. <br /> <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is a wonderful actor. Peter Stormy is a wonderful actor. But this film just sucks. Slow picture is not bad, it's just bad. The sketch plot combined with artistic ramblings of the anamorphic details can not draw together in meaningful way for a plot unless cohesively highlighted some gore that are cohesively highlighted from the many perspectives, at the end. I really appreciated artistic attention, but as fun, it made me sleep. (I fell asleep and had to look back at the movie - it was more frustrating). I usually do not like negative comments or reviews on other people's work, even when they kill me. It is very bad that these great actors are ashamed with this ultimate result.
