D.W. Directed by Griffith; It is a great joyful king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the king left the scene, his queen would music with the ministrel of the palace (Henry B. Waltel). The king finds lovers, who decides to get rid of the terrible Edgar Allen Poe-type revenge. It is difficult to believe that lovers can not hear plans; While the actors are trying to look noise (lovers) and quiet (cement mixers). The sets show "Sealed Room" with many illustrations. The shows are okay, and the story is easy to follow. <br /> The Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Waltal, Marion Leonard
