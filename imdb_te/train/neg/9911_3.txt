If you have loved actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal, and Bill Cobb, you do not need Billy Burke, Golioo or any other distractions. As the massive talent is thrown in full "Vegas three days," this accusation collapses in the script. My neighbor's vacation movies are as interesting as this wrong road. If you want to see how to use a popular cast with a good script, check "Crew". There are not really any ransom factors here, and watching these amazing actors struggling with such a weak thing is a crime. I like it, but the shallow script breaks the audience, especially the actors do nothing. - MERK
