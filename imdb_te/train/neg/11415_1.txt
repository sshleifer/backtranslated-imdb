Well, AWFUL is just the first name. The film is part of a cliché-ridden guy. High school comedy setup in a military training camp. <br /> <br /> This topic should contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> This topic is completely baseless, unbelievable and unrealistic. HEPO (military police) does not come to you if you do not perform your wedding on your wedding day. The actors were pretty impressed with the scene, as the scene did not work much less. You will understand in their voices. Even if they are not such bad actors, they can not save the scene. <br /> <br /> Guy should exercise in his wedding suit. No, he did not have time to get the first uniform. Man, this great cinematography! I remember this scene of my life. <br /> <br /> There are also Girles in the camp - exciting - even if one is a model, I never seen the actress. I doubt in Hollywood that she is a single line in a B movie. <br /> <br /> Even in the military, the girls! Now it's funny. The girls are also placed on the same floor, so we can insert them to their room at night! In fact they are placed in a quarter of a mile in different buildings, separated by two different bodies. <br /> <br /> We have available tanks that can be used for a fun ride in our free space, of which we have plenty. No, the tanks are not locked, and the ignition keys are inserted. No one will notice the engine sounds, especially at night. <br /> There is a group of sex scenes and instructions and are all below the waste. We need the sexiest Germans to love this movie. Switzerland is a very small market for any movie. <br /> <br /> A sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Nevertheless, none of those facilities have ever been locked up. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the end of the foolish movie, the mafia hit is a revenge on the poor man who tries to shoot him! He left his future wife! Certainly I bought it, the Italians - a jealous bunch (not). <br /> <br /> The bad guys try to do in outdoor hours with two dozen witnesses. Dark alley is not night. Again, military training grounds (open firearms) are open to the public, anyone can drive freely or walk there. There are no guards or fences. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ The explosion hit men and their feet angry fiancée knocks. If no one is injured in a 40-foot distance, the car will not be hurt. <br /> <br /> Okay. It's got a comedy, and I can live with it. Realism is not required. If it's ridiculous, biased, or entertaining, interesting and challenging, filmmakers can easily get it. Unfortunately there is no one in that. It's awkward. Tearing out of the brainless American comedy. At the end of the career, at least professionally done without amateur actors. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the waste of time and energy for those sitting by the whole picture is pretty boring and predictable. Yawn.
