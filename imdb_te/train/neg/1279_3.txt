The film has three stories, which seem to have been portrayed as a mixed vignette film. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is a woman who feels for everyone in sex with a sexy Vivian Shilling woman. The sun (she will courage the Adrian Monk look), has a martyr's alone in her home. You are literally doing some ridiculous things in Vivian. She spends most of her time in one night with her amazing features. <br /> <br /> The second vignette is playing the role of Rommate from Bill Paxson-owned Hell. <br /> <br /> He allows him to take full advantage of his stupid roommate, and he can do anytime when he is billed. <br /> <br /> The death of the last vignette is like his friend at any time <br /> <br /> That movie is not all that interesting. Bill Paxton fans are essential.
