IMMORTALIZER, interesting. It certainly did not kill me in its hour and half, but it did not impress me very much. A group of children are taken to a fancy house in the muscular heads of mutants (in a scene where at least one of the most intimate headaches in the crackdown on the sound effect of the film) and the suburbs. Dr. Daiva and his team are brain convulsions for his older older patients, so they have young people again. Hey, this was quietly rebuilt with a big budget like FreeJACK a few years later! When you change an old man's brain into another body, who knows that their new voice is exactly like their old voice? With this discussion of the pineal glands and the glowing green serum you can see almost the most visible and re-imaginable dances from the makers of the makers. But the product does not have the guts to literally withdraw it. I do not understand why they do not pack the frame to the edge of the frame when they do a low budget horror film. The acting is uniformly terrible, with the only good performance from Clark Lindsay's assistant doctor. He has a nice bad smile. The only other thing about the IMMORTALIZER note is that it has older people doing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the cast takes some clumps for older folks.
