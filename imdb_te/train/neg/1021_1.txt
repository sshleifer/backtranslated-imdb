The film's strong, LL Cool J (Deed) began as a secret secret police officer, with partner Sargent. Lazarusov (from Dickson McDermott, perhaps misappropriated by Practice?) Exploits and murders. Dead refuses to kill a drug dealer, which creates a dirty cop's controversy with a conscience. Other big names (Freeman, Spicy etc.) are well cast and the film promises. <br /> <br /> Just when the introduction of Justin Timberlake (Polak), the film is short. I'll pick the former when people probably see repeatedly, or if Timberlake is allowed to make a good film once teens girls go once. Talented actors have to work with their expertise; Timberlake is not skilled and can save him with no amount of hard work. For the fact that he has been talented over the years, I thought he would be in a good show. <br /> <br /> It does not automatically translate that a singer sold millions of records and sold stadiums to make them successful. <br /> <br /> There are some plot holes, such as Pollack's sudden sniper capability and deadly operation of warehouse engines. This film is very promising. Disappointing.
