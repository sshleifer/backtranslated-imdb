Are there similarities between Ray Laurence's "Jindiffin" and his last film "Luntana"? Its consequences for a dead body and already unbearable lives. <br /> <br /> "Lantana" has given some hope and clarity, but "Jindibin" is often disappointed by viewers, perhaps even deceived, which leaves everything unsustainable in a very rare issue. <br /> <br /> The storyline - a dead body on the remote river after the discovery of a fisherman - is based on a short story by Raymond Carver. It became a topic in Robert Altman's classic 1993 bloc "Short Cuts". Lawrence stressed this theme for exploration and explanation of relationships in a small Australian community. The film poses some ethical questions, "Do you want to break the discovery of a dead body and destroy your good weekend?" And the more fraudulent for the Australians "What would the difference be if the deceased was an adivasi?" Particularly acting, especially Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linne, is appreciated. <br /> <br /> There are also mystic theories that strengthen horror music rather than "picnic at the hanging rock". Very slow and near the beginning of the murder, which removes the element of mystery. So we left these desolate lives and a blank end.
