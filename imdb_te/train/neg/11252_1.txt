"Sky Captain" may be considered a tribute to comic books, pulp adventures and movie serials, but some of the finest from those genres have magic. One contributor tells you that the film experience depends on whether the effects of movies are identified. I do not think this is true. The films that pay thanks to "Captain" are quite different from the expectations of fiction and serials. Especially those who have enjoyed the fun when they were children. The film is almost full of that attraction and magnetic appeal. Of course we know Leeds will get into the scrapes and out but there must be some tension and play. "Captain" Law and Paltrow's climax have ten minutes to avoid the disaster for ten minutes and they run at their target by five minutes of fall. They take the idea of ​​a fallen enemy that looks long and unnecessary conversation time and 30 seconds tragedy. In fact, one would have to add some sessions but a good director may have some necessities. <br /> <br /> Such films are not necessarily "meaningful". One has fun and enthusiasm, having a sense of internal logic. "Captain" is almost nothing. Remember when La and Paltrow are driven by winged creatures and they reach the huge abyss crossing through a lag bridge? How are they safe from the creatures when they reach the other side? They can fly! The abyss do not mean anything to them. This bridge is unnecessary for them, so where is the escape? <br /> <br /> Palv and La (both of whom have been given the name) have been playing "varieties" in the past but both are flat. Oomed Jallily was more likely to be given a chance, but Giovanni RBC (who showed himself as the greatest short-lived) and Angelina Jolie appeared to give any "amph" to their roles. <br /> <br /> There is a great 'look' in the movie, but there are many ways in CGI mess. When used in nature or for creating scientific or magical awesome creatures, CGI is greatly useful. It is disappointing when used as a substitute for natural locations. There is no real meaning for surprise. There is no constant or sense of awe and revealing that a true mountain in a CGI mount. I think the design of this film is very deliberate and it does not necessarily mean to be real, but do not think that way? It's not just. <br /> <br /> For a weak and broken script ... no tribute is required. However, the film has some thrillers and dramatic tensions, which still enjoy. "The Last Samurai" is anticipated weekly and I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, but "Captain" has not particularly attracted the viewer in the world and we do not make sure its rules and way "Sky Captain". <br /> <br /> I would like to see a similar approach to films about comic book heroes in the 30s and 40s. Actually (Jay Garyrick) Flash or Green Lantern (Alan Scott) is molded for such treatment. Probably well, well-known and fully-absorbed characters make that role better for the film. It's hard to be worse.
