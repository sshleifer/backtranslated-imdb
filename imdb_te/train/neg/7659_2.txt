Alone in the Dark is a bad film and Deuce Biggl is associated with the worst year of the year. <br /> <br /> I am a bad movie and I am in two minds about what kind of bad image. The lower budget wreck like red zone Cuba, monster A go go and manos. Or a huge budget disgrace like Gigli, Superbubis or this gaffe. Because the director does not have a clue, you will see movies such as Monster A Go Go and Manaus. <br /> <br /> This Ubi bol (this shocking trash is already an intellectual and already has some real rubbish under his belt) only the blue moon has created something that happens once. The really horrible bad horror movie. Everything about it is a mess. Cheesy CGI, bad plot, mad random camera cuts and frightening soundtrack. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Who's Who! Review. <br /> <br /> In 2006, I gave the bud and roll and I would not talk again. <br /> Do not watch this movie.
