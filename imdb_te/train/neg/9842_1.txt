Woody Allen is watching everyone in the film. They quietly and pause and beat more. It's really for fans of Die Hard! It tries to look experimental and artistic - but it looks like a very low budget movie created by college students. The most commonly used term is "hum". The film will peg at the end of the sixties / early seventies. When you talk to each other, the terrible lighting ("for the sake of art"), and if you like images that you feel like sitting in a lame political meeting then you might like it - but you really should be bored. I found this CD in dollar bin and now I know why.
