Original "Cube" is an excellent B-movie film, rotating, meat character, and great over-the-top performances. It's creepy, subtle and cool. And it's perfect on its own, without a stupid sequel like "Cube Zero". <br /> <br /> The third (!) feature of this cube series is part of the movie (body traps are very sad recycled), part violation. It takes a bold step, explaining what the cube is - which is not revealed in the first film - though, the description is bland, I'd rather put it on a secret. There are some important interesting suggestions for the society outside the Cube, but they do not somehow develop beyond the instructions of the political-religious dictatorship. <br /> What's less social commentary is flat and unfocused. <br /> What works? There is usually nothing. Acting is an entirely awesome bell, the speed of which is slow (how many people have a look at the screen?), And gore effects, failing to persuade the rebels. In short, "Cube Zero" reminds me of a sloppy and sophomoric clone for a "cube" fan-fik, a good movie that does not require a sequel.
