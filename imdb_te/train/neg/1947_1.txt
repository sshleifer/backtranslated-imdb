I am 17 years old, and I still like a lot of Scooby Doo movies and older episodes. I love the 1990s movies, and recently we have been a good direct to the DVD which has been Scooby Doo outings of this decade, Scooby Doo and Goblin King, which I did not even imagine as good. Anyway, get a clue back! I've seen some episodes, something very good, but I'm impressed from what I've seen about it. First, I hate the animation. It's flat, delated and very Saturday-morning-cartoon-standard, easily the worst item in the series. Some shows that I really hate have a slightly better animation. Worse, Shaggy and Scooby are like aliens, and I can not escape Fresh, Velma and Daphne, and I've added a lot to the old part when Scooby Doo is good. Instead of fixing the secrets, I hated character changes, because Shaggy and Scooby now play superhero, something they've never done in movies or Scooby-Doo? Show. The theme tune is not very good either, I can not even remember it, and the jokes are lame and contrived. Nevertheless, I realized that there was a very talented voice cast, that they were good stuff and did not tell the different sound of the original human voices, which I could add. In conclusion, I personally think it's awful, and I'm not trying to discredit it, which is what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
