I'm getting a second star because I work in downtown and I love to destroy it. The effects are good - I hear the most expensive Korean movie I've ever done. The cost of big waste is because it is the most expensive and still completely alarm. I can not complain about what I paid, but I have a couple of hours that I will never return again. There are plot holes. Terrible acting throughout the board. I do not have time to watch this movie, life is very small. If your friends want to see it, run away. I can not stress how painful this film is. <br /> The hell comes from the second dragon? Why did he not show beforehand? How are the rocket launchers on the dinosaurs just 500 years old?
