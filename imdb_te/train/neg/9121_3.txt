It's not all that terrible comedy, but it's too DULL. It's just no laugh, and wasting its luxurious product values. When Phu Manchu provided the dose of his elixir to his "enmity", he says, "You are my precious adversary and now we can start again". The scene, however, is the only memorable parts of the film, apart from Burt Quack's entertaining komedia. (* 1/2)
