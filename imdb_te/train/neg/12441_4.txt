Some things need to be explained. Mark Ferris is not a film by Mark Ferris. I know he is my father. Delete that picture. And yet, Marc Ferris is the author of at least one of them. I am trying to find a copy or path to see this movie again. If it has years and you point me in the direction of getting someone a copy, it will be great. This film is not so bad, and it's a waste of trying to compare to today's world of Star Wars and other high-tech science. If you see it, enjoy it for red and humor. Enjoy lighter and less creative and new images on the movie snobs.
