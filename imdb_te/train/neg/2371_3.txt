I'm not a big Freddy Kruger fan, but I'm not like Robert Inglund and his other nightmare on Elm Street Pictures. I think Robert is a very good actor. He played Freddy Krueger better than anyone. But the film is not Robert in the film. The performance was terrible, the plot was really weak, and Freddy Krueger was also the only part of the character to watch that role. Sometimes the sequels are Friday's 13th franchise (I thought it was the best of the remake series) but this is not one of those movies. It's fine, it's good for me to be the 2nd in my opinion, the 3rd is ok but I smoke you can see others. Whatever you do, I did not make the mistake that I did by looking at this trash.
