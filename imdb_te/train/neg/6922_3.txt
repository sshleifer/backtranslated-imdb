A sheets and newspaper campaign (as often as they do) suggest a more sensational and violent piece than what was shown on the drive-in screens. Claude Brook originally worked on films with the Americanization of Claudio Brook, over the years. This one is harder to find anymore; I like to look again to compare with other international horrors of the day, but do not remember the most impressive way. US. This is a version of the small pieces for theaters and video. But oh, a sheet ... still a gem of horror gathering after me.
