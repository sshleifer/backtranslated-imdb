There is nothing in this movie. No one ever tried to act before, see if the extra in the coffee shop is also glued in place. Nothing has been achieved. The quality of the film is awful. The 'action' takes place in very narrow corridors or apartments, the cameraman trapped in a paranormal, some less camera behind and back to 'actors' to deliver their lines. Not the tripod and the proper microphone either, the sound quality is terrible. Manas' rentals are better than that, at least they have appropriate equipment. <br /> <br /> Daddy's new camera is a stick for home videos that some 5 year old kid tries to find the video feature on the phone. You'll have a long search for finding more movie than this movie.
