This plot is very interesting in the face of the Russian Revolution. I saw Budapest because the film was partially shot there. Sadly, there is zero chemistry between the two main characters, so the love story between them is hard to believe. Love scenes are forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirkland is really tight, almost snowy. Rob Stewart was very lovely and kid, so she was more like his sister than his girlfriend. Conclusion, when we finally figure out after them is actually very weak and does not make any sense. If the relationship between the two actors is quite reliable, I think this film is a great pleasure.
