The film is an acoustic avatar, at a stronger level of 11/10. The tone of tunes and cardigans spandex trousers are simply staggering. Although real Scotland is merely colorful, wherever you go, there is not much chance that local people's disputes can "dance". <br /> There are sticky songs and dance scenes there, but the plot is very cheesy and simple, and the conversation is very weak. I also doubt that someone would want to stuck in a timewarped 18.th-century Scottish village of boondocks over homophobic New York City. <br /> <br /> It is not a big sacrifice for the priest leaving Brighadu, but he is trying to get a hell out of the dump. <br /> <br /> This is a good alternative-reality view of the Christopher Street Day Parade LSD in Scotland. I will only recommend the full range of Hollywood mashics.
