Yes, IMDb rating 7.5, good comments, bla, bla ... Ok, my friends and my two friends, we ordered pizza, sat down, and wanted to see if it was cool or versus something like Ichi. But Naked Blood is sucked. This is a complete waste. Well, the scene with a woman who wants to eat is very unusual. But it is. Nothing, nothing less. I will not let the plot in the summer, and other people have already done it, I thought I should stop hype. But watch it and rate it for you. Perhaps where it can increase the rating. Another thing that comes to my mind: The soundtrack is worse than the carpenter - okay, John's cool ... :) 2/10
