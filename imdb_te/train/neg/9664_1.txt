This book-based movie is really awful, and a big disappointment. We are waiting for this move in the month. Many film reviewers are hopeful for it. And in newspapers and TVs, it got bigger sense. When the 29th of April came, many people were very scary. Why? The first of all stories is not so. It has many indefinite scenes, and sometimes it's hard to know what's going to happen. Actresses from Hulia Awassor and their characters are not particularly contrary to Wilson Atesaver. She played well in comedy films, a kind of drama that she could not remove from her previous role. Finally the movie is very small, just 66 minutes.
