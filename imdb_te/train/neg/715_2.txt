This is a really interesting movie from the blurb. Nazis, secret, government conspiracies. I was expecting boys from low-budget Nazi version of DaVinci Code or Brazil or Shockwaves. It's something different, more moody, something like David Lynch. In fact it's plus. <br /> The story is just awful. <br /> Casting part of the difficulty. The role of Adrian Barbeck starts with a little more fragile and frightening. She certainly did not try, but she did not do well at her age. The actor who acted as son was thought to be comedy. Many of the other actors seemed to be considered a campy film, or at least it was acting, rather than aggressive. <br /> <br /> Pasing another big part. It starts very slowly. So slowly you can be tempted to stop it. But when you get your daughter's suicide and come in for a while, it becomes compelling. But sooner it was all worried. Some of these were beneficial, but most of them were necessarily confused, monotonous, and focused. <br /> <br /> The real problem is not just a fun movie to see. It's slow, dull, no one likes the characters. Excessive use of images and sets. Some of the movies you see are torturing characters. In this, it is the viewer. It has some creepy movements, particularly creepy Nazi images and credits, but the rest is largely tiresome.
