The disappointing musical form of Margaret Landon's "Anna and the King of Siam" was filmed with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison in 1946, Debor Kerr traveling from England to Siam in 1862 with his subordinate school teacher and mother and most of the king's children - One can teach one thing or both in the process! Stagy movie begins well, but quickly loses energy and attention. Yule Bainner recalls his stage success as a king, a commanding presence, but used it - as a fictional story - as a buffoon. Although Kerr Merini has a lip-synch for Nixon's singer, she keeps cool respect and good rentals. Perhaps already part of this episode of death, Bryner appears to have no helplessness for translating the screen. The second-half, the musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin", with ridiculing Anna and Muppets, is very ridiculous, and Rodgers and Hummerstein's songs are more discouraging. Brainer won the Oscar for Best Actor, but this keeps the move on water. Overwritten in the worst sense of this term, the massive, and 'old-style'. ** from **
