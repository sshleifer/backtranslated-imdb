My heartfelt advice to all: Do not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even go to the theater playing this movie! It's also a glimpse of health. Serious. No jokes. It was 3.30 in the morning. And I return from this crappiest movie in this universe. Four-hour dawn! I'm very proud to be alive after all! It is called survival. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. Anger. Disappointed. This is pure waste of time! Money went into the stream! There are no plots. I hope to wake up tomorrow sane and without the memories of this night !! Rubish film. <br /> Happy day of the Republic and all :)
