I'm a big fan of the TV series Largo Vinch. This film is suffering for me. I had to go fast enough to stay asleep. It's boring! How can anyone destroy this title? The story is only a good thing. Actors sh.t. They can not live a role. The main actor (Tom ...) is a vacuum. See the other characters of this actor. Combat sequences are unbelievably boring and do not follow, somehow they can not follow the situation. The other reviewer has a low budget film with bad actors. Maybe someone else can work better from this title once again. French does not do well with big films like Alien 4. It is Bit Breer, after 1,2,3.
