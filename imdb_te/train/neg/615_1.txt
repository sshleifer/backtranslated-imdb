I said, I'm like the horror movies I've never seen ... but it's curious for my gory taste. I use the gory, gut wrenching types ... but this particular film is lame. Performance is terrible (yet clapping (no intention) one-liners are beautiful). And the sequel, Scarecrow Slayer is even worse! Yes, maybe, when it first came, there was a huge rack and people liked it. But when movies such as The Ring and the Exorcist of Emily Rose come out, Scarcro films appear as child. If you want the movie to pass the time, select this picture! Special effects are cheesy like heck. But when we see that it's a low budget movie, let's see where it goes. It is the symbol of the "Corn Children" film. Independent Movies Rock ... most of the time. If you want to see killing dead people with concoctions, or if you want to hit 2 fires in the sequel, then these films will be for you.
