One day a person who murders a child in the plot forest is an elderly person who lives on a main road in the woods. Police attempted to persuade him that the soft man for dredging was not anticipated by him. However, every time the old man guides the police, there is no corpse of murders. The soft film to dive reflects the majority of the film, an old man living in a home. I was twice as scared when the child I killed before the movie was suddenly seen before the old man. I do not have to accept the rest of the film. I saw the film a bit slow. Limited conversation is not a problem. Nevertheless, it took a long time to develop the story and its conclusions after watching the film. I feel like I have a relationship with the child and the old man, the soulful encounters. On the night of your own minds, the rare forest can lead to some strange situations, as children are always scary ghosts, see dark water.
