"So this is the bride, you see, and she will be crushed to death by this statue falling on her on her wedding day. Then, get this, a year later, when her ex-fianc√© comes in love with a beautiful mood? That cute mental stolen her boyfriend The devil of the disgruntled dead bride who wants to keep her from haunted by the ghost of the bride? He'll be happy with it! "<br />" New yen An over-the-body ", the new studio, film studio executives expect Jeff Lowell gave her. The big mystery as well as the corporate biggies revolves around the right and how the green light makes this project, Lowell directed the film and lets the screenplay be written. Probably as bad as ever this original mantle sounds, then obviously you think another coming. The author is the only way to work if it is just silly and has become a taboo-barred satire. Instead, he wanted to make a confusing, infamous and warm romantic comedy, Lowell tries to slow down the half-act in every step of the way, reducing the absurdity of the dub convention. In fact, "her dead body is over" is absolutely utterly useless and unfunny, it's hard to know where Lowell thought it was going with it. Virtually every set, joke and sight gag in this movie are flat and poorly executed, and actors also learn about their strict conditions. How did Paul Rudd, Eva Longoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Bignes explain their semi-real and lifeless shows in their different roles? <br /> I do not choose to blame actresses, some of whom have proven their expertise in the past (especially in the case of Rude). But Lowell and those studio execs definitely have some 'splainin'.
