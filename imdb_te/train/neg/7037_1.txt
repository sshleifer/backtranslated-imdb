This is really an awful movie and 2 hours waste of your life. It's nude and bland and dangerous simultaneously, along with our and violence. However, nudity is not that wonderful, and violence is repetitive and boring. Also, the plot is weak at best, the characters are dubious and undeveloped, and acting is some of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I heard this film funny, but it is not. When I watched, I did not laugh at once, and I also smiled. The filmmakers tried to combine comedy films with action film, and they failed both. <br /> <br /> Very bad movies are funny because they are very bad, but this is not one of them.
