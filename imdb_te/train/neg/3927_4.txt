The most common horror story about a luxury mansion at Brooklyn is hidden by hell gates. It remembers Polanski's "The Tenant" ("Sentinel", which released the year before), but is far from the Polish filmmaker's film in the future. <br /> <br /> What's more surprising from this film is the cast: Great names of the American film (Burjus, Gardner) <br /> <br /> Judgment: Just entertaining <br /> * My rate : 4/10
