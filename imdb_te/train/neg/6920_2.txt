Body Slam (1987) is a horrible film. Low-budget reeks, directional pedestrian (better) and writing and acting lame. But if you do old school wrestlers (by mid-80s in the 1970s) then you get more entertainment than the average viewer. I warned you, this film stroke on ice. I thought I was generous because I gave it to both. This turkey "directed" by Stunt Master Hall Needham. Stars Rady Piper, The Tango Kid and a wrestling wrestler and C-list actors (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> The essence of this "movie" is about a promoter who wants to combine "hair" and wrestling, but others do not want him to succeed, there is more but I do not want to spoil it for you.You have a bad acting and untimely storyline In the stomach, finally the end of the hard wrestling fans has some surprising moments. <br /> <br /> "
