... then you are not good at watching this movie. They completely destroyed the premises of the show. The movie is Duke Boys idiots, Daisy is Tramp, Rosco is bad, boss Hog is capable, Uncle Jesse is a criminal ... Only Cooter and Flash are true characters. <br /> <br /> Enos is very close. <br /> <br /> At one time, they opened doors to enter General Lee. <br /> <br /> The original presentation is a great TV, but it makes entertaining and makes sense to the characters. The film meets Dumb & Dumbler Simple Life.
