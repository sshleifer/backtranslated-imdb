Kate Barrett (Catherine Hickland) runs along a special desert road, her car breaks down & her horses goes through ... Deep Sheriff Longley of Riverton County (Franz Luz) Kate disappears after her father reports her. He looks at his broken car and looks at her, unfortunately her car breaks down & he needs to walk. Langley ends up at a deserted dwarf ghost, his shock langle soon finds it is literally a ghost town It lives by ghosts of former residents & evil Devlin (Jimmy F. Skaggs) It was not explained by the reasons Kid kidnapped & culminating in the curse of towns She's up to Longyard & <br /> <br /> Richard Gower's This odd film directorial effort Kaikadi and really do not like a lot to me & I. The script written by Duke Sandyfrey tries to combine horror & Western artists, which does not have any major impact. Have you ever wondered why there are no more horror western hybrid movies? Well, but I find all the answers in Ghost Town because I'm not asking for such a question because it's not very good. Two genres do not mix well. There are plenty of cobwebs out there, some ghosts, an ancient curse, talking bodies & some violent kills, on the main street, bulls, rental doors and upward prostitutes & hilarious intellectuals who are in the innocent town, fearing to have a gang of thugs on the west. I was very underwhelmed, suppose I had nothing terribly wrong with it other than just dull & both styles did not sit together. There are a few holes in the plot, why Dwayne Kate was kidnapped? I knew she was similar to her previous girlfriend, but how did she learn and what was he going to do with her anyway? We never know why this ghost town is filled with ghosts, do I keep them there and cause them to come back into ghosts? The latter tells that he can not be killed only a few minutes after Devlin's shot dead and then why the bullets did not work in the first place? <br /> <br /> The Director Governor makes alright, which has a well-lit cobweb streaked sets & a nice horror film atmosphere in the western Hollywood western town which is represented here on a central street with lining wooden buildings on either side. It's not because I can not say it's scary, there is not much tension and the movie drags in places where it's just over 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> If two people have guns, the budget is pretty small here, It is reasonably well-established and still effective. Clothes & sets are actually very good due to the credit. Acting is good but nobody is going to win any awards. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ghost Town is a strange movie, Anyone looking for a Western will be annoyed with moody horror elements, but throwing Western items to anyone looking for a horror movie. It's a bit different but what's good is it, if your promise is valuable, do not get the gut to see it.
