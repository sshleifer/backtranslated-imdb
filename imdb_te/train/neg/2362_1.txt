The first of the series is the best, one of the best horror films of all time. It is a chipstick. When I sat down to see this, I was thinking how bad it was actually the fourth and fifth ones, these should be good after the previous terrible ones. Boy I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> I saw the first ten minutes. I actually searched for it really, but I thought it would improve. <br /> <br /> The last two (fourth and fifth) is not only a horrible film, it is not desirable yet another sequel. Also, how many times can you bring Freddy back! It is acting terrific, story-line speculating and trash and it also has errors in it. The way they made Springwood was completely wrong. First of all is respected. <br /> <br /> In this movie, "The whole movie" is not "funny" at all. When do you think Freddy Kruger is "funny"? I would funnily call it the worst. This movie is not a horror movie comedy. If Freddie had a daughter, that information would not have been the first! It's just plain stupid and cheesy, as well as the rest. It completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one. <br /> <br /> It is such a shame that Wes Craven is very good at the beginning, but it must be pulled out of the bin in the bin. They should not even be bothered to make this film. There is nothing in the other sequels except the third. <br /> If it's a DVD and I'm not part of the Nightmare part of the Elm Street DVD set, I've removed it <<br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> "Do not waste your time in this worthless junk.
