<br /> <br /> In this film the highest form, human nature, especially the nature of addiction, excellent illustrations and techniques. None is unique. Cameraman was clearly a panicked observer, having an unfortunate addiction to the surrounding and surrounding and circle. Why the director is not giving me this exclusion is beyond me - but perhaps he's been too busy trying, and somewhat failed, this is usually a wonderful but irrelevant cast that draws good performances from the cast. All in all, a weak adaptation. Read your three hours (or read it) book.
