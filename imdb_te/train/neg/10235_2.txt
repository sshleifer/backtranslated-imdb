<br /> <br /> In this film, I gave the film only 2 years, because filmography made such days. This is the other 21st century grind house fodder. Gore is irrelevant and rebellious. I did not care about any of the characters, but I do not care to care for this trash of some cretin pen: I like to complain about the money I spent, but my surrounding and 40 years of cleverly left a minute after the 40 minutes of "capitulation" And amusing "Live Free or Die Hard", perhaps most of all Ratinged.
