The first in this movie is not comedy. You can rarely laugh unless you are really forced. Secondly, the film is slow and boring. Acting is not bad but is not special. In a small town there are two families struggling with each other (with big noses and big ears). Luckily you have a lucky comic humor instead of wasting your time for this movie. Religions and discussions are not a good source of good comedy and this film does nothing more than just to ensure this rule. The same thing is the comedy "home teachers"; Here are some good moments. My last comment: This time and money does not waste to see this wasted and boring image.
