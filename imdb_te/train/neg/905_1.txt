Stella (Bette Midler), a unmarried woman, is pregnant by a wealthy man (Stephen Collins). He proposes to marry her from the sense of responsibility, but she turns flat on her and decides to raise her child as her child. <br /> <br /> I'm a teenager (Jenny) (who is a fictional) who turns out to be worse (and predictable). I saw the quiet version of "Stella Dallas" and the sound version. No one quite impressed me (and I could easily cry) but well made if it's dated. In 1990 it was just a sly idea to try to remake it. I've had enough power after the incomparable victory of Midler "Beaches". This (speculative) bombing. This story is funnier and dating with today's standards. Although Midler and Alardo performed good performances, the film really drags and eventually I was crazy. Both Stephen Collins and Marshallson (good actors) do not help in the supporting roles. Weak and dull. Really - thought of this work? See the 1937 Stanwick version instead. I give this a 1.
