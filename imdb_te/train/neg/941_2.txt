This movie is just bad. It is not even looking to make it fun. The lunatic professor is just plain annoying. Disdain is also allowed to disappear (I'm happy for good movies) and allowing more and more stupid sufferers in the horror film, the film asks more than that. If you're looking for women's locker room shower scenes and random sexual encounters, if you're looking for a bad image, get another one. If you want to waste your time on an annoying bad image, rent it.
