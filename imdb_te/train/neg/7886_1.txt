I have nothing against religious movies. Religious people need something to see on Saturday night, I guess. But the writing-up on the DVD box is really naked as I point this fact to an effective viewer. <br /> Though I am a religious person, I agree with many of the other posters, the film is a mess. Badly directed, poorly acted, poorly edited and soundtrack's effort is a delight. Duplicate voices are terrible, the characters are mainly out of stereotypes, and the continuation window. The only reason we are sitting through this lame waste is that it's too late to see another movie. <br /> <br /> You may not necessarily have any ugly qualities for the film. You must preach your beliefs to trustees, even if it's a worst pile. If you are not, avoid all costs. Do not be fooled by writing a box.
