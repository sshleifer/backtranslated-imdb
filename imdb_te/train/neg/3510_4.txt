I have seen this film recently on DVD and I have to say I did not impress. <br /> <br /> "I'm thinking" Well, they are entering it, The story is going to be made immediately. "Before I knew it, the movie was out and the story never took place.I can not say I'm all impressive in acting.It's too bad.The Star Wars prequel trilogy is not bad, but it's not bad. <br /> I'm not sure, because I have two hours <br /> <br /> However, when the film is complete, I have to walk to halfway to the other side and eventually get bored in my comedy, so I'm not one of the fastest shoots and explosions in a movie Do not get me started because it does not like it.
