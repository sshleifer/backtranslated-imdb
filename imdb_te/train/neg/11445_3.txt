I saw a lot of rubbish in my day, but goodness takes hot rod cake. I saw a free screening in NY. I can hope to show the funny version of the customers they pay. Larger laughs are low, the plot is unhealthy, and the characters are better as a dimensional. A highlight of a hilarious dance scene with Adam Samberg. It is invaluable and the only scene I really have a heartfelt laugh. Moreover, I can only remember the coincidence and the dead wind. SNL & Samberg fans may be disappointed. I hoped for more of it. But small, I definitely do not recommend a free screening or payment to see this movie.
