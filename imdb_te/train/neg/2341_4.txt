Okay ... It looks so far, Burman fans commented on this film only - time for a counter. <br /> Learning is not (mostly non-Belgian): Tom Burman, director of the film, is the main leader of DEUS, the most famous of the late 1990s in Rock Band's in Belgium. Initially, they created the most vibrant and innovative albums and quickly became known to the national level. Then, the allies were damaged and the band dropped apart, along with others to make albums in Barman and Deus-Monicher. This is always the case, and the post-breakdown DEUS is much more than tamer and less interesting than the original. In 1999 they attempted to advance their international reunion with their album "The Ideal Crash", showing a very diluted version of their previous songwriting. They did not do much. However, Igos is still very big: Barman is big enough to be considered enough artist to try on the movies. <br /> <br /> This kind of thing is not a big mistake, and it does not make the film exception. And Barman apparently went to art * in this art, another big mistake. For one thing, he is not a music director and is not a film director. For another, DEUS has the best of it's pleasurable and inspiring music, but I always consider art *. It shows. <br /> What about this film? Moreover, it tells the story of a group of people who are entirely interesting, making them even more unpleasant when they are equally inadequate at Antwerp's Friday, as they are interesting. The characters are inseparable, the plot is totally nonsensical and the film does not have any other ransom features for these defects. Comedy? The whole picture made me smile three times (smile) and actually provoked a 5-second smile (not too loud). Mood? This film does not show any kind of emotion or feeling. Mystery? The "air-man" idea (* a small spoiler *) that promotes the name of the film is trapped as a banana pepper pizza - not too much, and a thousand times (before anyone remembers Jonny Destiny - one of Tarantino's worst performances in the movie up to date) (* END MINOR SPOILER *). Also, its * artwork does not expect to be able to do the actual actions for all of the above. <br /> <br /> In other words, except for some smiles, it's frustrating for me in my stories. Well, the soundtrack is great, but it also faces some of the problems that other OSTs have shown lately: the first is that the film feels more than a commercial for a CD. Second, Burman is trying to find weaknesses and emotional stuff in the back-up image of the quality of the songs that do not just work. Finally, it makes the movie look like nothing more than an illustration. And sadly, this is Burman's own contribution to the soundtrack that attracts a lot of attention, but I'm very concerned that this is the weakest part of the entire soundtrack. Moreover, it stands to show more about music than movies than Burman. <br /> <br /> Even camera work is okay, but you can not make it harder for fun. <br /> <br /> Looking at this film is the only thing seen. Since I was born from Antwerp, it was fun to play a kind of "guessing-point" game. <br /> <br /> In all, Flemish loses another opportunity for the film. I'll be watching late, and the best Belgian films come from the French part of the country. At least, it's mostly because they have something to tell and maintain both sharp and emotional (brothers Daerden recalls). Perhaps the filmmakers of Flemish arts should also try.
