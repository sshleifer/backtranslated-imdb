Okay it will be this little and sweet review ... something that the film must have achieved in some way has made its life less and sweeter than it does <br /> <br /> This image is $ ^ @%. There is a petition with 40,000+ signatures that good reason Uwe Boll demands to make films from franchisees. Blood Ren√© is big there. <br /> <br /> The jokes are good ... if you have never heard of them. Acting descent but u can really only blame the script. <br /> <br /> The film could not do anything with the original games. If you played games u know the motivation motivated as a mass murder that is the real motivation outside of homicide because the main character stubbed his leg or simular. There is a lot of story for such a stupid image. As I say. I can not steal this film too. It is necessary to look around .....................................................................................
