By the time this film was released I saw the chorus line 4 times on the stage and looked forward to the production of the film's most eagerly rumored rumors. Before I opened the box office on the day of release, my wife and I were in line. It's not disappointing, it's a kick in the abdomen. <br /> <br /> First, the story is "moved out" to talk with scenes that do not have theater restrictions. The limits are a big part of the meaning and effect of the story. <br /> Second & third time (Put your own order): One of the original songs with a very serious dance number is removed; A song not included in the platform product. What to say ?? Confused! <br /> <br /> In this film I gave 2 stars instead of 2 stars because my appreciation for performers' talent and effort. I have now seen the chorus line 6 times the platform, and I do not mind seeing 6 times before I die. Wonderfully written with awesome music, heart-indulgent true stories. If you want to see a music that has a great "livestock call" audition, I would recommend all that jazz. If you want to see the chorus line story, look on the stage.
