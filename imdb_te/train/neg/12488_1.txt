0.5 / 10. This film is not good about it. Acting is one of the worst I've seen so far, what's really amazing is that everyone's awful here and there just some, everyone. Directed by a joke, the low budget is undoubtedly clear, the score is awful, I can not say editing the movie, brutally cutting and be the more correct phrase. It combines serial killings, voodoo and tarot cards. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. It's not scary, special effects are disappointingly dull. Humor is bad throughout. This script is very bad. Cinematography is looking very cheap, and is very slippery, and camera work is terrible. Again, there are really actors in the film. Cheesy.
