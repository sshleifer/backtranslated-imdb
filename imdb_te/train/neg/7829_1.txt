In the early 90s, several "quirky" and "off-beats" brought independent pictures, a particular sub-genre, semi-mystical desert crime film. Others of the note are "Wild at Heart", "From Dusk Til Dawn", and somewhat "natural birth killers". Good films such as "Highway 666", "Destiny Turns on the Radio" and this fiercely surrealist anti-work "Under the Hula Moon" are good. This is a comedy intended for an emotional tone, but it does not, but goes to the point of embarrassment. The spirit of the desert and Chris Pen's performances in the spirit-world are good ideas, the film is not enough to be dirty or enough to be a good criminal film, and comedy when laughing. I can not disperse the end, but say it's bad. The film is mainly influenced by the bad side of art-cancer. It is the purse of indie-mania.
