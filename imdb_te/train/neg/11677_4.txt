It was talked about the death of critics when it was not honestly great. Certainly, "Chose" and "Inside Man" literally have a single image, just variations in suspense. But I was "chose" more enjoyable because it was a quick pace like a silly movie "Swordfish". The film was a more popular cause because it was released in the United States and "Chaos" was broadcast worldwide throughout film festivals and overseas theaters worldwide, but still did not find a distributor in the UK and USA and thanks to the classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films It does a lot, but it's a fun movie to watch Not to. <br /> T.V. If there is nothing in it, but you'll get bored just a little later.
