Hi, I'm a friend of Wadalele movies, and the dark wolf's flick of the shelves is "Oh, normal and nice name it's at least the least I have, it's just before. <br /> <br /> First, the film starts with TITS. Many of these movies went to the budget. <br /> <br /> In this way, about the mystery darkwolf character (a little spoiler ahead, but who really cares ...) Your average is everyday, just like actresses who are crazy about the effect of a wolf! The biker is not too difficult to look at, but the old intelligent woman says in the movie, "It's too powerful and dangerous than you've ever encountered." Just a tutor biker- By the way she describes herself ID "red glowing eyes," I will also use a special effect, which appears twice! My God, "cans-plant-red-dot-eyes-computer-motion" effect has been used since the seventies. It can be ugly here! And the wolf does not start with 3D-CGI. As mentioned earlier, it looks like a bad and old video game. <br /> Finally, like wolves images, as I have mentioned. They pretty always build a werewolf-myth of their own. Dark Wolf also builds Wawwallworld, about some of the hybrid-werewolves and some crazy myths of ancient blood. But. It begins with random-slashing almost immediately after creating the rules of engagement, that "anyone who kills someone who has been hit by dark men". It does not make any sense, and even the rules of killing do not even bother to explain why they can not even play by them ... Abulous wolf-point-of-view-scenes are a Sony handgun or something, mostly filming the floor and walls. Just add the sounds growling and you've got a super-werewolf effect. Gore is partially okay. But when the Wolfe walts everybody, it does not trick me by putting the victims on. <br /> In fact, these waste can be made straight-video-video horroritiles, which are not funny-type of bad movies, just sad.
