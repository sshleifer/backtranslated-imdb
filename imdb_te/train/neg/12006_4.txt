Direct Rebuilds Love Right Director Nikhil Advani Half-Time With KHNH Wait and Wait <br /> <br /> He takes a 3:30 hours + movie that loses patience, time.etc. 3 hours sleeping to watch this movie <br /> <br /> They have 6 names required, but why is it necessary? <br /> <br /> We have an Anil-Zuhi story but did not show such boring TV serials? <br /> <br /> We have the story of Govinda-Shannon, but the story of Akshay-Aisha is reliable, but boring, comedy is still a very soft boring comedy. We are Salman-Priyanka's story <br /> <br /> You have the story of Sohail-Isha to laugh and the trick works with gratitude thanks to all the other stories. <br /> <br /> All stories come in bits n pieces, but the audience is boring and sleepy and the climax is not attractive, especially in Salman-Priyanka's story Nickl Advani's management climax locations, some stories are well maintained but Music is good in weak places (SEL), but most songs are good for cinematography, each story is given <br /> <br /> Cast  ోవింద రాళ్ళు, BB తో తీసివేసిన తర్వాత, అతను నిజంగా నవ్వించటం మరియు అతడి వయస్సు మరియు బరువు అయినప్పటికీ ఈ చిత్రంలో అతనిని ప్రేమిస్తాడు అనిల్ కపూర్ తన పాత్రను బాగా నడిపిస్తాడు <br /> <br /> సాయిల్ ఖాన్ చాలా ఓవర్ ది టాప్ మరియు ఇషాకు అంజనా సుకనీని తొలగించాల్సిన అవసరం లేదు. <br /> <br /> Priyanka and Salman are you getting an award for this film? <br /> <br /> Salman Khan does not get involved in his work and is in his sleep and a fake voice is like a lady thrown up on her, and she's fine at the end of her life, Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla Okey Shannan Okay
