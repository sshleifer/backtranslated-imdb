Although the supporting actors' sterling work and a brilliant script by Alan Plater, the film suffers a lethal error - the lack of central character / actor. Richard E. Grant's character, one of the characters, is described as a "broken little grass" and unfortunately he is all perfected by him. His girlfriend and top-level publisher / friend does not have his performance or his performance to make him trustworthy to spend much time and emotional work on him. He was barbaric, proud, selfish, self-destructive and totally annoyed. <br /> <br /> When Ivan McGregor is a speech he is also a part of what is known as a loving actor. <br /> <br /> The witty satirical writings on the class system have been wasted, an embarrassing and totally unlikeable performance. All I want to do is to move him and tell him to receive him.
