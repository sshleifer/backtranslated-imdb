Boy oh boy o goli gey, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing in this movie is the joy of bluescreen effects. <br /> <br /> They looked like I was filmed on the movie, it was totally untrue, and it was not good. Love this movie. The staged "stigma" shots are also really enthusiastic. I mean, hey, if they have a low budget picture, that's fine. You can still make a great picture with a low budget. But, a bad movie and low budget and effects. That makes for a bad combination. In this case, such a sadly combo crapptastic movie, "Invisible Mom." If you have children, your children may not have any taste, perhaps they will be awake to all of these.
