I was amazed at how many comments were "real" in this program. <br /> <br /> If Veronica is Mars, it's in a big way. <br /> <br /> This acting chews enthusiasm and you through the plot truck. <br /> <br /> Reality Rob Thomas and his crew show only how to cut off. Overall, I am worse than a snooze festival and a little annoying. Kristen Bell looks like she could be a good actress, but it's hard to tell with the over-the-top style of the whole show.
