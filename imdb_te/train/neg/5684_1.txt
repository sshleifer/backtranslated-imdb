Badly worried. A simple nihilist brutal gorefest ... If you're the sort of person you like ... look at a pitch. If you're the guy, it's not really good movie, acting is really poor, the storyline is filled with holes, the director really has to leave a real job because it has no talent for this work. I can see why people do not like us. We have some of his films lately and this is sad, it's the best of them, it's really sad! The lack of any sort of humanity seems to be consistent with some people but it just finds it here. Horror movies are deserted, they are a minimal art of art, they are a good sight when they are not ... And the seed is really poor.
