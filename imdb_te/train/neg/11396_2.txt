The owner of cheap romance horror, Rolf Kawfus, makes a film that does not go directly to the Playboy Channel. "The Heezzy" has a huge amount of everything from Nightmare to Evil Dead in Elm Street, but still maintains enough humor to make it look like ... just. The characters are cardboard, dialogue wood, story-paper-thin and actors can not work in a grocery bag. Combine all and you'll have a mascot for the movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat the paper. There is a lot to see this movie. See for 90 minutes and remain in your mouth with unnatural taste and nutritional value.
