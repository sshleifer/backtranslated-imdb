I have read some other comments and I do not accept the end. I thought I was going very well. It drives your mind and then separates it. What's missing in the last two minutes except the full mess? They have improved as they earn money to come up with a better finish. First they say about seven of them (they will make you think about aliens) One person then disappears when a mysterious thing is that they went the worst. I thought actors and actresses were fine, it just went sour script. Anyway, if you look at the end of the movie will be ready for frustration.
