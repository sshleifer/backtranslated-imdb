This film, I do not call it "cinema", is basically nothing and works more for the popular acts of time. <br /> <br /> The war is in full swing (pun intended), and the film gave a treat to the troops and our audience. A young Buddy was pleased to see Rich in the drums. <br /> <br /> "If you belong to a great generation, as they say, you will surely love it" <br /> <br />
