The film was produced by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground), a movie made by Italian horror director Lucia Fulcis. Now this great combination of great talent you can imagine the film is a true gore fest. It does not. As one of the most boring slasher movies I've seen come out of the Italian cinema when the masker has fallen right on its face. <br /> <br /> I am really struggling to stay awake in this film and I have never had a problem with Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> The massacre begins with the one who slaughtered an ax along the road. This scene was used in Fullsley Nightmare Concert. It's not a bad scene and it increases your expectations of a film that is shot as a killing ax. Unfortunately, SO is boring in the next hour. The film is shot in horror film and the scenes have a lot of character development, but the characters in the movie are very frustrating and your interest begins to drop. The last 30 minutes of the film are not so bad, but are still good. There's nothing new since Gore's curiosity in the film and a lot of gore scenes in the Fullby Nightmare Concert. The end of the film leaves a good twist but the most unanswered still continues and the continuation comes right through the floor. <br /> <br /> This is not a very good movie but for a real Italian horror freak (like me) this film must have been very rare since it is rare. 4/10 stars
