Forgive everyone, I know this should have been an "art" image, but wow, people should have handed guns at screening so they can not blow and watch their brains. Although the scene design and photography direction is stunning, the story is very painful to watch. The lack of a sound track is cruel. Loooonnnnng shots are too long. How long can two people sit and talk? Especially when the conversation is about two people complaining. I really had a hard time getting through this movie. The performances are awesome, but how much can you take for those dark, dark, unpleasant things? The only thing I liked was Maureen Staphton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise it would be a replica of Bergman. And I'm not a fan of him or a fan. Anyone I'm enjoying 1 1/2 hours is lying, well.
