Let's say it's simple words to say that the makers of this film are also capable of understanding: this is also the original story like Dumbler script, kitten animation and thumbtacks. Do not be bothered - you need to see the mentally deformed adults or mobs of children. They're off their necks, especially they may laugh. This is a special kind of humor in the funniest film - the filmmakers think that kids are just as insidious idiots, they are spending roughly zero, but they do not even embarrass the inserting of a sweat. It's funny here and there to find an adult amusing. This film, frankly, royally disgust me. Disappointment on you without too little demotion.
