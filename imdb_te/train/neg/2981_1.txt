The film was recently released on DVD in the US and I finally got the chance to see this hard-to-find gem. It also came with virtual theater previews such as the other Italian horror classic "SPASMO" and "Before Darkness". Unfortunately, the previews are good about this movie. <br /> <br /> "The strange way" "Jumbo 3" is actually linked with the "jamby" franchise, a young man who started in 1979, Lucia Fulki. Similarly, "Jumbi", "ZOMBI 3" is a rotating plot and the 'horror' trash just keeps floating and has very bad actors. This gore does not exist (if they are afraid of people running green moss on their face) and the English dubbing is insulting lyric. <br /> <br /> At this point the plot is sometimes dead military operations (ie, an idiot males and his stupid male side kick), some called "Death One", which is meant to re-animate the dead. I do not even recall REASON for research of "Death One" unless my ears did not check. <br /> <br /> Anyone who experiments on a dead body is "devastating one's only" on the poor souls. I look like Ull Brainer), and when it enters his system, he is steep and his head exploded! Sound effects are also very fun - the face of the corpse bubbles can be heard with the sound mud, 'paper pump' sound. <br /> <br /> "Death One" is transported outside the toxin and a 'hi-jacked' by a group of thieves, the person turns into a zombie, but he will contract a deep porter before his timely escape to a cheap motel. And a bathroom mirror (!) Murdered maid by pushing her face. Take this military catch to the air and sooner before the 'pollution zone' will remove everyone who is adequately lazy and before moving the upside down motel. <br /> They are found in the chimney stack (!). <br /> <br /> We are holidaying from the Army, listening to 'Groovy music' coming out of a small hygienic boom-box while a men's team is leaning out of the windows and awkward girls trailer-load lifting their chests. Can anyone say "zombie food"? We also have sub-plot involving her boyfriend driving a car and a car to stop checking a group of birds lying on the road ... The same birds that are infected with 'zombie' smoke! <br /> <br /> Help the birds to attack the boyfriend and drive off a deserted gas station to seek water. This film is one of the most spectacular happy moments. She runs around this old, dirty, rigid and reckless building, where she louds, "hello?" Asked, please, please need some water! She meets a group, one of which is bound to the wall (!) And the other swings the machet. <br /> Meanwhile, the birds will attack the trailer-load of the Worse and a girl gets mature. And infected. They pull up the same motel where the original infection took place, and this is where the second most happiest moment of the film takes place. After hours (in most days), the same motel now dipped in dirt, there are growing wires, and it seems to have been dropped over the years. Anyway, is it a good place to take refugees than this particular building? Needless to say, the group begins to break up when most of them walk together, which will fall into a very obscene situation involving a zombie attack. <br /> Explore a deserted village for the third and most happiest moment of the third, woman comments, "This place is dump!" She continued to carry out a balcony by a zombie in the water of the seat of Pirahana (?), Where her legs blew and turns into a zombie in seconds! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are very few inequalities in the film, making this film very stupid for the words. . For instance, the 'ZombieFeed' time is high for people infected. Sometimes it takes seconds, other times it takes hours. Some people are being driven by zombies, others pull their feet and walk slowly. Some do kung-fu movements, while others are surprised by people to hide under the hey stack. Some people talk to zombies! The fiery moment of the course is the infamous 'zombie head' in the 'fridge' hog, creator 'Lift' as a stupid person looking for food in mid-air and 'attacks'. Funny enough, her girlfriend gets her throat torn by it's 'headless' counterpart (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> The absence of story lines involving people in the biggest disappointment of me actually killed the zombies. We can not see them look back on zombies, in fact we are pecked by the birds we see them only 'zombified' and a girl who bites them. Besides, I am looking forward to a couple who killed a man who was killed in the kitchen and / or zombies coming back like a zombie. These zombies are only amazing to take only 'some bandage' and then move their next victim. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous moment is the zombie embryo. A pregnant woman on a bed in a hospital. She tried to deliver a woman's baby (!) To herself with a "medical knowledge" and her face pulled a woman, bursting her hand before the woman's head over her head and the rest of her face off. <br /> <br /> As always, all the characters are accurate stereotypes of this genre. I guess the film is really a comedy, killing megemonium military officer who is rarely killed, unrepentant freelance women, killing the killers (ie watch for the chase!). A hand grenade (a clear scene of the whole budget) and a scene with a man shouting "I'm the third ... Threaded Blood for You!". The costumes were really bad - the same was seen in the same Bollywood movie Bruce Lee's film that was seen in the same 'Asian-like' costume dress and a blue-looking 60-year-old girl looking at a girl in a motel dressed while she and her boyfriend bump into the infected person. <br /> <br /> The door opens up for the apocalyptic storyline that ends the film. A radio DJ commenting throughout the entire movie turns into a zombie and warns his listeners 'early start' when two survivors take off in a helicopter. <br /> <br /> However, the film will deliver many laughs. Gore is low, and there is no gore, it's very astounding, let alone expect. Black blood, thick green goose, exotic sores and green moss. "ZOMBI 3" makes sleeping on the party or for a good rental on the night of beer and popcorn. In contrast, horror fans should avoid it. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 3
