Keep it this way. I really get this movie. I get what the author / director is trying to do. I understand that the dialog should be dry and emotional. I understand the plot is non-climatic and old. That's what the author / director is doing. Very much humor / comedy. With that understanding, I suck the movie. The film / director Napoleon seems to be trying to rebuild Dynamite with the film. It has the same features. The main character also behaved similar to Napoleon. But Napoleon Dynamite is actually funny. Its script has worked. This is not a movie. It does not have any purpose. Well, let me repeat it. Its sole purpose is to break through the Napoleon dynamite and try to capture that scene. It's not too bad.
