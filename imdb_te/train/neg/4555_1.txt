The film failed to capture the mystery and plot of the book. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of the book is that it is not good for everyone to develop the role of the character, why, even if the insights are rarely touched, why everyone makes such big deals about them and why they like to risk their lives. No background or personal development is really a concern for what's happening to all audiences, so action sequences are flat. <br /> <br /> The search for handwriting ends suddenly, not with a real explanation <br /> <br /> It is one of the worst in the book I have not seen yet. It's terrible and wasting time. If you read the book, skip the image and read it. If you read the book, skip the movie and reread it. <br /> <br /> When removing this movie, the film is no matter how ridiculous and ridiculous. It was very shameful, because it was a good success, and they managed to get a good storytelling and some good actors. <br /> You can not waste your time, read the book!
