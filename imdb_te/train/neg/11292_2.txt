Cornell Wild and three dumbbells search for sunken wealth in the South Atlantic. <br /> <br /> Wild-headed treasure hunters fight target sharks with cute little pirates on their hungry face. <br /> <br /> Wild and his hilarious men begin searching for a way to get the menu so they can start an old Spanish gallean excavator that is filled with gold bars. <br /> <br /> When a team listens to a little perpetuity, argument and the annoying health tips of the Wild, 5 crazy exploits capture the boat and complicate things. <br /> <br /> Now that this is a treasure, let's see what happens in the shaft of the shark. <br /> <br /> "The Naked Pray" was 10 years ago and he was in excellent condition. <br /> Made on a budget of 75 cents.
