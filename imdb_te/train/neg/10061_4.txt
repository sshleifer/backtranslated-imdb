'The Curse of Frankenstein' is reliable for a title to Mary Shelley's story, though these changes are not as good as any good. The tragedy of the creature that destroyed the Frankenstein family was completely removed and replaced ... nothing. The heart and moral center of the story is gone. It does not help Frankenstein to be a conniving, devious murderer; He gets everything he gets. This plot is primarily a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clips. Even though it has its own rules, it is even worse: a film featuring a psyched-soul living with a pudding bowling hulk. This is the first of Hammer's horror films, directed by Terence Fisher and Peter Kushin and Christopher Lee's role in the horrific history. But it's the worst.
