I do not give this movie a rating, it's not worth it. I see only because I am a Pfieffer fan. I love her and see anything she has done. She is not disappointed in this trash. Every scene with her kept watching the viewer ... waiting ... something went wrong but nothing was done. It has some good story lines but suddenly ended soon after they started immediately. <br /> <br /> Puffer is 29 years old when she is so cute in the film. Wardrobe and set are surprisingly good. <br /> If I see anything more and rarely look across an image, I can not like it, but this is a worst thing. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about it is that it eventually has a bigger hill. It's a closing scene where you woke up and say oh, this film finally goes to a certain place, then the credits roll. Good grief. <br /> I agree with the review .99 Cat food bought 3 bins and eating my cat was very exciting. Well done. Actually, that commentary is more fun than the movie, because it's very good. I was very ruined .99 dents.dud.dud.
