Okay, I'm blessed. I have seen two very strong theatrical productions, one in New York with the original cast and one in San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you rock!). Compared to this film, the film is almost invisible. I've been plodding through the DVD for the past two nights and is not yet complete. Way is a lot more dialog, and waaay added scenes and people too. Yes, the four major performances are great, esp. Mrs. Streep. But comparing an image to the stage is certainly an example of "less is less." Dramatization of the play is a poor choice to satisfy the need for cinematographer and distinguished personality. Please, find a theater product nearby.
