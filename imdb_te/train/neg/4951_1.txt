When I first started this, I commented it and gave it a "thumbs in the middle", which provided the benefit of doubt beyond the first part. <br /> <br /> In June 2006, I have seen six points in total. As a lifelong Batman fan, I can say without doubt: this program is completely worse. Everything. <br /> <br /> The story of the hero and the design has been mocked and stories are mockingly muddled, and the writers of any kind have no interest in developing or expressing any ingredient in any of the articles. It 's just me, or the joker in every episode ?? Gotham is part of a reverse-door legal system? <br /> Once again, the authors are not entirely interested in making any effort on other villains (see "Development of any character" above). <br /> Furthermore, each subject is the Joker <br /> <br /> The Joker walks the whole city gas. <br /> Batman saves all day. <br /> <br /> I saw an episode that was not the story of the Joker. The title escapes me, but the confusing clomaster with the villain quiz show ... "Think Third Thunk" is part. One of the worst Batman stories I have seen, heard or read. Yes, "I've got Batman in my basement" worse. <br /> <br /> I can not say I feel this show because it's probably against Tots, but it starts with "B" and "Fast". Thank you for Timim / Dini / etc. Fox and Kids are the era of bot-entertainment from WB days. Stuff is that good, and I should know this, just could not possibly last forever, unfortunately.
