I'm very proud of the movies I rent in my childhood. Exemption Theodore Rex. Talk about the fraudulent image of any actor resume all the time. Can you imagine what she told you to sign this part of Woop's deleted agent's garbage? "Hey Woop, you see that show dinosaurs, yes they make a movie, and you see Germany!" That agent would then have to mention Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The film is very bad, I bought a copy of the film and destroyed it. I think my memo can do the same thing, because my sister gave me the worst for watching the film. I mean, I saw Nani and Kazzam theaters (good reasons why I gave Hulk Hogan and Shock), and this is my bad childhood in my mind, and big rental remorse in my life, and that was 16 years ago. <br /> <br /> I can not tell you a list of all my schedules of worst movies, because I am trying hard to put down what I have ever done. You Would Screw, just happy people will recognize your worst Eddie and No Act 2 as lucky as you are.
