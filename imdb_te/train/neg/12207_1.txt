I loved this film when it came. When I was 12, I had a Commodore 64 and played Rambo's role. I was really thrilled when I had to buy this film really inexpensive. I put it on my VCR and started: Man is really bad! Sylvester Stallone has 3 words (except that awful emotional speech at the end), and his face has the same expression. And that stupid love thing in the middle, it's just wonderfully predictable. I'll take the whole thing up and down and go to the movie switching for another.
