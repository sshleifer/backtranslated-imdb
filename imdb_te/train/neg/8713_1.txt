Scott Valentine is too big for ten sizes, a desire on his face is not so bad with lasting effort, everything else in the film is evil, story, acting, effects but funny, funny, funny! A special OPS group leader is its happiest! "Terrorists" are scary and realistic "nights", which is funny and bad in everything that tries to laugh .Watch the metal pole that sticks up something in the world of T-then something is up and you have the perfect end with its head .In your bad movies, The golden pot, bb - the Mona Lisa of the evil !!!
