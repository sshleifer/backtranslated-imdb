I had a different discontent with this movie at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. I attended this festival for 5 years, and in some cases I definitely saw poor movies. However, the new brand in the film 'First Byte' has reached less. While filming in amazing locations, occasionally, the excellent food was taken out, the film ended up with a great deal of plot turns and steady roles until I practically begged. The mainstream journalist, David La Haye, has failed to present any role throughout the film, from the beginning to the role of a luxury chef. Additional sub-plots, such as eating defects, were developed very little and the film did not fit in any case that was shown at the time. <br /> <br /> The theme of the mysticism is used as a poor effort to cover a picture that does not achieve anything, goes somewhere, and completely disappointing.
