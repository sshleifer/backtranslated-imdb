Believe me, this allows you to drop down the image you want to avoid and this comes from a big Denzel Washington fan. The disappointing part is 1/3 of a great image. The first part of this film will set up roles and make a unusual job of a new relationship between a Creasy and a girl he paid to protect. The trailer is said to be her kidnap. So, I'm giving away nothing when she says that after her kidnap the movie will deteriorate into almost unwatchable mess. Even if the director tries to do anything, his achievements are literally disappointing the audience. Rapid, frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half hour as the cruise criminals track down. These cuts are very unnatural and all the stories they did make you out of the story. I thought that this disturbing way to tell the story is a change in the role of Crese and that the director is following another movie. Well, he's right. The next film is complete and unsatisfactory trash. As a result, the quality of the film will be over forty minutes.
