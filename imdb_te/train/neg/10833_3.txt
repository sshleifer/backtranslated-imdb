I like magnolia. Plot reminded me of the Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories to meet in the end, but by Magnolia's film half disputed and I was gone. I almost stopped it from time to time, but I knew I'd stay there until the end, and I know that eventually 1 1/2 hours will be another torture. Thanks in the theater instead of the god I rent. I was disappointed after about 2 hours. The frog is the biggest fighter in the pants. My DVD player still did not forgive me and I can not blame a bit. It's a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless movie.
