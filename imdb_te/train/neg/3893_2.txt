I was thinking that the main character, the bad case for the astronaut to run, (in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc.) can always get more cinematic work after he'd reduced to an ink. All he has to do is get a job like Bob. The maze of the film is very beautiful. An astronaut radiates the sun's radiation (I think), so it behaves like ice cream cone in a hot day. This is not a puzzler, but apparently he has to kill humans and feed their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity. Huh? Have you ever watched what kind of radiation risk or experimentation would make a person instantly killing a machine? <br /> <br /> The astronaut surrenders the nightly 'secret facility' (which is not safe). Apparently he had just enough memory to make head for launch pad, probably because he wanted to return to space. <br /> <br /> A doctor uses a Geiger countertop around and begins a piece of pretty filling film. He killed a stupid Bill Gates Look-Alike Fisherman, fanned a young girl with the image of Frankenstein and ending an absurd old couple (punishing them to steal some lemons). Then he has a small scene where his former general, and whacks a very scene where he kills a young gun and surrounds his girlfriend around. If you cut his arm then run away, the scene may change. But ... we were shouting in terror, even though panting in a corner of the woman's treatment for ten minutes and gone with the monster. <br /> <br /> When the film ends, Lamer is better than the rest of the film. The melting guy go into the pipe, and then ... nothing. That's it. This is the end of the movie. Well, that means there's room for at least a sequel.
