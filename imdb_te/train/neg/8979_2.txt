It is "very funny that it's funny but very easy to be crazy" said Jon Pertwee. In that case the pasty face was "very easy". David Baker (as Director / Screenwriter) and his performers in voice comedy is stole scenes and style from top brackets such as Lock Stack and using a fully developed script and tracking and loudly too loudly. Alan McCaffrey suffers from this kind of OTT performance, but the film is not enough to destroy. <br /> <br /> Pasto Face is terrible in all sectors, especially scripvides. I could not understand why it ended, and it seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner. Oh and other glaring flaws You need a visa to visit America and the green card - you believe that you can start a new life in America - still paid to donate blood in America - I know in America and donate donations For many years The stream is discontinued - and what kind of weapons can be purchased from the gun shop. Gun shops sold anti-tank guns on the counter as long as I knew that gun laws were different from the states. So we got so much unrealistic and oh so unfair view of America from the unfunny movie. Maybe a revenge for the Brave Heart of Scots-based Hollywood scene? Perhaps, but it does not stop past faces without worrying comedy
