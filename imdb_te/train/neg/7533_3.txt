The film has some of the favorite elements. Maybe too much for my taste. The writer / director felt that we were trying hard to experience the inner confrontation of his characters. Not once, sometimes ... but at all times. <br /> <br /> It's not the movie, the work of television. <br /> <br /> The location of the train station is well-received and I enjoyed the Sascha Harler performance as a pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I felt like Justin Clark's performance had diminished. Though the director was trying to draw the themes of the film through her heroic feelings, her reflexes were compulsory. I can not even believe that a director can make an unbelievable presence in the spectacular Daniala Farinacci. <br /> <br /> I have found the option of pop music in the whole scenes. This is not a lazy device, especially pop music, from any diagetic and / or where the song's songs are considered awkward. <br /> <br /> There is a stark appreciation of Australian heat and stimulating the local perspective. It creates heat and sunshine atmosphere. Using the special animation order, preserving the film from full western, filled with passion and handmade attraction. <br /> I think this conversation is very complete. "Who knows someone?" <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments came home from cricket with a group of flowers declaring his wife "I am smoking". <br /> <br> Smoking anti-advertisement? TAC statement with some flavorful animation? I had to leave the movie at a 50-minute mark - it's too much.
