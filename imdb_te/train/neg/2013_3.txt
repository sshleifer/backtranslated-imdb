What is the film with a futuristic version of Cinderella Legend but with songs and (most witty) sex scenes? The film is not exactly what it wants and ends up pretty much a mess. It is much more expensive than director Al Madison films, but it is not at the same budget level that spectators expect from science fiction films. The actors are very good and unlike many Adams movies, there are no former big names or B actors. The music is okay but it's easy to see why Cinderella has forgotten many years 2000.
