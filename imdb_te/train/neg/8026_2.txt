It makes wonder how this program is in the air. The two were together, married and had children, but everyone broke up. What is this continuing point? The show is entertaining at the beginning. You see all the girls are swooning over a man, almost all of them are instantly like them. It's in real life! Girls start to fall on the sides, bitch out to each other, and show off their true people (or think of it). <br /> <br /> Two children, how would you come for someone when you had to choose them? This performance is unbelievable. Dating dating online was bad, but should people go on TV to find love? It's not realistic. When a person is working with him, how can a person be with others? None of these questions are answered and you know that the show will eventually get better in the future when the show ends. For all of us know, everything is in the script.
