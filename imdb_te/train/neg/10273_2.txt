When it comes to horror films, I want to discourage disbelief, ignore the sub-par production values ​​and ignore the plot holes in the interest of good fears. These films do not have good fears. It can not even experience the camp. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad direction, murders, predictable and poor performances, music is abhorrent, camera work is bad, clothing is also bad. I felt really bad for the actors I was trying to do, but I had to deal with the terrible, fictional dialogue and the obvious lack of directing. I suspect, they got no rehearsals. It is impatient to look at, and it's frustrating to do it by ending "surprise", which requires strenuous patience. <br /> <br /> I do not usually write reviews, but this is very bad and I thought it was strong enough to warn others. The film is completely waste of time. If you have to watch this movie, do not miss the "Making Of" feature. The author / director appears to have murdered the lady as bold and brave. (Seeing it.) He and the casting half an hour referred to the film as "Citizen Kane" as the new-age. It's like taking the scenes behind their Christmas show like listening to a third-graders group. They really think they've created something of the ingredient. Is it really sad? I think the "1" should be reserved for real attacks like "Manaus: Fades Hands" and "Space Miliny." Because I gave this film to "2". So "American Nightmare" is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but I'd have to say that somewhere in the bottom fifty.
