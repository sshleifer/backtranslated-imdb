On its face, Ruiz walked out to make a mental thriller. Although it does not satisfy a classic piece of the genre, there is also a compensation. They were both harder and hardest among women between Hubert and Bali, but they were both forced to compete in a computational battle; However, in a genuine European art-house style, women do not release this speech, as alternatively women try to behave in kindness. <br /> <br. In fact, if we follow this title, the film is much less about the thriller skeleton as Jane. Campaign's The Cut. Instead it is a priestly psychological study focused on men. The boy, Camille (Nils Hugan), takes a decision on a practical joke, and plays against his mother, the other mentally disturbed woman. Two women are diligently scattered and these compounds are a problem. An intemperate psychologist (Charles Berling) who is rapidly confronted with women in his life - calm and (we learn), acting as a symbolic adult counterbalance - his sister Huppert, nanny or his pay. Henry James' father of the film, 'The Turn of the Screw, Denise Poddelides', did not implement father's law during the film period. <br /> <br /> Rouge plays an oddly moment from Hubper's reaction to Hollywood's direction. <br /> <br /> The film is ultimately discouraged when you read as a thriller or psychiatric article. I was officially bored with Mme Hubert's screen system, which was buried very much and I'm looking forward to seeing her on stage again before I can return to her (the European enjoyment of heaven's gate). Support is good. There is no fee for Ruiz Cast. I'm thinking of Isabelle, especially Edith Schoek's Shamanic neighbor - communicates to Bafflement but I know knowing if he is leaving far classier away in his direction, far away from some poor lighting and some willfully odd shots. Set pieces do not link up to a forward driving plot - I'm not tired of the tension already suggested but ruined in its directional potential. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see a good contemporary French thriller? See L'Appartement instead. 4/10
