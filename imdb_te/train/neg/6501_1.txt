The film is once again, one of those films is trying to make sense of it or try to try. Anyone who tries to make this sense is a morn! My advice is not both but a very strong acid takes two hits and at least you'll get a visual thrill out! Finally you can kill yourself to waste your acid! If you need 10 lines of information for this comment, I will write something for you that tries to save the film. Unintelligble. Garbage. Schitzoid. Talent Waste. The film is ringing in clouds, with snow in the sunny dive in pudding. It looks like a lion in red twilight. Describe me now !!!!
