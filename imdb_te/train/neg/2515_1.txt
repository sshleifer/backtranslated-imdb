The film is unreal and its preparation is to be considered a capital crime. <br /> <br /> No one ever has ever done a reliable film simulation of this marvelous mystery. It is a really gripping mystery story, nice old fashion romance, and dry English humor. Why producers have to change Richard Gordon from a Scotland Yard policeman with an amateur detective, his English servant's idiotic character and sarcastic introduction, murder charge and change of part of the main storyline about Gordon's struggle to save charges. These producers and directors are better than what is in the book Make a stretch Those who think that Starda should not write the original script and do not raze another's product.
