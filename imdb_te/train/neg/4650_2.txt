With the star cast of British journalists and the 1950s Briton's lovely photograph, I felt more fun by this movie. Unfortunately I found it glued to for the wrong reasons - I could not believe how awful it was. <br /> <br /> I have seen thousands of old films and are ready to make permissions for the products of their time, but it is very difficult. <br /> As others say, a delicate romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or a musical. When Jenny Carson suddenly broke the song about 15 minutes I was a bit gobsmacked! It is not unbelievable at any stage, the storyline or daisy will never appear to have an ounce of harassment at any time. Other contrary to credibility, Donald Sindh's songwriter (a lyricist for God!), Is the Diana's holders at the highest level and does not seem to have a bit of interest in her (I mean, Diana's Doors! Come on!) And a song is a funniest scenario in the publisher's office. <br /> <br /> When I chose that favorite scene, I started with the great actor Wilfred Lassen. Everything is a big way.
