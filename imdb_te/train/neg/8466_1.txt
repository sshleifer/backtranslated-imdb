<br /> This is a great, funny spoof B-movie science fiction that has been completed correctly, but sadly, it should not be. Sometimes the most justified actors in the play field have suffered a lot of difficulties with such a dog-snack-to-be. I can only accept comments from previous reviewers - clean the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Positive: Nose of Lucy Biemon. <br /> Every plastic physician can face such a task.
