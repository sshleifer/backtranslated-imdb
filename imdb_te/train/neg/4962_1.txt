99.999% pure garbage. And the other .001% I was in a sleek moment. <br /> These conversations are legally bad. The action sucks, and there is no sex (the elegant chic we mentioned earlier is wearing, alas, the whole picture). The CGI is the worst I have ever seen in the film has dubious dignity, and anacronyms are numerous and glitter. Acting is only from Ben Cross and Marina Sciris, the only 'names' in the film. <br /> <br /> I saw high school being more productive. This MST3K is a flourishing film type. To allow this steam pile in the air, go to Heads Size-Fi.
