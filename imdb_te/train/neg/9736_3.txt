Tob Hooper faced luck with his terrific 1974 horror film 'The Texas Chain Saw Massar' and every time I see another Hooper movie - the scene is strong. It seems that he wanted to hoop up his own pictures, such as scanners and firestarter in 1990, so we end up spontaneous combustion; A movie with good ideas and a whole load is taken from other movies. Put it all together and you get a messy, boring image that is good to miss many people! The film leads audiences to audiences, which could be half of the initials, focusing on some experiments on the two young men in the fifties. The couple have a baby and some of the experiments that have been done after a while are causing death. A few years ahead fast and the baby is now the oldest named Sam. But naturally he is not a normal person and he realizes immediately when he realizes he has the ability to set fire as he wants. <br /> <br /> Brad Dourrup, starring in the film, his success with child play two years ago; But the Central Performance is really scary indeed in an uninspired decision; And terrible support does not help demonstrations. The sensitive direction and the dull script have also not contributed to the film, and the lack of support has special effects which is unrealistic and there is nothing on these images. All this happened a few years ago. The plot is really slow and the note happens almost an hour before anything happens, and I do not even care about it. It is clear that this film is going to be directed shortly and it all covers everything. The final confrontation is a big disappointment and nothing in the film is really explained. No divine message is not that interesting. Overall, it's another reason why the worst movie and Tob Hooper is a long way from a great horror director. See the Firestarter instead.
