A friend of mine is a FEDS agent (non-speaking piece, I recall) in the cast. He brought it on DVD, so I could see. It was "interesting", but was considered as the most ambitious movie. Well-made amateur movie, though. Really boring and poorly written. It's probably fun to make and get involved, but it certainly does not deserve any kind of extensive release. <br /> <br /> They feel that they will enjoy in Omaha, but this California girl is bored and sincerely has suffered for my friends' involvement. <br /> <br /> If this film is made or made more movies, a really interesting story line, and good actors. I am a great learning tool for them. I wish them good luck in the future, and they hope to improve their film making.
