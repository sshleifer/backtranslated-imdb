Without a brief description of what I read here, I have noticed anything about it. After watching it, I told him that the director promised, but it looked as an amateur, then he saw other things he had done to see if he was his first or second film, but he did house on Haunted Hill and Fear Dott Com. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty awful, she is a pretty girl because she is very beautiful but the mind has a child I finally ended up finally 3, because I finally had some visuals that I enjoyed recently, but overall the film is pretty terrible.
