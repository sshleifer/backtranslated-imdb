"Executive Producer" does what in a film. If I remember correctly, this film is the person who finances financial support. You're the executive producer in the bigger movies Sean Connery has played, and Canary raised money since he was a major player. Unfortunately, since he is a major Hollywood player, he has to show a number of films that have created Sean Connery, usually credits executive producer and star film, and the same movie is not more than a star vehicle even though the story / screenplay is not up to scratch <br / > <br /> PROTOCOL Saga CRAZY OF A Sunny Davis One is a kooky bimboesque cocktail waiter who rescues a visitor and serves as a great diplomat as a reward. The topics are that Ms Davis finds himself in more extreme and less likely situations where she has a problem with two sentences. The ProTOCOL stars are the executives of Goldie Producer Hoan I is the story / screen Ai said that the lines are not live?
