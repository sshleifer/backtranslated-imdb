The main character of this sitcom is the main character Jim based bad guy, bad husband or simply great selfish. How can you be funny <br /> <br /> A character in a sitcom is flawed, but Jim's character is in a very impartial manner. In my opinion it is because he says "to be good now". Jim is not a fool, he can look carefully at things and get a chance to do that. But he chose. When he chooses not to play with his children because he does not want to buy "Lady Products", it is his choice to choose when his relatives fall. <br /> Since the other characters appear only in the series, the gym can have a jerk for anyone. If Cheryl was a real person, she would have left him a few years ago and would not die for 8 years. But alas, she is a catalyst for gym's extreme middle class extreme selfishness.
