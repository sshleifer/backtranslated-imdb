.... it's caip! Go to the filmmaker and say "why?" The type of cinema you want to say. Terrible camera work ... The camera tries to stay consistent on a person and not. The dialogue is ridiculous. Acting is ridiculous. It looks like they have taken a ghost town in the west to see if they can make as little money as possible. To make this I used home video cameras to bet $ 10. Either, or most cameramen are drunk. Really trailers are more entertaining than this film. If you ever want to host a "worst movie party", take this matter. Want more entertainment ... stare at a wall.
