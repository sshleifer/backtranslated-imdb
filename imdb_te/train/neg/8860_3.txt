OK, as everyone has said, this is a complete dog movie. For some people it's a cryptography film because it's too much (or disappearing) to escape the ex-rating of the sensor. <br /> First, the script writer seems to have mixed its wolves and vampires. The film does not like irritated fur and silver, but in each other they behave like vampires. Now you can not do that with a bad image, you are committed to the rules of the genre, or the fans are confusing all, and disloyalty in the wrong place. In fact the whole (confused and poorly presented) plot is already made for vampires, but the wolf does not give any meaning in the film. <br /> <br /> Second, you have never seen a werewolf clothing. <br /> <br /> With the two people, I really liked a lot. Others have referred to Cybill Dancing Touts. <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to have a plan to attack the Werewolves' grip. There are many horror movies that are based on stupid characters, but in this case they will buy the most intelligent and effective anti-wolf arsenal and kill monsters. I mean, you can kill the waswolves with silver bullets, and these days we have very powerful firearms. Can not be too hard to put together two and two, alas? But in the distinctive style the movie goes to the top and some add more sensitive and fun lycophanp weapons.
