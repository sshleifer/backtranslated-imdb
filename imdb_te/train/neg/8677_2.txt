I liked Chiba in the Street Fighter and hey, even if it is stupid, I see some hitting the donkey. Wrong. It's a frustrating, frustrating mess of semi-humorous writing and meaningless scheme. What kind of action scenes, less martial arts scenes, and much less will be filmed and you can not even do what's happening in the world. The dub is also terrible, and perhaps the most striking thing is the fact that it contains the Italian mafia ... They exclude all of the Japanese! Avoid the plague - you see good martial arts by looking at the window of your local preschool karate class five minutes.
