I chose the film primarily because Anoano Tadanoobo also portrayed Kittono Takashi's incredible remake of Jotocchi and the updated samurai story. These two movies are different from the worlds. Zatoichi added humor and its characters and deeply classical samurai film cliches. <br /> <br /> First, I hate movies with other characters, tell audiences to the audience, in which the character plays a major role. "You can not decide whether you are a monk or a warrior" states almost every role in the existence of Benny, although in the role of this internal crisis itself, Instead of character development, we get boring, gory war scenes. Asana's character is booming and he is frustrated and does not know what he's doing. <br /> He finds that he is generally distant and good and is a part of Asana's appeal, but the film does not serve him. <br /> <br /> Camera movement is very boring. There is a scene where the camera goes on forever wandering around the main characters until my wife and I felt like vomiting. The end is ridiculous and anti-weather is opposite. <br /> <br /> Now there are no good samurai movies in Japan. Colors, scenery, and costumes are great, but the rest is just a loooong waste. I see one of these mythical versions of this legend.
