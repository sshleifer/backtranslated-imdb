(Spoiler also, some became) <br /> <br /> This film can not be seriously responded. In some places it's terrible, and I can not help laughing at all. Stalin's role is a 20-meter distance with full climbing gear or (and this is really my favorite) try me for the sequence that makes me smash a bad guy to put him in a stalactite. Yes, what terrible power did he have to do with such panic? I say, but he certainly gives a run of reality for money.
