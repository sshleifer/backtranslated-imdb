A very good knowledge about Germany's film is essentially a young man who is facing problems for his mother and her boyfriend must tell about the movies made in the past. If such a movie is shown to the people again, then it will be a new, fresh and challenging audience. Germany's filmmaker Silke Enders, the main character in his film, Crowco, has misdemeaned everyone around him with his mother and boyfriend. She has no courage to face any punishment when she attempts her hand in all kinds of criminal activities. Shoplifting.Kroko first shot on DV blown after 35 mm format. We do not hamper our joys of technological maturity when Kroko learns to seek to become a cop she feels she's reluctant to think of a run from Mills hairdresser. If someone expresses a positive perspective of Silk Enders, Kroko can interfere with disabled people as a result of the punishment. Joys and sorrows.
