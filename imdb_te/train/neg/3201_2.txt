Joe Donne Baker is a good actor in small roles here and there ... He has a pretty good band villa in Allright and The Living Days for Goldie and has acted in many other films. One thing that he can not do is primarily a film, which is in this very disturbing revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Dan's partner was killed because he kills the killer's brother and then kills Italy, but some people are forced to set up in Malta and the killer is away. Joe Don has been detained several times by Joe Dawn chasing here and there killer, Joe Dan is harassing and interrupting a bartender and acting thereby. The picture is very bad and you will not find the pull of Joe Dawn for sure. The protagonist Joe Dawn proves how many times he has been removed by a punch and inefficient. Zone Dan chases the killer over all Malta with the killer in the priest's cloth and then they get in the boats and the film crowns part of it when he chases them all around Malta. The movie is one of the most deadly ending lines to end the film.
