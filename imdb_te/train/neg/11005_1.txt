This movie shows the sequence of sketches, which partly crosses each other. I know it's going to be late at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes in the movie come without significant punchlines and try to move around in reality using absurdity and obscenity. <br /> <br /> When watching this film my boss is a bold attempt to turn into something great: my staff and perhaps the subjective result (my god every time I call it "motion picture") hurts my head. But it failed. At least the director did nothing. But this is not good. <br /> <br /> Many films are not as funny as it is in the plan, but it's topped by all of them. It is a real life manifestation in a worst case scenario in film making. No. It's worse than me to correct me. The picture with the impersonation is very bad, they are nothing more than funny. It's not even fun to see the main actor, the writer and the director (the same third person through the way) to die through the sink of bad movies. This movie is very bad.
