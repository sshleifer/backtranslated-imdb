<br /> <br /> Some movies are actually "they are very good", and Zombi 3 is not just bad, but it's unfortunate. <br /> <br /> It's more than just a picture from Lucy Fulzi, Fully reasonable, feeling or reasonable. But he did not direct Falco, but Bruno Mattei did not even have the style of Fulki to help bring the film. <br /> <br /> So, I'm ashamed to say how happy I enjoyed every minute of Zombi 3. With the silly characters, the weak story, and the lack of imagery, zombie 3 goes out of the boat, but doing so is even more ridiculous than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> "Death 1" stole the gas from a military base and run away to escape. Who is the thief, why he stole it, and why the US military thinks it is a good idea to create a dead country-related cannibalistic forces? <br /> <br /> When hiding from the hotel at this hotel, the infected thief is trying to burn it through the army to determine the best way to dispose of his dead body, some of the green plastecine on his face, "Death 1" into the atmosphere ... Zombie Birds! Then attack people and turn them into zombie people! <br /> <br /> Then we meet our "heroes", Horny GI trilogy and girls coachload. Most of the other boys are with them, but they are not important - here is not an important one. Hold a hard time to remember someone's face, just let them know their name or find a reason to care for them. They end up hiding at the hotel like a thief ("It's buzzing with this place a week ago, now it's buzzing with flies!) But escape from the undead. <br /> <br /> Point you'll suck it completely or you're damn The subject will be turned off.The script is so messy in the world's greatest acting so it's not even saved, so they have some of the worst Some of the best - and only human characters, the action of the zombie zombie all the time - there is no agreement on how to behave zombies - some time honored in style, some are engaged in fist disputes or charged around with magic and not to mention zombies that can speak (this is a gimmick harfling treat They are from gunfire to chest (k Kunda head) and die down with a good left-hook How can you punch out a zombie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The focus of 80 actions that seriously reflects an episode of V is often reflected. <br /> <br /> Zombies are also hiding a lot of time, some poverty will pass through the sap and get the fear of their life. They also hide in shrubs, garages, cottages, roofs, water and pregnant women. At one time a zombie steps follows a woman. Will she kill and eat? No! Push her into the water, the zombies and their absurd sense of humor! <br /> <br /> There is plenty of gore. The remnants are hacked, wounded green paws and eating meat and eating the faces of people have nothing to compare, but unfortunately the effects are not in your bag <br /> <br /> All of these and I can not tell terrific music, Zombie Head, whose acting actually is really bad Vahincedi, or being overrun by zombies last Chilling panclain ... an ingenious twist on the original radio station, Zombi 3 will give us a real zombie DJ !! "He's gone on their side!" "<br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not want to be alone, <br /> <br /> "Do I say I'm rich? I am 88 minutes less ...
