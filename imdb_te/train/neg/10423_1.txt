So ... it's a sexiest, and classist, and I do not want to change this because Stella says Steven, as Stella says that Stella wants her to really change and talk in the right way. Well, he certainly changed his tune, and it seems after other reviewers sued. In the beginning, love story is a social appointment and women are sacrificed mothers. The end of the film is not a hero for her, it makes the whole thing sad. And her sad people think she makes a hero. Perhaps people wanted to make a film. Positive response reflects the continuous patriarchal flow of social conscience. Yuck.
