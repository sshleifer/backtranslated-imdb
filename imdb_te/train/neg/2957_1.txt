What a mess !! Why did you make this film? This, and other films of its "carrier" should teach the tools on how to make a movie. Children may like it, but more than 10 people may or may not. The great talent, such as Hupie Goldberg and Armin Muller Stall, has deteriorated further to the lack of any noticeable film.
