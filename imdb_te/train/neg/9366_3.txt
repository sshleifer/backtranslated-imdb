I hired a hybrid for the weekend. No disappointment! A big laugh in the tele-movie. When he was completely weak and running the guy they got for the lead he was eating that minty sweet [he made a lot of} looked ... his back! I feel that the actor is very wealthy because he does not fear anything about his performance, but the wolf he wears is very good. The clever American American chick should be one of the most harsh faced hogs ever seen. Talk about sour cow! She smiled once for the whole movie, and I feel because she was sexy. The sexual scene is very dull. <br /> <br /> All in the end, it has a lot of hatred in the mine, in the cover and on the DVD menu, cool sharp teeth on the lens digitally filmed. They did not appear anywhere in the film. :(
