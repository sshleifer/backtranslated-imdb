So Angela grew up and treated and managed to turn her into a real life daughter rather than the son that she was born, and now has a job - waiting for it - a camp councilor! How right, right? I know, I loved it. However, the first sequel of the Sleepway Camp franchise follows the rules of horror sequels - more blood, more imaginary murders (unexpected, but more than original), more nudity, more elaborate story and more generally than real. <br /> <br /> It's not the same as the original way, that's the characters and wardrobe so goofy and so certainly not to help you get a good laugh out of the 80s. On one occasion, a man asks Angela, and she immediately goes quickly, saying "I'll call you". The guy tells herself, "How did she call me and call me? I do not have a phone!" <br /> <br /> It is a popular fact that 80s slasher films are more frequent than murderous teenagers, sniffs in their armpits, and their murderer is not usually punished, but generally very narrow. I first went to horror movies, and for the first time in the 90s, I saw Friday 13th films, I did not realize it. I learned a film series a year or two later that year and I was surprised that it was a little bit of madness. <br /> <br /> In the film, the movies are not going to have some kind of message. She once told her that she was a lesson for the Angela victims: "It's a lesson for you to tell me that it's a lesson for you, a nice subtle screen writing, guys again, dialogue is a lot more entertaining thing in the film." By that time, that treatment and those activities and cleaning his past and a regular And the well-developed person went through all the activities that reinvent himself and then <br /> <br /> After that, one of the advisers, which is changed, has changed from the Angela, umm, Angela), on one occasion, "I do not want to be a bad witch to the west, but I know what happens when things are under control. <br /> <br /> Two years ago I had a camp in a sleeping camp with one of the stars in the film Hadaruga was 15 or 20 counselors have three children, and it has a set of rules, it's not what the movie). It has seen the imbalances of the film from what really love the camp life. <br /> <br /> There are some 10 or 11 year olds who have died in this movie, but okay, you are rarely running with 9-year-olds. I did not see that kind of thing much earlier. <br /> Surely a bad taste, for a slick 80s slasher movie ....
