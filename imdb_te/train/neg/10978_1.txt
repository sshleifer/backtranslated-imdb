Normally when a movie receives a vote, because it is hated and frustrated, it is not cheap and hence decides to drag them instead of lower rating. <br /> Here is the best example of the Bonesetter 0/10 movie. This is nothing and it is not possible because it really is trying to do anything. There are a nasty D & D novel type strings, which are not unanimous and full of any kind of action. It is obvious that no one participating in this scheme has given any serious work because the hard work of completely different people is very high. Really awful movie.
