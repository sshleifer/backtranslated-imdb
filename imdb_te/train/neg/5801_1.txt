Ivan (Valerie Nikolayev) is a bad, stupid journalist who investigates the unexplained. <br /> <br /> In his car stores and he gets refuge in a small building and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly she becomes a monster and he kills her, and the town that killed this woman is surprised ... I guess the witch but I'm not fully aware. <br /> Ivan is now running by his soul or something, and he must have faith or something to hit it. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian images. They are usually filled with lute actors, stupid storytelling and lesser influences. Not to mention that this is not just a Christian film ... but an alien as well. Voice-over actor for Ivan was very scared because this was too pitch and winnie. You will not miss a lot for missing this movie.
