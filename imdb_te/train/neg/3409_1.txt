When NASA technical advisors asked the film to be credible for the film, it was rumored that they had been laughed for several hours. After all, if you're a politician or work / shuttle shuttle, you're not going to be in the shuttle. <br /> <br /> The truth is that everyone on earth will win lottery prizes for multi-billion dollar. <br /> <br /> The film is intended for children and they do not know many restrictions and requirements regarding access to KSC / CCAFS because one is written as written. <br /> <br /> It's time for a very useless film, and it's a well-deserved flop.
