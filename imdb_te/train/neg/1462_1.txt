This is the worst picture I've ever seen. Despite Mikshelt's claims, the film is not historically accurate. It starts badly and it's all downhill from there. Hitler's father blamed his own misfortune on the "fact" that he married his niece! They are actually second cousins. Hitler's mother, Clara, called her father, Alois, "uncle" because he was raised and raised by Alois Clara's grandfather as his son when he was his nephew. Aloe was older than Clara and read her in the habit of being called ana√Øs, "uncle." <br /> <br /> Hitler saw his fellow soldiers scratching the trench and removing it on his dog was just insulting and insulting to all intellectual intellectuals. We see Hitler chasing the dog through the trench, and when he was caught by the poor, he rejected him for disobedience. In the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers punishing and listening to the cowardly little man, but then his Sherlock lands directly on his persecutors, and each one, we are told, is completely killed. If Hitler is the only person who can cope with this scene, is this story of cruelty and cowardice being said? Has Hitler gone around "pride"? <br /> <br /> In the following years, Hitler was threatened with a threat and threatened, and a Jewish officer who had fought for the Eurez Cross! I think this Jewish officer is a Bond broker before fighting for the Fatherland, and I think he has brought some fundraises from his shop because I'm not sure that iron crosses were shown as shown in this comic scene. <br /> <br /> There are all the strange cliches here, Wagner music on the little man is least comic and hypnotic effect. Only if the producers put Ian Kershaw together. <br /> <br /> Franz Lehar's "Merry Widow" found that they were floating the Fisher's boat over "flying Dutchman" from Richard Wagner's artillery. <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know what to do,
