The idea of ​​the film is to make it look attractive to the brightness of the original movie story Charlotte Brontë. In this movie, I did not recognize the features that made the original novel very powerful in the film, as seen or portrayed. Behind the main characters back and forth, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester were left missing from the screenplay or cutting room floor. Even Jane Eyre's glamorous sense is not self-conscious, helping her to succeed in her confusion and everything. The original Jane Eyre is a hero. The woman in the film failed to win along with one of the great episodes of the story when she ran away from Jane Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Food, shelter, her insult, hunting for bread, the risk of dying in the cold, the emergence of a person from her beloved, in my opinion, the sharp parts of the story survived. The title character is dry and enthusiastic. For those who are unappealing to the story and reading the book, I can not imagine that this story is at least bit interesting. If there is any credit to the classic story, screenplay and direction did not lower.
