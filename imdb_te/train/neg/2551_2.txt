Misleading by the terrible lie on the cover, "fun as American pie", my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV waiting for the comedy ... it's not sure. If you missed one of the most sensitive minds, such as Jacques, you probably do not laugh at a time. It's not a romantic movie, at least it's something, it's about sex ... <br /> What's this? An arbitrary plot deals with a person who wants to lose a virgin (zero in the original, I'm missing one) and a gang of his friends. The rest of the characters (ie the girls) did not come for reliable reasons. Dancers (very simple: "dwarves pleasant hi ho") acting is very small (many look like on TV) <br /> <br /> The horror movie. Amateur, badly generated, and not all fun. Children and teens want to see it with friends because of swearing and sexual jokes. Also, do not even consider renting this movie.
