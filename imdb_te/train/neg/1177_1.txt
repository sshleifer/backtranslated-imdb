This movie is full of worst! Avoid these waste of celluloid at all costs, which is random and irrelevant. I was proud of myself in plumbing on the depths of 70 plus films from Salo to Salon Kitty. I was amazed, but I needed a coherent story. But if you look at the horse's scene, this picture is for you. The lame piece is a lame wolf suit with functional Wang. By doing so, I'm sitting in trouble, it's terrible, and the soundtrack is badly dubbed. Please, the cover is interesting (how does the gorillas arms reach for a lady's bare donkey) but you should not waste your time or money without getting back.
