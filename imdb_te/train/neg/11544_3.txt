I'm really looking forward to watching this, I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. Initially interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. It will soon jump to the mainstream, they attack the strangers' group and Deer Anderson was badly beaten when he was raped. Then they decide to take some revenge. Good, right? Well, that's not it. The story is boring and track on the side, and some things really get unnatural. I do not give any details, but I do not have the desire to see, for one. I would like to give all the images the purpose of doubt, and I really like it. It just did not work. I mainly give 10 to 3 for acting.
