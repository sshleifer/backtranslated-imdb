<br /> <br /> I have chosen it at local Wal-Mart after reading online in the beginning. I have been following this online for a while, and just got to buy the movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... I guess, or lack of evidence that has proved to me. Time and again, the characters (usually the narrator and the person he is) shown walking ... and walking ... and walking. I'm not the editor, but I know you can cut me among those who left someone to show up at point B. No need to show the whole journey! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for those involved in this role. <br /> Wow ... <br> That's why it's decided to do almost all the effects using CG. Even ILM still sometimes employs small pieces. One of the most eye-catching green screen screens in the film is a group of people (including credits at the end) that constitute the citizens of different towns and cities, including London. Sometimes these folk go and come without regard to distance or angle from the camera. In a shuttle in London, the narrator's brother (who played star Anthony Pey√±a without his disturbing whiskers) is seen on two feet six feet high. <br /> <br /> Talking about the film, Timothy Hines has done more of his work. It is a turkey, simple and simple. Plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most true laugh-out-loud bits of pleasure I've seen quite a while.
