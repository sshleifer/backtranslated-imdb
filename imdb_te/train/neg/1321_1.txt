Richard Dreyfus is not a star here. He has three 20 second comos and how is Jean Barry doing this movie? No idea, director probably his brother! This film does not make any sense. The fictitious author / director (same) was killing everybody with his horror uh ... work. DVD for the penny so I can not complain! But this is unreal! And it's not that you are bored and in a good way. It was 70 years old and the director seemed to be in an evil Amla tour and wanted everyone to feel inside his head. It has some interesting and controversial feeling, but it quickly plays a foul role as a drawn-up record. It is a failure to "Manson Family on Acid". <br /> I do not know how other critics have done this film. Perhaps they are not ready to lose 80+ minutes of your life anyway, however. Yes, it's awful!
