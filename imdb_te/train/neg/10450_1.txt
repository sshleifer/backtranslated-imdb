The movie is the worst picture I've ever seen since "Date Movie". I'm laughing at the whole movie instead of frightening. It is funny how snakes are searching for the special section of the passenger body that attacks the eye, tongue, butt, for breast, for example. If we see the National Geographic Channel, we do not know how the snakes wash on the body. In each particular scene, the snakes bite passengers and stay on the body that injures the person. I believe that the producer did not study the snakes and their behavior. I believe I will waste my money in this movie. So I do not recommend this film trust to wait or rent until it's in the dollar theater.
