Recently saw the film at the Dubai Film Festival because it was selected for the Cannes Film Festival's prestigious competition. <br /> <br /> This film, some critics, did not fire as much as observed - but the inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy / competitor in front of your young son .. or someone forced to eat a ceramic spoon to prove loyalty. In this Chinese / Hong Kong movie there are some different karlone sons of Kopala's "Godfather", but the two are different from chalk and cheese. <br /> Image violence is recommended for ginkies. There is no great movie here. It is better considered to be better than normal run run shaw production for production values.
