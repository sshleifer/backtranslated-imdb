I'm attracted to see this movie through starpower, but in the end it's been offered. It plays like a Greek tragedy over the big city corruption of a modern thriller. It's a great flaw in its assessment and complete absence of suspense. We know that the bad guys are in the beginning, they will come like chains and come. Its credit film is disturbed from disturbing violence and sex, but in any other way a good, clean romance or excitement has been forgotten as an alternative. Good, Flat Decofined Diet Cola all tastes. "Q & A" in New York, "LA Confidential", is a very good alternative.
