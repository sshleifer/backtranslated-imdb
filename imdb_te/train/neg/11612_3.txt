Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after her self-titled debut, this time it's a movie for Emma. In the diving tour, the body of a blonde beauty on the sea floor of Rome finds her feet and cement in the way you expect. Rome was in this case immediately after the man was appointed by Waldo Grosseki. Rome has revealed that he is the main suspect, investigating some mafia types, and he now wants to go on the run and fix the case alone. Portali Sinatra tries hard to sell us lame jack and we believe he is not being sexually attractive to a good detective, oh and foxy reckless welch, but this ham tries to miserably fail in the vanity project. The apparently ridiculous defeat of every male is astonishing, with a narrow head of the woman in front of each woman in the film, Douglass, of course, Director of Douglas, their zodiacal guts every time zooming and their posterior muscles grow. There are also ridiculously campy gay characters that believe beggars, which is "a true men", a film made by "true men" to reassure their own flag sexuality, which is a shameless evil.
