* Spoilers and intense mobility movements <br /> <br /> When this program first opened, I found it to be acceptable and fun. Most Ad Patents are a cartoon type of children and adults. It has high ratings along with Spongebob. <br /> <br /> Butch Hartmann and his team began running downstairs due to the worst decline. <br /> <br /> First, the toilet comedy is not everything funny. You can easily smile from a little boy with a little kids, but there are only a good audience to laugh at that cliche joke. There are next kiddie jokes. People can see in their lingerie and people can see cross dressing. LOLOLOL !!! I can not stop laughing in such a homosexuality! Please help someone! However, this presentation is not a form of generalization but it is not evil. How did the team portray Australians? They do not see Kangaroo-beloved, boomerang-throwing lines that live in the hot desert. But now ... This show really has the loud noise of all that's why it's the kind of curse of this ... the jokes used to be over! The show is like a great thing constantly dragging the same jokes (many of them being unfair)! Cosmo is highly accusing. I hated how they kept mentioning the "super toilet" (which also includes a mixture of the same Kurdish humor in the same) and Cosmo outlining. And can not forget that dumb battery Ram Joke that is used in every e-mail episode in every goddamn parent in Dimmsdale? Did you know that each parent (who cares about other parents) delivers the perfect punishment before being broken into their child's room? <br /> May be the first class humor to others, but it is pure for others. <br /> <br /> If I did not make a mistake, I believe that Butch Hartman ended the show. Thanks to God! Everybody around my area says it's like, Nickelodeon's funniest appearance. Can not I agree with it? I think horse dung is another pile as I get worse in our cartoon stations every day.
