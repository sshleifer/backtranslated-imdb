This film is very hard to appreciate. CGI for the dragon is well done, but the light and shadow is not the perfect modeling. Also, the same footage is used by continuous dragon stamping through the corridors. <br /> <br /> I am amazed to see "Marcus Aurelius" in the credits I like to see what the Roman Emperor did. Empire is doing this movie! It should be an alias like "Wooply Goldberg", and he can be blamed for using one if he appears in this stinker. <br /> <br /> This story may be interesting, but the acting becomes flat and the direction is tedious. If you watch this film, go to your friend's house and drink - then enjoy.
