SPLIT SECOND may be a good movie. A story about a "road rage" homicide, a very young Clive Owen gave a pretty good performance; <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the filmmakers did their own film with a careless camera work and really awful compilation. The camera will jump on all creation unsuccessful effort (I suppose) to reflect the oven pressure from business, family and traffic. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers do not care about making a good film, but it is not only to impress each other with idiot photography, and do not waste time on this trend. .
