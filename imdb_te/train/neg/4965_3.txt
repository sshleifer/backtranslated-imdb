For such a great classic story, setting (position), Grendel was disappointing. As a writer and dramatic tension, I have blamed the script. Rubik's club story is useful and newly taken on literary classics. Initially, the writer dropped due to some unnatural reasons. I know it's shot in 21 days, and I'm "suddenly" and unfortunately. Now you have to wait for the Hollywood version of the big screen. The word in FX, I can really withstand crappy CGI but the script is rock and this one is very slow, spartan and drama-free. I will make an allegation against the actors but ... I know I write more than acting, so I choose my colleague.
