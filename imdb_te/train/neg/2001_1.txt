Why are there so many people at the San Francisco Film Festival where one evening of Roberto Morita's "Up Against Them All" ("Contra Todus") "It's about a hitman," my friend said. "Well, it's Brazilian," I added. Beautiful colorful people, tropical climate, forest rhythms, and hip gangster plot? <p> <p> <p> </ p> <p> <p> <p> How to make rounds of Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, many small local festivals, and now San Francisco? <br /> <br /> The first was the first prize in the Rio Film Festival to win the first prize called Best Brazilian Film. This should be a bad year; They have very, very good ones. Next, lead capture, museums plus the speculative buzz - close observation of the critics of the film and will not be displayed anywhere - it goes round. <br /> <br /> Festival Blurbs is a lot of ducks at the promotion at the moment. The Chicago Festival called "Contra Todos" "directly shot a speedball cocktail shot from Brazil" and Claudia's boyfriend referred to as "neighbors like slums". Soninha "Teen-aged daughter, such as Theodore's nymph, is related to the increasing sexuality." The film was "often portrayed by the handwriting camera's camera" and the director "works with indifference and indifference to the disturbance of the carnage." The effect was "persistent raw and honest," and the film "suddenly turned towards the end of the show's lives ended dead." <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" is actually Hitman, two hit men, and wife and daughter and a revived Christian friend. The camera-work behind the no talent, without a shot ugly digital video with more toasty - mostly a barren-looking poor suburb rather than a "phevelas" or village, in Brazil as in urban slums than one, "Black Orpheus", "piksot" and "God of God," in this time Sao Paulo is made in Rio. <br /> <br /> <br /> A person suffering from family problems is a thyodoro (Giulio loop) and partner Valodayiro (Atle Graz) with his medication problem. Unfortunately, some of the actors teyidoro blonde wife Claudia (Leona Cavalli) and Sylvia lorenko her as the female actress, plays the role of ready-rebel daughter soninha. Some of these actors are made from the corners behind Telenovelas. Who knows? - Improved direction may also be better in the film. Besides, some young men have been infiltrated by Tortoro or when he is busy, gangs of gangs. Although the camera is much better with their pores, it does not work too much. <br /> Some observers, one in the Berlin Festival, and one in London have seen the film's fault, buried in the web spines. Henry Sheehan is shown "Berlin" from Berlin (his quotations) as "the worst of video works". "చలన చిత్ర నిర్మాత అది చిత్రానికి చౌకగా ప్రత్యామ్నాయంగా ఉన్నందున వీడియోను ఎంపిక చేసుకున్నట్లు తెలుస్తోంది," అని షీహన్ వ్రాశాడు, మరియు "కొత్త మాధ్యమం యొక్క ఏదైనా సృజనాత్మక ఉపయోగం చేయలేదు" - లేదా, అతడు సృజనాత్మకంగా ఏదైనా చేస్తాడు. /> <br /> షీహన్ చిత్రం మొదటి పెద్ద తప్పు ఎత్తి చూపారు: ఇది "చర్య లోకి సగం ఒక గంట, Moreira, తండ్రి మరియు అతని స్నేహితులు ఒక ప్రొఫెషనల్ హిట్ అని వెల్లడిస్తాడు ఉన్నప్పుడు అప్ పట్టాభిషేకం కోరుకుంటున్నాము ఒక దేశీయ నాటకం ఆఫ్ మొదలవుతుంది పురుషులు ముప్పై నిమిషాల వేచి చిత్రం ఏమీ జతచేస్తుంది ఇది And at least, at a waste as a perfectly arbitrary decision but ratcheting up all the more టూల్ కిట్ సంపాదించిన ఎవరు చిన్న పిల్లవాడిని వంటి చేస్తుంది తన జన్మదినం కోసం, మరియు రింగ్, కారణం లేదా నైపుణ్యం లేకుండా ప్రతిదానిని చూసి చుట్టూకి వెళతాడు. " <br /> <br /> 2004 లండన్ పండుగ గురించి కామెరా డాట్కామ్ గురించి వ్రాస్తూ, మెటిన్ అల్సాన్జాక్ సానుకూల వైపు చూసేందుకు ప్రయత్నించారు, అయినప్పటికీ The best feature is the lack of ransom features called performances. Yes, very lightly, Mi Jump too bad. "Alzonjac admitted that this low budget, Sao Paulo's non-committal violent and unwanted accounts are the favorite characters and, as a result, has the hope that the human condition is not as helpful in the dark and stubborn poor subtitle." The first half hour, the first is the frustration of our expectation for the first acts of violence It is not broken - it connects Contra Todus with "Dogme" and Mike League to Anzankk, when they arrive, just "snuffing everything in sight without the ring, reason or skill" - Moriara tries to restore his sudden end, A frightening counter-clock scene Saralu be married. The director wanted to show high-level hit men in the working class neighbors to "abolish the evil", but he could not do the roles, he usually sees us and will survive. And the picture's structure will show that he can not even modify his subject. <br /> <br /> On April 28, 2005, at the San Francisco International Film Festival.
