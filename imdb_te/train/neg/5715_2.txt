'Yes Yes' One of those movies you're expecting is going to be good, but it will never do. It's kind of inspired by an innocent couple 'crapfest of psychological torture of inspiration, directly loved by video filmmakers video. <br /> <br /> These conversations are clunky and poorly translated in many places. The acting is uniformly poor, especially from the villain of the character Jong-hu Park. He is trying to talk in the shiny and deep voice, he seems to be really intimidating, as he seems to be scared of his character, he makes it seem a bit ordinary. <br /> <br /> The plot deserves special mention, it is foolish for all beliefs. It is not surprising that 'heroes' threaten their hitchhiker to kill them. The 'heroine' does not stay away from his toes when he sees two villains. The villain passes on a police drive (when wearing a shrouded veil of blood, and a bloody head shaft) shows the cops burning corps in the passenger seat he drives. The villain Punch, a sharp edged and stuck by with a pitchfork, but this, rather serious, never seems to be inseparable to the injuries. And I do not start with that terrible 'twist'. <br /> <br /> This is a plus point for the film, for me, sang mu chu. <br /> <br /> Overall, 'The Hittor' and 'Spurlos', such as a poorly written, obscene acting and intimidating directorial venture, but failing at every turn because of the lack of talent.
