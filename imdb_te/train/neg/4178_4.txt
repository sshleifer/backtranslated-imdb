The man went to the earth and now he is traveling to new worlds. But the new worlds of old worlds come to ... place vampires. And not just a minimalist but whole tribe. <br /> <br /> In this film (I've seen it as "Blood Scorsers", but "Vampires Wars"), let's see what happens when imperialist earthquakes meet imperialist vampires. <br /> This review is undiserving of a good review because I will make it much smaller. The best thing I can say for this movie is a good cast of B-list and upcoming stars. Natasia is more attractive than Malke Quintana, and "Bloodren 2". Michael Ironside Mucho, and is always a fan of fans (as he says, Jack Nicholson of the poor). And horror fans from the name of Dario Argentino's "Genefer" also get Kari-N-Fleming as the "Damian wife", now known as the named genie. So this movie, it's bad, some names have not been added ... but it's about Uwe Boll's work. <br /> <br /> Military tracking and killing vampires in space is not necessarily a bad idea, but it easily gets into the realm of "cheese" and this film gets hard. Acting, especially from vampires, is at the top and I can not find the explanations of their existence quite plausible. Most of all, vampires have "Voorres" and "Leatherface" names. I thought it was a brilliant reference to horror fans, but it was not brilliant. <br /> <br /> It is merely dumb and spotlight (except for many minor references in James Gunn's "Silthrai", which is the name after the less known horror directors). You'd like to see Vampires fight in cheese (today I'm from Wisconsin) and poorly dressed actresses in space (although "space" looks like any other forest on earth) if you can find it. I do not recommend this personally if you can see other cheesy Vampires movies ("Jon Vampires" of "The Vampires") or other cheesy space movies. Or even some good ones. But, hey, do your work.
