I chose to see this movie because I got a good score in IMDb. But many people really have a poor taste or someone scores the score. <br /> It's a real disappointment. The image is correctly stupid and has received as much as the title suggests. There is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but it goes here: I thought someone was thinking: "Is it cool to make a movie with snakes on a plane? Let's go crazy and get stuff started!" And about it! The plot is thin and unnatural. Snakes are bad CGI (but no one in their right mind would recommend anyone to cut corners in a movie!). Performance is poor, and all people are unreliable stereo varieties. <br /> This is a compilation: One of the worst films I've ever seen - stay away!
