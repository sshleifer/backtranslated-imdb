"Fungicide" is probably the most ineffective, awkward, pitiful "film" I've ever seen. This act is criminal and not practical, and involves separating a monkey by learning learning problems in a laptop computer with special effects. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br The producers of "Cinema" Yes, "the movie" low (nothing) will damage the budget, but in that case they will just say that they should not be really sad. <br /> <br /> However, they have done the most terrible of the world, so it is possible and only pleasure from it. <br /> "Movie" "Citizen Kane" or whatever. I looked forward to a little bit of low budget, perhaps inventiveness, a hint of fun and some power. <br /> I've used a napkin cinematic compound. <br /> Plots? Well, a dysfunctional antihyperian scientist who works in his parents' dungeon, mentally looks at a niche in a cup of confusing. Apparently, such high level science is the ultimate result of research for years. His parents then send him to a strange hotel-type area in the countryside to relax. There are some other people who are just so horrible to write about. However, the scientist puts his worm in the mushrooms - and immediately kill some mushrooms. (Wow, I'm writing a plot summary for suicide). Our heroes bury the vinegar barrel ("fuse" - really throws a piece of the string - to it). The barrel accidentally explodes with a small nuclear weapon, destroying all the mushrooms. End. <br /> The essence is as good as the "film" gets (in fact it is very interesting). This is not really at the stage of development (which means that I have the plot boundary on the back of an envelope with the crayons). Someone really met and someone gave a serious shake and said "no." <br /> That "special" effects. Well, they're all right "special". This is crazy go crazy. And I believe the bicycle Pump is the pinnacle of modern technology that will be done by a person I dreamed of. <br /> <br /> When the mushroom demons were not in the home computer graphics package of 1984, the actors covered in the sheet (I'm not a child) <br /> <br /> The film is lazy in the most troublesome ones. The hero revolves around his pistols (La Quint Eastwood) and explains the scene that fails to get them in his pockets. <br /> <br /> "Motion picture" manufacturers should hang their heads in disgrace And should not be prohibited within fifty meters of any film making machine. <br /> <br /> Images and family members give stupidly high customer ratings that give IMDb and incomplete reviews and give a completely inaccurate picture of "film". Chitra's an absolute mockery of the production. Mr Wascavage very, very stupid, or too much, it is very cynical.
