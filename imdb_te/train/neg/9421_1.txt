If you liked watching Mel Gibson in the Million Dollar Hotel then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in another film that is bad to be delivered forever. I can attest to the DVD version, so maybe the VHS version is of good quality, but the movies have night and dark scenes, all of which are red. My DVD player was in trouble. It's not. If you persist in watching, I recommend that you adjust the color to your TV black and white. You will never get through the movie if you do not. If you do, you can recall a poor filmmaker to restore the style of poor fiction.
