This film is not great, but certainly not bad, I'm not sure what I expected. In my opinion PG13 movies are not scary enough so I already know that I'm going to be frustrated across the whole movie. There are scary things happening in the hotel room, but we can not see it already. I guess I do not like it because I thought it would be too many turns and happening; It got old and repetitive. I do not understand whether all things Cassack experience in the room is true. There is no explanation for the events that occurred. The film just drops and you want to continue when it finally comes to end, because you're still waiting to say something about the whole movie. I liked the special effects. There is not much pleasure from it. Perhaps this was me but I thought it was below average.
