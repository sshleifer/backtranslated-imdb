When I was born in the 1960s, I saw TV "Movies of the Week" at the beginning of the 70s and "Crowwave Farm", "Bad Ronald", "Satan School for Girls", "CollHak the Night Stalker", but it's just plain mute . It was a writer's attempt to invest in horrific mums killings a few years ago. The film "McCloud" and "Duel" fame Dennis Weaver takes his family camp as a father. The family faces hippies for some reason to intimidate the family. The reason for this is not explained, and Weaver's pure attitude is difficult to swallow. For God, call the police, beat them hell or something, just sit there and do not whine about it. Acting is pretty dull, story is unbelievable, etc. Susan de Becky looks beautiful, but about it. If this is ever aired on TV, discard it.
