I said this a lot - this director is all about RAW pictures ... we are not ready to confront things too much on the head. I am surprised when sex, suicides, murders and people are constantly bombarding "relieving themselves", trying to communicate the concept of relief or release. I tell you that the director has a good eye. There are some really nice shots and "movie moments" in the film (fans, their fish in the wire), but the story leaves me asking for more (obviously we leave asking ourselves "What the heck we do <br /> <br /> : If you have a tendency to gag or vomiting ... you can not see this movie.
