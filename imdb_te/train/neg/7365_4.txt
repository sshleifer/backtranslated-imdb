Not bad but also a great heist movie. Kirk Douglas is recently released from a safe-cracker from prison, who decides to remove his job after rejecting a proposal from the mob. He appointed Circus Gymnast Giulioño Gemma. Mayhem is great. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves muffin goon Romano Pippo, as well as Douglas's Patient Patient Girlfriend (Florenda Bolcán) really in the Goofy love triangle. The director Michele Lepo Pace keeps moving quickly and is at least an amazing and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Despite being an Italian production, much filming took place in Germany. Douglas is not just dirty in gossip, it's good. Wonderful Bolcagon gives a spectacular performance. Music Ennio Morricone and Cinematography was done by great Tonino Deli Colli, who was able to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
