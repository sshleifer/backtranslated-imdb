Martin Amis is a great fan of the book, based on the book. Unfortunately the director could not translate the book to the screen. The novel completely breaks the modern and most artificial art into its elaborate roles and the traditional storyline and character development. It is the most ethically human greed of contemporary British writers, a joyful test of overly and emptiness. The director of the film completely lost the place of the novel. In his hand, the film screams along with the breakneck speed, each known trick shot and the 'odd' camera angle is involved. It was like Ken Russell on acid, and cranked from the old director's self-satisfaction to a hundred. The short (glimpse) glimpse of the beautiful actor Christian Solimeno's penis did not help me save this wretch image. Endless!
