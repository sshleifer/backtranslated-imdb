It's a low picture. No original plot. Nobody can ever see us as we are inspired. These films are some of the worst actors ever to keep in the film. The threat is supernatural, but these three are controlled by elderly people. Why are they doing the work? To fear other members of the group? I do not know. There were some fogs from a fog machine and everyone was scared. Should it do something? I do not know. There is some nudity for it. I was always surprised by these films in these old films. Things are actually settled these days. However, people walk with the ax and are ready for the ax. They do not plan; No resources; Nothing. There are five silly climax in the film. Who are these people and "there" is a ghost or demon. What's wrong with others? I challenge anyone to say anything to me. What a mess.
