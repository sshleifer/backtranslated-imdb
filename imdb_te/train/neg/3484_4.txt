I remember when I was in the theaters, the reviews said it was terrible. I did not think it was bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a rich man who finds his girlfriend a family for Christmas. He goes to visit the grown house and touches a contract to rent the family there for Christmas. I really liked the scene of the lawyer who signed a deal. <br /> <br /> So he makes family crazy requests and writes scripts to read them. However, those who are interested in the love of the family have a hot daughter. <br /> Moreover, the whole do-daah law is funny, especially when they are in the first place with a black man, and the parents of friends can not say anything about it. And du-dah hitting on his "imagined daughter". Final Verdict: I thought it was worth checking if I caught the cable.
