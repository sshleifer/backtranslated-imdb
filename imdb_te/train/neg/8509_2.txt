I saw this movie for the main reasons Mira Sorvino. She is not so bad with the cast. It was some secret and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend and that he was pretty good in 'unfaithful' and it also appeared. <br /> <br /> This story is set in Spain, which is an exotic entertainer in my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking about the same thing, let me warn you: This is really a horror, uninteresting boring image. <br /> <br /> The story converges with sub-stories. They try to build a terrible / thriller looking fascism in Spain, but terrible. The number of turns has no credibility and so-called research can lead to somewhere. <br /> The letters are thin paper! I do not care about anyone. They are embarrassing and pretty hateful. <br /> Acting is very worse. What's wrong with you Why Mira? You are an Oscar winner! Keep some respect! Her role is weak but it is not necessary for such a terrible performance. She is sleeping all the film. Think about it, I actually saw her eyes slowly shut down some scenes. I thought this woman was sexy. Well she's not here. If you want to see some skin Romy and Michelle because there is nothing to see here. And that voice? <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is even worse. It is very painful to remember his performance to explain here. Sorry, but I can not. I suffered enough with this trash. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is discouraging! It's also very bad in every way a surprise to how it's done. A lousy team produces a lousy script and earn some money on the actor's name. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
