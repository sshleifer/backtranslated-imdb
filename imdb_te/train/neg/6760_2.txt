Famous writer Mark Redfield (like Egger Allen Po) tries to conquer old addictions and tries to start a new life as a publisher of Baltimore, Maryland Magazine. However, blackout threatens his attempts, threatens to decline and rejection. He wants to regain an old girlfriend and romantic love. This type of drama was directed by Mr. Redfield in Edgar Allen Poe's mysterious last days. Redfield is very useful for creating an emboss of black and white, color and trick photography. Kevin G. Shinick (like Dr. John Moran) is relatively speaking. This is not enough.
