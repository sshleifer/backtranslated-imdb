Wow! This film is really awful. I've read this badly written script and I can not imagine that it's given a green light. The cast is virtually the only cast of all really horrific performances from all cast. The story is confused, broken and irrelevant. Telling, lead and predictable. No wit, no charm, no humor. Not least sexy. The letters are flat as the proverb pancake. The film was very difficult as the film was running and the stomach became very difficult. When your main (carrel) is unmanageable and incomplete it is elevated from there. It is fraudulent, to turn back the love with a sick feeling in my stomach. If this goes for humor and social comment then we're definitely sad.
