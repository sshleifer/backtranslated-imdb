The naked female angelic gang in heaven (a large plastic fang) gang took a resident in a horrific forest where they wandered any vicious spirits. This was not a long time before a group of friends on a road trip became a victim of blood infants. An independent low budget horror in the UK, Damned's Forest takes on an interesting campus, and it has long been the worst performance I've ever seen, putting some of the effects and direction on the pan down. <br /> Do you have some occasional skill behind the director Johannes Roberts camera? The scenes in the dirty home are long and there are some shoddy 'shock' moments - but most of the film is technically irrelevant. <br /> <br /> The horror signs Tom will throw some really horror shows from Tom Savin and Shawn Hutson, and you have a real bad picture in your hands. <br /> <br /> Some variations originate from the pure shoddiness of the film, the male nudity to laugh at the boys, but most will find a fate sitting by it.
