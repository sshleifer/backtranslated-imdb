Anyone studying any physics or cognitive science is bored 40 minutes later, my wife and I did. Entertainment can be entertained by unknown people using hands-free arguments and "resolutions" (without even attempting logical reasons) from real science. I'm disturbed by the absurdity provided under the mask of "science". <br /> <br /> The authors have chosen a Quantum Physics book, which does not understand a word, then watched The Matrix a thousand times and came forward to write the film. <br /> <br /> For example, the Washington DC crime experiment was made by The Transpendental Meditation Program. A brief search reveals the knowledge of their methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
