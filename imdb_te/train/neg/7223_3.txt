My first attempt to watch this ended in eight minutes, almost after the TV report scene that I can not broadcast. <br /> Reporter 1: Alas, there is a pyramid in our skies. Reporter 2: I think foreigners. * Embarrassing silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... <br /> <br /> After a few days I finally saw that. About half of the plot can easily be ignored. And the other half should be extended to explain the background story or something. <br /> <br /> What is the use of the detective, eugenics people and monsters in a short time by Horus? More fun monopoly scene. "We're all powerful" Gods "who have lived for Ains, and we have been playing monopolies from all over the world." Monopoly? Monopoly? <br /> <br /> Compared to Eric van Tynekene, reasonability appears. <br /> <br /> The remaining half is terrible. What did our protagonist do to make himself free from scratch? Is there any big event when he finally gets released? Remember, he had those pesky followers? What happened to normal human beings? What is the deal with the masked person? How did the blue-haired girl look? What is her eyesight? <br /> <br /> If you look at the Egyptian goddesses with radwaller heads, you will be more or less.
