<br /> <br /> When I saw the version of Kent Branagh, I immediately had to study this painted version of Hamlet and it was really frustrating. <Version> This version takes many different aspects of the play, including sexuality, in a different manner; A very gay osquik and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I was at this time (60's) considered Hamlet's most complete version but did not compare to the full version of Branagh. <br /> Just a note ... video in my local video store) Australia and I have really been looking for a Kind Branagh DVD. Please tell me if someone knows.
