My mother Denis L. He has worked eleven years with the rider, not sharing an office with him. When he announced BTK, she was amazed. The whole day is her only telling stories of how she should never be seen as a Witch Killer. I listened to them several times. I questioned her about a lot of things, and asked her to go to all the interviews. I have read a book about the rider, I was surprised that Wichita would be my hometown and in Kansas. Another BTK movie on TV was not long ago, and I thought it would be better to paint the murders of Dennis, but his intentions may have some intellectual touch. <br /> <br /> I am very stupid with errors in this film. <br /> <br /> It was his mother's role, my readings on him, and based on the video tapes I saw while he spoke. <br /> <br /> First, the camera angles are terrible. It seems to have been shot in a home video camera. <br /> <br /> Dennis Rider has not had long hair. Dennis Ryder is a "very anal guy" and the guy who "follows the book of the book". The film is not as good as he saw him, he is very polite and sudden, like a business. As far as we know, this is also his murder. <br /> If you see his confession in court, you already expect it. <br /> <br /> And for the siege with Slaughterhouse? No. I never read or admitted that Dennis Ryder had a problem of animal cruelty or people looting the sound. In fact, he studied chicks and dogs for choking techniques. <br /> <br /> Dennis Rider did not kill the people he knew, he said, but he also revealed to her in his first killing. <br /> <br /> In this movie I also want to go, and I'm already there. If you are interested in BTK's true events you will not know what to watch. You do not want to see if you want a good horror movie. If you want half-pornography burned with just a few killing scenes, this is your kind of image.
