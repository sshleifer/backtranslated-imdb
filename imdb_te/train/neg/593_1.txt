This is probably the worst movie ever seen. Worst than the most unpleasant American swamp; Glitter in American drums par excellence - worse than Mariah Carey. I can imagine that the writer and producer are taking a huge amount of recreational drugs, and thought it was a good idea when discussing the plot. That's not. It is the wicked garbage from Satan's very intestines (he may have written a good script he might put his mind on it). Robert Jones Exce producer, our taxpayer money (lottery money folks) must be answered, on this piece of nonsense. Did you think that it was a good idea to re-create the earth ??? I will ask you - Christmas Tree, Deathline ... 'Do the doors' The classic of the really bad British film, we really do not need a reminder. And we certainly do not need a poor, second rate, badly written, badly developed and badly the worst piece like this. All of these brought potato men's sexual lives from the UK funding agency ... and I rest my case. <br /> <br /> Do not pay to see this stuff. It was perfect and completely rubbish - a savings grace for the producers they got a huge split of cash ... our cash ... to make it. They should hang their heads with shame. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am very tough on the low, Mgr makes me think it is worth supporting our national body for cinematic support. The British film industry did not have any hope when idiots were running this program. Where are you in Harvey Weinstein? Come back, please forgive us !!!
