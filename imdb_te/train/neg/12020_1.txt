It's such a waste of time. Danger: If you see this, you will be able to remove your DVD from the wall and try to dig the window. <br /> <br /> An enthusiastic product: Terrible, recurring, empty dialogue; Wooden displays of paper narrow plot; <br /> <br /> Strongly erroneous story, completely unreliable characters. Film and t.v. Two worst concepts in (1) the evil couple, (2) amazed. There are no twins. <br /> <br /> The plot "twist"? It's simpler and clear with passion - like watching a train coming in the middle of the day in the pastry. It also did not solve properly. <br /> Please, please, please - do not see this if its freedom and your only choice goes to a community hall.
