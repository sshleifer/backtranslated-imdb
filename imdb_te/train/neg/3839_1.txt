Some movies are good, they are good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on the true story, the film is about the possibility of the genuine boyfriend of Pinocchio. Performance is terrible, directing is poor, and it travels very fast. <br /> <br /> Melissa Jon Hart has always beat me as a talented actress, but every film she has done is pretty low - anyway budget. As she did in other films, she quickly made her words faster, accelerating her words, speeding up her words and speaking more dramatically. She really brings out the feeling that she had a crew in front of her and she was talking to a camera, when she should take part in the viewer in her role. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this film is that she finally hangs herself. <br /> <br /> If your taste in the picture is a blender than a piece of dry bread it should be seen.
