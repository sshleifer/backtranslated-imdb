This is a viewable Hollywood medium if there is good editing. It relies on the distinctive American thriller plot - "Who's going to beat everyone". Acting is low, but he is largely responsible if tension rises in the film, shining by the detective's best actor in the film. The film is completely blank and suffocated by sound shots and it looks very raw film material. Overall, if you do not see a movie that looks like a student movie project, it's a picture to see. I think it would be enough to say this film, everything else could really spoil the tension that was probably low enough.
