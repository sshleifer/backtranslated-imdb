Terrible picture. If you have a Turkish movie you can not see in 2006, that should be Banyo. What time is vain? The less laughable couple does not achieve this film, Nada, Silk, No. The dialogue is cheap and there are all the sexy clips. The director needs to see more movies before making his own directing. Red heroes show examples of not performing actresses. If you're interested in learning how to work, a perfect example of bad acting. The good thing I have to say about the movie, wait, wait, I'm not good about it. I really do not like writing much about it. Jeez!
