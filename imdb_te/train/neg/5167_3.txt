I rated this value only 3 skirts, if the actors are good, the twins are right, the twins are good, I believe it is bad, but the elder and the youngest brother, they know how to cry, really bad, they seem to read scripts without acting ... Spoiler: Why do they freeze blood for the vampire? The vampires do not drink frozen blood, but the sister said that she should drink when she was alive ... But when they went home, they were buried with frozen blood. <br /> <br /> This is a huge waste of time, and I have read all reviews of how great this film is, how many awards have won this film, *** at home ** t !!!!
