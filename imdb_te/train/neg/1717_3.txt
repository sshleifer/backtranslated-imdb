Here we have two faulty children who have a chance against the existence of a cruel and impoverished poverty: Robin Hoods are alone for torture because they are at times cruel. Ear! The worst thing about Bonnie Missouri's Westest thing is that he is taught as a psychopathic psychologist who is a fun love boy who thinks he does not hurt anyone ... He wants things to be done without much power. Poorly portrayed, poorly portrayed, unreliable conversation, weapons unrealistic use, gore that looks like a grape jelly than the real thing. Avoid this bleegator. Bad. -5 stars.
