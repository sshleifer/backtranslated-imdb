The Ballad of Django is a mess in the brain of an image! The spaghetti Western meets scenes collected from other people's (and better!) Movies with "Zanggo", who says he has brought in various bandits. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) did not bring anything to the role of Django. If you do not have just every Django movie and do not need a good enough to see this stuff, skip this too !!
