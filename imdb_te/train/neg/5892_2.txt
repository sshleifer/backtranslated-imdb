Rigu (Ring, 1998) and Hippo Muzu No Sokko Kara (Dark Water, 2002), which contains hints of Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but the worst gore (green corpse with red eyes!) Weak story, and a weak theme (I find it very difficult to find a picture message scary). Two moments in this film made me unexpected hand, and worrying all the hours that I was ending watching (after another Mike Takashi Wan, from 1999), all of these pictures were really scary, and I can not see this movie sell to Western populace of big Japanese horror movies. Ten out of ten.
