A constructive hand-camera camera was used, perhaps the film to give a documentary look, but the effect was so disturbing that I started watching the film. Anyone with a cerebral palsy (camera is not a crime for the victims, but I do not think it's a cinematographer to work!) Camera work is very frustrating, so disorganized wife and I feel it is unrecognizable and left it after 10 minutes of torture. After a while I checked back (it was shown on TV), and this is not good. We suggest giving this one miss unless you have to eat unless you get rid of any bad sushi!
