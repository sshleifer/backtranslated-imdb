I've never seen Tarzan in the movie, I saw on television, and I wanted to give it a shot. Unfortunately I have to say I'm disappointed. Tarzan is 40 years old and slightly overweight. I can not imagine seeing Tarzan. For me, if I missed a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave his traditional Warbling rat. <br /> <br /> Tarzan has not swinging through the trees - leaping from wine to wine. <br /> Oh well, a lot for estimates. Anyway, Jane is there - the monkey is a cheetah. There are some people with guitar. There are villains and good guys and a romance ... all too dangerous and predictable. <br /> <br /> It is not the best film to introduce Tarzan: 4/10
