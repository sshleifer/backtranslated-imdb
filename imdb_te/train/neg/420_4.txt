For those who want to watch this movie? I say: go! It can be a good movie / documentary without a narrative. But music, narrative and some heroic lines are very difficult to see skeptics like me. Following many animals, in many seasons, their life is enjoyed by the feeling that we are an animal soap we are looking for. But the dramatic perspective does not cut it, and the predator finally goes to the camera zooms or another scene with an animal (an exclusion is left there). I'm asking why that happened, if they show reality, why are there dramatic scenes? I think it's moral for the mass of the audience, that makes it all come true: it is waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
