Full House is always one of the worst TV series ever! Why? Because all the characters are so irritating that it is impossible to afford. The best character Joey one is also the occasionally pretty irritating. Girl DJ, who wrote her character? Every time she speaks she wants to kill my self. <br /> <br /> Example: DJ won ten dollars or more at the casino. However, she is not eighteen, so she can not gamble according to the law. She is ready to pay the money but then Danny, her father is her coat and she is not eighteen because she does not let her raise money.Oh, give me a break, will yes be? The scene I immediately stopped watching television after I was stupid and childish. They say that some children can not buy in this order. Anyone in the world can think that the whole house is fun and funny? To know something about the Shakespeare Shakespeare in each series they say, the kid and stupid write something stupid as they are written in the script for the full house except that he does not come! <br /> <br /> For those who have a bad heart or bad medical condition or feel for everyone or the real world, I try the 'Do not Look at the Full House' episode. Avoid this series. Let yourself be yourself from the stupidity and nonsense. It's the worst televised show! I'll see this after teabibs.'It'll see '.
