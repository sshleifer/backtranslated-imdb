I do not have many reasons to come up with this movie. Sylvester Stallone is once again the author and fighter of Japan's John A. Rambo, his only friend, Major Richard Crena, secretly taken photos of American prisoners who are still going back to Vietnam and are still being imprisoned. If he does not really do anything more than sneak, take the pics, and sneak up? Who came to see the film? <br /> This is essentially a musical celebration of Stallone. Preparing for his mission, we see his well-oiled muscles bulging. (They are bloated by oil and all.) There is a traditional strap on black leather, ugly guns, and even uglier knives. Black guns are cleaned, loud clocks are clogged, and the stomach's muscles are almost oiled. The bow is tested and yes, there is enough pound to drive a bolt through the forehead of the enemy. <br /> Stalel and his battles betray lawsuits from one or two of Washington, stubborn politicians, you can wager, grammar school. What guts do you know? <br /> <br /> This film is nowhere for people, but it is a matter of great respect. This deliberately occurs in a fictional story intended to calculate the number of MIAs kept silent in displaced camps in the mid-1980s. Bumper stickers were all over. (Our MIA free.) Why would they keep them? This is not a reason for slaves to become slave labor - a country that has no resources other than labor. Or as a means of humiliating the United States for their propaganda value - a propaganda weapon that has kept the Vietnam world secret. <br /> <br /> As a hostage, Rambo gets treatment in medieval fashion in North Korea. Vietnamese. His muscles are still displayed by his wrist after dipping his neck in the pig dispersion. Then, the content with the insulting Vietnamese, a Russian officer brought to play as part of the Gestapo officer - "V Half Ways of Making You Remember." <br /> <br /> Rambo returned, declaring that "this country will love us as long as we love it". Vats who returned from Vietnam emerged in the same way and were subjected to accusation, so the Congress could elect a number of elections and appoint others to the highest level. The last three lost presidential candidates are in the hated group. <br /> <br /> Rambo is ridiculous though action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others are broken by brilliant tiles. It has not been able to kill, speak, talk, talk, talk, and talk without boasting. Speak of a sign of weakness
