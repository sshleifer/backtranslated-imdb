I have read some books about Bonnie and Clyde, and it is definitely more accurate than Beatty / Deuter Reform, its clothes and locales echo the gang's original photographs. Particularly the death of Buick Barrow, and his wife Blanche's abstraction. This actress will see the photographs taken on the day that Blanchee is mourning her dying husband. However, this film is still pretty hard at the end, after Hollywood, and our anti-heroes are full of holes (in life, Bonnie is a perky cheerleader at the time of her death when she is severely damaged by a car accident, and does not appear to appear to be a popular accident). The script is tedious, and poor acting, especially Leeds. Very frustrating. Stick with Beatty and Dunva. Theirs are not "the true story", but it's a great movie.
