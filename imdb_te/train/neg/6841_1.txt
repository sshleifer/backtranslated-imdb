I'm listening to rumors about the upcoming "Leonard Nimei Blu-ray Disc". It is interesting to see if the franchise can be restarted with the development of the last 25 years from fixed-cam to CGI. <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy Beatamax performs the VCR" is a fantastic milestone in the history of entertainment. Temporary "Leonard Nimoy performs a compact cassette" and clearly demonstrates a strong "Leonard Nimoy 8-Tape Tape", anticipated such a rich painting? I'm thinking about it now.
