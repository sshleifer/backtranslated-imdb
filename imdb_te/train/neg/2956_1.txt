What does she think about? File: Woopti Goldberg who teamed up with dinosaurs (!) Who spoke for a criminal case involving madness who wants to start another ice age who plays a police role in the future. Straight-to-tape novelty is embarrassing and ridiculous, with more searching. Apparently this was a work of love for the writer-director, Jonathan Betel (who also worked as one of the producers); Unfortunately, the final results are anemia, they are voluntary. The existence of Goldberg on the screen is just a matter of good choice and the script is bad, but here she sinks and you can see the results. **** from stars
