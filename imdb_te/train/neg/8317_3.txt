This is surprisingly dull for a movie about the killer. <br /> A lot of things happen and they do not produce real enthusiasm or interest even when things are happening. <br /> <br /> It is good from two leads, and Cassetti offers a great performance, especially with the accuracy and stupidity of Sukco, but the rest of the cast will do the same. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> The problem is that the poor writing and directing is not as interesting as the real hero, Sukco is not a particular character, he is neither interesting nor exciting. <br /> <br /> These films generally generate nothing but tension or empathy or outrage and it is nothing but a feeling of wasting your time watching you.
