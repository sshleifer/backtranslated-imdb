I have not previously been smitten by many critics. Certainly, having sexy, lesbian vampires has lovely girls. Marianne Morris and Analca de. These two lovely sirens play with these razor teeth, who run on the road on the road, confuse their home (evening), and their food .... What happens there ... well, after they are separated and mostly kiss one, they kill their visitors. Director Jose Ramon Larrac has some of the illumination of his camera with his camera. Some scenes have been shot in a very strange and efficient manner, but sex does not have a movie (at least intentionally intentionally intended). Not really a story here too. We have two girls. We've seen the pistol shot in some unsustainable and unexplained beginning. Why? "Do we have a guy who has been a long time guy since he had been there since years ago and had a wine cellar filled with girls and carpenters who seem to be like vampires in English rural areas? It is suffering from such bugs Wine and Dine are very strange and ultimately go with some alchemical scenes, but this is anti-climatic, I've told some effective scenes by the director ... the girls are portrayed and dressed in forests looking for their food. The house is also a very attractive set. It's very lovely to have two girls Morris eppanumariyan exclusively - in more ways than one of the older fans of the film, the silent screen in a brief cameo in the famous Bessie Love, a t the end of the film.
