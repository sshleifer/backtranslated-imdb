<br /> <br /> The film is confusing. When I saw there was another person in the audience, and she went on for an hour. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do. And Ritchie could actually think they made a good film. The conversation is ludicrous, acting is very bad and the only thing that's good in the movie is the scene. Richie Lina's image and turned it into another "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> You can not even watch the night at cinemas. Time to waste on the worst as time is very valuable.
