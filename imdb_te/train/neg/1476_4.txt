This is a good start to the formula knives and flying fist film John Woo talents. Cinematography is good and some of the knife work is unique. Unfortunately the film's burden of the daunting story and the flashing low budget (if you suspect me check some of the scenes in the fight scenes). However, what you can see is valuable, especially if you can get in the box.
