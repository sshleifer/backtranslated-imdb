Last summer we told a friend John Phanty when we entered a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I do not know that Phante Buckski's favorite writer - a writer who has the same edge and humor, except for a generation ago. The first fantasy book I've read is 'Ask the Dust', which remains one of my favorite novels. The novel is an overconfident, masterfully talented author who does not know how to write about the real world experiences he has nothing but a brilliant piece of writing about himself and the outside world about a sad, scary young writer. In this novel the Prophet does not know how to earn the appreciation of a woman who wants to write about her magazines. His craziest relationship with Camilla was about how he settled for his first sexual experience with a wounded worshiper and he had nothing to do with, and his unsuccessful attempts at love suddenly ended. The film adaptation is true in the book for a while, but remains in the film of love with persistence through racism, illness and death. The heart of the story is a jerk and Camilla is a silly one, and their love is never and never true, no one of them is true. The film suffered the true meaning of the story and replaced it with Slack. I can not believe that the guy who wrote Chinatown can read this book and make a film about it.
