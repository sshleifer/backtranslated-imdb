I saw this movie last night with many good reviews from many sources. <br /> <br /> "I'm struggling to understand the characters of the cast." In the film, Jump from the stories and do not allow you to say any characters. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps better to have people who are interested in corruption in political affairs and other world governments, but the movie is very boring for the average filmmaker, it's very boring and the movie you paid for the entrance fee is confusing and annoying. <br /> If you're ready 100 minutes every minute details or political interest to you. You can not see if you really like watching movies.
