Before I started a TV movie, I had low expectations. It was made after the last episode of the series, and many series were lost. If you remember President Sheridan, Delen, Lennier, Londo, Veer, Gakker or Lita, the second of the last episode of the series, B-5 ​​has been omitted all regulars except Jack, Weir and Captain Lockley. Now for this film they make a small and irrelevant performance of Garibaldi (not in the last B-5 film) to join Jack and Captain and Doctor. <br /> <br /> The film is currently in a geopolitical exploration about a soul hunter (Martin Sheen) that led to Bobby 5. An archaeologist (Ian McShane) has been stolen from a secret repository. Spooky mumbo-jumbo stuff happens quite a lot but frankly it's pretty crazy and meaningless. Yes, yes, that station was almost blown up but was preserved and everything was there, but I thought it was "That's been there - I've done very well in the past". <br /> <br /> The secondary story provided further for comic relief, when a businessman installs a completely brothel and does not know exactly what that command is about and when they try to force them closer, they are cheeking. <br /> <br /> She has been doing a good job playing Shane before. Eyes and bizarre delivery. However, he repeatedly dropped out of role in the episode. <br /> This is the final judgment, which is only the whole die-hard B-5 nuts (just like me). It can be seen that others who see it will take this series - this is a great injustice. This is a great example of a program without knowing when to quit.
