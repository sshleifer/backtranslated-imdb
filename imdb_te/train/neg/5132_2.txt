I got to know about this movie because the game came from Ben-Chaplin from the game. He clearly leaves he because the game is funny British sitcom and Hollywood and star break in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jeanine Garofal is a very romantic comedy in the film, playing with an ugly woman who uses her neighbor Uma Thurman with Ben Pope Chaplin. The picture is just bad for a lot of reasons. The plot is unbelievably imaginable from intentionally flawed bits to the bitter bits: the mottage is where the fun and the photo bit on three of them. Those two scenes were scary to me! Johnny's character is sickeningly proud (and guessing from her character as stand-up "comedian" and tilt-feminist is also in real life). In fact, when it was real, she claimed that the film was "anti-feminist". Men are more often than not being individually disappeared. It's also interesting to note her impersonation. Prior to taking up the role, she wanted to become a feminist and "comedian" and suddenly decided that the movie was bad. I guess I hated the idea of ​​the film and the script before it was released but made her silent, so she was paid for this tragedy of the film. I mean she has acted for Heaven! This is the opposite of people. <br /> <br /> Woman Thurman's character is painted by men who are stupid to attract the attention of Noya's men in their brains in their brains of stupid animals. <br /> <br /> There are other bad things about this film as Ben Chaplin plays the British man every American girl is beautiful and Jamie Fox Chaplin's token black best friend and of course Fox came to try and mimic his accent for a good measure. Best Script Writer? Blaime has never done anything except with Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore films. There is also a grotesque phone with a really awful phone and there is little proof of the film. Other comments here are all that Janeine Garofalo is not ugly but really beautiful. Am I watching when they see the same movie? She is absolutely watchful and the only good thing about this film is to cast her right ugly one. <br /> <br /> I can not see Uma Thurman's appeal: she is weird and watching. <br /> <br /> You are giving three things about this film. <br /> <br /> You are embarrassed to have a phone sex scene and <br /> <br /> You are bored after ten minutes. /> <br /> Look at your own peril.
