I did not have much confidence in the AIDS conspiracy theory but its sociology was interestingly dramatic. In the early years of AIDS epidemic, fear and dying fear and mental illness often produced such dark fantasies. This is especially true in San Francisco's politically intense and sexual militant Demi-Mande. The city, which is famous for its beauty, is rarely seen than the film. <br /> <br /> Acting and storyline is a complete loss of films, especially partially protective of darker mood movies with cultural context and cruelty. Actually, I found a very interesting presentation of Irrit Levi as a crusty and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?) Police detective. <br /> <br /> Highlights: The image of the tragic strand of the garment is very useful and has a fantastic precision coincidence by iconic show artist Ron Ate.
