Most of the reviewers reviewed the film at first sight because they were filmed near where they lived. How For Ringing Endorsement If I shot this film that I lived in, I can not mention in my review. It's awesome! Many reviews make this film a cheeky horror movie in a spoof or tongue, it's not. The film is sad to review the film as a comedy, which makes it a bad effort not only in the horror film but also as a comedy. <br /> <br /> The film is a good thing, a mask and a choice of weapon, unfortunately it was more interesting to see an hour and looking at this garbage on the mask and half of a weapon. Social commentary behind the film is also funnier, juvenile and stupid. Do not be bothered with this film, you have wasted reading time in this review and the film is no longer in vain. Arrggghhh! Movies like this are also made. I think the band, Allan Smithi, is a whole cast, usually a director, and I think it will use the name that is not very bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this movie, nothing is redemption, I spend $ 1.19 to rent and I feel I ripped off. Avoid. 10 to 1
