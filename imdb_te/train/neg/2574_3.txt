I know movies do not need the mirror of reality, but this comes on my nerves. It will permanently paralyze innocent stereotypes about "mental trauma" and mental illness. The "mental mother" thing was done many times (and usually better) and did not get well-rested. <br /> <br /> A highlight: I was a longtime fan of General Hospital and a tour to see one of the roles played by the former GHG, Jon, daily. <br /> <br /> If a person does not care about its bogus psychological analytical part, you should suspend a reality / judgment when watching movies, then this film is enduring. <br /> <br /> I forgot, I spent my time looking at it.
