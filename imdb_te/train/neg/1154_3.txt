May (Anne Reed) and Tots (Peter Vaughn) are occasionally touring with their son Bobby (Steven Macintosh) and his family in London. Although tour begins, Tots suffers from a deadly heart attack, drowsiness, synthesis, and questioning her life and future. Her daughter's boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig) attracted her, and her actions led to inevitable consequences. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, but for its reality and appreciation, The Mother is more unpleasant repulsive characters, and asks the viewer to share with them. Reid is shining as May, and it's harder to care what is going on to create the worst characters like Michelle and Kureishi Craig, Macintosh and Kathryn Bradshaw, as her talent and commitment as an amazingly laughing actor in the film that is completely discouraging. As written, Macintosh and Bradshaw have played the role, so totally selfish and cold-hearted, is Kureishi wondering what it is? Those who have directed are unable to lift or make Bobby and Paula over two dimensional in their terrible selfishness. <br /> <br /> Reed's performance is worth watching, but just a little else. A crying shame ...
