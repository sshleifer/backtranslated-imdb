Chris Kutton is a great sketch actor on Saturday Night Live ... If he gets something in creative control he must leave the film alone. He plays an immaculate pussy character, who is basically slightly retarded and fast. Only funny parts know? That's what they show in the previews. Yes, he was taken by him. There is nothing else. Especially when he can tell that he is trying hard to be a physical comedian, because he does not try at him because he is. And yet, his 'wet office is damaged' comes a little more horrible. The film has developed an eyeball for me. Avoid all costs, and keep watching SNL.
