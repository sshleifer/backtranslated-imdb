I have always been a great fan of Woody Allen and much of what he has done in the past, but one blind lover can ignore how disappointing, meaningless, laughable and very scary. An empty physical masturbation that is based on inconsistent grounds. And the artificially anticipated "actor Allen-Clone" reinventing of any unfortunate idea in Ferrell's mouth and Alan tells what happens to Alan Ferrell at the age of 30. The result is obviously ridiculous. Do not talk about dialogues ... The philosophical reflections are intended to make it the intruder of the intellectual process without knowing its comic effect. How sad ...
