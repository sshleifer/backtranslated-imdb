Film school intellectuals abandon the important (hypothetical) meaning of the film, wherever they want, but that's just the intellectual: intellectual drooling. The film is creatively bankrupt, and some errors are considered to be endless. Yes. <br /> Obviously, Goddard is not a Stones fan. It's very bad, because it's great. He captures the timing of this timeless song and chooses to cover music with a True Detective Mag instead or some of those who have read from such rubbish. <br /> <br /> There are endless shots, like spray-painting words on 60 people of librarians' cars. And then seemingly disappointingly disappointing "Interview" where the actress was brilliantly asked yes or no answer to all really deep and intellectual questions. Some people in a purple color have been reading more garbage from a book, Oh, about 20 minutes. And there's something in black jackets or a junkyard. <br /> <br /> But the school school hipsters who do not care about the possibility of losing full access to the stories have been sympathetic to the world. <br /> <br /> More precisely ... Maybe Godard is just blows.
