If you like Marilyn Monroe in other roles she will have good advice "Do not worry to watch this movie". <br /> <br /> This story does not really have anything to do with the VHS box, certainly not. There were only suspense, precious little enthusiasm and very frustrating spots, many of whom tried to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was quite confusing. Although Monroe does not play a good role, she does not need to know that she can play this role. "Some Like It Hot" is good evidence for me alone. <br /> <br /> It is also bad that the cinematic talent of actors like Richard Widmark has been wasted. Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jean Cogn√©, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> <br /> Summary: It's not entertaining and entertaining game name.
