This is one of the definite peculiarities of Felney. His truth is about the only silence. This is a two-and-a-half-hour cut by dual horror world through decline, wealth and sexual challenge. Sutherland makes an interesting appearance of Casanova and fails to participate in a series of sequences on unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography. Outside is the art direction and costume design. Although the Academy did not select a former candidate, it was fair to give OSCAR a gift for the latter. In addition, (unusually), confusing, nonsense and almost invisible screenplay has been nominated. Go and find !! The image in the video is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes less than the original running time. This viewer is grateful.
