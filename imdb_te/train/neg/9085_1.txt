One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Acting is terrible for children and adults. Not all the characters are too short, or enough emotions. The lighting was terrible, and there were so much confusion about the day the film was taken (There were 4 shots if they damaged their boat in the river scene; evening on their yacht Sharif and Dad, Jillian and Molly in the evening, the daylight on the river * and the doctor on the river bank * and the doctor, Beatrice And Simonstone nights will not fall into their boat on the evening.) On the best of the film Sheep, coffee (perhaps, when the pulse detector is in the slip of the character, but when people die, it looks like the beeps * Cappy is dead, it still moves, it can be heard, and when the nurse examines the extra pulse again, it pulse again and he will eventually Dead). It is a freelance movie I guess it's not right, but it may be better. It is worth watching, honest, even for children. You can look good like the Lion King or the Toy Story, if you want to remember anything.
