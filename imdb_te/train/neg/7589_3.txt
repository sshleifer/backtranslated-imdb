When you do not have the script that starts, what can you expect when the director does not have a job? Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kircin are good actors, they just do not respond or do not respond to anything. Even the earthquake is pretty poor. And I do not know how close this film is to the novel, but the two Jewish girls have not come out of nowhere, but Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes. Instead of bringing back the LAC, Camilla was also imprisoned in the desert, where he could bring his flowers for a Catholic burial. Pathetic. And L.A. The set is ridiculously created ridiculous. Is anything good? The window to his apartment looked real, curtains, sounds, and air. And Donaldson was always great. From the Body Snookers or the Night of the Living Dead, it's what's going on.
