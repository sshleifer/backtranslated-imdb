I first saw Calvin Klein-esque commercials, but I wanted to give you an opportunity. I saw it, and I can say everything I say. This image is very bad. I hate this movie too much. Looking at the film, I remembered funny scenes from Altman's "The Player", when the authors sent their tremendous ideas to the producers. I decided that an hour and a half long music video app of MTV Producer Bronte (but at this time Heathliffe's name is Heath and he is Holli's name Hendrix) is a good idea. /> <br /> Even if that's not bad, every other aspect of the film is not terribly wrong. In the direction you are "alone, pate for me." I laughed loudly during all "extreme" scenes and all the rest was frustrated. I remember repeatedly that the camera work was cut and looking at a bad picture that is considered sharp. My theory was bored and some bumped up with his boom - all the waves were when half the scenes were heard. And in other sequences, I wish all I could hear. <br /> <br /> What they do with the Mercy song "More" is the most problematic to talk about sound, and again they can not tell what they can do for BrontÃ«. On the bright side, an entertaining scene - especially when Johnny Whitworth catches up the face of Catherine Heigl - and that scene tells you what you can do with the rest of the story.
