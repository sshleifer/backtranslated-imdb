After a good first 25 minutes you will feel all warm inside, you're pretty convinced that this is a great romantic comedy. Then the picture gets worse. <br /> <br /> The warm feeling may still exist, but as others have said: This plot is very unbelievable and artificial, almost impossible to see. <br /> <br /> The film was tightly picked up, and you thought you were making a faster forwarding or the producers decided to fit less than 1h40m and wanted to cut a lot of scenes. <br /> <br /> Realism is not just a goal, but as a viewer, I'm pretty sure that this comedy is not intentionally irrelevant, it just happens. <br /> <br /> Despite the good interiors, and bad script on the <br / plus side, I feel that actors performances are basically good. If I could rate the first 25 minutes, I would probably give it eight. Now it gets four forms. ... and that's fine! <br /> If you're a fan of romantic comedies, you have a great time. Otherwise, I would recommend that you look for something else.
