<br /> <br /> It's a joke rather than horror for my disappointment. The acting, dialogue and flow of the film were very low. It does not have much sense. For example, there's a 30-person party and there is a secret place where they are terrified of a man and looking at healthy young people and frightening person sounds. <br /> <br /> I was thinking of another movie like Scary Movie, but they are trying hard to see them as gorgeous. <br /> Blood and gore also happen poorly. I've seen Halloween costumes look more believable than this. Cut a person clean on his head ... looked clean - signs bone, meat, blood, and even head. <br /> <br /> The strong weak strike by ax on a corpse is something to do for himself ... person swinging a bat instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> The main villain is a twist, but opposed to other parts of the story. So what happened in the mind of the person who can not do that? If there is a twist, you should at least build it up to adding mystery and suspense.
