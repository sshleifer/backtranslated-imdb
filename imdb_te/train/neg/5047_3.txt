I'm not really going to comment, but I have what I say. Two days ago I saw this film, but I think it's not a waste of time (for producers, but it may be money), which can lead to serious problems. It's really good cinematography and (small but nice) nice music. Most said about Anna Cristina Olivera, but to be honest, what about? She is not an actress, it is eternal between her acting and acting innocents. In any other film there is no one like Odette because her performance is cool: Crazy? Sad? Childlike? A cheater? No one knows, colleagues. <br /> <br /> I think this film is a good example for the problem that many Portuguese films are suffering here. Sound track. The dubbing has no permanent NO and the resulting blue comes from this simple mass. People in other countries may think that there are a large number of Portuguese locations. But what surprised me was that the dialogue was dubbed but it did not necessarily resolve the syndrome. Even bad dubbing, I must say. It's the first thing that touched my mind in the first scene, the first character says it's strange to see a movie saying: It's been dubbed. Also say that the film has technical problems. <br /> It has script issues. This will try to be scientifically original from the last scene. Things are suspended and afraid of a disappointment to leave shows. The author is clearly trying to get everything straight and he but ... it shows !! All dialogs are very exotic and there is not a single component that looks like a line from one image. It's a little raw and a little unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a whole mess, I should stress. <br /> <br /> I feel that the good parts are very clear to keep the bad feelings in mind. <br /> Direction brings a little to the screenplay. All the shots are music and un-innovative, but their beautiful. <br /> Now, the problem is, instead of keeping people from believing this story, laughing throughout the movie and taking it seriously: DIES clearly plays the guy who is not an actor. Actually, I can not see why it's a very important role and non-actors doing such a thing. This person is not an actor or a good-looking person. It means that the whole image is mounting down rolls, since we believe this beautiful woman is obsessed with him for a second even though he's gone, and his hunky lover who survive actually has a bad time to get over the damage, we all see the apathy of this character. Very bad. The world of beautiful people who have good seductive lovers is full. There are also some good actors in the world, who are also capable of being sick at the hands of cute guys and after they leave. The world is full of great images and not even great movies. C'est la vie!
