Michael Cain has always said that "the only money he (he) is totally unhappy" and "the worst film he ever played". Hold, Michael, do you have a swarm and hooray sundown? Two films are better than Ashanti. Cain remembers the 130 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures (director, Richard Fleischer, who was hospitalized as a result of solar-stroke during filming), physically punishing demands for an action film. Ashanti actually reveals that Michael Cain is not a low-level career. <br /> <br /> Instead, it is the most average chase thriller with talented actors, exotic locations, boring stretches and the most formulaic storyline. <br /> <br /> David Linderbie (Cain) is a W.H.O physician and his black brother Anson (Beverly Johnson) will lose him when he misses an aid trip to an African tribal village. Linderbie regularly learns that his wife is sleeping by slave traders, led by Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) - who continuously leads to the Middle East in the continuation of continental expansion. <br /> <br /> <br /> Along the way, big stars pop up for exotic and exaggerated guest appearances. William Holden had poor Kamini as a penny pilot; Omar Sharif performs his Western attraction or kindness as Pampered Arab millionaire; Rex Harrison is a useful introduction to helping Keine in his quest to get bored in his short role. The film is based on the best seller named Ebano with the lesser known author Alberto Vasquez-Figueuro, although the book is not very popular in this adaptation. Glamorous as Ustinov Slaver (he has all his movies that can not give bad performances), and Caine produces believable sadness for the man who thinks he will never see his wife again. Occasional actions are going on but slowly moving across the whole of Assamese. In all, it is an immune component of action hokum - not by any stretch of terrible as Caine is often suggested, but a very inspiring image and absolutely let down from all the talents involved.
