<br /> This is my first post in IMDb, although I have used it for a long time. So I'd like to congratulate you all. <br /> <br /> I am a Greek but I'm going to influence my judgment. I'm not waiting for your anger. <br /> <br /> I've spent 2 years in my life (we're all Greeks), analyzing the Omirus epos (and homers not everywhere you see it), rhyme through the castle. I remembered that it was the 8th class on the 9th class and the Iliad (Iliad) on Odyssey. Warner's Troy, my fellow Greeks around me and the campus (I'm studying in the UK) was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The Iliad epoxy is one of the best literary works ever made. It was composed by the Greek poet Omiras 400 years after the real war. Although historians put the Trojan War in 1200 BC, and the beauty of Helen, the original reason was Troy's strategic location. It can be understood that Omirus epsus is not presenting the actual events (not historically accurate), but this is not the purpose of this work. <br /> <br /> When reading this huge poem, one can find himself in the very definitions of respect, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, obedience, and others. This long talk and best educated among warriors before the war. <br /> <br /> Warner's Troy is very cheap for my eyes and is also very low for English-Finnish and German colleagues for other intellectual people. It is shameful to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. The exact storm by the way is a bad and stupid blockbuster (computers have done all the work graphics), and yet it is Wolfgang Pietersen's best work. <br /> <br /> "I'm giving Troy 2 out of 10. It's a very expensive B picture. <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> Alex
