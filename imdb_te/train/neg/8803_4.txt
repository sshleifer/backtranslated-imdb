I love "Anchorman, The Legend of Ron Burgundy" and it's just funny, but alas, it's not. While some bits are excellent. I thought it was a pleasure to announce his love to Ron Burgundy in a sports car with the Guy, Champ Guild, the other car in the road. Everyone is ignoring him and he just gets loud and loud and finally Burgundy kisses. But the whole story is not gel. It's a beautiful attempt, though, that protect the unused bits from the first film, that the entire plot about some pretty benign is called domestic terrorists "alarm clock." Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has funny lines, but this unused plot line is a good reason not used in the first film. Extras in this disc are pretty good and the best of both are the funniest, and Fox commentary with Will Ferrell and Ferrill in the beginning is a part of an "Egg Producer" film, in any way, shape or form. He walks towards the recording studio and turns into a "just one person" who pretends to be a producer. It's some pretty funny stuff that takes about 10 or 15 minutes
