The first matrix film is filled with fantastic character development, witty dialogue and action scenes. These items - together with the amazing special effects of the day - provided a magic ride that put you all the time to the suspense. Enter Matrix Reloaded (and its Sequel, Revolutions). Here the argument is not, there are some special arguments or combat scenes; The brothers took the most prominent roles from the first film and deleted them like rotten tree lags. <br /> <br /> When the first Matrix is ​​realized that the same characters are not the same, the first film will lose the first established connection between the audience and the characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Image. This character does not feel the same, and is also about supporting characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Removing the 'tank' is also disappointing. The tank's involvement in the first film is fine, but he has played very well. In Reloaded, we realized that the tank would die after the events of the first film, and replaced by the Zir Jar Binks Stunt Double, which was his live stream (the Kellogg's Corn Flax's vintage box). His performance was done by me chickling, and there was not much talk of dialogue. There is a fantastic feeling that it is difficult to convey his emotions on the screen or deliver it in the script; In some case, the experience is ridiculous! <br /> <br /> Nayo's godly person is also suspected of fighting scenes. The Battlefield with 200 Agent Smith Clone is absolutely exaggerated. Whether a person is worthy of being a gift like neo - when he attends more troubled things (that he wastes his time taking part in a useless, frivolous battle, especially when you consider his unpleasant ability to fly his maturity or matrix; certainly Neo Clone is very fast, and More efficiently). Again, they are entrusting themselves to a script that will interfere with such actions, and the sequences created by us to keep us away from the guided feeling. Interestingly, our estimates of the characters created in the first film were immediately deleted. <br /> <br /> However, if you take your standard, run-of-the-million action movie, and forget that you have a good story, you have to be very proud of yourself, to develop a character from an amazing story and an original character from the very first film.
