The 1973 remake of the 1973 film Billy Wilder, "Double Indemnity", is an example of how to destroy a great script. This grade-B TV feed also generally describes the folly of reconstructions. <br /> <br /> While greedy officials have been asked to include black-and-white imagery and scandalized in pan-and-scan images, the industry has insisted on making a classic image and cutting it down into a boldly version of a classic Editing the first stage script in creating.

Then update the product with bland, color photography, smart, high-end sets and TV-aware actors.

Cobb only performs a reliable performance as Keys. <br /> <br /> Director Jack Smith and his three principal teachers have done much better than anything else. <br /> <br /> There is no conceivable reason for producing this wretched remake unless it is time to fill in the broadcast schedule. There is no conceivable reason for recording this dude in the DVDs and packaging it with the original image, unless the DVD disc package is complete.
