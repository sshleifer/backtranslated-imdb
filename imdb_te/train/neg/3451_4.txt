Frank Sinatra is far from being the best actor for Western films. He is a great actor, from Here to Eternity and the Man with the Golden Arm proof, but he does not have a Western hero's body and you recognize him as urban. But he tried to do his job in Johnny Conco, the fact that the film failed at the box office was not his fault. I claim to say two things: a) The story is very unusual, especially the Sanatra film that acts more than the villain. It is better to imagine the type of people in a type of model and leave it. B) The story is not persuaded, the Cinatra allows him to do anything he wants, as the whole town feared his brother. When a man shows him a special bar that runs to him, he can not draw a gun and if he is invincible, why not all pistols receive it? I do not think the film should be withdrawn because any film with Sinatra is also valuable, and its lapses are still enjoyable
