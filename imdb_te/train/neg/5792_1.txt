The other is made for the junk off TV! It was an insult of this war film (I use the word picture in its simplest form!) Regular basis, but I was involved in this when it was heard that Telly Savalas career hit the rock when the visitor who showed Tarant in TV on a semi-TV Birmingham video Like forgotten! I tried to push it to my subconscious memory, but cable TV brought me out of memory! <br /> <br /> I like the bit (sarcastically laughing!) in the film as a scene from the Liverpool in the Forties, but it was the shot of the Zagreb Cathedral at the end of the eighties. Commando's commando training, JZ (Jugoslavia Zeleznice, or Yugoslav State Railways), makes the logo clear to the locomotive, although the makers have tried to push them black. Where is the film not in the UK, where is that much set? <br /> <br /> Cheap garbage, and waste of celluloid!
