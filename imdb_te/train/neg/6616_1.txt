I must say correctly, I certainly do not have the power to Bollywood films and only some people have seen. However, if you have not seen it, do not start it! I have enjoyed them as much as I have seen, but I could not stand this. I also said that I could not finish the film - it was annoying. So why is it so annoying? <br /> <br /> The film has a character called 'Ramba'. He was more annoying than jar-jar binks - I would never have believed in it. He is # # ^! # Annoyer! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I understand that it is funny humorous. Instead, he waved my nerves and wanted to die ... slow! His voice, his habits, and his wickedness - he closed his every scene and dominated - he was dead! <br /> Leaders have an excellent ability to easily dodge AK-47 bullets. I'm not a child - there is a scene that many unarmed guys took a small army of boys with this attack rifles !! And, again and again, they took a single bullet and escaped and beat ruffians !!! Stallone's actions in this "Rambo II" look mundane !! <br /> <br /> The film is face and tight, so practically my brain is bleed, so gosh-darn !! This film is like Mathan's influence with people! Crazy camera angles, intensus music and action, action, action ... This image is clearly designed for someone who wants to take the picture with the plot and wants almost 100% action. The two main characters and their actions and motivations have zero angle ... nothing! <br /> <br /> If you are a very serious action and bollywood fan of this film, you can see why in IMDb's alert list below 100. Wow ... this movie is bad and bad bad !!
