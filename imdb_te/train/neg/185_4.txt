Man made five or better in Western Western Hollywood is collectively uneven. Even John Ford has never done so much with much quality. The interesting thing about them is how unequal they are. Ford's My Darling Clementine has two and a half worth each of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> Along with Man and Stewart their real hero chase is. Chase to the wonderful red river is responsible. Chase is bending to the country for many countries, some to others. But none of them are like my darling clementine, but very few movies, Western or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Each of the five films of Mann is one of the larger spaces, or six. Bend, Far, Man of the West, Furies, Winchester 73, and Yip, Six, Naked Spar. After a bright scene, everyone has a spectacular view and is not very clear. Yet the Red River is the only Western Western to date. So perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> There are huge huge holes in the Far Far country. It's mawkish, and really comes alive only when the horns of Stewart and Mc are locked. The rest were pretty pedestrian, with the exception of Man's camera. Man's camera is a person's course in cinematography. It's good for someone behind the strip of the moving image. This is never in the wrong place. <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful moment in the Far Country. And comes from Stewart as usual. No one in the history of cinema has received physical punishment with the authority of that person. He is absolutely amazing: Look at man from Bend, Far, Winchester, and Larry: Hitting in the bend and confidently hanging through a thread and with such boiling hate he looks like someone displaced from Dachau, Far he shot off a raft with such violence , And of course when he dragged through fire in man, well you're looking for burns Is convinced that it should be done. No actor. When he hit the beginning of the room, Winchester did not say about the moment and nobody else did it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is painful to record the scene of anytime recorded. Although Cooper Stewart is not quite as compatible, he is equally wrong with something wrong at the end of the fight. In short, no one but no one but no one has also shown the terrorists as well as the man in man. <br /> What a great, great director. <br /> Look at every western country he has done. They are his true memorials. But do so. When they bellow with his great sequences they are as good as anyone including Ford. <br /> <br /> In the meantime,
