For some reason, the local CBS affiliate station in New York at the beginning of the 70s and early 80s is a Friday night or Friday night in the film, usually 2 a.m. Or at some times such a film is playing. It's really a very difficult and very odd (see other reviews for special story information) which is an appropriate image for the slot at that time. However, after it caught several times in the days before cable TV (and after a lot of hits, but before they all night programs), I was caught by this little novelty. After watching it for several years, I decided to see if I could find on the DVD. The Budget label "Brentwood Video" in the "Brentwood Video" featured in the lousy grainy print on "Brentwood Video" (from 4 search on 2 double sided discs) 10 is generally available, but if you shop around it is very small, the other three films in this set are the Public Domain Other features of the movies are readily available, so I do not have to comment on them, but I do not see "ice." However, even though it is a "revamped" version, this print runs exactly 92 minutes, so it is not correct to mention IMDb 90 minutes of time. A chime that was translated into English from another language, along with the running time of minutes  రం కూడా నడుస్తున్న సమయాన్ని కొంతవరకు కత్తిరించడానికి అసాధారణంగా లేదు. కొన్ని కథలను డబ్బింగ్ చేయకుండా ఉండటం ద్వారా డబ్బు ఆదా చేసుకోవడమే ఇది సాధారణ బడ్జెట్-మనస్సాక్షి అభ్యాసం అనిపిస్తుంది. ఏదైనా తక్కువ గందరగోళంగా పొడవైన సంస్కరణ చేస్తారా? Who really knows-unless you've seen in its native language ... By the way, my efforts to look at this day are not working and I just end up ending it off. This film is something about looking at it in the middle of the night to fit it .. Or is it from my previous experiences, who ??
