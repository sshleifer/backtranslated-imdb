Ho- hum. An inventor's (Horst Bucholz) deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Her son (Luke Perry) is not known to be anonymous. Enter the CIA agent Olivia di Abo and the cat and mouse car starts and chasing the gun. Also in the cast: Tom Conti, Hendrik Hasey and aging Roger Moore. Moore stirring up one of his best efforts in this chaos. Perry fans will be accepted. D'Abo is wrong for the role, but it's good to see.
