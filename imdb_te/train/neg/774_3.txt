The film was made by some good ideas but they did not make the film either, or they thought the script was edited or funny. When I saw the film, I looked for John Candy and thought it was wrong. Instead, there is a stupid plot about mind control and very flat, unfunny moments. And, to top it off, Candy delivered some of the crudest lines I've heard up to so far. So, despite the idea of ​​a powerful funny cast and story, we are left with an enthusiastic and raw image that is probably too stupid for the average adult, although young people will probably find some laughs. This is really a shame - it might be very good. I, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy, it's awesome.
