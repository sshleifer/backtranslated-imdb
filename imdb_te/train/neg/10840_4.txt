I love millions of others in this program. <br /> <br /> When I tuned this film, thinking it was good, it was at least a bit dazzling and fun. <br /> Wrong! I have to wonder, at this end, Charlie Angels is really that boring? I do not remember that. But this film might be as bad as these types of films, the excitement of that time and appearance has little comparisons. I've seen everyone, despite the negatives, it's unclear. But I'm a lot of fun, and all the ladies, especially the angels, have really seen them. This film is not just interesting. It tried to make every angel a "role". (An angel is agnostic, one "good girl", she enters her husband ...), all the characters are shot with the same main features and less depth than normalization. The excitement of the show is lacking and dialog .... dialogue. That's pretty cool. <br /> <br /> It's not awful. No TV movies are the worst. But missile.
