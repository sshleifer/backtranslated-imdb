It's not a lot of nonsense animation film experience, but it's definitely not adored because it's trying to be good. Combining DreamWorks Animation and Computer Graphics, it is a Mustang's story, followed by a Spirit named (Matt Damon, providing the first person's story), and his West Old West borders. He was born freely in other races in beautiful rural areas, when he was kidnapped to use a saddle horse, and would deny anyone trying to turn him around. Nevertheless, Little Girl (Daniel Studi), avoiding his cage, both of them form a friendship, Oh, and he certainly has a thing for Little Creek's females. Eventually, Little Creek creates a big leap in the end, making a few bigger attempts to chase Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men and release his female horse, and they are home to their rural and fellow horses. As well as Chapman Bernard as Sargent. Joe as Adams, Jeff LeBewy Murphy / Railroad Forman, John Rubano Soldier, Richard McGonagle Bill and Matthew Levine. I look forward to horses in this movie, but it turns out to be Dumbo thing, Bryan Adams's songs are not very appealing, but this is not a horrible movie. It was nominated for an Oscar for the best animated feature and was nominated for the Golden Globe for Bryan Adams's "Here I am" Best Song. OK!
