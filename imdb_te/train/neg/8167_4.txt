Forest is not just your daily standard slasher / backwoods burden of cannibals, it is also an interesting mix of supernatural elements. Two couples who go into the forest on the story camping trip. A cave dwelling, cannibalizer and his dead wife and two children are immediately threatened by demons. There is something you did not see every slasher. Director Don Jones receives an "A" for the work, but while the film is only flat at every level, acting is only in the woods, except Jeetet Kelly, who plays the role of a dead wife (Michael Brody or Gary Kent) in the woods. /> <br /> The movie opens with a valley and some cute shots hiking a couple in a forest. Someone knows they are very late to hunt. They were sent in two general slasher fare. Our killer uses a reliable predatory knife in the rest of the movie except in the past when running a handsel, pitchfork and rusty blade to send his cheating wife lover. The film does not work with it, and I've been pretty boring with just frustration. 4/10
