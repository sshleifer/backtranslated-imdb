I'm a big fan of horror films, and zombie films are unique to mine. Zombie 3 is one of the worst worst films ever seen. So I do not need to say that I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've seen so long. The story is similar to Don O'Bennon's "Return of the Living Dead", but it's okay if the film is intentionally funny. It has some of the most ridiculous acting I've ever seen since the main laughing role I've ever seen. The General are just silly in his sequences. Moreover, the effects are relief and in many cases sloppy, and death scenes are often just stupid. This, of course, makes it more fun. The chest man opens the door to the refrigerator and then opens its eyes and somehow it sees the severed zombie head, which latching on the fritch (obviously pulled ineptly with a bit of string), the scene neck, killing him. Zombie heads now have the ability to float in the air? It describes all the laws of physics related to humanity, which is one of the most abusive things ever shot. It is just one of the many truly Goofy moments in the idiot mess. I can not believe that I got the highest rating here. If you're a fan of bad movies, help yourself and rent this suitor.
