I never knew when this movie escaped the anger of MST3K. "JimCata" is a fiery action movie, which is filled with paper-thin plot, dumb characters, and unusual conditions (or vacant). <br /> <br /> Action centers around a gymnast that has been chosen by government agents (at least, I think they want to spy). You're his father's other sportsman, who has not competed in this sport, is fluent, "the game." <br /> <br /> "Okay, so it does not start, so that the bones plot sypnopsis will not begin to describe the joys of this film. Like Gimnast's mysterious Asian girlfriend, does not speak for the first half of the film, then suddenly begins to talk, and will not be closed at any other time! When the rules are made and the breaks are really delightful, the shirtless bad guy who likes to break up and breaks is the happiest pleasure of our hero through the "Crazies Village" (obviously the real name of that place!). <br /> <br /> There are action sequences where our protagonist is a gymnast, director behind the cities of the Middle East And it's good to drive gymmatic material in urban squares, so our gymcaster master can use his gymnast skills to fight parallel to his gymnast skills and bars and palm horses. <br /> This is a very interesting thing. Most, I'd say about a half cast, shot with an arrow and die. Interesting arrows or action only in the whole picture of the arrows. If these are actually effects, this is a major note of compliment to anyone designing very realistic arrows. Most likely, this film is not an additional way to pay. However, if you can see without paying "gimcata", a look is desirable and is looking for some mourning for an easy target to hit. <br /> <br />
