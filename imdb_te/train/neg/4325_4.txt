<br /> <br /> The second in the Celebration series was easily enjoyed, as Clarke Griswold achieved a tour to Europe for the whole family. <br /> <br /> It is practically not the first thing to do under the tasteless, belt comedy. That mistake is certainly a good director as Harold Ramis is somewhat clear that there is a very uninspiring script that is somewhat clear to director hackerling and good lines scattered around. <br /> <br /> What can they do with cast; Chevy Chase distributes some versions of life in the proceedings, but this is not enough and the most funny Eric Idle wastes as the most unfortunate Englishman in a very short role. Some powerful happiest movements are not for their full potential and can greatly exaggerate the viewer. All depictions of Europeans are single-dimensional and not nearly universally funny (such as English SOOO courtesy). <br /> <br /> Unlike some scenes, a smile in the eyes is very difficult, into a full slapstick. But if you're a Chevy Chase fan (like), you can watch this movie, but more than that.
