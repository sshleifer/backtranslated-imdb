I love the stories of Jane Austen. I read both of them (P & P and S & S), but after seeing this subsequent, I reached for "peruation" from my book just make sense from the story, and I wrote Jane Austen such nonsense. For me, if you are based on a film based on a Jane Austen novel, you're not really wrong. This is pretty pretty by default. I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> First, where are you playing sympathetic characters? You must have at least one preferred character to invest in their emotions, and it does not deliver. Certainly, I wanted Anne and Wentworth to be together, but you know the purpose of this story, because they are mingled. <br /> <br /> Instead, I refused to discontinue my tea cup on TV and continue watching it. <br /> <br /> Anne is totally annoying, ultimately, Wentworth so he kills her, there is nothing to be attracted to him. She is positive, polite, dull, socially inadequate and has her own mind and is like a sheep who follows the instructions. It can still work for a major role, if you do well. It did not do well. <br /> <br /> Other characters exhibit different types of nurses, the worst of them being Mary, the full nurses personality disorder. Though Ms. Bennett has similar flaws in P & P, she is still mesmerized, but Mary is in a freak-show. <br /> <br /> Wentworth was very beautiful and looked like a good man. To the greater part of the story, I was shocked to see what sort of person he was and why he was in love with Anne, certainly, the kind of person he wanted a little more ... Are alive? Acting, not to say, I responded more often than the good of the people rather than the characters. <br /> <br /> Anthony Head looks awesome, but as soon as I see it, I'm low. <br /> <br /> The story is also very confusing. Although Elizabeth is not the stepmother of Anne, it is not only at the end of the film, but a sister (I'm still not 100%). The whole Anne / Ventworth return story is also a bit mess. They were together but later separated and they were two bitter about it? How come I was wondering for this for a while, and the explanation seemed to have poured him because someone convinced her that she was so convinced? But somehow it is no longer important, it is said to be a kind of "by" that it is almost distant. How important is it when it becomes the core of the story? There is a lot of name-slipping, but the real sense of who the characters are. For example, is this Louisa man who is she? A friend Family? What? It is not clear who their relationships with different characters and the other. Lady Russell is very much, but why? Mrs. Craft and Wentworth's brother and sister, Mrs. Kraft was considered to be quite unrealistic as being old enough to be her mother. <br /> <br /> Last kiss, yes it's a bit strange to kiss on the street, but I'm not too busy because I'm not too busy because "it's already available !!" On TV, because Anne's lips trembled and trembled and shaking for what they really felt like ages before they met Wentworth. <br /> There are some contractions, but only a few seconds or half a minute. <br /> Then there's a problem with the camera work. As a regular movie watch, you do not care for the angles and unless you decide to see it. I have decided not to do that here, but I still watch them. For me, filmmakers are not doing a good job. Conversations are very serious facial expressions, only when it is really important. In this adaptation, it is mostly used and does not mean. The concept of hand holding in the past did not really work in dramas. At the end of the scenes, the camera work was very contemporary. (Not to mention running.) I was the only Aston simulator I caught in ITV's Aston Season. I think it's worth watching "Nordenger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park", or I have read the books and left it. I'm sad, I did not enjoy this as Jen Aston's. Maybe I'll see the 1995 version. Before the BBC, it is famous for the transition to Austen quickly before.
