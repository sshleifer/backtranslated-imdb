Dialogues, story, actors and actresses - this movie is very bad! - It's hard to imagine we'll see a miserable movie this year or next year. "Lovely Brother" (Italian emigrants set up in Australia) has Italian but about shallow clippings, Italian and Italian from Italy also speak English in this language. The message of the film - the ugly people have to marry the ugly people, the beautiful people have to marry the beautiful people - is really uncomfortable. Giovanni RBS is good in movies such as 'Suburbia' or 'Lost in Translation', but it's hard to endure his fake-Italian accent here. Watch this picture at your own risk. Can trash even worse!
