Three authors have tried to win Jane Stanton Hitchcock's novels for the tube, but this television movie is eventually dramatic and does not know when to exit. The struggling artist Meg Tilly suddenly gets a job by wealthy, troubled Ellen Berstein, who wants a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom. After learning about the upcoming party of Elden's daughter - Tilly decides on her artistic background, that her daughter was secretly dead before the work began, and she and her dead have a wonderful resemblance to each other! Two brilliant actresses donate their services to a fabulous yarn, which are not closely monitored, which fails to match the lady with emotional intensity. Bertstain's role in the camp is difficult for teaters and tilly to dream-wow routine. A scene at the end of the movie (after completion of the morning morning) is honest feeling blamed with anger and betrayal. Everything else.
