I read the book "7 years in Tibet" from Heinrich Harer and was impressed by it. I immediately caught the DVD and started watching the movie. The first time I saw it in 98, I liked it very much. Well, I have looked at the book full knowledge based on myself. <br /> When they enter Lasa, people start to get their lips out of their mouth and greet them again in Thiblis and Pitt Tibet, and they will again regret ... In the horror book, the tongue is a symbol of holiness and loyalty in Tibet, This is done in front of Lama, but not exactly for these two Europeans! Only the mother, but the Dalai Lama himself was wearing glasses of people. Harrar claimed that no one in Tibet wore glasses at that time (sorry for the forgotten cause, but also in its book). A young Dalai Lama, but alone and no one can see him! And that's about the Mao Tis Tang Lookail, destroying the Mandal before the young "Jeevan Buddha" ?? The kid ... and the dealer horror and the oustsnitier Tibet outfit is not European designer suits! Many events that are not totally altered have been removed from the story, to fill out time with a romantic love interest (female tailor ...)? Just like the whole story about the son of harrers, roll. There is no mention of him or any family member in the book. But it's not for me, because the Hairs is not a book because "7 years in Tibet" is ok to me. Its about Tibet. I was disappointed by this "simulation" of the famous book. And I Heinrich Herrer is also 3 stars, just for cinematography.
