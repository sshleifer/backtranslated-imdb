Japan (Joe Drilling) arrives to visit his hypocritical, biblical-coaching archeologist father (William Finley) in Egypt and attracts attention of a group led by the descendants of Marquis de Sade (Robert England). Inkland also runs in his cell, in the past, Mohamed (Juliano Mer), who runs nude (Juliano Mer), juggles her with black omelette, smokers her smoking a snake on a snake, a dance and a father teachings! Meanwhile, black hood cult members decapitate, gouge eyeballs and split throats out. When she drinks Genie's medicines in her tee, she sees her seed in a bottle and carries her blood on a bed-painted woman and a snake on a leaf g-string. <br /> <br /> This is usually the Sleepy Harry Alan Towers product is redundant, cd and pretty, but all of the sets, costumes, cinematography and location tasks are going to be exciting and at least something. <br /> Score: 3 in 10
