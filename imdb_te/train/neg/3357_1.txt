I do not think the viewers will respond to this new "simulation" of Shirley Jackson's book, not the remake of the original 1963 film, but I suspect the following: the book or the original one is not going to think too much ... For those who are big fans of Hollywood's current trend towards them, and "special effects" Hosted the last word "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />" of the book, which is not a true simulation. From the articles I read, the film is required to cover other items. And, it seemed reasonable, except for the length of the stands, it covers a book for any movie term! (And not even), but the film has never been mentioned in the movie or as mentioned earlier. They reminded me that they decided to kill a black man in Shining's original film version. I did not like it either. The press release of the film says ... "We have a basic, basic idea from Shirley Jackson's book, we have similar names in the home and with the names of several prominent characters, but we decided to write our own story , And, what the heck, we are monitoring, the first is shanding and ghost, and throw them in a bit They had lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting a carefully chosen guest who had brushes with paranormal in all their pasts. "Instead, this" physician "sneaks into their" insomniac " Under the house everyone came (he invited them out there to scare them to death See how to respond to their fear after u ... like laboratory rats, he said that they are always part of an experiment ... good guy). <br /> <br /> In contrast to this statement used to encourage two films, "Some houses are just bad", this house is not bad, but because what happened is bad because ... and this time, Takes the mystery (shades of change). The only problem is the so-called mystery so absurdly I'm sure the audience is quite a mystery ... But then there is no secret in the first place (not in the book), because the house does not begin. <br /> This is the first time the "victim" dies before the eyes on it. Luke's character is totally ridiculous. He is regarded as a Debnoyer Playboy, one of the legends in the home (and this is a true skeptic of "history") ... and in this case he wakes up, > "I was furious with the way almost the original scenes were trying to recreate the word for the word (scene with Knoll's sister family, and Mrs. Dudley's short opening speech ...) <br /> <br /> I've lost the story of Naal through the whole movie. The original novel by the original novel's novel was originally as a gothic novel, and we are always secret to her ideas. The Nell was not a bad man but she was a bitter guy (after she had spent 11 years in her life sacrificing a selfish aging and a hateful sister) and she wanted to worry, He lost his temper. This is a very good truth. <br /> <br /> It is not clear at the climax of the film that the author has been watching the GHz many times. <br /> <br /> They changed the history of the house, which took quite a while. Where Abigail Craign (Hug's daughter whose version is bigger in the original versions), there is "mate" and not a nursery. There were also "Grace" (the original physician's wife) and Hugh Kryn's wives died in completely different ways. These changes have changed WAY WAY WAY. I do not know that the producers of this film should be happy Shirley Jackson no longer walk this earth or whether they should be ... sunshine (if i get my motion!) She did not expect something hauntings something is something to be trifled <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> "The film is to be thrown into the ground, and the floor sprung into the floor!" My favorite movie from time to time. not.
