No horrible movie. It sucks. Very bad. I do not know what to say about this film, but Dino Croap, I stole his donkey from some critic. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH ?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sigh .. It's not Roger Carman that I hate, this is a terrifying picture of God. Well, really? But what can you expect from a picture with homoric computer graphics. Another thing, CGI sucks out loudly; I hate the movie with hatred. It's very bad Roger Carman has a B-movie and it probably has a lot of B-movie. It's --- DINOCRAP! Sorry, I need to disturb some scholars of these moments. This is an awful movie ... 0 / 1,000
