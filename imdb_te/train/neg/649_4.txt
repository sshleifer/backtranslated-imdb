Okay this movie is a reason and one reason is earned money! The producers did not really care about killing a classic horror. I know this film is read as soon as this film is going to be a pg-13 that has changed the Pag-13 election films. How many women are asking for the moon? The answer is no! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, Prom Night Knight did not mention any masterpiece in the 1980s but deserved to be sure that it was a genus of its genre and that it was trying to do anything more. <br /> My problem with Prom Night 2008 is that it carries the killer and I have 3 major problems with him ..................... <br / > <br /> 1) As he runs away, he is locked up in a mental institution and he escapes through an air conditioning crater !! What hell? Why would they have an air conditioning crater in patients room? Would he stay comfortable with his staying or at some point? 2) His intentions to kill some of the main victims and friends, some are obscure, so he tells himself that he loves him, but in the next minute he tries to kill her, so why would she kill her, or do she love her? 3) The killer is great, how did he develop his skills? He is a teacher in the scene where he primarily kills the victim's boyfriend, but he is mainly a sleepy man with all the silly 2 stars horror film from 10 fierce, silly, stupid attempts when she sleeps and noticed her
