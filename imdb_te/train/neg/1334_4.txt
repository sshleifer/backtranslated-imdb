I saw the movie "My Left Foot" after years when I finally said my mom ... Day Louise's central appearance is really awesome and wonderful, but less for his other people. <br /> <br /> In my opinion the most severe misuse of this person Engaged with simple proof; The film has chosen to make him complete and totally foolish. On the one hand I will see that I am logical; Humanity is capable of always being objectionable, and the disability should not be hidden. I would like that the forgiveness of impartial behaviors should not be forgiven and that conditions can automatically forgive me. They will not do. Acting is normal, and yes, disabled people work - but they do not do it because they are stopped; They are because they are inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Physical weakness is indirectly inappropriate for you, since someone you love may turn you down. <br /> You can disable or be able -bodied. One of them is to give one to one to directly boot a football on your head. (I once saved the penalty from the school's star striker with my face, but I was already valued it was not for acceptance). If you can prove yourself capable of passing through physical hoops, your father really appreciates the fact that you are only growing up with your family. These are all stupid, and it's not a little foolish to suffer them as a way to show your courage. <br /> Yes; Since you have overcome obstacles to achieve great things, you can not do anything in one jerk ... preferably being a good person; Setting up an exciting example for disabled people should look down on the list.
