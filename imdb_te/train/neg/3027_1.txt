It smells like garbage and if it looks rubbish, it should be rubbish. This is one of the worst films ever seen in my entire life. Tony Scott's poorly constructive style is already unnecessary, and Domino Harvey is an undesirable storytelling to be the bounty hunter of life. This story is totally disappearing and is confusing to see. Some of the elements of the plot are ridiculous and totally reliable. All of the action sequences are combined with poor plot and terrible acting. Keira Knightley is totally naked in this regard. This is only one of the films. If you only want to go naked for an hour and a half, and you can catch the whole nipple. I strongly suggest that nobody can see this movie! </ 3
