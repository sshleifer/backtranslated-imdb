If you see fewer movies, it's big for you. If you see a lot of movies, it's a joke. The real heroes acting is very bad. Needless to say, there are songs, there are a lot of flashbacks, and most importantly, fighting scenes are stupidily performed. New characters, good direction, good work, but it's all Bollywood heroes / heroines, you can predict what's next. You do not feel sad when something happens, because they see this actor in other Hindi films, the emotions they are praying are terrible. Suppose this was a realistic picture, but it failed to show. There are times you are thinking of, you are bombing thousands of military vehicles and Pakistani soldiers, and there is nothing in them. Is the neglected pacas bad or the director looks stupid? Some good characters are good, but it is associated with plot and action, it is not properly directed. The film was smaller if they removed songs, flashbacks and points.
