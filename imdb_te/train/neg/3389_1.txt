I saw the original "chorus line" on Broadway. How many times did God get to know this excitement from the live experience in Thamata, feeling depressed and happy. Michael Bennett will have to re-imagine the "chorus" on the screen, but he does not know how to do it. If the person with the stamp is stumped - answer your question. There are some shows that only live with the audience. Nevertheless, the film was directed by Richard Attenborough's "Gandy" musical work on the latest and "Doctor Dulittle" dance, which did not match any of the stage performances. Horrible songs are included (surprise!), Great songs dropped or other characters (which does not make sense). Michael Douglas's wrong cast. People who can not dance have tried to act and have sexy "landers" woman who can not sing, dance or dance - I guess I have completed her as Gandhi's wife. Dances by Jeffrey Hornade have nothing to do with refusing "Flashdance" and doing nothing. I sat in astonishment at how something could inspire nothing to be so inspired and emotional. If you really like this show, if you come back to Broadway in 2006 - see it but do not want to do anything with this movie as "a chorus line".
