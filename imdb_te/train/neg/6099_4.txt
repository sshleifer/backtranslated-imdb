This is less than the small movie I have seen recently with features in Turner Classic Movies. The movie is outdated by a very intense technicolor, the film is not merely moving, and sometimes the plot looks pretty cheerful - not even the observation of the class room and the wider audience's attention. In particular, how many times have I complained about the content of the films - when the characters talk to her, they usually say "Clara Barton" instead of "Mam", "Miss Barton" or "Clara". Plus, a sick soldier soldier said he was "Johnny Reeb, a Confederate a Rebel, ..." - almost like the cartoon character Mojo JoJo from Powerful Girls. <br /> <br /> John Hamilton (later, "Perry White" at the Superman TV show) was interested in chasing as president Garfield. Yep - it is for him under that chin.
