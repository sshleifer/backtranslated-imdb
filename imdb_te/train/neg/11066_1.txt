Before seeing "Dhammer", I thought what film would be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered". I made a mistake. Overall, "Dhammer" has a story about a gay serial killer, which does not kill nearly any kind and meets Dahmer's gay men before being thoroughly killed. There was no plot to get there, and we did not tell us about "Dhammer". All you will learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he likes having sex with men. Malicious acting, horrific direction, terrible writing, terrible everything ... if you have to choose between three hours "dhmer" and projectile vomiting, go with vomit ... it's less painful .....
