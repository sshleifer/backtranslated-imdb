The endgame I never heard of, but the idea of ​​political thrillers so I thought I'd give a shot. After doing some research on the film, I realized that it was intended for the theatrical release initially, but instead of the DVD. After seeing it, I'm thinking, "No wonder." The picture is shocking in its dysplasia. Plots and characters are not perfect. I found out whodunnit by half mark mark but the end is a curved ball. I say, I did not expect it to be done as much as it did, but it is not a place for it. The more predictable end was a priority that was too bad. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers decide how much the film can imagine, and decides to reject it. I want $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes back.
