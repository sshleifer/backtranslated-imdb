Boring, long, pretentious, recurring, self-involved? This move is considered a bad date. Worse, the tedious art school direction - which made me almost throw me with heavy arm use of a whirling shot that is very quick ?? - is constantly observe and tight. Include thin plates and virtually no dialogue and the film will feel about four hours epic about 30 minutes. It will be even worse: poorly written voice-overs and quotes and songs that are very clear to the characters instead of dialogue. Really Led Opera Music <br /> <br /> All the actors are fine. Main actor Miguel Angel Hope is particularly suited for the film Stardom. He and other actors have some pale romantic movements. Even after 5 minutes boring is a miracle if this is the beginning and director Bell Bell Amy's audition for a romantic job. Excellent college campus in Mexico City is inspired by the architecture. The University of America is so bored (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD in this movie. Do you want to use the fast scan button? Too.
