When someone sees this movie, it really covers my mind and claims to be one of the worst paintings in there. It's not very bad, it's still not a good movie, but it's not the worst. See Death Nurse or Blood Lake, and then come back to me and say Charlie is worse. The film has good camera work and editing, which is more than I can say for most blurry films. <br /> <br /> In this movie the screen does not occur, you see his pruning in the neck, but all the other deaths are very interesting. But the absence of graphic violence on the screen is not a bad image, it's just not bad. <br /> <br /> The film is intended to not be taken seriously. At the end of the second slasher wheel came the image, so it is a reflection of the traditional slasher elements, which are made in the tongue in a cheeky way. For example, after the killing, Charlie goes to the town's 'welcome' mark and lowers the population. <br /> <br /> If you are into slasher movies, give this watch a watch exactly. It's a bit different than your normal slasher image with the possibility of two killers, but not quite. The comedy of the film is pretty much telling audiences to audiences and the film does not take a quick look at God. If you forget the picture, you will remember it. I remember this because I love that name.
