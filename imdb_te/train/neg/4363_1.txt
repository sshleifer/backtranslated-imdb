Any positives in the film are hard to come by. The producer seems to have to make a buck without much effort, so we have shown it in the entire galaxy, which is not the longest for a movie in history. Police girls were very sexy in their small uniforms. There were more action shots of the two cops & the way to go too little to the Galaxy. Of course those who are adding that budget decided to fill that wretched back and fill the place. Ms Albright makes amazing looking sexy & her first acting performance. I heard that but Ms Stubbs, which did not appear on the screen, was a favorite and did not have the primary acting talent. Apart from Ms Albright this is the real worst.
