Philip. K. Dichian film. And that's fine for that matter. Better and lesser Report (Spielberg) than paycheck (woo). But allowing it to deal with, twisting and cheating ending is a bit too much for me. Throughout the film I started to worry about such a kind of ending, and I'm sorry. But that does not mean that the film is not worth its time. It is not. The first half (already commented too) is awesome. There are some episodes that you start to suspect that the director is the most important thing in the future (we can do it on such kind of Korn SF stuff) or that it is just a combination. But there is mental disorder and also feeling "from the joint". Good.
