Heroine: In 1999 Kargil Sector, a 4 km long stretch of film, revealed enough details at Karogal Sector. Pakistani intruders crossed the LOC and entered Indian territory and Indian vengeance. If you want to know more about the story, I have suggested readers reading the news of Kargil. <br /> <br /> If you see a formula story in this movie, it will not attend. LOC Pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and lots and lots of bullets and blood. I was filled with the film hall whistles and cheers when the film was showcasing Indian bravery. <br /> <br /> Tribute to Army sacrifices and real life war heroes (4 PVC leaders respecting) have wiped out their lives so that we can see today. The film made an amazing role in the army faced by all imbalances in tough weather conditions. The disadvantages of the film are very extensive and the songs are very boring.
