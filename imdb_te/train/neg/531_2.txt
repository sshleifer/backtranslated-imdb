A cast list like this, I guess it's very good. Vanessa Redgrave spent most of the film on the bed. The best actresses in the world can not be very curious about their performance and fall asleep throughout the whole movie. The plot summary is revealed to their mother's daughters, which comes closer to their mother's death. The thing is, she never tells her nothing but cryptic advice that her daughters are happy. All the relationships in the film have evolved. I felt unnecessary back and forth between past and present. It seemed to have been stolen from the Da Vinci Code used to raise Sunflower or from The Note Book, which used the device to create end-of-embellishments of the main characters of the story. However this is a cheap device in the film. Because it did not work to create anything. This is a way to do a suspense in the film that is not available. I thought about why good films should not be written for women. It is really disappointing.
