I actually like Robin Williams in his more serious roles (eg Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The Gap according to The World). This is my favorite Robin Williams movies. But well acting, I've captured The Day, one of the worst films I've ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie (Death to Smashy, Club Paradise, and Ice on Aadadin). <br /> <Every good story is going to have it up and down. This film, however, is a giant down. I do not need a feel-good Hollywood cheese-fest, but I have anything other than 90 minutes full and totally disappointing. The movie "Love Liza" (which is actually worse) reminds me, as far as the only one in the film can see. The answer? Who cares.
