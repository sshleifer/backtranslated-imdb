If you enjoy the original SNL cast and performances, then avoid the film at all costs. This was the first time my friends came out and I waited for over an hour to go to a selling movie house. The half way through the theater is 3/4 vacant. We refuse to think it's better. When the movie ends, we are the only people left in the theater. The movie is only one day in all the theaters. In an interview with "Mr. Mike" he refused to comment on the film. The film was a joke on parts of SNL, which came out after one day's release and closed images. We tried to contact "Mr. Mike" to get a refund by phone and mail but were completely ignored.
