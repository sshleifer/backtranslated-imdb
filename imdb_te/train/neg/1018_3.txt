There was an amazing reason Edison went directly to the video: it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling dirt. The film is full length and boring. The evil people close to the acting act of Justin Timberlake are less ridiculous and less likely to be acting (thanks to Freeman and Spacias separately two weeks in subsequent films). <br /> <br /> This film is not all bad ... just too much. I showed LL Cool J as a shot with the leading figure. He deserves it. And, besides his fellow musician and co-star, he can work. Kevin Spacey is almost always enjoyable (he may see Gulp for several times as he shuts down the scene), and Freeman is capable of increasing the height of the film to three stars (from ten ... he's not good). When all is said and done, the ultimate error in the film is that it is the worldly and tiresome part of the failed pseudo-action papyakac that no one is awake. It also failed to give some good rubbish about the characters. All in all, t is just plain boring. It is said, take this rent when you are suffering from insomnia.
