The film has a boring string of scary clowns, which does not provide true cross-cultural insights. On the go, the Middle East is specifically described as annoying: clay brick villages, clay bars in the middle of the desert, black dresses and bold dancers. I am wondering how camels and date palm trees are missing in the whole movie. The personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and is rarely reliable in many cases. <br /> <br /> The original idea might be interesting, but if you are looking for cultural insights at the end of the day, you should avoid this film.
