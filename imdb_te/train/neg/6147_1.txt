I can not really get all the speech this film has received. It is a mask of mockyish, unnecessarily manipulating and many dodges of big problems - his passion for Nash's affairs and sexual relations with men in public places. I think it's tolerable in the context of the commercial Hollywood movie, but what is all praise for Russell Crowe's performance? Will the person catch his briefcase, wear a tight hat and get some good acting? Anyone who knows someone with mental health issues can understand that Crowe's performance is surreal. It's also dangerous. And, I am really grateful, on the right side of being terrible
