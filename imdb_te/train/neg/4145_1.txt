Well, I've seen this movie twice now, I have done a lot of research on net, where I have asked a number of people on the opinions. I went to the length of the original Sheridan Lafa classic 'Carmilla', a book to be based on the film. I think the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play. The book is here because the film's theme does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Lara lives in a castle in Cyborea with her father, Mr. de Lafontaine. They kept their lives happier and peaceful. One day they receive a letter from 'General', who made his mission in his life to take revenge for the death of his daughters. He argues that supernatural forces are in work and explains that he will soon visit them. Meanwhile, the chance encounter with a strange woman results in her daughter, Carmilla, Lafontaines looking for several months. Immediately Laura starts to sink through strange dreams, and begins to fall down with a strange illness. Who is this mysterious carmilla? <br /> <br /> I've found this game and I like to play as many people as possible and let me know what their results are. I also have an impressive name, and a jingle will be a lot, but I can not be bothered with it. <br /> <br /> "This film is not a sense". <br /> You will have to do the movie and try to get the full plot to explain what is going on. <br /> You need to answer these questions. <br /> Why can vampires walk in the day? <br /> Why are they lesbians? <br /> Why is a girl named Bob? <br /> When this film is in a dream, is that true? <br /> <br /> Why did the killing zombies take part in life? <br /> <br /> Travis Ponte makes a spot and a zombie flipping while driving his car. <br /> <br /> After that he learns that he is a girl, then publicly known as a vampire in his head, and runs with him in his car.
