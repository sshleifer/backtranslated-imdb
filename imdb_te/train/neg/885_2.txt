The collection is always a risky business and I think this effort should be appreciated. There is a lot of involvement here. Many talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not really enjoy this film on the three issues I had with the film. <br /> <br /> First, there are variations in the tone and quality of the sections. And unfortunately some of them are upset with others. <br /> Second, many sections are developing me. Good stories are never as long as the seeds are. I'm not talking about happy conclusions here (or one end time), but they also lose basic development or solid settings. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I did not think New York and its residents were properly shot. <br /> <br /> You still are still interested in high-faced short films, but the average viewer is dissatisfied.
