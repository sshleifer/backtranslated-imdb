Let's make the name of the film cheat on you, in fact Jake Speed's character is probably the most sensitive action hero known to the movie. Jake's speed tears do not save the girls from the evil mad, he is not often, he is relaxing. Maybe it adds to his charm, but in my opinion, an action hero is "cool" when he gets that chance. Moreover, unlike other chivalrous heroes who have an impressive list of talents, this man has no one, unless you're sleeping talent in the course. However, the film is not primarily intended, the sub-par and action of some, while some are very dull. So if you have a movie in mood for a cure in insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you - it's not just a hero to sleep himself, even with his audience.
