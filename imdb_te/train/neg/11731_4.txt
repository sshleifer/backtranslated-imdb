The worst version I've ever done since this silent version of Merry's wife. There is no sensitivity or love or spirituality about this version, it is all terrible, Germanic, bad nonsense. Reminding me to fall in love with the Nazis; <br /> <br /> This silent version of Van Stroehm is not a reliable adaptation of the original story. This one we were lusting after this silly American actress, played by Mayor Murray, with John Gilbert and his gross relative Prince have our modern permeable hairstyle and unbelievable feminist manner that threw me off again. I like my love of light and beautiful, slowly build; This is not the hardest. <br /> <br /> If you want to know the sweetness of Franz original opera, let's see the live demo of the show. Lehr. Failure, wait until TCM shows Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier sound version. It's great.
