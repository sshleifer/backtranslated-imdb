Flat, about a simple female thriller, is a woman who deceives her loved ones to increase her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays a fraudulent trace and married Daddy Andy (Bill Pullman). An old school friend of Andy's Zell Hill (Alec Baldwin) becomes a resident surgeon, the trouble is not behind him. <br /> <br /> If the script fails, the efficient, deceptive thriller, and the lack of intensity of character motivation, background and development will bring the overall performance. <br /> <br /> Poor director Harold Becker is trying to resurrect a deadly dead project, but no cast cast their interest in their shallow characters, most notably Bill Pullman, and can not entertain it. By the time that the 'secret' of the plot is revealed, you do not care. <br /> <br /> At least cinematography is good for Massachusetts. <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
