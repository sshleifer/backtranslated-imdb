<br /> When you find a movie, you feel that you are dissatisfied with the end of my life. <br /> <br /> I do not know who the film is to be made, the tigris is bored as a detective and the remaining characters are a dimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The victim Alicia (Mia Kirchner) is more of a nice girl, we may have really enjoyed seeing the unfolding of the plot and bringing justice to justice. The problem was that she was mad as the other girls, which turned out to be an opportunistic coke head from a good girl. I can not understand the moral message of this film, and the detective did not work as a story and a thriller.
