I saw Brigadon on TV last night (12 September 2009). I am 61 years old and have been looking at pictures as long as I can remember. Brigadon stands alone and is far from the worst film I have ever seen. The voices are shy. The local children's club produces better sets. The characters were wood and they probably had a dry ratt from patrons of the patrons who were unlucky to see them. The stars in the film are believed to be thick enough to protect them from the difficulties facing the film. The owners of this tripe must do great service to mankind and destroy all copies of the film.
