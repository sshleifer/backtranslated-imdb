The other day this movie is t.v, and I do not enjoy it at all. Jorge is a good comedy for the first time in the jungle, but the sequel .... completely awful. The new actor and the actress are not good at all, the main characters are not good at all they got the original actor (Brendan Fraiser) and the original actress (i forgot her name) so this movie gets from 0 to 10 ratings, one gets you to sit down and watch the movie, this is you If a rental or purchase is a picture that will be turned to or taken to another channel back to the shop. It's good to see Ape Aap back, but first, they've been a bit better then George's son grew up with new George, and still had Bredon and had to be doing that, in the film (What's On her Face)
