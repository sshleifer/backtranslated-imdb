Why do I see 1.5 hours in my life? Why is this film also made? <br /> <br /> Do I comment on this film in this review? <br /> <br /> This reviewer has endeavored to see the film, not for everyone. I do not realize who I am for this film. Probably after the hit of the acid, SOMEBODY, the drone can see and do some part of it. It's irrelevant, it's not experimental, it's plain and simple trash. This film does not have any plot, when you think you have something, well ... you can not. <br /> <br /> "I do not think I would put a spoiler here, It is not that matter, and the film will miss another in the film world.
