Lindsey Anderson is a very European filmmaker when much about Anderson's film, social commentary and subtext, featuring amazing images featuring the likes and likes of David Lean, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker. <br /> <br /> Do you know what you think of British filmmakers? If I wanted to try Pony Express, I would like to be a universal medium of cinema, I would like to be a universal medium of cinema (in my opinion makes the best Brit film for Hollywood makers), pretentious and very set in 1960. The year of love of the summer and the year of student rebellion in France. You can imagine every French leftist admire the film, especially the climax. French New Wave Filmmakers also worship abstract surrealism of some scenes, but it does not like the main international game and many people do not like it
