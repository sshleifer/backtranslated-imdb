It should be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm at the age of 64 and is a football fan. I wanted to see a football movie. I was surprised to see how about 10 minutes of it, such a bad movie (specifically acting) in a theater. By half the way, it is terrific to my husband and explained to me the facts behind the film. While I was a little afraid when I was preaching in a movie theater (they could see some who are not Christian though they are not Christian), this is not a big deal. Nevertheless, it is the quality of acting for such an imaginary and unrealistic behavior and more. It is the perfect film for a church outing but is displayed in a church auditorium rather than a theater. Should i go to church Yes. Would you like to go to church when I attend a movie? No. Do I recommend this film? Not sure !!!
