Try to bring Roy Rogers and company life back to "SinTown" - a ghost town that booms if silver mines succeed. Andy Davin (as "cookie") slapsticks around. Jane Froze (as Carol), Mr. Rogers loses her bitches to the sharp leer. Foul wilding and the riders of the purple sage stand-in (or, dairy-in?) For A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and The Sons of the Pioneers. James Finelson (from Laurel and Hardy's movies) adds to the "chappoptic" look of "Grand Canyon Trail". A loose floor board presents the winner comedy show. Mr. Devin's kiss kicks its heels. There are also powerful human performances - but the material is not grandma. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Whitney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazie, Andy Divine
