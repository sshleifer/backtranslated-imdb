I feel my responsibility as a lover of horror films to warm up other people about this horrible and very bad "horror" film. Do not waste your time or money in the film, the acting is fine, the story is coming around and the script is just awful. Nothing is good about it, why am I thinking of you and I'm seeing this trash. This plot has a lot of holes and they are not clear at all, it's so bad, I do not know how terrible I've created. As I mentioned before I loved horror movies, I gave up, it's a 18, but you see a little bit of blood and no fears or fluctuations. How did the intellectuals in the film have no words for the heroes like kissing brothers and kissing? I can say. Just do not bother, there are so many great horror paintings, it's too small to not waste your time life.
