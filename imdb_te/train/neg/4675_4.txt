"Washington Square" is a flat and torn adaptation of Henry James's short novel. In fact, the novel is very good, but far from James's artwork. Moreover, its simple, non-incident story did not make a film (with William Wyler, his "The Heires", given in a beautiful version of the novel in 1949). <br /> <br /> However, the film is completely cheated by the spirit of the great American author's soul. In the novel, Catherine Catherine is not very attractive and somewhat clumsy, yet she is a sound, intelligent young woman, and it's not as simple as it seems. Her attachment to her father is respectful, dignified, and there are no drugs. In the film's three, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Lee) is merely a bad and bad thing. In the last quarter, she suddenly (and incredibly) intellectual, learns about her dignity as a woman, and everything. <br /> <br /> Director Agnieszka Holland added two fabulous scenes to the story. First, when the nervous child Catherine was, well, she had problems with vesica. The second scene, when looking in the background, is a sort of open slavery, hooked hunters carrying behind the parentes, and so on. Nothing contradicts Henry James's soul and artistic ideals. The writer is also very polite and confusing for the standards of the Victorian era. I refused anyone to stay anywhere in thousands of James's huge literary production. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the director needs reasonable freedom in the adaptation of a novel. But if the director is completely ignorant of the author (or Henry James) or misunderstood, I can not see his work to do bad work. <br /> <br /> Acting fine and flat: Acting fits this film despite the talents of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely a non-recommendable film.
