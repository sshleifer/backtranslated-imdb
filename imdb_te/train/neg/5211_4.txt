Ha. Without a doubt, Tommy is one of the worst here. I do not know why, but for some reason, small children come across small buttocks in horror films. And because they are children, they will not die. Because they're annoying ... well .. except for the shelter of terror. <br /> <br /> All in the cinema. Can not find this movie on DVD? You can definitely do that! All you have to do is buy the cooling classic DVD pack! You only get metamorphosis on DVD for $ 15, but you also get 49 other movies! No bargain! pff. As well. I made statements for these cheesy movies. <br /> We have a chemist scientist. Yes. This guy makes all the chemists look pretty in the role of Peter. He is trying to come out with a serpent to stop the deterioration of the body. He wants to remove the plug in his project of college, so he tries himself. But because it is a horror film, he increases the incredible long change that it sucks and starts and takes about 3/4 of the film. <br /> <br /> The movie Out Pad is a son who he gets into a relationship with some woman. And she did not marry! Scandalous! But of course Tommy is one of the most irritating characters .... I'll take it back. He is a very irritating character. He was far worse than an old disabled person who was in the hospital when he was in the hospital and had taken over the glots on him. <br /> <br /> So by accident he may begin to kill some of the visions until Peter finds himself doing and killing everyone in his way to return to the normal path. He eventually becomes a lizard. Yes, I do not ask you. The end does not really make any sense. <br /> If we're really hoping for a better payment, we're not able to get it. <br /> <br /> It's not a horrific film .... It's just a frustrating payment that's not good. If you already have 50 movie packs, if it's in your list, you're not for a snooper, but you're not even for a great movie. Just sit and relax, eat too much snack food. This image does not go out of your skin anytime soon. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis gets 10 plastic lizard heads.
