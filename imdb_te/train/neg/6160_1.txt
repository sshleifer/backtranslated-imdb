I can not say this is a bad image. Unfortunately, for me, I feel more familiar with fanning, the fact that it is totally irrelevant is worse. I'm fencing since I was 14 years old, and this film is very poorly painted. F. Murray is a good man (and has some fencing background), but many of the other actors - especially students - lose.
