Spoilers ... if such a thing is possible .... . . . . . As Robin Williams fan, I thought it would be the first time on screen in this movie. Wow ... I can not imagine a more brain-numbing picture. In particular, the film will tell you after your bad Artie dinner and take a bad joke after another that is dramatic for them. <br /> <br /> Robert Williams is a lawyer in a 30-second sketch. <br /> <br /> I'm for body humor, but this comedy is not fun or unpleasant ... it is mind-numbing. The film does not have any eloquent qualities for the film, except for those who like Robin Williams, who like every part of the film.
