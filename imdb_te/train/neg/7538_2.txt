I saw this movie because I liked Nicolas Cage, it was fantastically and totally absurd ... I decided to get around quite a bit and got my hands on a copy of its 70 copies. Wow. What is the difference. The original one is way better. Whether you know that I originally made a statement, it had existence. In fact, the Christian public has expressed their fears about paganism. If you dig it deeply, it will comment on life but if I'm disappointed, do not want to go to the details, you're disappointed and want to know how you look. 70 version, dated slightly, but very good.
