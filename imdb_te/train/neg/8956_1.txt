The prequel, which was disappointing for the first two films, has one or both interest in second suspense. By concentrating on the 'running' guys in Cube, it basically leaves no feelings of tension within the cube, because we can not care for the characters inside. The image is very boring, and it just becomes really terrible with the introduction of glass eyes superior and green eye crazy sea contact. After that, however, it just descends into the over-the-top random pleasure. Even though the conclusion is complete, it will be returned to the first in an indirect way. The script is terrible, fine acting, and direction not impressive. Less follow up.
