"Fred Claus" might someday become something like "Santa Claus" by at least a bit more amusing moments than Tim Allen starring, but it does not mean it's going to be enough for a theater tour. <br /> <br /> When going to holiday movies, it is creative and sentimental. But in reality, "Fred Claws" can be anxious to one of the most powerful of David Dabkin ("Shanghai Knights," "The Wedding Crassers") in the power, a line between a bored Vince Vaughn vehicle and a mess Christmas. And finally, it's not very much for both. <br /> <br /> With the cast of Paul Giamitti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz, and Kathy Bates, it becomes more discouraging. <br /> <br /> Vaughn Fred, Nick's (Jiamatti) old and split brother had been to his parents (Bets and Trevor Peacock) for a while and got his favorite sympathy for his parents at some point. When Nick becomes a Yolede-Jared Repo Man in a hard-faced Chicago-encounter with his girlfriend, Santa Claus (and voice over tells us, when you become a saint, you spend time on yourself and your family) <br /> <br /> He stumbles on the law And his younger brother (who was at least a decade older than him) was released from prison To. Nick agrees to help in the toy-wrapping business at the North Pole, but agrees. Fred reluctantly agrees, though Santa and Elves are constantly cheering the entire Arctic missions, while checking his hateful clashes and efficiency expert (spicy toy factory) factory operations. /> <br /> The film has its movements, but the thickness of the running is spread over them in its time period. <br /> <br /> In the midst of Christmas film clippings piles, "Elf", and the efforts made in jail are as sweet as last year's fruit cake. <br /> <br /> Wagon, as always, brings his coarse charm to the table, but Don Fogelman's stuttering script really keeps him from doing his job. Under the bad fat suit, Xiamatti brings a pleasant old attraction to his iconic role, but unfortunately Fred has had a second sonata. <br /> Finally, "Fred Claus" can lead to an unforgettable film. Sure, there are bad ways to start the season at the cinema, but there are definitely very good ways.
