Wow! Should anyone continue to do so many Ranjith films? Half past dead is a bad movie but at least got an idea of ​​what it wants to be. The HPD2 has no clue what it wants to do. This is on the screen for reasons I do not explain. Spoiler: The whole film is: Twitch (played by Tha Dogg Pound Kurupt) is transferred to another jail where a golden brick can be buried. In jail, a riot is erupted between rival prisoners, one of whom runs out of cortez and cartes. During a suspicious tour, Tchchitch's fiancé and Burkes (played by Bill Goldberg) were kidnapped by Cortez, and placed in a hanging room. Burke reluctantly relates to Tritch and when they find Cortez their loved ones, they are facing difficulties with the idiot prisoners. <br /> <br /> This is a very unnecessary sequel from Universal Solzer: The Return. The script is terrible, acting is horrific, dialogue is a joke and everyone in this movie is a sarcastic. Look, I know the low budget movie but these guys are not an excuse not to put effort into what they do. In this "movie" no one believes in the roles they are playing. No one cares about the movie. Kurup wants to be ashamed of himself. His character "Twitch" is a spineless minimalist puppet that spends most of his time joking through Burke or other prisoners. Bill Goldberg spends a lot of time sulking across the film he had to take out of PHD (pretty heavy dump). The scenes with poorly choreographed and curiosity and action movie HPD2 action is also pretty boring! Anyone who tells you that this film is a bit better. This is the main reason people are hating Follywood.
