I did not expect to meet the combination of Sida and Period about Ada Lovelace, Computer History, Charles Babbage, these films were disappointing with a mixture of nonsense pseudoscience and true and fantastic history. It gives the impression that its writer (Lynn Heshammann-Lyson) does not have a true understanding of the subject of the mantra, technology or history of the film, but is working on it with vague artistic opinions. I was confused with the art of jokes and misused the science rules and ideas for confusion, eg Emmy Coeur: "Information Waves Half-Life", Ada: "I can not say half life is better than life." <br /> <br /> The film is a fun and fun - it is misunderstood. The only ransom value I can imagine attracts the viewer to find out what it is most distorting. This is very likely to encourage the superstitious understanding of any science and technology that is growing inseparable from magic.
