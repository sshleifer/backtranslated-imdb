After purchasing the DVD in Bargain Bin, I saw it all in the DVD player and looked good because of the impressive amount of features listed on the cover. Nice animated menus and extra features are a whole lot ... But when I play the movie, let's down. It's a bad thing I've seen and some bad movies in my time. The film, which is appreciated at IMDB, comes from the people who actually made the film. So do not waste your money if you do not want to waste it!
