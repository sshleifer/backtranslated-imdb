I watched the interview with Rob Schneider (Marvin meen plays a major role in this movie). Here he wanted to emphasize the physical comedy, as if you're getting the volume turned out as if you're smiling. Clearly that should be the secret. I turned the volume up. <br /> <br /> I listened to this and thought it was a disaster - completely disgusting after Snyder's gigantic performance. <br /> <br /> The story is stupid: a mad scientist named Michael Wright (Michael Cotton) begins to lose control of the main loser and his "animal instincts" who dreams of becoming a policeman filled with some part of the animal exchange after a car accident . "It makes him" supercup ", he can secrets hidden in the body cavities and removes the horses.Although there is a nasty habit of eating people's cows and trying to deceive their goats, but is it a small cost to pay? <br /> < The cast was dropped as long as it was all in Hollywood than John McGinny Sige, commander of Mage on Police, repugnantly cartoon character (the same as his doctor's character in the very popular TV series "Scrubs") I had the first "serious" acting job in Colleen Haskell's in this film Any "serious?") She became her first "Survivor" as her competitor and was known to us from her About ani Here is proof: a button she was beautiful. She was here to prove that natinatudiga is no obvious talent. And what annerto Ed Wilson is the chief of police. I mean, how old is this guy now? He tried to eat some of the cows we eat, and he came out of the way through the whole way. He was amazed by the filming. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I chuck twice: Mage is playing with his majestic dolls in his police car, and the scene with Schneider Haskell and Orongutan - Orangutan has more acting talent! So, for two chuckles - 2/10.
