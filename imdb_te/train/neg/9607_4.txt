Do not listen to the mischievous title "Werewolf Woman". Europeans focus on sex and nudity on real horrors in their horror films, but here is a bit too high. The title role of "Werewolff Woman" seems to be an immaculate sex scene traced with the killing of his partner crazy and brutally. Fun first few times, but this one hundred minutes quickly becomes very monotonous. Schiff is chick, but its ancestor was executed for lycotherapy. The film repeatedly misuse and torture the thriller in a poor role of the film, which is ten minutes (flashback), a legitimate superhuman horror (after which I thought for the worst classic). In the end, the director insisted that this would be based on a true story. Yes, that's right. <br /> <br /> In order to be fun, there are some entertaining elements of the product. The title has a form of Woddle's woman and has some nice gore effects and nude scenes. However, these have become rapidly unchanged. Moreover, the dubbing dialogue is especially delighted at the most swinging doctor in the world (he's a job) at Camp Fashion. Unfortunately, the picture becomes very rampant. There is really no real plot or anything. This is an insult to read the description that I thought the film had some realistic potential. "Werewolf Woman" is overlapping, slowly moving, and a bit too nonsense, even by the scales of the exploitative style. (4/10)
