One original, extreme, edge-of-your-seat, scary, gore-fest, and filmmaker Eli Roth and his team made with "Cabin Fever" and just like a starring one is a major difference. The film will bring five college graduates to the Cabin, which begins to prove fatal after the other capitulation of this mysterious, fast, acting-meat-eating disease. Friends are not so long before turning around, and can not see each other, the same is similar in the same way. It's a specific spark behind the basic premise of this film that is working, at the hands of a lesser self-confidence filmmaker, as it sounds all sounds. Unfortunately, the only intention was to make it look pretty, initially a very unpleasant script, an annoying script, and less induced subplots (in one case) than Rhoth directed by many incomprehensible to leave the viewer out of the audience. Making Sloppy Film in many ways! Avoid devourer this time.
