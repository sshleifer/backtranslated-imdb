So you can read some comments posted on this image, and you may be thinking, "Hugh was a group of revive reviews posted on December 30th." The sound of this Ravens Review is a very funny thing as they come from the same person or from the best, small, coordinating group of "open house" groups. True, my friends, this film is not really worth watching. It is "independent" because it does not get a free pass. Make sure that your actors can sing (b) your stars in a movie or playground on Broadway or in the local community playhouse. , (c.) You have good sound equipment, (d.) You have a well written score (e.g.) you have witty and graceful songs. Even Anthony's rap is not saved by this one. This is one of those unfortunate films that I felt deeply troubled by everybody involved.
