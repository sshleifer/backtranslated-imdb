Well, I have seen all the movies dealing with witches and vulgarities, but this is simply unrealistic. The film is actually a bad act by the witches who led the Orson Welles, who did not play a role as a satist. But anyway, coven takes a new member, prevents a toy similar to anyone and she does have an abortion. The woman who has a miscarriage and her husband goes into a place called Lilith, and at the same time when she sees her sister's image or calls her out and does not use her powers or dies or she dies. After they settled in strange town finds that all the inhabitants of the couple are all witches and she is nosy and her neighbors and friends are all afraid. Then suddenly disapears (that's creepy) as well as he asks the lady to help bring back that finds a funeral taking place on a hill that has seen a small boy belonging to Orson Welles at Playgroud then strange things begin to happen life. The girl tries to escape from the town, but its residents and powers are looking for her to catch her and ignoring everything she's trying to warn her about her soul. The film is good, it has moments of suspense, but it's much better than that of Orson.
