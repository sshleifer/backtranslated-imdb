<br /> <br /> Agra does not see every Bollywood movie, but tells me my imagination. <br /> <br /> This is a suicide on behalf of the director of the artistic initiative of the film, and I believe it is successful in his mission. <br /> <br /> The actor does not share the movie with the same billing on the list outside the movie. <br/> <br/> <br /> The director of this film should not be banned. Cinematographer, he appears to be playing for an amateur home film producer of the annual award. There is a dramatic score expected to take to the next scene. The lighting man holding a hand cigarette and light bulb on the other side of the pole, and the cigarette burning flames hope to add a much needed light to each scene. And, of course, actors! Some of them were not new, but the rest were forgiven. A group of actors were all set to promote India's most beloved film, the re-design of 'Sholay' to promote new start and size. Do not forget that these actors can not force the film, are they a high and enthusiastic public expectation of letting the A-list and some of the preferred participants, let's face? So it prays to the question, next to Amitabh (for now), does not other actors really believe that their performances have tried better? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that in this disappearance of the film, people in his inability to remember his conversation? It should not be stupid, it is not really, it is a performance for the people who have negotiated with how much money the actors will drive. <br /> <br /> The fact that everyone I participated is a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film, which only succeeds in contaminating everyone's mind when they see the reality.
