Maggie Smith, very young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov - was excited to discover this late Sixties comedy when my favorite people were staring at some. My disappointment did not work as a comedy or a perfect harlist film. Ustinov plays a little time curve from prison where he sets up his sites with a large American corporation located in London. His acclaim with CEO Carl Malden and Tech Geek Newhart, Ustinov, is going to become a computer expert and will soon plan the film's perfect heist piece. To do this he had to obtain a security criterion that would protect the corporation mainframe. And here's one problem. His definite plan works only because the film is reliable and stupid for everyone. His bloated excuses are taken at face value and it should be computer center anywhere without video cameras. The second problem is that the hest (really cheat) takes place within the first 30 minutes of dramatic tension. Maggie Smith is sadly miscast like Ustinov's ditsy-next-door neighbor / secretary who can not do a job. I love Maggie Smith but she looks very much here, sitting very, this episode is more of an absurd, physical comedian. Moreover, Ustinov and Smith did not have any chemistry together, perhaps the age difference, but then the romantic relationship, the original romance and the little creepy. Ustinov co-wrote the script, and it was well thought out at the time, but I found unfunny, meandering and great cast found sad waste.
