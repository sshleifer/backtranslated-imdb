How high school girls headline can also be on this site, this is a movie I've seen, it's ridiculous, no moron sits there and a movie I've never heard of you, I've gone behind you and gone "boo" and you'll jump , But the film I do not mean to be deserving of writing or directing, "is the end of the week Not all of the same ", it is not a good reason to get a picture well. If they do not tie everything together then there will be no sort of image, I guess it does not make the whole movie, it is not the whole picture. So basically this idiot girl has complimented them to complete the film, well I have a high standard of love how today's youth is having media and production companies. The political system of this country can get away with what they want, the idiots that come in our country, this girl actually leads to some day, it's a horror idea. Get a life and see a real movie for a while, try it in a Shawshank Redemption or Waterfront, or something like that, and do not comment on it as "boring", it's a little bit.
