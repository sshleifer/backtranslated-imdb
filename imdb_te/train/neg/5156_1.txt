The tag says "Laughter is the state of mind", and I'm excited to comment on Barry Levinson. What is he thinking in the preparation of "Toys"? When he saw the rush, he saw a successful, funny fantasy? If so, he is working on a different plane than I do. This is a lovely picture, which is 90% of the product design (and cartoon colors are also upset). Robin Williams and (especially) Joan Cusack's brother and sister were insulted as brothers, and their father passed away the factory after his death. There is nothing remotely funny (satirical or choppy-wise) at the show. It is one of the worst "big" films uniformly pulled, ugly, and ever made. **** from stars
