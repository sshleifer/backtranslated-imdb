Not entirely off the wall in a good way, but just stupid completely. "Killer Tang" is a science fiction, horror and ludicrous ridiculous mixture. This is equivalent to a foolish and totally absurd image. There is very little dialogue, mainly the script, if one, is the full "pond scum". I can not call it strange, just like "total nonsense". Undoubtedly the film is perfect, and you are alerted. There is no reason to waste time at this point, and if you do, the burden smell will linger like a rotten fish .......................... ..... ................................ MERK
