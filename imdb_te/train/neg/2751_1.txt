I hate to waste time when I write 10 horrible lines. Lunky is that Huang-ray Shim is a capital crime, or that he will be killed twice for this disaster writing and directing. I'm amazed that this movie has a $ 75m budget, but in reality it's a fantastic flop, that Shim hopefully, to make the rest of the life of another film and, therefore, no waste of time for most artists. <br /> I think the actors should be together. Now he was harassing him. <br /> <br /> You can make a great movie with this budget with the available resources available to them. As always, the failure appeared initially with a terrible script and story. "Transformers" is another visual dinner with a weak script, but it looks like "Citizen Kane".
