I tried to see this film in a military show in a foreign event, let me see any of those situations. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes have set the tone through the weak romantic-film quality acting, the outward blue blue tales and the unbelievable conditions and behavior. It comes worse later. The film is not the only one to save, and it's not as bad as it's funny to see. It's just terrible. I saw a lot of movies in my life and not all the criticisms that I know of that snobby, I'm bad and even enjoy some of the movies. <br /> For this guy, my friend _well_
