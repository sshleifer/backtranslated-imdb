Over the past 10 years, I have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling companies, running many wrestlers (including 2 backyard wrestling stars), working on 2 different wrestling TV shows and voice-overs and commentary for many wrestling DVDs. I have never seen the quality of the stupidity, skill and skill of continuous quality and the quality of quality that has been published in Rampage Wrestling. The misuse of the term is to list this list as a kind of wrestling video. Filmed with low-dollar video cameras, which are the main videos of children playing in the back yards. The sound quality is bad, the video quality is bad, and the acting is horrific. The "wrestler" wear temporary dresses with hand-drawn t-shirts and ski masks and tries to touch each other with different objects and mimic wrestling moves. Sometimes the "matches" are on the grass. Sometimes on a yard trampoline. All of the wrestling skill's lack of shamelessness is all poorly handled and executed. In short, do not bother with this stinker. If your interest on this DVD is entertainment or educational (both in my case), you will be disappointed.
