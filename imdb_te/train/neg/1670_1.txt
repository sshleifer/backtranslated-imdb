<br /> <br /> When this film starts, a terrible opening scene is set to be the C type size fiction TV. Image. It's a big star trek and a bit X-files, but it's more than anything of boring. <br /> <br /> Acting on the film is imaginative and cliche. It looks like a 2-peter in a bad sized fiction TV series. No suspense and no thrills, but for the lack of trying. There are a lot of speculative dramatic differences between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
