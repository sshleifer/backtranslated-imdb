The film is boring, the characters and scenes are dubious, unbelievable, action is hilarious. This movie is a big mess. When the action kicks in music, run almost impressive stunt. Either known as Mr. McGregor or Steven, and changed his voice. There is a lot more dialogue in this movie, very bad acting on behalf of everyone. The film is a great sleep treatment. The fight is ridiculous. Effect of eye shape change on nasty designer drug addicts is good. The main villain is a joke and his character is poorly developed. The main villain was used to explain the story through the investigation, who simply dismissed random plots, such as "spraying" CTX (his designer medicine) in water supply. Again in the cinema. The film was highly successful.
