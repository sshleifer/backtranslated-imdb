Tyrannosaurus Azteca In the sixteenth century, the famous Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes (Ian Jearing) entered Mexico, where six of his best men, including Lieutenant Ríos (Marco Sanzes), also had some gold stolen when they came to Spanish and possibly. In minutes they had the first sight of local Aztec brutality, and later Cortes & his men were captured and imprisoned. <br /> <br /> If you are not good enough then it's a couple of Tyrannosaurus Rex lives there & Natives like to eat locals in trying to win their lives Spanish offer to help get rid of their monster problem, but various hidden agendas <br /> <br /> Directed by Brian Trehanpard-Smith , My whole time favorite robbery movies shoot turkey (1982) Azta   క్ రెక్స్ (స్పెషల్ టైర్నోసారస్ అజ్టెక్కా అనేది ఒక అసలైన టైటిల్ వంటిది, అది టైటిల్ను ఉపయోగించినప్పుడు సైన్స్ ఫిక్షన్ ఛానల్ ద్వారా మార్చబడింది. విదేశీ చిత్రం) ఈ ఇంకా మరొక ఇడియట్ & చౌకగా చూస్తున్న సైన్స్ ఫిక్షన్ ఛానల్ 'జీవి ఫీచర్' & మీరు నిజంగా తెలుసుకోవాలి అన్ని ఉంది. Although the Tiannosaurus Aztecs are still a merely a 'organism feature', some people are running a monster from poor CGI computer graphic, although based on the real Spanish coaxestador Cortes during his trip to Mexico and the film around does not strive for absolutely historical accuracy Some people Tulu. Although there are regular cliches here, there are the usual underground pieces of the character, stupid decisions & selfish one, heroic one, backstabbing one, just eat the upper-left victim & the pretty woman is easy to find & all here. The film is speculative, crazy, dull & really entertaining at any level but if that sort of thing you're interested in it is one or two half good moments of Gore. <br /> The story is not very good, there are too many holes, it's sort of a completely forgotten film in a few days. <br /> <br /> Now that I've seen & sci-fi channel 'creature features' & typically CGI computer effects are terrible, the Tyrannosaurus Aztec does not perfectly match the trend, but there are some shots that show some effects, but they usually bite directly after the gruesome effects . There are some good gore effects, there is a cut-out heart, a person's leg is bite off, some blood splatter, he saw some of the cool shot of a man leaving his own intestines after the invasion of dinosaurs, dead bodies & someone stabbed with a knife . T-Rex also gets a lot of people to eat. Product values ​​are really cheap, one of the attractions that is made from the Aztec set stereo-foam and the Spanish men should be imprisoned in cinematic history, keeping the fence less than one man's waist. <br /> <br /> With a budget of $ 900,000 I could not see where the money was, and I shot in Oahu in Hawaii. Days. <br /> <br /> The basic ad is basically sufficient on whether or not the Tyrannosaurus Aztec is truly 'not the best' than any other cheap sized fiction channel, but it is almost as interesting & exceptional as whether you will appreciate or not.
