Absolutely no Saturday morning TV's kids' show has always been poor. After all, the producers should count the audience coming back. Well, in this terrible submission, they at least count the money they save on sets. The script may have been rejected by some long-forgotten space opera serials, and some sensitive lines for cool slad Gerald Mohrar to melt Naura Hayden. No director has been able to do better with such a paradoxical storyline, so that action is just as ineffective. Space accessories are inappropriate - a Bulowa wall clock and portable typewriter, for example - but the grid settings are the worst in the history of film. Most raw drawings, and all of which are often mistakenly mistaken in red light. Even mohar's bare hairy breasts are used as a prop. And it's bad - the plot is the rib. Any viewer able to make the end of this film can hear a message from Martians - and it totally accepts!
