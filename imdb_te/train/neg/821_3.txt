Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and attends two main points: action and thrills. Domino Principal Jenie Hackman is shot from prison, which helps to do some mysterious work. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallk are his activists --- they probably work for the government, but the storyline of the movie is not clear. Hackman asks a lot of questions that do not answer, so the film goes completely. While working as a night cycle and parallax scene, the Domino Principle combines confusion and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is well photographed and works on it. Kramer's direction is not in any style. This is a very sunny picture! <br /> <br /> It's nice to have a Hackman cast. Widmark and Wallach were worse as evil and Albert Well as Widmark's cruel ducks. Even the typically bad Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's sidekick. Candidas Bergen's actors were hilarious as Hackman's wife. We seem to have completed her jail time and she is trying to put some sort of souvenir in the South Booth. Grammer's idea of ​​her trace looks worse and she rarely wears a wheat wig. It is better suited to the likes of Valerie Prínin or Susan Tyrell.
