There is no reason to see this film. A good plot idea deals very badly. Everything changes in the middle of the picture and makes little sense of nothing from there. The reason for murders is unclear. Acting was terrible. Nick Stall clearly needs a good director. He is wonderful in bed, but here he is terrible. Buffer's Amber Benson must change her role someday. You are also disappointed with the gratuitous sexuality and violence. Although the film is 80 minutes, this is a very good movie (but not too long), there are no deleted scenes on DVD, that is, they never bother to fill in the missing parts. /> <br /> This does not cost a time.
