It's hands down the worst picture of all the time. The combination of Hupie Goldberg (the worst actress / man in history) and the dinosaurs spoken by al-Jar-jar-binks are a combination of a painful badge. This is a simple description. This movie is not worth watching. For God's love, do not look at this picture.
