A model named Laura works in South America, kidnapped by a gang from a hotel room and taken into the forest. She demands a huge redemption for her release. Peter was hired to stay safe for his home and if he could bring the money to the girl as well, he had a bonus. Peter's friend takes Jack through the helicopter with the jack. They try to give the duplicate money to Lara instead of kidnapped but the plan goes terribly wrong and they will be bail out in the helicopter. The helicopter is shot and they also have bail (so far not going well). Forests are also damaged. Its just a naked black person in reality weirdly big eyes and breathing problem. He starts to kill some kidnappers and Lara is caught up with some evidence of avoiding him. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not a fan of Jess Franco, I'm the only film I have ever seen, but I can say that this is not really one of his best efforts. Movies are dragged along at all slow pace without taking place at all. The whole thing may be very easily edited on a 25 minute TV show. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is lit poorly (I'm shining out of it all), badly dubbed, poorly acted and slower yet for some reason it does not bore me. I think this is the main reason for it is some of the ridiculous bad sights. For example, in the scene where Lara's street walks were apparently fired at a real street, it avoided shooting people's groups directly at the camera. One of the gang of another funny scene was killed, one of his friends hanged in a tree where he was as busy as he was seen as a minute. Then the man on the head of the head beats the person below him without any reason. It is to be seen in belief. Then there is actually a real ghost. Although it is a very naked black person, he is very obscure, despite his heavy eyes. <br /> <br /> The film was hooked on the part of the nasty horrors in the UK in the 80s and is prohibited. Now I have no idea. There is very little gore at all and it is rarely a surprise movie. Minus nakedness says I was almost away with a PG. <br /> The only thing I can think of is that it has never been seen and the word is added to the original list. <br /> <br /> You do not have much reason to watch this movie Jess Franco Fan. There is plenty of nudity to fall asleep and you have a good laugh at some of the very bad ones, but other wisdom will tell me that I'm going to pay ticket for South America and lose it in a forest. It is very fun. <br /> <br />
