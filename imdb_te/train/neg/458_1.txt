What's this worst? My little cousin took over this apparently overly exotic girl's DVD art and title ... I decided to look with her because she was not bored, and I was absolutely scared with the terrible quality. <br /> <br / First, the acting is terrible. They appear as enthusiastic actresses who read cue cards. Delivery Sub par and most formula. <br /> <br /> Second, jokes and stereotypes are not original or better, and again the principle. I can not calculate the amount of time I can predict the next joke. I had some chuckles from the "subtle" sexual experience. The Cat, the Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? Simone! Just stay away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not even stupid-funny. It's stupid-stupid. This is a PG children's picture with unnecessary sexual contact, pornography and violence to close the MPAA rating. <br /> <br /> "Do you want to travel in my boat?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> The blood on my stool was hit!
