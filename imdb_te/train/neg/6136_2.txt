Buck's role in the role of Kahn is run as a country where Bob Barker (The Price's right) runs his show. But this turkey is too much to chick and snart. Kurt Thomas exhibits some significant acrobatics as "hero" facing the infants, but does not tell the acting talent. There are some spooky moments (mostly in the Village of Crisis), and some lightweight impressive martial arts scenes. But any "ninja" movie gives you more fun, and you feel guilty about laughing.
