Gee, it's a sweet picture! I'm afraid of people about "grudge". The director is playing a trick (I have to confess a good man who brought me a very sweet life), then it will be repeated for the rest of the film again. Consequently, I was scared of the film in the first quarter, but once I fell asleep in the grill. Ends, I can say that the so-called "ring" that was called before was very terrible and started to be a waste of money to buy a ticket for "grudge", there are very good movies.
