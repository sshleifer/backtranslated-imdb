I say that the movie is at least meaning, but it's bad. For the most part acting is not good (I think only Sky has shown no promise) and you feel awkward watching it. All of the scenes that should be meaningful are really inspiring, as Ng comes out when his parents come out. The kanji tattoo on the skies side, the magic in the refrigerator and the sets of the god in the sets of sets ... and music ... and clothes .. and everything. Real Life is never in this film. The boy said at one time "I'm gay, not corny." And do not know. Even the commentary is awful, I turn off it following the Ng Conversations on how she weirded out a lesbian play.
