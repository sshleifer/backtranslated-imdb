The "True" story of the last monster that appears when contaminated by an American industrial factory. It's fun, but not good, the monster has a lot of people trying to get a monster and not fully participating, but what's going to happen. Give us points specifically designed to scale for some scenes but giving it a big monster that takes away some of it looks like a non-intimidating puppy. An entertaining exploitative image is happy to be happy in the right frame of mind. (My complaint is that the print used in the Elvira release is poorly found, which appears to be a major copy of its predefined well-worn video tape 20 years ago.)
