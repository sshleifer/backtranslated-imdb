Person has designed a lot of title for a group of movies and one day he does not expect me to speak; I will choose a cheap scenario, try to keep the title of most of it (after all I'm a title designer) and try to persuade people that it is actually a movie. Even worse I've seen it too. <br /> <br /> If you have a desire to see good titles, watch some posters do not waste your time watching this time. <br /> This is quite a contradiction, do you see the poster? Almost none of the title work is part of his project!
