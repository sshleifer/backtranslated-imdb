A well-known show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly, she kills and an aging fled when a heart attack. The female murderer is the name of the murderer. She still goes to school and works for an evil criminal Akai who sleeps with her. <br /> <br /> Even big anime fans will have to admit that this is a vicious action thriller. Gorgeous gore fest. It has a "Kite" style, but it is still worse. The unusual plot of killing people as a murderer makes a frightening and touching attempt at the same time, causing it to fall on the face in the story. One of the headlines is good and bad when the heroine Sawa falls in with a bodyguard from a building, yet the dramatic shape is not good and the character's faces is the awkward and grotesque animations of director Yasumi Umetsu. Simply, the mourning scenes are just creepy. <br /> Grade: 3/10
