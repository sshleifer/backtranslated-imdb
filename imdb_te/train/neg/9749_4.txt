Professor Paul Steiner is researching material transformation. He developed a machine to create a wrist watch or a disappearance of rodent, only to return to another area. But those at his research facilities do not like or approve his experiments and do whatever he does to see that he is unsuccessful. After a failed display that saved his funds, Professor Steiner decides to test his machine. As expected, things get terribly wrong and he will transform into a frightened madman that he will just kill the touch. <br /> <br /> In understanding, the same week I saw The Fly, Return of the Fly, and Curse of the Fly. There are so many films about the impact of material and the effects of influential horrors on the human body that can face a person within three or four days. I do not know who is responsible for the cinematic roster for the subject of the project for the project man, but most of them are similar to fly films, it's not just coincidence. <br /> <br /> Previously, I have a big problem with Bryant Holiday in the lead role . He was a horse's ass, only when I did not care about his suffering, I was actually the source for it. Supporting actors Mary Peach and Ronald Allen are almost bad. They're tough and dull. In fact, there is very little excitement when looking at Project Man. Soundtrack ?? Not too memorable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I saw The Prozaged Man using the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode copy. The most accurate, most frequent, poor movie is the good MST3K riffs, which are nearly touching their marks at the audience, and I'm very excited to give my MST3K rating a 4/5.
