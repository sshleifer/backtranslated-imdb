This is a very old and cheaply built movie - a simple low-budget B-Western in many ways. Gary Cooper is not yet a star and the movie is the most memorable of John Wayne's first films made for the "poverty line" studios. Actors, their familiar style and personality are not yet fully formed. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper's incarnation does not appear to be exactly a few years after Cooper (he speaks fast with other things in this early film). <br /> However, this age, other than the average B-film, has some interesting aspects of the film (though not good). If you ever want to see a woman married Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita is a very odd casting choice for female stars who love interest and she has a massive accent (she is French) and is not too close to being too "movie star". Incidentally, she was married to director Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> From the 1930s like Brookebaugh Mountain (and I thought this is a new idea), but for me, the film's most memorable and unnatural element seemingly gay subplot. Gary Cooper's character was hated by women, and women grew up with each other who could do many pictures to keep Cooper clear. This tyranny does not necessarily require much, but there are many evidence that filmmakers are really trying to portray themselves as gay. In the end, especially when one of them was killed, the other was shot with an arrow, circling his father on the body and then surrounding him with his hands! This is pretty exciting stuff for the time and I think this makes this dull image really charming today! The film is a bit of a bit of bit and a lot of skill until Cooper and the plot is gone. Unless you are familiar with Dmity or about homosexuals, find yourself in a favor and a good Western.
