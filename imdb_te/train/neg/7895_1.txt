I think the Germans smirking is funny (just mumbling the Americans sexy and just women who work with English accents). I had to cover my eyes whenever I was on the screen. One of those housewives hacks Heads corporate mainframe stories, cheating a bank that connects some random keys of his home to a power socket. The director apparently loves the big celebrity lady. I can not tell him to share his feelings. There is a very funny bit when the whole family is sitting alongside advertisers sitting in front of the television. Apparently this review should be a line here longer.
