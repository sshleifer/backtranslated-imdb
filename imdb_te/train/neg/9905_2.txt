'Balderdash!' The name of the little island in the movie is named and is actually true unless involved with submarines. Lesser point of training with poor camera work, muddy stock footage and perhaps Japanese 'jumps' low-point, Japanese fighter pilots and single-dimensional square-jawed Americans with images of left and right images. Sixty years later, it's an oddly funny and funny game, and it's an opportunity to see if the fever is on you. Plots and dialogues remind me of playing a summer afternoon guns in my childhood, my best friend Steve and my younger brother peering through the neighborhood hedge to get a fatal advantage. In fact, Mackin's Island attacked Carlson and his men almost equally confused before Japanese, and finally, thirsty and thoroughly disappearing from shady shots with shadows, and immediately surrendered to the soldiers! Many of Carlson's Marines withdrawal in another island and have been canceled! Cinema, of course, can not tell the story that was not in 1943, so the madness of this bit was faked and the drums rushed into the release of beating. Randolph Scott and his jaw, Colonel Thorvald (Carlsson), headed almost one of the stock charts, the green candidate (Harry Landon, Robert Mitchell), Grigzed Veteran (J. Carroll Nish, Milburn Stone, Sam Levine), Country-Pumpkin Rod Cameron), All-American Boy (Alan Curtis), and Scranks (when they smile) 'Jumps'. And yet the cast is almost overcoming the material. Almost. The narrow range of Randolph Scott fits well for his definitive commander role and he supports with a solid team of fine-tuning experts. But in the end, the one-note item of exercise wins. Randy Scott is almost exhausted when acting directly on the camera and calls for a dilemma (very well-sarda confused) weapons. The cast is better than the cast. So the audience. Refer Madness and a medially priced Merlot bottle.
