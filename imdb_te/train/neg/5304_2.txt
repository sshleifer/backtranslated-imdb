I'm out of the film based on the origin of the source and say, "The book is good." Since it is not a reliable adaptation, I know very well in reducing the value of the movie. There is a lengthy process and a lot of decisions about the control of the director's editor / editor / cinematographer / producer and sometimes a film that is not under the control of the original author. Hence, it's unrealistic to expect a movie or a game or a video game or a Disneyland ride or a movie that's exactly the same word, the word! A film must be judged on its own criteria and how it fits in society. Moreover, a successful film is required because the source material is related to society and if it is based on the source source, its relevance must be reviewed and improved by filmmakers. <br /> <br /> In the early twentieth century, oil! Based on the novel, Blood Will Blood Will Blood follows this model, the Iraq War and Fuel Concerns is the nation's country of the film, US, and is experiencing. Based on the original film, King Tech, the use of new technologies and the use of animal rights concerns. <br /> <br /> Why do not you understand why they are bothered to make this film? Besides the great performances, he will get the fees and royalties of Oscar Nats and Shanley's director / writers, which has come from somewhere. It should be just like play. The film (which is similar to the play) is nothing new about engaged sexual abuse and is often covered by the Catholic Church here and abroad. It's no new or different than the original play. I can not compare this movie, at the same time compare to another movie: Frost / Nixon, based on the play. Frost / Nixon, about Nixon's regret, is because it has come when President Bush is about to leave office. Nixon's sadness in the game / film about the war and his president is simply a reflection of Bush and his presidency. Frost / Nixon was more relevant in that regard and actually benefited from a wide distribution by the film because of the political position of the country at that time and reflected. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the same as the news that it is doubtful and does not seem to offer anything that is not dramatic. <br /> <br /> The movie is "good," the performances are good, and the screen playlist is appropriate, but what's that? Why not play it? Why, along with marketing and financial reasons, make into a film? It did not offer any new audience to discus about the awful thing.
