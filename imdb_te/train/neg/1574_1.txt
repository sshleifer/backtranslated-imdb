No story! The plot is helpless! A harder accelerator, no breaks, and a difficult automatic transmission gear lever can not be good shot on a car! Within a minute I could have stayed in the car or was constantly in the police car. I'm sorry for the actors who provide such a poor script. Some scenes are more dramatic and you can get realistic. In addition, there are many bugs, such as the Runaway car hood, which appears to be 100mph. First it was folded on the windshield, which was actually the same, but later, it was lost. <br /> <br /> The film is still in the picture observed with the hood. <br /> <br /> This film is not embarrassing, stay away from it!
