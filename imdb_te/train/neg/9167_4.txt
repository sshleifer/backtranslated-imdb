The Leap Years Singer Catherine Lim is an adaptation from the e-novel, the first Singapore novel / novel to be sold on the internet. The film features an enthusiastic post-production schedule: filmed in early 2005, was released in late 2005, but only three years later, on February 29, 2008, only a leap year. Before I could say anything, I was not a fan of romance first, so I showed little bit of bias on this film - because it was produced in Singapore, it was available for loans in my neighborhood library. <br /> <br /> Get started now telling other than Qu-Wu's KS and Wang Li-Lin. Love is Eurasia (Ananda Evergin), and Wong's bandit trilogy, Er-Hem, Eurasians. I do not know if the film is falling in love and the normal Chinese (or what Asian race is you?), Which is affiliated with the Eurasians, is exactly that. In addition, everyone in the film speaks with some mysterious "angular" voice that is not anywhere in Singapore. It is the power of "Semi-Perfect English", which speaks to us, but does not exist outside MTV Channel. The film's dialogue was forced and frozen, and the cast did not help in the absence of true-blue Sinhalese. <br /> You seem to be trying hard to strut someone into the script. One Liners. Twenty minutes later, the film's "wit" starts off as silk and the film offers its plate plate claims. <br /> <br /> I do not believe in the entire premise that I should continue to love affair for over 16 years. <br /> <br /> There are other beliefs in the film. I can not believe that a KS (Qi Yu-Wu) has fallen into one of Wong's friends. And in the scene where the groom says, "go before going to change my mind" is used by hundreds of East Asian (Korean, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwanese) TV serials ... <br /> The film has 4 stars. The value of the product is fair, and Wong Li-Lin tries her best, but she does not help the script. <br /> <br /> Jon Chen has a 15-minute bit-bit of old Wang in the film, perhaps a very good actress, but, hey, her character is just a guest. In The Leap Years "rental or library, you may want to pop in the DVD player for the desire of curiosity, but if not, for those who do not enjoy romantic style, you can decide whether you should miss it.
