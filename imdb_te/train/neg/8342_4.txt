Salvage: 4 out of 10. The Christian alliance of Groundhog Day meets the horror film. Well it's not bad at all. Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Cure Lewis) is killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry is terrible and cruel). I woke up and could this be a dream? .. or is it? <br /> <br /> The primary problem with the film is that this fifteen minute plot (completed the first time) is repeated again. Claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or alternate reality because I'm afraid of what happened to Claire and finally wonder what a lame turn. (Which was more honest), but the film collapses half the surprise conclusions (Village Think or Bilow) Thani Darco's Director's cut. All the great twist ends the sixth sense in horror films, the actual snapshot of body snacks, Happy Birthday to Me because the audience did not expect the left field description. (Heck is also worth 13th for the end of Friday) <br /> <br /> Each sequence has a twist with a twist of shades. Other nude flaws include a note piano soundtrack (although special songs are good) clear time padding (Claire cuisine, Claire's mother subblaters), Claire "There is Anybody in Hell" She Seriously </ p> <p> Some of the acting roles (specifically by Claire's mother Marie O'Dwyer played by Maureen Oldder) show the first low-budget roots of the actor Ndi. <br /> <br /> When you look at how to fix this mess, Salvez, who is almost smart enough to cut your interest to you, is very intelligent. The problem is they are not really.
