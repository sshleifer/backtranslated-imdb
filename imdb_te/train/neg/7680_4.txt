Snow White's opinion is a bad picture of my opinion on artistic material. The plot is pretty much advance, the letters stereotypes and editing is very exaggerated. However, the film does not have much artistic aspirations. <br /> <br /> "The actor is the band's leader in the film - the SENS UNIK of the band, with a character from the French part of Switzerland. The German German Swiss film is not sold to the French episode - and contrary to the fact that the film has all the production locations on my nerves. <br /> <br /> "There is a widespread outbreak in ZÃ¼rich which is why the Jewish people are taking drugs without any other goals in their lives, so it should be more cautious." I hope that I have earned enough money to Samir for Snow White, The next film will showcase his true artistic skills.
