When I first arrived, I was watching ATTACK. The science fiction channel is much worse, but not quite. The shameless repo of Jurassic Park, ATTACK alternatives for Cybertoth Cats are for dinosaurs. And they are loose, many are devouring as much as possible. CGI is very bad, and prosthetic cat head closets are funnier. We get some gore, which helps a little more. Wait until you see how a mad scientist has started all this confusion. Unlike Robert Karaden, the cast did not know much less. Apparently this was filmed in Fiji. Good work if you can get it. All the low-budget monster popular in the 80s and 90s reminds me of STVs.
