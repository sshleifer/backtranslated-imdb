<br /> <br /> Do not understand how these animated films will come out, and how good it is (or bad) how much it likes. <br /> I saw this movie with my two children (5,7). They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who have rated this movie). The theater was almost complete, and I looked forward to seeing the film with its magnificent actors. I was frustrated at the truth. It is unbelievable predictable and just plain unfunny. There are a couple chuckles across the film and it is there. Of course they have tried time and time to get the cheapest laugh, but just do not work. My son almost always told me that he wants the DVD after seeing an animated film, but on this one. My daughter fell halfway asleep through. Also, the idea that the character of the character looked unnatural. <br /> <br /> When I saw the polar express from my daughter nightmares, I did not listen to them. <br /> <br /> Do not believe me, it is not something that is negative in every case. But quality quality, and like most animated films they throw there, it's very little.
