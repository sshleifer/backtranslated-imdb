Spoiler: A young lover, Zed, Spinster, Kate (Andy McDowell) was dropped because Zed mistakenly believed he had been involved with one of his two Katie girlfriends. Kate thought she drew them sharp delicto. Kate throws Zed's shoes out of the door. Zet reluctantly leaves, and then sits in the middle of the road to lay his boots. He then runs through a truck ("crushed", one of the title's meaning). <br /> <br /> "After that he will run through a truck." Can the script writer actually imagine submitting the script with this plot element? Until then, it wants to be its comedy forester, but there is no real phase. Zed is just annoying everyone. Then they kill Zed, and everyone is sad, and ultimately the gulls love each other and help them in return for destruction. I give 2 ugh of.
