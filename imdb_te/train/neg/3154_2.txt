Look, there is nothing exceptionally vigilant about this film, it's just boring. It's a special ROM-com with a finish that you can see before, like a trailer. The main difference is that classic Rom-Koms are intellectual and unsurpassed in their stories. This film does not have any prerequisites but is not really in the sense of movement, you can ever go out anytime. The film's production has a sense of the debut film of fifteen years ago. I recommend reenacting the classic movie like Wayne Harry Met Sally instead of this shallow emulation. Oh, one other BIG problem ... no chemistry. If you are used to seeing Vaughn all looking beautiful in Michael's alias, you're going to be disappointed as they've done him here.
