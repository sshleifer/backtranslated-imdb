I want to say that I hate this movie. I can not say Gerard Butler is in it. I am sorry for half an hour of boring conversation, actually paying attention to the plot, and I started fast forwarding to the Gerry scenes. I do not really know the ending, that I was bored of that. If Gerry did not have it, I probably finished one of the two: falling asleep or shutting off, but Gerry had a bright light in the film because he had a lot of previous films. Do not worry about Gerry's fianc√©, he's always been very valuable and valuable, but if you really want to see the film for the plot and luck, you need it or the coffee or soda to keep you awake! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... And although Gerry does not know how to spell his name in this film, the casting director has the meaning of doing the film!
