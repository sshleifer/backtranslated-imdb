The film with "National Lampoon" in the title guarantees absolutely no death in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and anywhere in Germany. It might be a company in the US but it's a big audience that is practically unknown in Europe. "National Lampoon's European Vacation" is unlikely to fix that situation. Terrible Griswalds that - terrible. They are not funny. Apparently Miss Chevy Chase does not miss all of her B.di Angelo after a lot of jokes, she feels funny, but she's paid for her and does not fork out Â£ 2.50 for the franchise. The section set in England is unique. The same old old older TV performers, Messers Idle, Smith, Coltran, Miss M. Lipperman left the same old tired clichings as the same old, losing in Mr Chase's hotel corridor .... The Bucking - Ham Palace, Big Ben ...... I've never seen two bikes twice on bicycles. - For me, should I go? Yang-Haters, English and French. The Germans are luxurious and obscure (not to say about war, Clark) and Lechus downtown pinchers from Italy. Did I forget anything? Every possible "funny" situation is the death work, Mr Chase is desperately desperate, Miss de Angelo sweetenes, kids are awkward bad. As long as this franchise period passes, you will have to reassure the public that you will not lose money forever.
