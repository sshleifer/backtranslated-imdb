The week before I met Iova, I saw the Art School Confidential, in which a proud student film was made and could not determine whether it would be art or violent exploitation. Iowa may be his film. I can see items of the best movies in Iowa - Spawn and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to the artwork, the two films have a good character development and a coherent storyline. Iowa. The film slips into a spectacular conclusion. I have to agree to have stability. This film is bad from beginning to end, and most importantly not worse or good. All the actors were able to do. Rozanna Arquette is well worth it. She will show that she is very sexy, very sexy, very sexy. But why does she have to perform at this turntable ball?
