Forget Plan 9, this is the ultimate flop, a dress drama, ineptly directed, scripted, starring, etc. The film is based on Isabel Alende's noteworthy good novel. I try hard to get a terrific script like Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish movies) and other actors, listening, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons. Lots of errors with bad tons of names, such as "Magic Realism" (for example, when Christmas is in snow in Chile?) And more cruel, this is the worst movie of all time. It's totally suck !!!
