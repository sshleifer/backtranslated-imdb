One of the worst films I have ever seen. "How to define a worse?" I prefer to have two eye balls yanked and then force them to hit them dance rather than view this pitiful frame. However, one-hit wonder confirms that Zwick Elvis is suffering from intellectual influence with fans, Mary Kay's sales, Las Vegas, homosexuals, FBI agents, and the intellectual intelligence of humankind. Elvis Presley Enterprises, how can the original Elvis song rights allow the film with a central premise that "Elvis Presley Immediator is the only one dead"? The worst part of this mess - and takes some work - sculpture script: In 1958, Elvis's words and songs were to be addressed in the 1970s! Worst special effect? The Oscar Elvis's tomb, the world's most photographed / recognizable grave, sees a pyramid with a gold record and goes to Maran, where he is somewhere similar to a golden color in the middle of the garden. Potentially, the film's biggest audience is Elvis fans. However, prevalent stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis a DEA badge, FBI is not a clue ... and I can go and walk) actually reduces the traditional wisdom. The Hague. I used the word "knowledge" to explain this stupid image. This is really a terrible, terrible movie.
