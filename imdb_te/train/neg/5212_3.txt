I did not know this film in my shelf for a short time in a Mill Creek collection, and one night I decided to see it; Not too much. Initially the credits rolled around and I was surprised to find out that this film was done under the company of Filtrayzier. <br /> <br /> Filtraizy brought the world into "Dwarfs 2", "Attribute Attributor" and "Mighty Sword Quest". It's pretty good, even though it's unrealistic. Gore scenes may be expanded and maybe even more frequently improved. But after a while, I started pulling the pace and I'm thinking of "someone will soon be killed" or "someone is good". At the beginning of this drag, while I have these ideas, while someone may have been killed or gotten, while the transition, the gore and effects are not very good. The scene of convoluted conversion is messy; For example: the first doctor Houseman is at the zoo, then he's killing someone about killing someone, and finally he'd wake up in a cool sweat in bed - he's a "zoo". <br /> <br /> As with the pace of the film, the sequence transformations have become more and more worse. <br /> <br /> Doctor Houseman's role is very good at development, but at the end of the film, I saw Dr. Metamorphosed, and hopefully you'll have to laugh - this is the only reason why it's really watching this movie; This film runs unexpectedly like a long wind joke. <br /> <br /> Doctor Hausman, Joe de 'Amato's "Mighty Sword Quest for the Mighty Sword" can also be seen. That same year. You love filtraise movies, they always use the same thing again!
