I've never seen this comedy sitting on a threshold ... it's not a smile. Well, Michael Clarke has a little bit for Big, Black, Bale Gay tears for Duncan bit. But the rest is frighteningly innocent. On the vacuum of any laughs "skits" continue forever! This is a clear steer if you are worth your time and money. Terrific !!! The worst !!!
