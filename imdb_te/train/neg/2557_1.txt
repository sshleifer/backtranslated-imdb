I really like the ashram movies. I got used to seeing as many people as possible. They are also good and the killer calls. It's plain lame. I would not believe that the same people who made the Dead Men Walking and Dracula's Curse actually made this film a lot !!! It's not even laughingly bad as JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, by itself, is pretty bad). It's just bad! I mean, I appreciate and / or forgive the evil acting or lame special effects in an ashram film, but this film also takes the path very seriously. I really hope the snacks on TRAIN are great. Now I can not wait to see that movie.
