This image is bad. If you're thinking about watching, there is only one good scene in the film, and it will be 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway's scene without). The rest of the movie is terrible. I think high school dramas probably have a good acting. This theme does not make sense. The set is too lame, and it's not even better to make fun. It's just dull and very bad! I saw it in Starz, so I thought it was at least good. Alert the short description as it'd be late. When you have to watch some horrible music video, the viewer does not have any obvious reason at the beginning of the film. The transitions between the scenes are quite abrupt and someone like it put a ton of clips into an image without even thinking about how to change them. Just cut from one scene to another, no sensitivity. My coincidence is like talking about how bad the movie is, and explains why the plot succeeds. The audio is less than a few points, where you can just hear, then it's aloud with gay 'horror screams'. It's the same sound every time. <br /> Acting: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Storyline: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame-Meter: 1,000,000 / 10
