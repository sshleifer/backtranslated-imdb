If you're really a fan of bad movies, if you find it funny, you'll have a great deal of shock. Pro works rarely at first in movies. Shack has been the worst actor I've seen next to Dennis Rodman, who made some bad movies. The film is also good due to Vicious Kid. I give this a zero but it's impossible.
