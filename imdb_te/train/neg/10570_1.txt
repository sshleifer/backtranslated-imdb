The MPAA is definitely a violent torture in this boring peice of dont * do not let you fool with their "Rate for Riot Violence". I imagined some of the cheapest Rambo 3 type of action I promised on the trailer, but it was discouraging slowly its boring boring nonsense with tons of mo flashbies. Avoid!
