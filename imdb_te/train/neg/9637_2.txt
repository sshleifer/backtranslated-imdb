Boy, this is a lousy movie! When I do not see Burton / Taylor cooperatives, I can say confidently that it's worse. This wealthy non-unhealthy woman (Taylor, of course) has this beautiful island in Madeithenne, a poet who is advancing to her progress, when she suddenly visits, makes herself a governing body. In fact, the whole movie is just a discussion venue, it is not too difficult to talk. Even in 1968, no one can make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense, and time passes makes it even more clear. It's not beautiful cinematography and scenery, it will qualify for a negative rating. This film is fine and it is unexpected laugh at the expense of the stars only.
