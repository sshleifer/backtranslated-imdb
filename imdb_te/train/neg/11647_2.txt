Alberto de Martino, who directed Crime BOSS; Italian crime drama partially shot in Hamburg, Germany. An easily forgotten image. Despite a good car chase sequence, the film is almost aimless. A new Don takes him to a powerful mafia family and fights for his own life. It's hard to believe anyone when millions of dollars are imposed by the unwritten laws and moral values ​​of the Mafia Code. Cruelty and violence have returned as well. It should not be put on a shelf with real gangster myths. Returns the image's image back to American drive-in fare memory. Notable American actor Tale Savalas can not even increase the skill of the crime play. Also played with Antonio Sabato: Paolo Tedesco, Guido Lalobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
