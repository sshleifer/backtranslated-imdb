Think Saturday is a live-action show from Saturday morning about this film. It also runs like cane spots because even small tails please find this a difficult one! I can not really understand how awful god is to make something very simple and uninteresting, especially in the dress department! Many warriors have used the same old story there, but considering it appealing to smaller darlings. And no one in the world let the mermaid cast to the peak in the first place? I thought this was a "family" film! MST3K, here is another good gem for your 1999 TV season!
