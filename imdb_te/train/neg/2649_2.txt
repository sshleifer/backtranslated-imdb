My wife and I started to watch this movie in anticipation. It looked warm and touched. It started well; But soon after, it became boring and frankly idiot. It's very bad, this film is not properly played and honestly, we can understand why we did not really understand or understand exactly how you could or how to hell with this woman! She lost her sympathy and singing and refinement. I would have committed her. And, of course, like many movies and T.V series made in Hollywood we will throw it a token "gay" character! This film is boring. I was expecting more from Diane Keaton!
