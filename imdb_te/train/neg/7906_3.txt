He was not in a hurry at Carroll Barnett's show that he was so funny. He is good at playing second roles in Mel Brooks films ("High Anxiety"). Nevertheless, he can not take a person into a movie. This is basically a "gremlins" knockoff after the tradition of movies like "Critics" and "Ghoulies". It's similar to "Gowles", but it's not very good with a very light tone, it's not dark in the movie. In fact, this one is very light and brow, and unfortunately many of the jokes end up falling flat too. I gave it 3 for a score, this is only because of a gruel "grimlin" mocofe film. If you see Mystery Science Theater 3000 you are talking about ... infamous "Hoggoblins". This is a man who finds a little critter in an underground space (I've seen this film only a long time ago so I do not remember everything clearly) and it starts to be friendly enough. However, this creature is quickly reluctant and of course stretches more and that movie. Miss miss than the hit in the Jock department, and it is uninterrupted to see the role of Carmen playing a bad role. This one is best to skip, but then you can check it out for kicks.
