Why why not make a good image from a legendary story? The second adaptation of "Beowulf" is that I was disappointed in one year. But the previous version (featuring "Beowulf & Grendel", starring Gerald Butler) was very high. It's a little disappointing. This is a mess !!! <br /> <br /> How many of us are innocent? Are they any special cause (human sacrifices? Meaningless interest?), Or bad cgi, or wretched storytelling elements for instability or uninspired acting? Even worse way they've seen Marina Sirtis look so terrible !!! And do not even allow to talk about that ridiculous crossbow? <br /> <br /> They've been reminded that Beowulf has 30 people in power and did not show the strength of all of the entire film. He relied on his side to defend his bacon, thrown by two demons he fought. When he was captured by the proud prince, he kicked him. He is based on many weapons. Bio-wipe is very fond of. This is definitely not a powerful Beowulf of epic poem! <br /> <br /> I want to end this positive note but I can not really think about an offhand. If you ever read "Beowulf" you would be unhappy with everything that I could say to you, this worse and wrong.
