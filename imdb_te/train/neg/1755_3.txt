The film is not mesmerizing and it shows a bit warmth, but ultimately this effort was not too vigorous and very tightly focused on Leeds. <br /> <br /> Mary Tailor Moore no doubt she knows what to do with all screenshots, and takes longer to emerge from the other cast. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the script clich√©s. It is difficult to find an elderly lady who has fallen out of college to get a good job (and end up with the first ever work), her executive dolls, a network of network executives, for her beliefs. None of them is really bad, that is, they are all really true, but they are very much in combination and many of us have a few dazzles and very few surprises.
