It may be the worst image ever done, and is probably worth it for that reason alone. It is unbelievable that Streisand laughs as a young woman to study eudism. Soundtrack features torture, including a film that has never been featured in a weak blater featuring Barbara. And I'm not even launching the plot. You get more chuckles in this movie than most jokes, because this is terrible. Stressing rampant ego, she has led some of this eruption, thinking Oscar heights could raise this stinker. I'm pretty sure that the novelist, Isaac Bashevis Singer, is a hoax and never forgot the sequel forever. I can not blame him. The film is about two hours slow watching the car in the motion, playing the old sound of 'The Sound of Music'. It's really bad. I'm surprised, I've enjoyed this film from the Streisand.
