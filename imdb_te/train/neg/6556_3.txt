I bought this DVD for my brother, a big Michael Feofer fan. <br /> <br /> This is a reasonably entertaining factor that has two different tricks. The two with Mitchell Pfeiffer are very interesting. She plays the role of Hollywood actress. After driving her car behind her, she goes straight to Brian Carvine (a normal married man with the kids). She initially contrasts with someone else, giving her the opportunity to go home as she feels comfortable to drive her home. When his wife finds it, Romano eventually leads to tragedies. I did not prepare what was going on at the end, but slowly planting and performing any drama from the regular TV TV plot. <br /> <br /> Darren McGavin has an older studio owner who plays. This section has a good cast with Kenneth Macmillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer & Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio owner but in the end, when he asks him to resign, they know where they are now. <br /> It goes on time, but it is not as interesting and it's happy that I did not buy it for myself. I'm not a Michelle Pfeiffer fan, but in 1983 he is also the only one worthy to be seen in the film. She is a good actress. Overall, if you're a fan of it, be it very simple.
