While the movie is very stupid, Kosher plays a slaughter scene, but not lying. The Kosher Act states that the animal is made when the blade touches the skin. The Kosher slaughter scene someone knows, or the veil shows a kosher slaughter, in which the animal is thrown up, and when the esophagus is still alive, consciousness is cut with consciousness and clear pain. We must remember that history winners are written. <br /> <br /> Does the Nazis illegally claim to have killed these tragic religious killers and are the Jews still being practiced?
