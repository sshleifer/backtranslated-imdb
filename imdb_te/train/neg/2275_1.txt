Alejandro is the reconstruction of Amnabar's Abre Los Ojos, but at this time a country, a breathtaking mask is a major character. For the mysterious purpose of the English soundtrack, Tom Cruise's inexorable performance, with a delicate depth, usually we bear. Yes, the character is identified with his personality, but we usually have some role to keep our interest. His character and his sexy power between Cruz or Diaz shows his vacancy. <br /> <br /> The use of masks to release an actor to enrich the presentation of the character through the noise and the body is the exercise of language. Cruise's masking emphasized his disqualification as an actor. See the 1997 Amenbar Open Your Eyes!
