This film is also a great example of how very funny jokes can go horribly wrong. At least at least in this movie, I really guessed it but it was not half good. <br /> <br /> This strange piece of jokes is actually funny, smoking ban, joe bole ... etc honestly good jokes but who does not know who this film is unsuccessful. <br /> The main candidates may be: - 1) Hammers (actors) and Hamilres (actresses) and not even funny 2) director 3) If you are really bored of actors and / or director, see this movie really, Smash each ad or teaser and your butt of the movie because they are more ridiculous than the movie. <br /> <br /> The grace of the film is saved only by Manasraj Manjrekar and funny Chop Bai
