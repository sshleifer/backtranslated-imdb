* Where can anyone say comedy !! <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) The weakest comedian (Thomas Hayden Church) is looking at the weak (with him!), and the whole thing is very thick! <br /> They tried to make a live comic book that turned out to be super comic comic stripes and is not it funny too? Like a plan scene in the bathroom; Its cinematic imagination is great but there is nothing but paint! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland <br /> <br /> This is actually a kind of work, which made it and made some money from it, but when this was a lot of money <br /> <br /> A lot of the arts were cheated and no entertainment was entertaining . <br /> If it's a big product, it's in Brando <br /> <br /> Sheen family is here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly not an intellectual film! And he certainly did not mean to be here one after reading this !! But the major big problem is that nobody's ever working in this thing, or wanting, a little time smart or even better !!! (Sorry I'm crying now! The torture of the film is unreliable!). <br /> <br /> * (Brando) There are scenes that hit her shoes (Mira Sorvino). It's very real! He could have seen himself, because he was in such a trash and was punished! <br /> <br /> For Millie Yard Time: It's Good (or Less Than!). The train is nice to train hastey and I imagine that they can escape a little bit differently (smoky and bantet), but (Brando) sheriff. <br /> Why did not this amazing Razzie Award come to? Do you believe that you have a lower image than this? I do not think that's ok! <br /> <br /> * Martin Sheen is also a guest star to support his failing son, while the father is as unsuccessful as his son. ! And why is it? Well! It's not as good as its ambition because I hate Martin Sheen more than hate movies! <br /> It's not a comedy movie, it's not. It's one of the horrors! And I hate the horror films, especially those promoted as comedy films! <br /> What's the good thing about it? Mum! Well, this is close to another Marlon Brando's monster film (Dr. Morau Island - 1996) is close (Casablanca) !! <br /> <br /> If you want to know what you are doing or want to know ugly, ugly and very unpleasant in this movie .. pray your last prayers and see it .. God help you!
