No wonder this film did not see the light of day. The release time is awful. Since the gong show was already released, "the shark grew up", so who would pay the money to see some sensors clips from the original run of the show? And the performance clips this curiosity is only a small bit of 90-minutes. Chuck Barriss's life was a host of the event. Did he really really believe that he really forgot the millionaire's life in him and his chaos? Did he even want to know about his life? (In fact, he later wrote his unnatural autobiography about his career as a CIA operative). Will he audition every 90 minutes for each one to audition? Or is the network executor hunting him at every turn? It can work as a plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode, but is not a full-length movie. Nevertheless, it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Jean Jean, and The Enuno Comics (though the film was made of "Masala", which only made him the fewest continuous shows). As someone points out, this is Phil Hartmann's first major film episode (although it's just a minute). His name is known as HARTMANN in credits, the name he was born. He can not miss his voice and facial expression, although he is too young and younger in SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) is also a small part; Soap was his first after leaving the world.
