This film is long and boring. They were surprised that they were selected for Cannes, although they prefer to be naked. The point is contrary to the other Dutch stars of the genre like Krekhof and Kruschop, Guernsey is completely empty. It also has no cinematic quality. The lengthy shot shot is not the depth of the film, it's just a long boring shot. The story is not interesting and the characters have problems that they do not realize at all. Actors did not illuminate her and sometimes lost. Leopold tried, but she was not the talent I had hoped for. Where's Kerkoff and the crucough? They really made some waves in the Dutch cinema. Leopold made another effort.
