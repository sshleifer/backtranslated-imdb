This is a sad, irresistible and incomplete way of seeing a brutally unrelated relationship between Brooks's psychopathic editor and Harold, his ardent girlfriend. Both have ZERO chemistry together - mainly because Harold can not do anything besides looking pretty at this stage of his career; But because Brooks' role is interesting or unlikely. <br /> <br /> Brooks stumbles with Harold and stumbles about his apartment in a state of mental illness - <br /> <br /> Cooper's "You Are So Beautiful" does not have enough material for a movie. There is nothing on the periphery of their relationship as these individuals appear in the real world. I mean Brooks' purpose, dealing with a white hot spotlight and, in a way, it must be abolished; But what you're going to do is be much better than writing and acting requirements than it is here.
