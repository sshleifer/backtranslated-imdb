<br /> <br /> I saw this movie as I saw this movie in the local TV station (TV8's "Big Chuck and Little John" in Cleveland, Ohio). I never heard of this film and decided to see it. <br /> <br /> For me, Thesaurus may even come closer to helping me to make this film really bad. The script is awful. Both of these are much less than an exception, because it is not desirable for any real effort. <br /> <br /> This is a small group, leaving some of the different works. There threw into a blender. It's not just funny. The "simulation" thing was badly damaged. Some of the most outdated references (even when it's released). <br /> <br /> You never heard of it, it's very bad at Saturday night live, MAD TV or living color, even on their bad days. <br /> If you see on TV, how is it a great example of how to make an image. <br /> Adam
