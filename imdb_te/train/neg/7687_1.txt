I started to see this film with high expectations. However, one hour later I gave up on this film because I only killed the questions that did not answer me. It started in the starting lineup and became worse. <br /> <br /> Why do they kill Halder in the idol? Why is Italian comedy present? Why did farmers save Hollander's wife? Why did he not save his life instead of loving the farmer's wife? Why did not the farmer's wife hollander save her while she was around her? Why are these uneducated farmers probably Italian? Why did Italian comedian know about the gold in the Netherlands? Why did he hide the trash in the midst of the nasty peasant property? Besides, many questions have also been exposed, in which no one has been able to answer in an acceptable manner. So I'm losing the point of the film, and can not connect with the story anyway.
