You expect that you are a high school boy behind a dark, uncalled theater with your girlfriend. How bad is it that you are going to pressure the theater and head to leave the house before the film is taken? This movie is good. Really. Movies are often very good, they are good. This film is beyond that stage of bad ness. It is painful evil. Terrible, terrible, offense-against humanity is bad.
