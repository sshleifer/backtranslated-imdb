Movies slept in front of me, but never made any film twice, so three seatings completed me. The dialog is bad. Women talk awkwardly and men are caricature. And two Japanese women looked Chinese, had Chinese names and spoke Chinese tunes apparently. I'm trying to figure out why Emmenthal men are sexually surrounded by one another. 10 minus 8 1/2 Equal selection: Will I give a rating for this film? <br /> <br /> The movies slept in front of me, but no film had been made twice, so I made three meetings to complete this.
