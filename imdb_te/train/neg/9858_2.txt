This movie is not funny. D & D takes on considerable stereotypes and increases them. All the major characters are less than 30k a year, they live with all their parents, they are all socially retarded, and they have no luck with women. Jokes are horrific and unexpected, one of them hit with a black midget, one of them kkk hood (which is his wizard's dress) and another guy John Rocker warms up (Oh how funny, he does not know about sports because he is a nerd). To find this thing funny you must be a kid's high school coach. Poorly mockmuntaries are very painful to watch, but very little to do. I'm sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly de Angelo. I guess their main past hotties are the only opportunities available for the way.
