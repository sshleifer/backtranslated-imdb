Actually, I mean ... I've suddenly lost a sense of humor or it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> When I saw the preview, it was not a great movie, I did not think it would be bad. <br /> <br /> What is the good old age when you get intelligent funny lines in any movie? Actors do not have to play the funniest characters. <br /> <br /> If you have not been able to do this, PS (sorry for me England is not right)
