In the 1960s, many people have changed and awakening time. Social rebellion and unrest are simple as people talk about their opinions. Ethnic tensions, politics, Vietnam war, sexual contact, and drug use are part of daily fabric and daily news. <br /> <br /> There are two families in this movie: a white and one black. During the first half of the film, the story is based on social and family struggles and is equivalent to each family. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is dedicated to almost the white family. There are more characters in this family, and the story lines mingle, but it does not give any consideration to the ethnical elements of this century. Overall, acting is good and the historical footage is combined with color and black and white original footage, giving the documentary feel. The film is a work of fiction, but the clips of famous historical figures are used to set the time line. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie but the conditions were imaginative and the storyline was on one side.
