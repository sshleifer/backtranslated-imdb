Large fans of me and my other half trash horror could not resist an image that we had both of the thrilled greats! However a 2004 film that was ripped by the cover of Freddy Vs Jason was insulting! <br /> <br /> If you look at the worst movie I can cast, a valuable price to laugh! <br /> <br /> "You have broken my teeth! <br />" You broke my teeth! "My cigar broke" from a vampire as a response from a man who looked like a uncle Jessie from Santa with Santa!
