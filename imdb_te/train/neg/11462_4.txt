I usually like monster movies. They are unbelievably and even silly. But the movie is very difficult to like and tries to take seriously at the same time while being crazy. <br /> <br /> Orkos is famous for killing the Great White Sharks, as it feels terribly terrifying when I can not help it, a furious Shamoo destroyer stuff. In particular, a scene that exploded in some of Orca's buildings exploded ... and when it exploded, the thing jumps out of the water and I thought I was watching a show with the Fireworks in Sea World. Plus they suggest that they are going to be in advance to kill a lot of scary moments. On top of that, it takes some jobs at JAWS. <br /> Yes, it's ok that you are attacking Orca and we can come forward with better reasons. <br /> <br /> Yes, you ignore your deadly **** ups in the logic of course. . But there is one thing that JAWS is not your image. It's awful. Yes it can not afford. Its somewhat outrageous yes. But very frankly, not real or not, a killer shark is not as close to being scary as a great white. And the poor effort of character development and writing is just hurts more. Jaws is even more terrible than this in Revenge.
