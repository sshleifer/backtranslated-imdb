<br /> <br /> These characters are not always meaningless. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a young man entitled Hezel Motes, who clearly comes from a magician in the army. <br /> <br /> He concealed a ride to a two-story house. He goes home, walks around and finally he left a note. <br /> It's not exactly what's going on or where it went, but we're hazel. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to the city. Why - we do not know. When he comes into the city he writes the name and address of a bathroom wall and goes to visit this woman who is surprisingly fat hut. He will see her for a while and then he can no longer see her. <br /> <br /> This is nothing like the one in the movie and does not benefit. <br /> <br /> The young man named Enoch tries to make him a friend but the hazel is not interesting, but you're like crazy like Enoch. <br /> Hulal behaves, or why Hole does behave because we really never know. Hezel had an overdose of scary, fundamental religion by his ancestors. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do, <br /> <br /> He tried to liberate himself from the lies of the religion he had made. <br /> <br /> Despite their mutual interaction, he met many with the teacher and the daughter <br /> <br /> Finally, Hazel begins to fulfill religious attitudes and begins with self-harm. <br /> <b This is a very odd picture. <br /> <br /> This cast will do fantastic work, but the film will fail to provide a full dimension or story. </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> The connection to the rest of the dialog <br /> <br /> <br /> 2 stars
