This is an "Anthology" horror film. It was written by Robert Blowch (written for Wired Tales and personal friends with H.P. Lovecraft), but the original story is derived from the four well-known stories for "Psycho". The quality of the stories is very uneven and I did not think the film was too serious or scary. It's good to do comedy like "Comedy of Tears". Only the last 4 stories were really ridiculous and this was the best of them (with Ingrid Pitt). I have seen some of these Amicus film films and my time is really valuable by Freddie Frances' "Tales from the Crypt". The Anthology style works well for producers because they hire a "big name" group of actors, who are hired for just over a week in shooting, and then bring the big name. So you must pay a 6-star salary but get 5 or 6 different names in the marquee. The audience wants to see some scenes with Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt because it is unfortunate for audiences. Instead, they came to them in these instruments. <br /> <br /> The first story contains Denholm Eliot, an apprentice who is trying to earn some respect for his silly role as a writer who feared by his own character. . Damnik, the horror source, the actor who plays Tom Adams, is just any silly wreckage which looks silly. There are some delightful things to laugh if you like Eliot psychiatrist, like the Dominic killing scene. It creeps behind the killer victim but the patent scene where no one is watching, so the whole audience is supposed to scream out "look behind you!" The second story is one with Peter Cushing. God loves that man very much. All of his movies are very bad, like these, are pretty much so. In the story he went away for long-lost love, and he sees her comparisons in a wax museum. <br /> If you have a bit with Christopher Lee, he will play the role of father of a son who has become a witch. This bit was fun again if it was to laugh. But instead we're supposed to be afraid of Lee Child's applause and when she's surprised when she becomes bad. <br /> The last story is amusing ... Ingrid Pitt plays an actress and Jon Pertway pretends to be an actor who accidentally turns a bloodthirsty cape into a real vampire. All about providing the story. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Ingrid Pitt's English language is bad and I have to dub some of the other films I've seen her. <br /> <br /> It's not a very memorable movie, but horror is complete for anyone.
