I can not find any film to get any budget for evil. This is something that TV station is not for anything, for anything. They are buried beneath a bunch of snow, the electricity goes on and off constantly, yet there is a background light that is stunningly stable. Where does all this (fake) light come from? That is, and those stupid bullies between characters. Each other complaint is more interested than trying to find ways to live. It tries to help with the sense of urgency and people. But due to such bad direction and acting, you can not be sorry with your Florence Nightingale. I'm joining negative feedback and I agree that this is one of the worst films ever.
