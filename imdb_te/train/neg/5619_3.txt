Saying that I totally agree with the theoretical principle of the film, I began to say that the first historical Jesus and Christianity are not a lie. With this film, the film is very good in proving thesis. It makes good arguments - the interpolation between Jesus' theoretical life and the works of the Gospels, filled only by Paul's writings that do not refer to a historical Jesus - and fail to fully persuade them. This makes widespread statements without demonstrating evidence based on advertisements, and neglects the counter-arguments presented by Christianists. The lack of intellectual honesty, emotional manipulation, and intense argument are obvious, and are excellent. Only Christians who hear from the film will head off as a reasonable, rational man who attempts to deal with a twist with a chip over his shoulder - the head of the filmmaker's old school - and the various Christians have accidentally encountered parking space. Sorry, but exposed Christians do not know much about their religion and reveal that Christianity's fraud is not exactly the terrible testimony. You can also say that Jay Leno is violating the existence of Michael Dukakis in your Jay-Walking segment. Interviews with experts are very interesting, but the film is full of, honest, acting as filmmaker. The film ends with Charles Manson in the first five minutes along with Jerry Fowel and Brad Davies. Finally, the film turns into a self-centered, since there is no rational argument, only a former Christian who is angry and engaged in people who are confused and confused by his childhood. Y'nnow, maybe that movie might be interesting, but it is incorrect in a documentary about the history of Jesus, and it is self-complimentary to reduce any sympathy. This is the film of Michael Moore, which does not include humor or film makers with intellectual or intellectual inspiration from Richard Dawkins's book. Skip.
