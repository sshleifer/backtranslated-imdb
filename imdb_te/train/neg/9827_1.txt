First of all, I remember the film about the older films that religion should look to in class. This is not a good thing. In general, it is just the prey and pretentious piece of dirty, just like the horrific "left back" series. I'm not offended by religious movies ... but I'm offended because these religious movies are just too awful. I will not be able to say nice things about a Christian film but it does not seem like it will happen at any time soon. I bet if you've given a good budget for biblical thumpers, they still can not make any good idea. Avoid this. Also, the "American Family Association" (mainly, Reverend Wildmine defects) is another reason for the beam to hate me about this film on their website. In fact, after I saw it, I went home and saw my copy of David Cronenberg's NC-17 rated "crash". Forgive me for sinning. Hahahahaha!
