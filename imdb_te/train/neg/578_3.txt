It's not a good movie. The acting is exceptionally sturdy and incredible. It does not know if the movie goes to a real horror system or going down the camp and kit. I have never seen the first film, but it has not stood on its own greatness, there are very incredible plot twists and the director is never known about the importance of the main female Vampire. No effort is worth looking
