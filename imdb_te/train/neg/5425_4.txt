But the Mirror Mirror has come because Yvonne de Carlo did it (because I thought it was great in her American Gothic) but sadly she did not play a big role in this film. It starts ok and pace moves along nicely ... but in the end it starts to get a bit tedious and dull. This is not a boring image, but it's just too average and amazing. I do not like the "posession" and there are no good gore sights. Plus the 'main' story is very confusing and does not make much of an inner time. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend the Mirror Mirror for horror fans - it's not just wet on you.
