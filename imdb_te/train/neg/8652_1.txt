I thought it would be a good idea before it started with this film, but when I started with it I found it really awful. They said they were making cinemas in Afghanistan, but 95% of the film was shot in India. You can see Indian made cars. You can see lasers of Bissary (Indian water brand) written on the road, you can see what is really funny and much more that you prove to be non-portrayed in Afghanistan in temples in Afghanistan. I do not want to waste his / her time watching the movie .. Pure Time Wastes .. Instead of looking at this film we recommend that you do something or your heart may be a good idea but do not waste time on these waste
