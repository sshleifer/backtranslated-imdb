Worst, clich√©-ridden and mock-up dialogue and very poorly produced form. In addition, the cassettes and the folk are constantly overtake. A fake "good picture". It takes time to find out how discreet Turkey is. The first scene is full of bore, hosternic and historic exchanges. The sound is terrible. Camera movements are unexpected as building roles. No poetry, no subtle mental, no interesting shots. Actors are constantly smoke and we see ads for beer drinks. Very cheap, indeed. (An exception: Ned Betty's successful and simplistic way to hitman).
