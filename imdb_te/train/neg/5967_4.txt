Just think, it costs $ 250,000 to make "Clerks". How was Hell $ 45 million spent on making this glamorous music video? A practical unknown cast, two or three sets, special effects I can not see ... I know that was spent in a skillful, financial, and tense screenplay. Shoot, that bar must be spent on a bundle set. Anyway, I do not think Jerry Bruckheimer is going to die. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm not expecting an awful movie. The male leads have some good chemistry and the soundtrack is OK. The IMO feels guilty if it can make this mediocre project without any damage to just $ 5 million and could even make ID films worth $ 6 million.
