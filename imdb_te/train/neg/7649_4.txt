Joyce Reynolds is getting the role of Johnny, a small town in the United States - a silly sixteen-year-old, winds up a steady soldier and her magazine on the cover of Life magazine (in a blanket party) in one week! Johnny's mother, instrumental, and genie's father, who was partnered with Johnny's Red Cross, had a chance in 1944 (parent, stuffy, sexy Edward Arnold and pert, Charty Ann Harding) He is trying to write a couple of problems, editing problems Kucu can not help a baby conceive two of them). Warner Bros. was nominated for an Academy Award (!) For the editing of Owen Marx. It was followed by "Johnny Gets Married" in 1946. Reynolds had to raise her co-horts by then - she was replaced by Jon Leslie. **** from * 1/2
