This is 'Freddie Mercury The Untold Story,' Theater Release, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the phoniest, uninspired and most bizarre biographical documentaries I've ever seen. If the film I actually saw in a movie theater was actually released on TV, I would appeal to audiences and distributors with false promises of the film's constructive documentary feature. Although a prepared TV documentary, the sit-in piano solos and interviews with sitcoms before hotel arrangements in hotel rooms are fake-literary narratives of the sleeping bed infomercial. Unbranded Fedby Mercury and Queen - "Untold Story of Freddie Mercury", or "Yumam", "The Princess of Diana Untold Story" original concert, video and TV footage. "He is a free soul," (really .. I think Freddie Mercury is a company man ...) is the light of mercury's complex life and character to reduce the newly-liked teddy testimonials by Brain May or Montserrat Cabellie. And what's with boarding schools like Harry Potter? How would you like to know about Freddy's first school band-crush ("Those Who Are Now a Travel Agency") and interviews with interview makers? The important milestones in his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and development, the Queen, the team was unexplored. Your grandfather's parents sleep on Sunday night to recollect the history of this history channel, which does not ask for a single, provocative question, nor do they have independent or visionary research in their case, rather than a troublesome and clever emptive commentary about a troubled and clever rock legend .
