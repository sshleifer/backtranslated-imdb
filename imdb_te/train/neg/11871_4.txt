Gregory Peck's performance is fantastic, as anticipated, and cinematography to play in a very spectacular dramatic "moment". But, the rest of the picture is overwritten and difficult to look at, anyway. I like it, but the last thirty minutes or so has come forward. I'll waste a lot of hours together. It's not for Gregory Peck, I can not last for fifteen minutes. 4/10.
