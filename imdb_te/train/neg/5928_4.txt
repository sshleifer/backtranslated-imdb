I'm not able to get some of these episodes of big episodes - Miranda is very awesome and it's nothing to you. Someone commented here, it could be something more than the frequency of light waves or it was luminous. Miranda just jerk. The episode is slow, absurd, and way too tough. Why does Colos a diplomat do not understand much - why does not the federation simply abandon the heavy Medusanes? There is a part that I love when Colos speaks through Spock about the loneliness of human experience. Overall, I like the TOS and in its lamest, I always tune myself up. Despite this episode - mmm, I do not buy a copy that is used under $ 3.
