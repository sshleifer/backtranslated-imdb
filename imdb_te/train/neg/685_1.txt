With this cast and the director, I thought my wife wanted me to take care of the film. We're wrong. In fact, after 45 minutes we left it. Crawford, Young, and Tone British, but I think it's impossible to speak for me, it's impossible for me to live in the past, because it is believed that England is not talking to the British voice. There is zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and it is ridiculous that Cooper and Crawford suddenly want to declare their love for each other for no reason to echo the previous comment. There is no reason to take care of the characters, which we were thrown halfway through halfway. I believe Hawks has directed this because no one of the actors spoke with trademark Hawksian Ratt-A-Tat Delivery. So save your time, and skip it.
