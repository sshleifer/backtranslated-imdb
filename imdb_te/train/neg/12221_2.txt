This type of budget is really criticism for the independent horror film without the exception of the above mentioned noise. Make the effects and Gore is very good and the main actor is effective, the main actress is particularly poor in her coaching some of her attractive needs. <br /> <br /> The main problem with frightening is its length in 108 minutes is roughly half an hour as a comic movie, the project is only ten minutes and ten minutes. <br /> It is visually appealing in places and is sometimes expected to have lighting in movies. <br /> <br /> When the film is very poor, large parts are very difficult. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is an unrealistic "serial killer back to the movie" since it died, with some fair and brutal modification, in its present form as an incomplete harsh cut.
