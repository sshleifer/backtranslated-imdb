How about 4 in front of the voters 4 could give this picture a 10? Is it 7 or more for the first half of the voters? Who is going to vote here? Most young children - I feel like children, mainly. The fact is that it is a bad image in every way. Story stupid; Acting is also hard to be considered; Characters are irreplaceable; And the conversation is terrible. I watched this rainy afternoon on the size fizzy channel. In the tragic event, it will always be resumed, but instead you suggest reading a book.
