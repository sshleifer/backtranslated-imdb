I was excited when I saw ads for this movie, because I recently read this book and really enjoyed it. This film did not receive my expectations. After reading the book, I was prepared to make the stories happen frequently when they were translated into movies. These books are not well suited to these books. The direction is weak. I have hard time getting into the characters. There is no real connection with the viewer about what's going on. The dialog does not adequately explain what is going on. It just looked slapped together and rushed through. The whole movie is very disappointing. Suppose you read the book, it may be right. <br /> <br /> Many people, if you can read the book, maybe you will enjoy more. <br /> <br />
