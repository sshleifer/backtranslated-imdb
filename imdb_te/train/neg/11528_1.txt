Those who are "good" about this must be a friend of the post. It's bad for the backyard wrestler. The fact is that this is not even the backyard wrestling, it's a few guys hitting on a trampoline. Every boys are about 45 lbs wet and there is an ounce worth entertainment in this. If this is possible, yard beans are only a few bored kids to give a bad name. If you want to see some entertaining backyard wrestling, take a Perzar Wrestling a Percher for Pain. It has 2 big names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh ban. These guys are good. They were actually trained and professionally trained as "real" Pro Rogers. They were legit and made good. I recommend checking those 2 guys. MDogg is mad and hook off. So there are "good" back yard videos where you do not waste your time or your cash on this crappy DVD.
