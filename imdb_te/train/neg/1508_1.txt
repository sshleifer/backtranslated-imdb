I saw this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what to put in my seat. I guess an image with gear ultimately guessed it would be some value but nothing worth ever came on the screen. This story is not a silly need to burn after slavery and torture shot. There is no role in the role of anything as real life. Cutting "style" depends on the jump cuts, mini flashbacks and overprinting, which are clearly freely run for years to give the gang of gangsters a gang of gangsters, and the killer of the leader is called "victim". I did not see how a Buddhist gear participated in this violent, sexist garbage.
