Really, really, abyss, awful, awful. But actor Clayton Moore (Motion Picture Lone Ranger) treats herself as an actor. <br /> You're a rare treat for five minutes, you're gothwickly transparently special effects, southern California, "the moon" (again and again), and it's not worth the wood to make it faulty. . . <br /> <br /> This conversation may be worse than these other aspects and clothes. . . Well, that's going to be enough. Plot? What a plot? <br /> <br /> Enjoy Bad Guy (well, head Guy Guy) and his followers like Croag (Crouch or you suspect McDonald's founder Ray Krock) and his unreliable pistols.
