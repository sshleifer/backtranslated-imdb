I was a big wrestling fan at the age of eight. I saw no federation. WWE, WCW, USWA. <br /> My 19th birthday on May 23, 1999. I ordered Edge Over and I'm just looking forward to another salary for the view. But this time. I made a mistake. Instead, one of the best wrestlers to come out of Canada, a true human being caused his death, because he had a stunt error. You can not change much situation. <br /> <br /> <br /> The death of Owens has become very intolerable to me. <br /> <br /> The WWE then decided to save the first to pay the view, <br /> <br /> Ovens death can never be seen. <br /> I told you. Vince McMahon has taken some stupid decisions in his life, but this is the absurd decision made so far. <br /> <br /> And this is the worst saying that Owen wanted to pay a paid view of the trip. Will you be. When someone dies in the puule, it will stop its common sense. <br /> <br /> If a police officer rushes out a thief or a mugger and goes to kill the man, he goes home and calls one day a man's life is never forgivable. <br /> What happens? Owen will miss and thank you for all the memories you have given us.
