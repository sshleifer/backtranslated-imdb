This may happen to me that some of the films banned in film history are indeed very important and good films. Sensors that I challenge and controversial films should be considered to ban films that threaten your IQ and your integrity. If they are one of the first films to be quickly removed, it is undoubtedly "stroke ace". The film is terrible with the capital 'A'. Burt Reynolds has never seen a "Canonball Run II", "Cap and a Half" and "Red-A-Cop" in his CV. <br /> The Layer-Thin Story Successful Stock Car Racer introduces us to Stroker Ace (Reynolds), Fast Cars and a woman who loves fast women. He was trapped by a curly promoter Clyde Tarkley (Ned Beatty). This contract requires some insulting promotional work for new fast food restaurants that dress up as a big chicken. The mixture has bimbo with Bimbo with the brains of the brains of the laggs (Jim Nabors), Aes' Fuzzy Milk, and Pembroke Feney (Anderson in), an anxious parasite of Ace. <br /> <br /> Hall This low-level worst director is Neidham, a stuntman in the past and has done many of his skill based on his skill as he performs spectacular stunts and car racing / races. Some of these films have come to career nadir with OK, but "Stroke Ace", such as "Hooper" and "Stunt Unlimited". The characters are very intelligent that you really pity for actors to play them. Anderson will give your teeth soft, especially in despair. Humor is weak and infant throughout, and stunts and race sequences are inaccurate. In the closed credits (all of which can be seen in Reynolds-shadow cooperatives) is also usually removed when it is removed, giving the impression that the film is not very fun. "Stroke ace" is a stinker for considerable size.
