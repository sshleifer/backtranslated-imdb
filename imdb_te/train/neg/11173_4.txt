If it's not for bad dialogues and scripts. I mean, it's really in that direction. It is good that the actors bring their characters into life. But ultimately, a solid script that combines all the pieces into the missing thing really. I suggest you do not see this. Al Pacino is an enthusiast and I see everything he's playing, even though the result is not too late. After S1m0ne, the second most bad movie for this actor is to know how to choose the characters once.
