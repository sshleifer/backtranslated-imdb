The problem in the film is that it is shot in the most dangerous camera and the film is obscure and tight. Probably the fact that they caught the camera or did not catch them. There is a lot of pope and vomit in this movie. I think someone is vomit every twenty minutes and I think it's made by some bulimics or something. It's frustrating. Then and go and and the annoying high pitched that pops up to the credits roll is tight. I did not even like her friends burning (or I do not know) and she went to the van and placed band Aids. It really is really stupid in a movie too. How much gas can he have for gas? It must be very much because they do not run out of gas in the rest of the amount. It's a terrible movie and I have never seen you ever seen in your entire life.
