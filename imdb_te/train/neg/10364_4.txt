The book is good enough to take up the film in a movie movie, but it takes more and more of the book, all religion, love and mathematics, cotton candy sounds, it becomes boring. However, people who do not read the comments I've read and do not read the book, and it may also be useful for the benefit of the child to read the wrinkle in time. Mary Poppins' Uncle Albert (I love to laugh) is the most awkward change to make a clone of a happy medium. The ridiculous smiling at things that are absolutely unfunny is so shiny that motivating the characters on the screen.
