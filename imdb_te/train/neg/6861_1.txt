Templarios is my first exposure & not a good one. I was excited to find this title among offerings from anchor bay video that has brought us other cult classic like "Spider Baby". The print quality is fantastic, but this picture can not hide the fact that the deadly dull. The villagers have a terrific early scene of the terrible revenge on the Templars (and the whole thing in motion), but the rest of the film is slow, wonderful, and ultimately unfulfilled. Add insult to injury: As the video jacket promises, the film is not subtitle, dubbed.
