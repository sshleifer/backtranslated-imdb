<br /> <br /> I have seen Ebay for a cheap price this month. <br /> I saw, I have only a few comments. <br /> <br /> 1) Terrible story-line, 2) terrible acting, 3) bad fighting-scenes ... <br /> <br /> The worst thing in my life is never seen in the movie !! While the storyline is bad, fights are a bit more interesting. <br /> <br /> The film is about Nikki Berwick (in my opinion) only positive. God, she is good in this film. <br /> It's about it ...
