Susan Swift is an attractive teenager, a flower child adorned in the 1980s (like the young Susan Day), but her demand does not have much vocal line for dramatic dominance and she wants; Still, she has rather sweet and bright eyes and a beautiful smile. In "The Coming" (shortly after the release of the theaters), Swift could be a reincarnation of a Salem Witch. I've given this film a little less than 15 minutes from the budget and many other films. It starts strongly and has some camping appeal. Naturally, there are more serious films dealing with Salem Witch's efforts to look beyond this; However, when the junk films went off, it was not terrible. Boston Locations is a definite plus, and supporting cast amusing. **** from * 1/2
