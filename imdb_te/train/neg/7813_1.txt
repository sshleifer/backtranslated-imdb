In my view it is the perfect example of Hollywood Ago, which was lost to the new King Kong movie. Superman is the original superhero and he deserves the treatment with respect to the tights wearing. Brandon Ruth is the worst Superman I've ever seen, just wanna cast a piece of cryptonite down his throat from the beginning of the film. He looks dressed and just crazy. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth is a bad choise for a deep lane, she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter, but in this movie she looks more like school. The plot is weaker and predictable (Wow, actually he is the most contemplative son) and acting is terrible. There's a good thing for this movie, and it's Kevin Spacey's name. His role of Lex Luthor was great, but he could not save the film. The film "Lewis and Clark" (except Kevin Spacesy of course) and a different story cast. I saw this film after seeing "Hills Have Eyes" and I was chocked to learn that there were those worse movies.
