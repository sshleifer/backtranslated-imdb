I first saw this film in MST3K. And while I laughed off my posterity at jokes, I did not think this film was all that bad in particular. It's a little hard to understand that it's definitely a low budget, but it's a lot of hitchcock-like plot and honestly honestly entertained when I see a non-Mn3K non-reform version. The film is crying for the Hollywood remake.
