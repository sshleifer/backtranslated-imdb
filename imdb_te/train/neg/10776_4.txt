We thought that when my wife decided that I wanted to see this film, it would not fail. <br /> I loved Billy Crystal, I loved my wife Julia Roberts and we all talked to everyone that they loved them. <br /> <br /> We have misled spades. Crystal's character is very three-dimensional and has done very little for the film. Sure, he broke up the good jokes, but he did nothing like a character but gained the space. <br /> <br /> And the poor Julia Roberts. In past shows she played well as a self-determined woman. In this film, she is totally oppressed and very low. <br /> I found a good thing, it should be Christopher Walken. Now it's fun. <br /> <br /> Like Billy Crystal, nothing showed about his role. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a mindless laugh at night with very little redemption value, look at it. If you're looking for a smart, romantic comedy, it's not your image. It is not mentioned above.
