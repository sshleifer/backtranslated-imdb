It's a simple delay Universal Horror film: its technically comptent, by numbers, with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting. The most interesting piece of the film is Stanton Casting of its Rando Hatton, the bone-to-be-like "monster" of the film. This man expressed regret for the exploitation, but they used the money he paid. It's less terrifying than a hatton studio, and I feel that I'm afraid or hated. Martin is a madman of the movie Koslak and he is very entertaining in this episode. I saw Koslak about anything. For some reason that man agrees to me. The other part of the film is entertaining to me in the world of film art is absurd. Here we are shown the bad art critics in their ability to break the artists; Which side of the film is with the male "hero", who is he "artist"? Somehow our hero will review the side-by-side with villa's absurdist sculpture. Moreover, the funniest protagonist accused him of hating hero's pin art, because "there are no women who are like" because our protagonist responds with a guarantee that the critic is not out of sight. Finally, there is a subaplate of the heroine (who is an art critic) who is a veteran person .... A thoroughly anti-feminist and sarcastic mockery. Overall, the film is a very mediocre film with some amusing elements.
