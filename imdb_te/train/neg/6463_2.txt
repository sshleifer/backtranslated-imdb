I saw free money last night & it's 90+ minutes long in my life. With such an amazing cast, I really wanted to be a treat - I'm a Brando fan specifically. Wrong! No talent is in vain. It is almost impossible to see (such as a livestock breed scene), and the funniest possibilities for comic setups (why not why Charlie Sheen's character goes back to Brando's truck?). It tries to be a slapstick comedy, but I did not buy it. Skip this. <br /> <br /> For de-hard brando fans only. <br /> I have previously made a scandal.
