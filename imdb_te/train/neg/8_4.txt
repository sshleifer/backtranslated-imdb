<br /> <br /> The director takes some foolish decisions on the film. <br/> <br/> Author / story <br /> <br /> Total score for this image. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this image, it's not worth it. I gave it 4 for this film and it may be too much. The characters are always more exaggerated than being in real life and some pretty unspeakable things are "plotting" and not good. This image is frustrated after 30 minutes due to the style (much more special effects: slow moves and camera shakes and fast forward). It is good to use the music to make this film tender, but there are a lot of tracks in this regard. There are about 50/50 dialogues and music in the first hour
