This is actually an insult to BTK killer victims and their families. The events in the film are not close to the truth. This is not any sense because the actual events are more interesting because the image of real events can not be done. Do not waste your time watching for free. It is a shameful picture of low budget and events which should not be a joke, which really made this film. I will do if I allow a -10 in this movie. Acting, and appears to have been shot in the old VHS video camera from the 80s. Save your time and money by not looking at this picture.
