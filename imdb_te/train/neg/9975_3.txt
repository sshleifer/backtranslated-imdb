I saw that I was watching this movie as a very young child, and some parts (of course) did not understand me. I saw once as an adult, I understood those parts. The only problem when watching as an adult is that it's not fun for me. So what type of film is that? Is it a "children's picture"? Not rarely. It is not suitable for children and children. Is there any exaggeration that each parent thinks they are going with their own children? Perhaps, but why does it focus more on John Ritter's role than junior? When a film is its main character at the age of 7, audiences have a film for seven and audiences when it is more than 7 years old, otherwise there is no way for older people (even an 8-year-old who does not see a film about a year-old boy). The film did not do well at the box office, and it should be a reason because it did not find a niche in the market.
