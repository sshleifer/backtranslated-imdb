I finally saw 20 years of odd years and waits to see exactly, and this time will definitely not wait to see. INCUBUS is absolutely no-horror film: the unseen killer / monster is rape and murder of women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The film is similar: the movie begins with the killing; Then blah blah blah; More blah blah blah; Killing one another; More blah blah blah! Blah blah blah; Another murder (surprise, huh?); <br /> <br /> The film is completely imaginable from the beginning to the end. The stupid "big" red-herring used throughout the film also convinces a 5-year-old. And I discovered the moment the Incubus secret identity of the protagonist found, so when the "shocking" surprise came to an end, I was not surprised or surprised. In fact, after watching the movie, I kept chuckling for a long time. <br /> However, the combination of the film "Rock Band" sequence is one of the few stand-out moments in the film. This is not good because it's not good but it's not so big because it's not big: a movie playing on the big screen is a video of a girl in red leather trousers, and he definitely gets a fake long hair cut with a girl who's been attacked by the movie theater's incinerator by Inkbus It has been edited. Cinematography is the best thing I can say about this film. But next, there is nothing worth mentioning INCUBUS, unless it is unexpectedly happy.
