<br /> Because 100 times 99 producers tried to buy or rent their sensitive sensor * by telling their teeth (or someone else) to lie. <br /> <br /> The shock-o'-rama movie proves that "Mass Feeding," maybe a good idea but this is once again released as a completely useless and dismal entry zombie genre. Folks, this low-budget film-making-only, this is a very low-budget film-making group of people - I'm sorry, I know the families that I love them - forever, never in any important fashion of Variety. It's a baaaaaaaaaad mooin 'pitcher, folks, and it's not cheap. <br /> Acting is normal, but I can not blame the actors; They do not have any direction. They have no direction because the script is half-baked zombie fantasy in the sense of the real cinematic storytelling. Nature is not the weakest dialogue and thanks to the long distance. Did I still say that the script and direction were pretty dull? They. No drama, no tension, no great character moments, nothing. The entire premise of the government's crackdown on the media is squandering on sophomoric "commercial breaks" and an outstanding storyline that defies shambles to its ridiculous end to rational analysis and awkward end. <br /> How does the government suppress the truth of a serious zombie epidemic when its reality is clearly visible everywhere? Why would they give more than a secret effort? Wireless access to cell phone cameras In this day and age, can they expect they can do better than one day or better? Now, if they cover some of their own guilt ... But "feeding the masses" has never explored such opportunities. Instead, it performs programs that are not perfectly displayed for the ridiculous and / or importance, whose audience does not notice the total value-added value beyond the primary film-making apparatus. Anyone in this movie paid? I believe the actors will hope, if their time is wasted in career blinds; At least techies got rack up some legitimate work experience. <br /> <br /> Even zombie fans will find quite a bit to get from "feeding the masses." This hole is unusual for budgers of its rank, and has special sets or unmarked effects. In fact, they can not forget everything. <br /> <br /> Even as Acey dies, "like dead" waste "eat the masses" before miles. Sorry, guys, back drawing boards, and you can take your fraudulent marketing.
