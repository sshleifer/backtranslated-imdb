After seeing endless ads for weeks before it started on BBC, I decided to see this serial. Although I did not like what Alan Holingstust wrote (sorry to his fans but the Emperor's new outfit I feel with the writer's writing) I have seen it. I admit that the acting is fantastic, it is pretty portrayed and I am fairly entertaining - although I'm very thin and the three episodes are very satisfied with this very empty product. The 'clear' gay sex that was drued about the media was not much surprising - many times - I was afraid all the time before TV. I'm afraid of less marks for product values ​​but less for stories / content.
