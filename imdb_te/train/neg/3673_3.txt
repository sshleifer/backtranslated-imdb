William Scuba diving scientist Hurt US agents investigating abroad? Is the person who gets sick after a 20-feet back and running away? The sniper does not kill and does not kill (just bruised him) but the second "kill" shot is dead? Waste of time. It's ridiculous to compare to other critics falling down. Oh and by the end of the film they start to wear gloves in their hands except the "evil" agent and hurts him to kill him by giving him a "virus handshake". What? BTW ... when need 10 lines of IMDb text? I am obscure here. If you have x total size, does it just reduce the content of the reviews?
