It's one of the worst funny stories ever made in movies that have never been 70 years old. Mel Brooks, Mike Myers and others have made very bad comics, but this is the perfect edge of the barrel. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, <br /> <br /> I usually like Diane Keaton that she does not need to pay for. <br /> <br /> The Docs Shepherd (I do not know who he is) is a good director to show him how to work. <br /> <br /> Mike White needs to find another character, who has done the same thing many times. <br /> Who is Ken Howard? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ <br /> <br /> I do not think this is a good thing in the movie comedy movie.
