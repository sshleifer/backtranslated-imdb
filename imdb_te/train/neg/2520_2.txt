OK This movie is a terrible premise. Be very careful as they are in an apocalypse battle, and there is money to buy huge robots and pitt each other. Instead of investing in each country to rebuild their country, they decide to fight with robots that no one can buy. Here's a good idea, our most useless resource to fight our wars, and jacks. <br /> What do you think about the director? He does a good movie, he makes a bad movie. There is no reason to give some credit to the film due to the director's possibility of sleeping? I enjoyed this film because it's very cheesy and ridiculous, I had to laugh. I'm really looking at the other except a cowboy (who looks like a killer, so it's a surprise, but it's sluggish). Whatever training is a wild gym anyway. I was sad to see Mst3k did this. <br /> <br /> I do not think there is anything wrong with the budget and there is nothing for budgets. It's like a cube. The storyline is also unacceptable and I have seen good performance in school plays. <br /> <br /> Anything to pick it up, it's a pleasant movie to watch.
