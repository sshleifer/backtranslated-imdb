I wont take too much time, just Darkman wanted 3 state of wonder. I have all 3 on DVD, my collection of DVD movie sets added to this. Darkman like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die Hard, place up there better, you get the point. There's a very good horror, thriller, there's no way to guess. Thank you very much for the whole staff, and set us to offer the Darkman trio. By the way if I was wondering how the DVD came across this one. I purchased it through the Internet, it's the area that you know is DVD Players 1 area 4, but if you own a Sony PlayStation 2, it will have the best DVD player from all regional players. Go to set up a witch's area (1-9).
