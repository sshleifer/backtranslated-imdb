What happened? This awful movie was the first on my computer screen and the first thing to remember after the end of last year. Nightmare in Elm St, it was deeply noticeable after the first film's cult classic, but I suspect anyone expected this horrible breach. <br /> <br /> No one can imagine this cosmic joke in the film, I'm not very worried about it. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is the worst image. It does not seem too bad at the beginning, but it is a tall shower view, rather than a real creepy intro and Alice. But we were initially right down to Right Bottom with a combination of bad acting and events. I'm sure, Freddie's movies are supposed to be dreaming and creepy, but this is like a rail-wreck of events and terrible plot setup poor sequencing. You seem to be coming with terrible headache, you're not scared. Directing failed completely. There is no suspense and well-designed horror from the past sequels and death scenes are mostly cross and moronic (especially the death of the food), except for a cool scene designed in the comic book battle. That's why the film got a point. <br /> <br /> The storyline is ... lame, dull, lame, lame. <br /> Acting ... I told you how Freddie's baby was like a clown-like clown. ? How did his reincarnation scene make him look like a monster of foreboding and nightmare dream killer instead of the 7-year-old horror book that has all known and abhorred from the first film? He wandered the hand and stupid chuckling ... ugh. And he was a liner. Throughout the whole movie, they suck. Seriously. The vomit freddy film then spews at 90 minutes interval when a grade-schooler comes with funnier stuff. Hell, Freddie had a lot of ridiculous lines for the chimpanzee. Who wrote the script? This film is really irritating. This does not mean. Just like a nut that hovers around your head, just does not go away. Freddy is now angry. We have seen him many times. This one is nothing else, and most of the time you want to take his awkward one liners and get your TV screen. Alice, instead of paying attention from the last movie and the silent girl seems annoying and very unpleasant, and this is definitely due to the terrible, terrible script fitted to this film. Lisa Wilcox might be a great actor, and sometimes she is shattered by cracks, but she has not saved this movie. <br /> <br /> Freddy's last 15 or 20 minutes of existence in this movie are awful and awkward. I hope England will be ashamed of this. Who wants to see Freddy walking like a mutated gorilla with his legs, laughing like a cartoon villain? The film has destroyed the optimism that I felt for the Nightmare series. I can not see this film without running through my head. That's the vacuum cartoon abhorrent that became Kruger. He slowly became a joke, retarded pop culture icon, but this is less low. It's rock bottom. No one ever takes Freddy Krueger seriously after seeing this film. He is a clown but it is too late for the joke, the clown. <br /> <br /> I hate all the movies, why need Nightmare on Elm Street? Dream Child reflects an epic death, breaking any hope in Nightmare in the Elm String series. Freddie Dead (which is actually more entertaining than it is), then he goes forward to reduce the mood in Freddie VS Jason and eventually he goes to reduce the mood in Freddie VS Jason. <br /> <br /> I'm thinking about why Freddie is now succeeding I'm very proud, but this film is horrific, so far One of the worst films. Not recommended for anyone, and ANOES can not be viewed again.
