<br /> <br /> I spent the first hour I was waiting to take up the film. It's terribly boring, and there are clearly random people around the hills in the clear direction. Then the hero comes into the picture. Although born of an Asian, he was white when he grew up. Naturally white. He is not even close to Asia. He looks like Justin Timberlake. It is very distracting, and the story does nothing to help cause. Meaningless war scenes and slogan dialogue. It's an hour and forty five minutes, in the end I'm trying to eat my own face. I have seen this video because this movie is good, but I always ask myself in the video store I work with. Now I have the answer. It will be like this: ego. "No good! Good God! This is Haribble! Do not do this!
