After reading the book, I liked the story. I was disappointed that I had made a lot of changes in watching movies. Books and movies are different but there are two different stories, just names and some book stories. Read the book and have a good understanding of the film. The book gives you a good improvement in the characters. These characters are very interesting and you care about them. This book is in line with the descriptions of the book. Some characters are not included. Television has a lot of great books and texts that have a microwave, this is a good example. The input from the author is not always a good image insurance but it sometimes helps.
