Horrible, Horrible, Horrible This movie does not waste your money on rent. This is a low budget for TV Canadian movie. Absolutely the worst picture I've seen so far and there are many people out there. The time to take this film to a DVD player or VCR is not valuable. : It is certainly not good for me to write ten lines, but it definitely does not flow. I'm prepared for the TV movie in BTK Killer and it's very good (this comparison) is sure they're going to make the film, but do we educate or tell a story about BTK Killer They mile away. It is infomercial for animal rights.
