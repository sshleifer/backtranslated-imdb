Move into your favorite chair, switch to the drama-station, you will be flown in the waste disposal section. Spend a useful 90 minutes. Living in your favorite game. Confusingly - poorly portrayed - non junk directed. It takes a bit out of many other "science fiction" movies and tries to get back to the parts of the patented weak story. There's nothing new, it's fun to make fun entertainment for filmmakers, but the touch of skill and ingenuity is essential to make a good film. The money I have seen is that I want to get my 90 minutes life back on waste and individually.
