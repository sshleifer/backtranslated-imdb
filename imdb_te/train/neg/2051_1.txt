The performance for the episode led to the Phantom or Phantom of the series, It was wasted 42 minutes to see the Martian man hunter. It is not true what happens to what is happening in the middle of the 6th series and no matter what the story of another story is, except for Martian man again meeting the hunter, and to do it for 30 minutes to do it. The bad writing in the soap opera in younger is another case. I really like the show, but in the cast that is written for the work or use of the soaps, even though it is mainly cast and has 3 or better episodes each year. It's very bad. Within the first 4 minutes the bogus and anything that happened was a dream of Clark's accuracy, due to a Phantom Mandal role, and he won when he woke up and the Blah Blah authors did not do so to create the villain ahead of the hero this week. Furthermore, Marion Man Hunter, along with another villain who died in the final episode, will fly away again and come back and say that his sunglasses will forget to see Clarke in this episode.
