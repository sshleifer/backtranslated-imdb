First of all ... I've always seen one of my movies but "Seed" (this serial killer does not need this cheaper)) I'm close to joining the hate club. This film makes no sense at all ... The plot is just plain bored with a joke and boll apparently trying to attract the attention of shocking people. You can end up with such images: <br /> <br /> Hooded killer clips were tortured on TV. It's a real life scene from the Pelt Ferms and the movie begins with a ridiculous reason of the "making a statement about humanity" and giving the address of the pedestal. The film is no doubt and the worst part of pornography is that you already have a reason to hate it from the beginning of the movie <br /> <br /> What happens after the screen is printed on the screen is a replacement electrocution By death. The cops have such crazy bad mofo because cops have stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey, animals, kids and death are dead appetite and see cops spoiled in the Seeds Basement. <br /> <br /> Cops bust busted in his house, stupid and darkened in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you can not see anything except flashlights. <br /> <br /> "Seed chair comes in and the film appears to be the longest of all in this movie" ... " He does not die and reminds us of the opening statement that he should be set free if he lives 3 electric jells. <br /> <br /> What should he buried alive to solve that problem? Seed comes out of his grave, another s A woman gets her head a strong and a hammer with a hammer in an endless order from a point of shock value. <br /> <br /> The Seed family takes him home , Threatens to kill his wife and daughter, after killing his wife with a nail gun, Top saves himself in the head, seeking to become the seed (also dharincakapoyina in his pursuit of his guys, never give up even one word. <br /> <br /> However, it does not even have any dialogue). Boll goes for a blueline shocker end where she grabbing a daughter with a dead father to grab people who are watching the video in Seed 3. <br /> This is a message that relies on some key scenes and their shock value. I do not remember a movie of this emotion of any emotion or message or entertainment. It's like watching the August underground ... fine with me, some people will enjoy this bleak snuff. But initially the fake-message and the film's camera-work and effects are taken into account, and the performance is also good for these waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> How did Boll make money for "films" when talented directors worked thousands of budgets? Lucky wave is not just ludicrous that the "seed" is simply a free market error, and its standard of living, just the German taxpayer, will be reduced for these waste.
