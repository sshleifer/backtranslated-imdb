I do not make a mistake, I'm a fan of many of Woody's movies, his last 70th artworks (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and in the late 80's / early 90s (Hannah, Crimes and Mistiminers, Husbend's Wives) Melinda, anything, short time crooks) but it's probably the last year's match point but El I could be wrong, but this is worse than I have endless. It was <br> lazily plotted - match point Manhattan was taken out of a cross basically between Murder Mystery and short time crucures with all the jokes - Woody was the most slurring, as well as on his way to deliver his lines and delivering all of it in the 'hilarious' catchphrases The bland music is a lot of bear until 'I understand it all about ...'. /> <br /> I know most actors are queuing work but they should at least read the first script - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are much better than this - and Woody has a sense of what he has about 20 miles behind. <br /> <br> Behind the camera's character really should take more. It's not so tragic if we're not very great Woody movies. But it's clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort, Woody should call a day before he is an industry joke <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly bad
