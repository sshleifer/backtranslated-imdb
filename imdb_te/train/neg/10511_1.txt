<br /> <br /> Watch out for horror fans: There is only horror when you experience 95 minutes of waste in your life in a picture that is insulting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Other good budget slasher movies are not just an excuse to use the pieces of the same lame set from the same but not as good. <br /> <br /> The promise of wild nimps to dance is very good. This is not SO. Enthusiastic cinematography "Fallen angels" are sexy about the average homeless person. <br /> <br /> Tom saving name has a long history of horror style: he is the king of low budget special effects and low-budget acting. It may be a reason to come to think about it and not watch this movie. He's not bad, but he's always been in bad movies. <br /> <br /> But, to focus on a positive attitude: the forest of Damned is a great example of how not to be prepared. A movie. <br /> <br /> All the rest are negative. Naturally writer is allergic to reality. The script is terrible. It was given the first 10 minutes later. But clueless pacing; The director sees "plot" and "character" as a nuisance. Tension, chronic and boring driving, walking, and nature sequences (no doubt that there is no doubt that the film is to increase the time to qualify for distribution) is not entirely attributed to the film and story heroes. <br /> <br /> This is another good example of a number-one way you can tell if a movie is bad: if the same person is written and directed, it can face the worst.
