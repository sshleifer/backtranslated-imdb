(Spoilers) Wow, it's bad. I duped when looking at an older Star Trek episode the other day-it's all a bit of sickness and a bit of nuts-and Stewart Moss, it's unlucky 'hero' night! He first worked as a first member, who dies from terminal depression. I do not think I saw his own film many times, it will cause depression. This film is really filled with people who are unreliable. The film does not have a redemption role, not one. It is very difficult to think of Dr. Beck's bat (or he's really changed). Because you do not like him. And you do not like his dark, bony mistress, or sordid shameless sargent. Ward, or Dr. Meesus Love ... So why should you invest in this film or power anytime? If there is no philosophy with the characters, there is no reason to care about it. Not terrified cinematography, they were filmed with urine, and five percent of bat special effects, most of which appear to be pieces of paper, thrown as a fan of mobs of bats. I'm not the worst movie I have ever seen in MST3K, but it's definitely there in the lower ranges.
