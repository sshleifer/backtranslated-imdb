The film shows that the animal's life has been hacked by a machete of the animal deformity and removed its skin. I know this horrible things happen in the world, but watching movies based on the fact that what I actually see happening on the screen is actually happening. <br /> <br /> These live animal clips are not intended to be in the movies, but are meant to show individuals from certain organizations that help human beings do other terrible things. <br /> <br /> It should be prohibited and destroyed. <br /> <br /> The film should be removed from the public. The person who made the film needs mental help.
