I agree with "Jerry Springer" for five minutes. I do not think of a snob, but I'm just looking at what's in my show. <br /> <br /> I saw this film as part of the Social Studies program. I was told that this film is really related to Springer, instead it is centered on the lives of those who appear in "Springer". How good is this film? I agree, I feel embarrassed to Connie (Molly Hagan). It is in her life. <br /> <br /> Jerry is very sad to take part in her program to solve this issue. <br /> <br /> Molly Hogan: I'm really sorry about this. After the film, did she notice that she was basically banned for "B" roles on TV? I told you about Haga. She is the most beautiful and intelligent woman. There is no doubt that she is very serious in her acting and she is trying to play her roles with empathy. The problem is that Hagan can not carry a scene of his own. She does not know what to do to make her the main character. Her best work is always Angel in "Hermann's Head" (it's not great, but its heart is in the right place) and when she proved to be "Seinfeld" as Robert's sister.
