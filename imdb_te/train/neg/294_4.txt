The baby rug begins to break off the shower scene in a tribute or the psychedo. (I am leaning towards the rip off.) Then gets worse and then surprisingly, almost the point being the original point. Bad acting and enthusiastic directing to reduce a very simple short story, but the film has already surpassed many people in the south, "Yankee comes to the south to break the southern part". <br /> <br /> Head of college girls group head. Summer holiday was laid down in Georgia by a flat tire, after Ladderdale and the main road. (Yankees Note: Be on the road when you go to Florida.) Sue Ellen (Lisa Stahl) is the pee cut so she heads into the woods. The local sheriff (Tony March) kills his mistress (merry Russell) when he finally finds a good place to do his business. (Note to Yankees: Do not go into the woods when in the south, you may not have seen a murder, but you can run next to a cannabis garden). It's not the story, the movie is actually coming up, but actually comes closer <br /> <br /> Although Tony March has never been on his Oscar talk, the sheriff Dean is a simple person's mess. <br /> <br /> Do you like Tom la deputy Scott and the southern deputy is as standard as I have seen from the Walton Goggins (deputy Steve Nichy) in 1000 Carmel House. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes in the movie. The girls will stop at BBQ in South Carolina and demonstrate their ethnicity when checking a large black man. Sue Ellen hides behind a few grass bays and hides in her haggard with a big snake in a frightening real moment. <br /> <br /> In a tight scene, Sharif Dean says he is raped by Pati (Carol Codyby) and her dress. Dean Radio was drowned by what he was doing. On the radio the teacher must go back and read his Bible. His sermon how Jesus had saved Jesus through the blood of Jesus Christ. I forgive the flock of these preachers. Jezebel is in the Old Testament some thousand years before Christ is born and is one of the five people you meet in Heaven.
