I saw thousands of horror films. (My favorite type) This is the worst of the movie. For me, drive an image with an idea. So, a poorly-starred, cheaply made movie will be good. Something strange is made of cheap. However, it is very little to say. Initially I did not understand what to do with the picture of the karate scene. Something is impatient. Keep your pain!
