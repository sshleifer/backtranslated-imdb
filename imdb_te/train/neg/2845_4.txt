The film will change from 4th to 1st without suffering from 3rd or 2nd, grinding gears sappy, b-film all the way to the finish line. Con in the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the film. It's worth watching. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub is very fast, you may lose it. All the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne is not sure of his TCM introductory value from mediocre mess. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in the foreseeable margin of society have become saints - a particularly unbelievable character al. Am I wondering whether he got a job in Cincinnati?
