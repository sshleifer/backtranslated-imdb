I am wondering at the top ratings of the film. I'm completely idiot. Will mothers "visions" when she touches some things or people? And one thing that she touched twice has kept her attention ... just seems ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She is very irritating. <br /> <br /> The girl who played the role of Lori has done a good job and has worked with many supporting castes. <br /> <br /> I usually love the LME and when it came to movies, the open minded seemed to be a ridiculous plot and top acting and it was not for me.
