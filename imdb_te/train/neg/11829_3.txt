I wandered into this movie after watching 82 minutes "borat" tonight, and left too disappointed. I'm a fan of Wallace and Gromit, and often go to see animated movies. I was told, I was shivering and I walked out at a time, but I waited for this film to be good. <br /> <br /> Visuals are excellent and voice work, especially in my opinion, Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen's (I had to remind myself of a few times bulbous head Elder Villain Gandhil and Magneto). One of the animated features for setting the issue of attachment in this movie is for me. In fact, it is then registered as the one on the slipstick, which is reduced by a trake-filled plot, which attempts to give each stop a "important message". It looks like a busted Oscar lure for the animated category and does not surprise me if it takes into consideration that the academy is dismissive and offers its hardware. But if you're looking for an animated feature enjoying rodents, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
