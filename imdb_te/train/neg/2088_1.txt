What a terrific appearance. Fans of science fiction can see anything regardless of quality. While a spin-off span like the BATTLESTAR GALAKTICA remake, something like the firefly is something unusual, which surprised me. This spin-off show is pitiful in every aspect. Acting is juvenile and enthusiastic. The cardboard clocks are always in the wrong science-fi series. The story is bad. The dialogue is worse than the main time soap opera. Decrease in direction and sets are awful. Caprica is a waste of time, waste of time and effort. This is a spin off forever.
