What is this Mish-mash of the most repetitive motifs (snails, shirley temple, swisss, and publicly racist music) by any kind of story or story or character development. The whole thing struck me as a self-motivated "freak show" and I was not the only exceptional casting decisions. It has the experience of itchy acid travel, which is the reason for the drug S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs beyond any level of drug use. The only movie I can compare is Errorhead (my second is the least favorite film of all time), this is a more discouraging intention, but what have I found yet? The total waste of my time. One thing to give me a peek in the inner work of someone else's mind - the consciously mutated conscious of someone else - but to throw me strange visuals for a different desire.
