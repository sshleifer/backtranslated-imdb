This is one of the worst films I've seen over the years! You can catch 5 people out of the streets randomly and they can work better than anyone in the film. It's the perfect waste of time watching. I like ghory movies but it's just plain bad. Acting (and I use the word quite simply) is unclear, tell me who these 5 main actors are doing their first film. Do not waste your time watching this. Hostel is a good way. I can not believe that someone has spent this money, and I hope it costs $ 50,000 to the producers - it looks like a school project that does not have a clue. Did you make this film too?
