I can not figure out why anyone can make this movie for someone else for my life. The plot is tired, acting hurt, language becomes constant foul and sometimes the "F" word seems to be a lack of dialogue, so another pair of 'F' wants to listen to the American people for a good measure. Gasset seemed to be particularly foul and enjoy his part. Forget this c__p, let Shrek rent and have a good smile.
