The authors probably do not have any experience in the army, and maybe not always in the history book, but I still offer some credit to this expensive producer war film to see the long-running role of black soldiers in World War II. <br /> The action is chaos and unbelievable - no episode of combat! There are good product values, but the cast is interesting. New York Giant Rossi Greer saw the buck value I paid for this. The fifth rate in art direction - men wear Korean War Uniforms, and they show up here when the US Army reaches Germany in 1944 is a pretty lousy climate, and here I am the area of ​​northern California. This script does not know why warriors are using black soldiers. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this basic story (ordered by the black command of the racist south officer), some men with Springfield Rifles instead of M-1s) should be expanded into a big budget product, now it is not too late to try it out. <br /> <br /> As previously seen, there is more sense because there are black war forces operating in 1944.
