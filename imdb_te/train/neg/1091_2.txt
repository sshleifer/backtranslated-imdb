Dreary. Schlocky. Just plain terrible and awful. Be honest, you can not even imagine great art or light mainstream entertainment when you sit to see something called double-D avenger. You're probably expecting a cult image type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts. You can not really get them in this video. Kitten Natividad runs the local pub, finds her breast cancer, gives no ills and a super-human capabilities, back and fighting, worn as a double-de-avenger, and prefers to compete with the local strip club. . When the stories were gone, I looked at it very badly, but another reviewer called this hanging as horrific. Action sequences include zip, drive, motivation, and tissue thin. Acting is not exactly campy and dialog pits. Nothing, and I mean the huge hand boob hints are funny from wincing puns. All the girls that can be made for it can be forgiven, but they are all short of way to fall. Kittens, Haji, and Raven de la Croix are much older (still still in their own ways) and have not disclosed anything and have become contradictory to what they are trying to do: the old, the campy caricature of their ancestors. Instead, they are dumb and depressed-the vehicle's "cast" rather than their own abilities. There are some other lovely ladies, but you really do not see much of anything. PG-13 will definitely have a rating for this. Material, actresses, and director all tired, tiresome, and dated - and again - not funny! It's a cruel bell plus this sitting by this, and it's a shame as I expect something campy and fun. The only person who plays the Bubba is the only real smile to me. He is not good at all in your mind, but every time he opened his mouth I kept thinking how awfully awful. Here is a lonely bright spot Mr. Science Fiction, Forest J. Ackerman, who played a curator of a wax museum, called his wax Frankenstein affectionately called Frankie. Other than this full fall - now how is another tired, terrible, soft pen!
