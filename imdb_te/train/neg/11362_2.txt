"Moon Fly to the Moon" has to be the worst animated film I have ever seen. It says something because I have taken my son to see every animated release in the last 4 years. The story is generous ... simple. Voice acting is confusing, very cute noisy. Rafer room variation of humor. Animation is a nicloton cartoon type but it is not released on big screen cable television. <br /> It comes because 2 is only 3-D visuals. Some scenes have a minimalist stimulating image, but in the past we have seen much better. In many scenes, the filmmakers have questioned the pressure that the characters can fly apart from the screen. First of all, it is tiresome after 3rd or 4th. <br /> I said this thing, this is a very good soundtrack. And not too silly about my son for the record. Bad movie.
