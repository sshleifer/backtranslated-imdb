If Edward Woodward is in the films watching this film, then he is shouting in horror. <br /> I'm sorry but it's enough. Let us get to Carter, the Italian job, Alfie and just get this. What are the similarities? No. Not exactly coincidely, Murdoch starring Maurice Mickey White and another great British actor. The main common ingredient in the sources is the British of the films. They did not want to impress Hollywood. Quirky English movies with the only charm / atmosphere they can not replicate in America. What better way to destroy a cult image than the word CULT and a remake or a bustle with a sequel. <br /> <br /> Wicker 06 also has a tough task before it comes to the road. Wicker 73 is more problematic, the other is called Cult Films; <br /> Here comes a remake. <br /> Here comes the remake. Do not worry. There is no real harm in making this restructuring. Some of the main elements of the story are reworking for the modern USA - Communications, Order, Virgins. But it's about the whole campus. That's why we've got a nice nail style with a shock music fabric for cheap fright. Then with any mobile phone mast on that island that leaked out communication - but this does not happen in the real world. Cops just did not go out. Instead of confrontation with his beliefs, give blood relief for inspiration and you have remake. <br /> It's just that all is laid with a trowel. The name changes are just hammy, almost on the cari, there is no perception of the community on the island, the center of town to capture your bearings, a few dotted dots about a jungle and it is there. Willow does not just give any information and it is inadmissible that Cage will stay away from her. When he goes into the well, he knows he will lock it out. The screenplay was eventually signed all the way - and you just wanted to hurry it and finish it. Epilogue is totally happy and does not know when to stop. <br /> <br /> That is the best way to summarize the difference between the end two. After the most horrific day ends in the most beautiful sunset. <br /> <br /> I loved the original but went to the open mind with the movie and was happy to see the movie. This image is probably forgotten forever in this knowledge that somewhere end up under the road, this time is mercifully forgotten forever.
