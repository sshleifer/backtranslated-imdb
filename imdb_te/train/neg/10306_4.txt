After watching over a dozen episodes, I decided to exclude this program because it depicts mathematical modeling. Charlie mocked my career in episodes that evaluate future behavior of people using mathematical models. I am not a mathematician, rather a chemical engineer, but I work a lot of mathematical models. <br /> <br /> First, choosing the right model to assess the situation is a demanding task. Charlie Eppes is presented as an intellectual, but he has to spend considerable time for a suitable model, specifically trying to predict what to do or predict where in the near future. Individuals are arbitrary and haphazard and are not modeling for them. Isaac Asimov wrote about it in the 1950s. If a particular type of person has a pattern, this is a probability (which means that it is a good chance of misunderstanding). <br /> <br /> Second, a situation has been detected, model parameters should be familiar. These parameters constants equations like gravity acceleration (9.8 m / s2), and are often not easy to detect. Again, Charlie Eppes has to go beyond intellectual to know the correct parameters for his chosen model. And after the selection of model and parameters, they have to be tested. <br /> <br /> Third, the most important aspect of modeling is not always nearly constrained, not numbers alone, and even neglected by science. -fi movies: A calculation attempt to solve these patterns. Excel will try to solve a complex design with several equations and variables and find a very tough task. Although Charlie Eppes is the right software to fix his specimens, he may be stuck with hardware that is terribly slow. And with the proper software / hardware combination, the model solution can take days to get better. He immediately solves them! <br /> <br /> I use my computer in my drama research, and I'm very happy. <br /> <br /> This is the best performance by play. The characters are stereotyped somewhat, but even in the Big Bang Theory is not even remotely funny. Crimes are dull and Charlie Eppes solves them, and sometimes the FBI is pretty inefficient. <br /> <br /> For some laymen, the program can work. For others, the way of dealing with things makes it difficult to swallow!
