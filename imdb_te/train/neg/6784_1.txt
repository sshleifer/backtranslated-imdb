<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> The film did not understand what good reviews came from. These people who are giving good reviews are trying to hype this film for marketing purposes. Their reviews are very dubious and it looks like an inner job, making things even more pitiable. Movies must get positive comments on their own steam and positive ones !! <br /> Acting is a cheesy porno memorial, and is not a funny way. I do not care how low budget films do bad things if they know how to work. <br /> <br /> I am irritating the main character. His facial expressions and humor are unclear childish. I thought it was deliberate to make this women's conspiracy more fun and established, but they were worse. <br /> <br /> The script is also very awkward (overcoming his boss's business speech) and unfunny sarcastic comments. <br /> <br /> I have not received any redemptions about the film than the attractive women of the film. <br /> <br /> I never thought this rating was misleading. I am interested in its premise but I am scared by the rest. If you like, of course, see, but I did not want anyone to waste up their hopes / their time. <br /> Maybe it's just me ... maybe not.
