The film is like a real life, with my intention - not more than 2 hours or more, many of the game plan or plots are often not seen in the cast (many critics have claimed their invisible "experimental" lighting). <br /> A big bore. Allman is surprised by this power - he is a very different actress (yes we all love "Gasford Park", but "Pret A Porter"? Kansas City? Dr. T. and the Women? Ayorg) The raw material is a story of John Grisham, and It's a wonderful cast that you can get through a better cast by crowding your silk sleeping - it's really shady Makes the film's masterpiece. <br /> It's not too bad.
