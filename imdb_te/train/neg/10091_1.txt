I can not believe this film has ever been created. I thought it would try to make a piece of the artwork for the directors but it would be further deteriorating. Look at the zombies as they apply very eye makeup. Zombies are in the picture in a few minutes. Finally, the total of five or six teams is not exactly a country. The best part of the film, if so, is that the painful experience was eventually completed. To reiterate another user's comments, the Voodoo priests are amazing and do not make much sense in the overall picture. Moreover, there is a scene with a snake and a famous girl, which is not just meaningless. It does not explain.
