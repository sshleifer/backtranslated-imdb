I saw a small scene in some advertisements for the first time, and I thought it would be entertaining by the show. The little robot man looks pretty. The animation style does not look like some sort of classic shows. Before the show was broadcast, I studied it through some sources. There, I was a little scared. Three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) were declared adequate but the robot boy was an exception. It would have been much nicer if he portrayed a young lad. A good example is Robot Jones, "What Was Happened To Robot Jones?" The presentation is not really bad. But the way the robot boy accidentally filmed was my criticism. Therefore, I do not have to watch too much.
