As Engineer, I said the first season of the show was very good. Applied mathematics is highly acceptable and the relationships with the Eppes brothers and their fathers show an interesting edge. <br /> <br /> After the first season, the show was heavily dropped. Mathematics and technology used in crime solutions are now very unpleasant and very ridiculous for all those involved in scientific technology and technology. <br /> <br /> The money from the actors is still ok and I am still going to produce every episode, but in the end, it has been a degraded flavor recipe that has a Grade C Action thriller and a CSI style cap show mix. You're about to see, go for the first season and perhaps the second episode. After that I did not waste my time. I showed the midway from Season 3. <br /> 1 season - 8 stars season 2 - 5 stars season 3 - 3 stars <br /> <br /> 4 stars. Since Charlie does not know his mathematics anymore, I'm not exactly sorry for me.
