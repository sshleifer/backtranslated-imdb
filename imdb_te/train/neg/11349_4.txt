Actually, it's a lie, Shrek 3-D is actually the first 3D animated film. I bought it on DVD for 3 years ago. Did Bug Life do it too? I'm at Disneyworld at that tree, so they went there and used the logo there. Also, Shrek 3D is a motion simulator in Universal Studios. It should still be considered as a movie because it appears in "Theater" and you can buy it on DVD. The picture is beautiful, at least there are small flies. I liked IQ. I agree with an animator, they just did a god job to make a movie out of an outside-back adventure. I recommend family and children.
