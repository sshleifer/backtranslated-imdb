This TV-made thriller is all talk, short action. It is difficult to set up its convoluted plot, yet the muddled muddled is still cloudy at best. In the end, I know these characters than I did at first. It is a partial-"ten little Indians" scenario, but it is good for Sally Feel and a murderer to betray her. The field rarely sees a gracelessness from her overacts here. Early introductions are good, but the writing quickly leads to off-straws and eventually goes to the top. Hysteria, and constant thunder and lightning effects (which does not add anything). An interesting failure from producers Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg. With all these talents, could they give us something more than a full script hiding in the red room with red herring and the entire room of Sally?
