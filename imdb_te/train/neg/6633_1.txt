Where to Start? Is it best to explain how painful the film is? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not too funny. Add a group of actors acting in a group of musicians - Meet Loft is terrible and Deborah Harry is worse. <br /> There are also plots. Working on Alice Cooper's program indicates a life-secret, whose goal is to be a group for Alice Cooper. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, they can not come up with an even more convincing final scenario - well, I will not destroy it. <br /> <br /> There are some actors who tell you that the film is "B" or perhaps worse. Gailard Sarten was one of them - and he has a more prominent role. Remember that the film is probably not very good. If nothing else, the film will live up to the lowest expectations - the worse than the poorest. <br /> Say it now. It is the opposite against all the bad movies. No worse than Roddy.
