I'm a big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is terrible. Jenna Jameson married Brad Armstrong at the time and he was the director of the film and Jenna was the most sexually romantic star ever. So, Brad tried to make a lot of money to stay away from this big budget porn movie. Now I know why they do not make big budget porn movies anymore. In a fantasy world, porn stars can work, but it is a real world and they can not work. So if romantic stars, such as Jenna, could have acted, then she tried to go into mainstream movies instead of romantic movies. Because your beautiful you are not a movie star. This fine example is Tracy Lords, one of the most beautiful and sexy women on earth when she was 20 years old. She did not star in the low-budget mainstream movies. Where is she now? I gave 1 rating because I was too hot for Jenna, but there were good films called "Dream Quest". Come on Jenna, we do not want to hear you talk, you want to see sex. Also, you can have many fans and more money in your bank account if you have done the anal on the movie, Jenna.
