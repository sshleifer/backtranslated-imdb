I feel like war wars to commemorate the war's intimidation, avoid idealism and respect some of the fundamental principles of militaryism. Zvezda just makes it first. Zweedda was a Russian war movie, I was expecting patriotism, pity, cute poetic images, a lush score, slavic cheekbones and ruthless Germans. I do not necessarily need a simple love affair, misunderstood crazy war scenes and the misuse of Siripi's soundtrack about all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust), but it's insulting to our understanding of the history of "free of Poland". As a film, he is not clear.
