Pia Jadora is unique! When I saw it, I remembered the classic cartoon showing the Hollywood starlet; Fearing to typecast for 'b' film or soft romantic characters suggests the need for another character; She said in the casting session, "I can not do the necessary roles to be naked, but the artwork is essential for the film ...............". This memory has brought a lot of naughty image of a single cartoon showing a pia in a session, "I usually do not take any characters that really need the actual acting, but it really gives me enough disclosure to enhance my rank as sex ..." ............ "It's probably unjust, misinterpreted in Harold Robbins's book, , And probably Pia (who won a performance at Butterfly) deliberately filmed her role in an unwanted role, although her piece was sarcastically portrayed. [Edit] Critics generally disappointed the actors for the first time, but it was unfair; script writers and director The real problem with the "Lonely Lady" is the real book, the screenplay appears for material rather than the material, and nothing will help in this. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is unlikely, but the story is more of a good script Although successfully filmed, it is a matter of personal verdict with Tatar directed and really effective acting. As it is released, my viewer ratings can be based on whether it evaluates my personal impression or assesses what the film is going to do. It has two of my personal ratings ten; But to some extent this film delivers correctly about its sponsors, and based on this, the quality rating of ten is reasonable. To be clear that in a volunteer mindset, and not to blame the pia for my disappointment, I give the IMDb rating of four.
