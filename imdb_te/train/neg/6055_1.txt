I actually gave this episode a two rating - I wish I felt more about it now. I have negative rating options. <br /> <br /> When I started looking at it, I was amazed how worry I was. I admire Ron Perlman, and John Carpenter ... So what's wrong? Last season episode 13 was removed due to the issue of miscarriage. I think that this season Mr. Carpenter was able to do something in the gray area so you can not see it immediately if he is a positive choice or anti-miscarriage. This is when I sat down and thought about it only when he realized that he was a very miscarriage - 'mom' when the baby was shot and killed, and when the 'father' was afraid, it would eventually be clear to the subject. Who will fall in distress, leaving the mother safe? But you can also see the role of Ron P. - if anyone can prove a threat to the past, they can not control the police as soon as they can ring. Instead we are dealing with the most sympathetic guard (only to pay for the end), whether or not I have strong opinions on something, but I do not agree with it <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> "Music retro 70 and just plain does not work (except Ron P.). <br /> <br /> A lover of a monster to forgive <br /> <br /> It's not nice to show a monster. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I'm happy with having horror masters- I do not mind sitting through some really poor episodes to find the ones that are good.The bit of renting horror movies from the video store - every now and then you get a better I will agree with this poster, master S will have to change the name of the - some of these people do not deserve the title. (Let me stress - I hated this episode, the title of John Carpenter arhuralaniatanu Master thru and thru)
