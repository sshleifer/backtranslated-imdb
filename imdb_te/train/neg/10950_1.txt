If I knew, the film was filmed in a feisty and thoroughly motivated dogmat 95 style, and I rented it. Whatever it was, I took the play for dramatization and gave it a shot. So much, too much, minutes before I gave up. <br /> I saw the last French movie "Romance" I saw and it's also very tedious, but at least the camera is stable and the characters do not breathe down the necks down. I blocked the continuous popularity of Dogmia 95 abroad - it will catch at the same time during the big extremes after America's conspiracy. (This is called the Dogmem 95 because it is the average number of actors moving through the camera. <br />
