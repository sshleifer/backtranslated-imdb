In 2002 the code was coded in HRGD002, in the ASIN, VFC 19796 disk, a DVD that was published in the UK without the IFPI code in the inner edge. <br /> Maybe transferred directly from VHS. <br /> <br /> There is no point in commenting on the adult film. But this one has a lower plot, and the characters are believable. <br /> <br /> In 1975, I saw myself in penicillinia. <br /> <br /> It deserves a place in the encyclopedia of movies. The DVD has no specific features and subtitles and is probably made using the VHS tape as the source
