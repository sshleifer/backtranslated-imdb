The 1977 fantasy film, found in the home of the wealthy socialist doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassell), includes two crazed lesbians (Sandra Locke & Coleen Camp), hoping to help them find a home that they do not find. When George's wife left the town, George ran up and recalled two other ideas to kill a delivery boy and recollect the two when one evening died. Bizarre and disturbing movie, but the movie ends, so both get the same bizarre. Much would be like getting it off or about 30 minutes after this ludicrous movie was caught up. Some people regard it as a cult classic. <br /> <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
