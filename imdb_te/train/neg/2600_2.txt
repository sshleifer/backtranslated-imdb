Here a film fails to fail, and the film fails. Terrible script, lousy acting, amateur direction, ridiculous special effects ... it's a completely awful movie. Not to mention the fact that when you come to the end you'll realize that the whole thing is not a sensitive one. It's ridiculously impossible, since the whole picture of what is happening around the world is that when things are finally explained, you know that the story has been built on the foundation. "We are sure that the movie will never be a movie" Drew Barrymore ". If some of the ungodly causes you to sit and watch this house, Instead of taking your wall over your head for 104 minutes, it was proved to be a more pleasant experience than sitting by this garbage.
