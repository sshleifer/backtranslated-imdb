Although I'd heard that "Comma di Gato" was the worst Brazilian film of the decade, I watched giving it a chance; After all, the director / producer / writer Alexander Stalker made his first feature for US $ 4,000 - even though it's cheaper - in the end it was not a big big sponsor or productive company to show up in theaters (as I saw it). But you're ready to give it to "Comma di Gato", they will be cut down in 10 minutes: this is an unbelievable, unfair, theoretical, theoretically and technically catastrophic effort to portray as a group that breaks Brazil's upper-middle class youth. The neo-Nazis are hooked on bad sex, drugs and violence (and they are also made up of closed-smokers), an unseen trace of talent, fiction, skill or feeling. Visually and Artherally, you recall the worst enthusiastic thing you can find on YouTube - only here it will be ninety two (count'em) minutes of disappointing hysteria and clumsiness, and it's also not funny bad <br /> <br /> We all saw the story before : Bored young guys want to have fun, go wandering, drugs and everything goes wrong - gang rape, buttocks, murder Adavasattu death (falling down the stairs!), The mother of one of the boys, and the mother of the girl in the garbage drained out with the boys decided to burn the bodies. Ethical and literary rubbish, get it? <br /> <br /> The film was heavily influenced by Larry Clark (especially "Kids" and "Bully"), although Clark's pictures - although moral and romantic - are high-class masterpieces compared to this trash. I do not think there is such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to suppress his thoughts in the audience's voice: Stalker makes us call and tries to force his non stop stop morals into his brains with repetition and discouragement - you have a lot of ambiguous, cheerful, moving direction, moving camera and awful acting. He's got an addiction with smartie / cutie comments, and how far did the prophets get it: technology (images, framing, sound recording, soundtrack songs, dialogs, sets, editing, etc.) And by making a comment at a point of cunning (I will be in that relationship). <br /> Despite his macromonic targets, Stalker feels that we can not produce at least a visual or narrative structure - he uses embarrassing realism (hand-held video camera) or repetitive sequences, using alternative tapes, etc.). Yes, he can not even determine WHERE to keep his camera (there is a touch of camera for three leads)! In this conversation there are common speakers who are always spoofful; The heroes of the heroes are only for his characters and what they stand for to justify hateful hatred. <br /> <br /> What you see is a filmmaker, hateful, preachy, condemning, and morally free of any talent (or technique) to go with it. <br /> <br /> It is very frustrating to find a kayo blade in this mess. One of the most disappointing young film actors in Brazil, with the emotion of a dog with his puppy eyes and the emotional edge that reminds Sal Minos, Blate is more effective in the direction of good ("Karendi", "Lavaura Arcarica", "Probido Feder"). Here, he says he's going to go on top and he has recently been playing some of the "actors" bore under the most awkward in memory. <br /> <br /> The film enters the dangerous landscape in rural sex depot scenes (thereby revealing themselves as web-cam porn). <br /> The movie opens and "typical" (with middle class youth) - wants to take us as a "proof" of the audience trying to teach him in fiction. But he is undoubtedly pleased with his face, choosing a highlight of the evil, racist, sexiest, stupid advertisements (which only shows it everywhere). Brazilian middle class young people want to prove that they are current or future fascists, who are enjoying middle class and entertainment drugs (who is all neo-fascist drugs or do drugs support fascist behaviors?). <br /> <br /> It is bad for 1,000 reasons for its dogmatic self-esteem, headache-stimulating technique and brain-borey bore, but most of it is harmful in a very artificial way: the Brazilian film's critics give a powerful case of argument . "Comma di Gato" is the best unwatched, unmentioned, buried and forgotten.
