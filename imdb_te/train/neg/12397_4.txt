The film is going to be a remake of the 1949 film Noir, "Chris Cross." I was disappointed with the next but it was better than this film. <br /> <br /> The film is a "Nai-noir" from modern times and it is in color, and two purists will disqualify the film noir status. <br /> <br /> The biggest disadvantage of this is not cinematography (it's good) but a cumbersome storyline. Hey, some 40's were like Dashyam Hammett stories, but I did not care for some of them. Here the filmmakers did not help the situation by placing flashbacks into the story that appeared in every three minutes. It is with this article. It's ridiculous! What happens is that by the 45-minute mark, their very confusion is no one cares anymore. I know I did not.
