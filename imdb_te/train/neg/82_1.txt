This film sucks. It really is in vain in my life. Acting is bad, the plot is totally inconvenient. Long, long story short, these people are "frightened" by this curiosity "crazed killer", but fail to fight completely in any way. After they took a raft without a gear on the camping expedition, it would be displayed on a camp site, which was already assembled and full of food and clothes and daughter headphones. In addition, after their boat is missing, they are concerned that they are caught in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they never consider that they just climb from the woods as he is getting them. As I mentioned, this movie sucks. Complete joke. Do not let your girlfriend see you.
