For Daniel Auteuil, `Queen Margot 'is much better. For Nastassja Kinski, 'Paris, Texas' is much better. The ending of the film includes the biggest disappointments from Chris Mengs ('Cris's Cross' and 'A World Wear') and Goren Bregovik for the version of the same musical background from the "Queen Margot" for the film. If it's an American pop movie, I'm not all surprised at; But for a European film with more independent actors and directors, the same general approach to child abuse is very simple and frustrating, without real awareness. There are bad guys that kidnap and sell people ages. There are those poor children who hate people who sell people and wait for someone else to be saved. In the end, is the big hero who killed all the bad guys and saves these poor kids from the bad guys. Each character is shown in terms of normal black and white: evil and good evil. Plus, at the very beginning, I did not understand how the end of the story. Is this the end of history of child sexual abuse history? I believe that childhood abuse and pedophilia is a difficult problem that is more complex than how it is painted in a very original film. I think this film is not disturbing, but it is very frustrating.
