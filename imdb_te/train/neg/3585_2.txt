Generally a big fan of gorilla movies, I guess this great guy - and gorilla effects, they're all good - I can write about this flap. The film is based on the true story but does not come close to what actually happened to "Buddy" - in real life, the famous Gorgandou, was sold to the ringing bros. Many animal enthusiasts who do not know Gertrude Lindsay, animals that are very interested in her animals. As Buddy is aggressively portrayed, it is the whole fabrication, and at any given time Gorilla does not resort to such behavior in real life. In fact, Buddy did not escape his wooden crate (a costly cage room shot in the movie), who sought shelter and beauty in his home, and Gertrude Linz feared to sell him. No, Buddy was not released into a gorilla family around lush trees in a zoo - he was left in a wooden round, deep in a garage behind a garage for some time and then sold to the circus - until he died in an event in Miami Country gorilla, on the way) where he had thrown him with peanuts until he died Lived a good life in the county. In the film, note how big buddy will grow, but chimpanzees are never aged. (Pictured in the film, with chimps, not simultaneously with other animals, including buddy)
