<br /> It is said that there was still another hour and 20 minutes left. <br /> Why, Oh, why the author / director cut, snip? Apparently the author / director has done shorts in the past; It's okay, it's okay. But the lack of dialogue starts with the iron grid after twenty minutes. Lack of music glare too. Background sounds (speak, traffic, and especially ubiquitous helicopter) get older much faster. But the worst failure is in the story. <br /> <br /> One hour later we again saw the same scenarios variations. I nearly screamed at the screen, "We get it, we get it !!!!!" After leaving the theater, we went home and was ready to bed for watching the Daily Show and parts of the Colbert Report and it was amazing that the audience was still frozen in the theater. It is not enough to sink your attention. You need to give your audience a sense of view.
