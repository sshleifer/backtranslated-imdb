What can you say about this movie? It's not terrible, but it's not good! Two days ago I saw Lilies and it was one of the best gay films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This story is unclear and acting is right. It's not bad enough to turn off, but it has some bad moments and some terribly stereotyping. It did not work well. <br /> <br /> Do I recommend this film? No you will waste your time and money. I do not understand why such films are made up. Instead of spending your time looking at the Ark of Nova on the logo. I'm trying to go to this movie but I think there's never been there.
