This version will be available in your local dollar store on DVD. The print is not great, or sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 or another minutes, you'll get your money's worth (which is not saying a terrific too). Anna Nehal is very painful as a nannet. Her attractions are back in the day, and they are not clear in the film. Helen Broderick, Jace Pitts, Arden also have a lot of good actors in this movie, but the subject is very small for their talent. However, it is interesting to see how such accomplished artists do weak writings. Musical numbers are really terrible (there are only two). Apparently the studio did not force cash into the great music of the original "No, No, Nontet". It's worth it, the DVD is for $ 1.00. It's very valuable to say what you've seen.
