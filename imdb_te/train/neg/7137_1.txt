The cars in this movie are great. Acting in the film is amazing. The plot and driving sequences are not very meaningful and are equally bad. If you're really bothered by movies and someone suddenly goes out of jealousy, save yourself trouble and money. Good movie for racing fans? Well, there is a portion of the wrong name they represent a NASCAR driver as a rally car driver. If you can not tell the difference, look at it, you will have a blast. It really comes down to this, really really nice cars are in this movie, they are terribly driven and totally unrealistic. Very bad plot because acting is terrible. If you want to watch hot videos, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. I'm disappointed that such good cars can represent such good films. Compared to a car class image, they should be racing with raced bicycles.
