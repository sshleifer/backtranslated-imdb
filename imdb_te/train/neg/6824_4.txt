I had a chance to watch the Life of Transformation Sequel when I saw Coyanscotti two or three dozen times and loved each second of it. I was really disappointed as I did not really stand up to the top standards of first. 90 minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my opinion about good film. Philip Glass scoring is not good for the film, and is not related to the first bond or beauty. Compared with Koyaisqatsi the film seemed slow and understandable. A version of a baracas version of Baraka, a similar idea but better. I really hope that the third film in this series does not follow the example of this waste.
