I saw this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke (Jill), and she briefly met in LA at the modeling trade show in her first film. I wanted to see her more, but I thought she was doing well. She is a beautiful and ensured TV host, and from the model, it is not surprising. I was thinking why I was killed, what happened as a result. <br /> <br /> I'm not really sure about the style of the film, I liked the actors I liked to college audiences. I tried to keep an open mind to consider it not my favorite style of heart, but I felt like gaggering outgrown. <br /> <br /> You have an unhappy ending, such as pulling in some places and guessing the powers that have a nasty professor in some places. <br /> <br /> The script, I know this is very difficult and can come down to personal opinions, how many movies have you seen & studied, and that you can relate to one time of time. It was interesting, but found a satisfactory plot and ended up with me. Jill (Brooke Burke) eventually returned to the portal and everyone was satisfied with the donkey and earned a high rating.
