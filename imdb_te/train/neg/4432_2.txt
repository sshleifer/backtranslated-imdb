Tatey Daniel has everything about a terrible old hug that afflict his loving and careless family. There may be about the colonies of France, but Daniel has just had his teeth made with broken fingers (which deliberately left a small child in the park). Sadly, it does not happen here. It is good and acting is fine and there is nothing really wrong with the concept, but it's just SMUG. God, this film also makes love. It's not as intelligent or funny as it does. The only inspiration in the show - sorry, the image - dust and dust from Daniel, and only surprise comes from watching this growing improbable routes. This is true: it's like in a sitcom, the added bonus of the lukewarms and 110 minutes of running.
