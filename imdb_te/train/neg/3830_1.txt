I do not know why I take time to review this waste of time movie. If you want to stay longer in compliance with the satisfactory end? Good, bad, surprise ?? Not. Finally, it becomes darker, formulaic, predictable, dialogue and acting finally. Indoor scenes will light you very much if you zoom out a millimeter further you'd see the camera lights. Costumes, hair dues, and sets are starched, pressed, and pure. Should we imagine that the common people lived in the twentieth century in Arizona? Other reviews' comparisons to Sam Peckinpike are an insult to PekingPack: at least the director likes his violence in the context of confusion and turmoil. There is inappropriate explosive squibs from the wooden counterparts of bad guys with hard men's gore artificial fingernails. Huh?!? I hope Heston might have made valuable things in this film. (He does not get his gun clutch on his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I do not imagine why he signed for this mockery. We want to see the film about the end of the West, as long as we know west end of SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again. The last hard men are jokes of an obituary of Westerns.
