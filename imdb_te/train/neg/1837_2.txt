I prefer a lot of "frat-pack" movies. How bad they are, I like Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell or Jack Black. But "envy" just left me about the cold as white horse dumped Ben. At this time, it is a pair of snake neighbors and a jack black, one of them (Black) finds an aerosol spray to make the animal pop disappear, and others (Stiller) becomes very wealthy when writing in jealousy. <br /> <br /> I think the topic of 'Vapuraz' is amusing first. The problem is, they try to keep the gag for the entire film (the black 'Caca King' is the license plate read) and it gets a lot tiresome. But Ben and Jack are also poorly used; The power level for both shows seems to dial down significantly. Rachel Weisz and Chris Walken both have two best performances. Walking's neo-hippie-dippy guy is an offbeat and well-modulated performance, which really refers to Wakens' other known Natsus characters. It's totally unique and yet clearly comes across Wallen. And Weiss knows no one about the best actress in the business. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br But the story twist is not reliable, because he refers to Jack's role. It plays a sweet guy who is absolutely grateful and embarrassed by all the lovely horse hairs. You totally discount. It's all filler. And what is the point of the out-of-control Merry-Go round, unless Barry Levins wants us to know he's seen "strangers on the train"? Screenplay is painful and the performance of the two main characters is not properly directed. Lewinson's track record is well known. Maybe someone will find something to make this film disappear. Oh, wait, they already have.
