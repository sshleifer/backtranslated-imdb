I watched this movie last week and had the biggest laugh I've done in a long time. The plot of the film is pretty dumb and moves in a badly designed way. Only Cory Savier's impressive ABS is the only plus one anywhere to find. Alexandra Paul (I think that's her name) is a horror like a preacher's wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is grosser and his character is the twist of all. And if she wants to have sex with her son, they throw in the socks solos that need every opportunity! The end of the film and the climax is completely horrific and funnier. I thought hell was your son and wanted to take the baby of a cane that made you feel that you had an absurd relationship with him!
