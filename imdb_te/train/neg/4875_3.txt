When my grandmother returned to theaters in 1998, my grandmother took my sister to watch this movie, so we bought tickets, popcorn and soda, went to the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it was over, the audience did not get strong appreciation, I heard some people do not like it, I did not like it, seeing that it's just stupid, and worth it. Eddie Murphy This is sad, but from him, the whole movie is bad, I rarely laughed in these areas, I also remembered laughed even more rarely to other people in the theater. Speaking of animals in the cartoons, live action films, I did speak the animals I felt really bad because they were completely a monster! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not think it ' <br /> <br /> When I saw Eddie Murphy in movies, I told him that he was the only funny part of this film, and I did not even see Eddie Murphy in the "great" film, Pluto Nash's adventures. The movie is not a film I recommend you should really talk because it is away from AP Murphy, especially the animals that speak because you do not like it! <br /> <br /> In this movie I gave a rating of 10 out of 10 stars.
