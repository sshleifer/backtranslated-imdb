I have already thought about a similar similarity, and I have seen this film for the first time. They say there are materials but there is no plot. I like this picture with a recipe that is cracked in half, along with sexual scenes in child-pornography (I think it's either edited or more apparent than nature) and I do not have any directions on how to overlap in the finished product. From the very beginning, the character development And the story is no more ... Unfortunately, many times in this monotonous drift we play with plot bits and "Ahh-OK ... we're going to learn more about why this scene is going on ... or ... what's this character ... or Finally we are going to appreciate and appreciate this role more ... or understand and engage with this inter-related relationship ... Dalainavi. "But no such luck! On the contrary, many times I turn it off more than once, when the carrot dangled, only to find a small plot w anyway whatever small plots (and poorly submitted) were just great fun. In the end, I continued my mystery, and generally IFC had better options and they gave 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery). Characters do not like some degrees or you can not identify with them or with their Hunnesses ... it can be a little bit more effort. It was shot around Santa Cruz and it was a surprise to me if it was a movie school project. I thought this was a good review but honestly it was an hour and a half a disappointing and frustrated waste.
