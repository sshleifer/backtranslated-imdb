If you hit your teens in the 70s, as I did, the stories about Studio 54 should remember whether or not you like disco. A unique club, a symbol of the 70s of cultural oppression and self-absorption; <br /> <br /> There is also an amazing VH1 documentary about the club that tells you about everything you want to know about it, and stories easily capture the captivating motion picture. <br /> It is. 54 follows his employees' lives, a bartender named Shane (Breen Meyer), his wife, a coat-check girl Anita (Selma Hayek), and of course Mastermanship, Steve Rubel (Mike Meyers). Despite being well represented in the club, the film is closely followed by Shane's story, increasingly concerned about the personal lives of the workers. <br /> <br /> The film works in movies. Sometimes it is summarized in the whole of the night life culture (when Shane is taken to dinner and does not know who is 'Erol Flyint'), and at other times it becomes a hockey drama. Are some of these inherent in the campus? After underlings as they meet in the richest and wonderful world ?? But most children and Rubel are due to children-stirring treatment given throughout the film. Rubel is precisely the scene in New York with his talent and every night he chooses his hand with his hand, and appears to have touched only the prevalent drugs and sexes; And when he mentioned his overwhelming mention, the liar, the cheat, the drug, and the hard-line man seemed to be strong enough for all those who were like hell. I'm looking for people here, but his ego has directly contributed to the decline of his club's fall and nightlife culture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Meyers make his best work to catch Rubel, but he is too small to work here, his performance is surprising. Effective; But he is good, and he helps to dedicate the film. Philip, who usually looks like a good actor, stops here with his character's stupidity and stupidity; He is limited to a deer-in-headlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending fury, and even he does not translate to a stronger performance. Hayek and Mayer are both okay, again, writing, and Neve Campbell tolerant? Prominent on DVD cover? <br /> <br /> In the second half of the seventies, I am interested in the popular culture and I am still impressed. But even if it is ready, it's not a particularly engaged film, although it's ready to be liked. That era, or the club, if you have any interest, I want to keep track of VH1 exclusively than the road drama.
