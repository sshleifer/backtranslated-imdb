Small Version: Seed is not worth it. It's just derivative and low. <br /> <br /> Long version: If you've never seen movies that have a clear "mental horror" style, this film will probably melt your face. Maybe not, but it gives you a good burn. Misuse of real animals is enough to open your eyes on the possibilities of cruelty in the opening montage video, and the next (only) memorable gore scene is probably more than you can handle. <br /> <br /> If you do not have much experience in the film, the climax will be played with your emotion in the film. If you look at the real thing ... "August Underground Pension", for example, is very difficult to stay awake until the end of the movie, just as I did. <br /> The reviewers have compared this to the old video nasties. I understand this comparison. Similar to video nastas, "seed" is more violent than mainstream horror film and less subtle. But video nasties are the only reasons that are still known to us for reasons - there is something special that is still popular. <br /> <br /> "I'm" -Did Dvd: "Today we have no more movies because technology exceeds the imagination and technology is cool, Many of the things do not appear because the movies are no longer producing, they are very expensive, but they are very cold, but they're cool. It's a horror film, this kind of terror film costs more than a million dollars These films are not very expensive ... they are genuine effects. <br /> <br /> The old school is horrific compared to horror, but the head of the crest hit the nail, despite their seemingly exploitative, the best of the video nasty is the original "truth." This is the name of the lesser he's seen in the movies and does not understand them.The checklist has everything ... about BS On, "a scene of torture porn, etc., But kristiti it" cool. "Gore was all CGI. The whole thing will be similar scenes separated from a variety of other images. And the pacing is sooooo slow. <br /> Another interesting note: A gore scene really reminds me of the video game. <br /> Anything BS. Weak image.
