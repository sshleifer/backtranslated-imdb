This image is very bad. Science fiction is usually my favorite channel, so I see all the original movies in the play. I'm not really sure this film is original. A zoo / theme park on the remote island is well known and is well known. What is this, Oh, Jurassic Park. <br /> <br /> The film starts with some stereotypical college children on an island where some kind of treasure hunt. One of them ends with some of the worst special effects I have seen die rather die of death. The blood looked much like ketchup. Also, in the beginning, a scientist wants to make teeth with as much noise as possible to make people happy. Three of them have already escaped and are eating around tourists, or people invited to the island to see the tigers first hand. Again, sound like Jurassic Park. Perhaps the tidy thing is 1000lb saber teeth that somehow shrunk and crawl around his front legs killing the mad scientist with the cat's statue of sorts that the guys go through the neck. The humorous death I saw on TV. <br /> <br /> Acting is very cheesy and special effects are terrible. CG tigers have almost passed for soil models and some sounds are stuck. For example, when one of the college students attempts to escape, he uses the ax to turn the door off, the ax goes into the door and after 2 seconds you can hear the sound. This image is very bad. Though cheesy deaths are very fun.
