Warn you that you do not want to persuade yourself with the names and the red names. _Undertow_ is meaningless and unengaging, and I've often thought of Twain a phrase about wishing all the characters will be drowning. Whenever someone made a category of worst paintings, it's not the likes of the Killer Shrews of _Plan 9_ or _Attack, I think; It's these favorites. No complete waste of time - everyone who participated in my own and this film.
