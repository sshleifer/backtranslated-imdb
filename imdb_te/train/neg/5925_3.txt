This "worse" Star Trek TOS episode? Maybe, at least it will be my vote in the bottom 5. That is, this episode is absolutely nothing. Are you looking for madness? Will you be. It has a different feel to this episode, music is high and almost forced to force the pain to feel, it's the point of sucking. I like some Klingons, Gorans, Tholians, Romans, Trixeslian or Madeusins, which are very boring aliens to make an episode. McCoy describes his famous phrase "Hey Dead, Jim". Spock keeps on protective glasses while shipping the ambassador, but Kirk is not. They can now remember the boring third time now go through that freaking "barrier". At least the next episodes of "The Spectator of the Gun" and "Day of the Dove" and "Follow the Dove" and others follow a good performance to watch me as a good fan of Trek. Personal observations, trek color purple, preferred to use its pink purple, when they were on the corridor outside the compartment, the gray gangway is now purple. We did not see a purple bridge but did not find it interesting, I saw in many episodes, made by a light filter and it works well but in this part, the corridor on the ships is pretty dull.
