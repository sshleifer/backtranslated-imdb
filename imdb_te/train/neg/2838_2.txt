Skip mission: see Galactica and rather the original Living Legend episodes. The network took the parts of the Living Legend 1 & 2 and covered them as a plot with a terrible fire in the space episode. The Galactica network is the best in living legend 1978 TV series, despite the lack of writing controlled writing and proper preparation for the correct production. Fire in space, on its own, is one of the worst parts. As a historical note, see Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the Restoration Trek series, and you will see a difference in the quality between network-made science fiction and syndicate science fiction.
