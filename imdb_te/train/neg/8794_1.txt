<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am completely prevented from liking this film, especially by many critics, very sensitive and insistent in such matters. <br /> <br /> The use of the illustrated example of its most easily illustrated - or absolutely, abuse - is music. In the first half, a really frustrating reggae tune is played three times (once most often). But in the second half, The Mammals and the Papas play "California Dreamin" at least seven times, usually at the highest level. Godsakes, whether or not you liked the song, you eventually like it ill ill. Just think, some people have seen this film four or five times. This means they list 28 or 35 times to California Dreams. <br /> <br /> This unnecessary hyper-repetition (which does not contribute to the story) does not contribute to <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am sure you will never see an HK movie beforehand. <br /> <br /> I am sure you will never see an HK movie first. Do not start it <br /> <br /> If you want to pressure to watch this, avoid all the expenses in the movie. <br /> <br /> You are threatened!
