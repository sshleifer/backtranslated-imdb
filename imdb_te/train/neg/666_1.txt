I have seen this trailer and want to see this movie, I want to see this film, at the same time my girl looked at me and said, "We should go to see this movie." I'm going for at least five minutes. I was confident and enjoyed the cheap bravery but none of them were there. It was one of the worst movies I've never seen director had no effect and again used the same shots and again he did not build up the suspense that the cast was probably just falling off the scream cry. I'd like to see a script like the first 40-minute harassing gyrar mums and bad music, the character did not develop. <br /> <br /> The plot just ... basically I know we are terrified of a high school group on their prom night at an incalculable serial killer, that is brilliant! Mum acting is hopelessly waiting for you in Australian Australian Soap opera, the main character Blondie God Dam is her frustration. Her long line should be half-sentence, and every time she's in the camera she has pulled another barbarous facial expression. <br /> <br /> If you have any taste in movies, this is, and if you do not like and have a choice then I wish good luck, maybe an iPad or magazine illegally. I can not believe this movie has been taken!
