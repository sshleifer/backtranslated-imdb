We open up with Universal Soldier and his Books Asian friend Colonel Luke DeWarrows (Van Damme) by following a river that looks like universal solzers. They kill almost two, then wait Oh, it's just a field test. Devayux is part of a public fundraising company that we are creating new levels of Universal Soldiers that we have now come from. <br /> <br /> It never mentioned to anyone about the original story. The United States government has lowered the Plan Plan for Universal Soldier and invades SETH (a massive artificial mainframe computer that controls universal solzers). Naturally he will not be closed without a fight. So turn around the dungeon and take all new species of universal solzers. It sounds like a fun idea for an action movie and a sequel, but it does not stop becoming stupid as hell. <br /> <br /> For example, one of the new Universal Soldiers is played by Bill Goldberg. You can watch a masquerade cast in action action is not wrong. He is older, he's hard, right? Wrong. Van Dummie does not have a problem with wiping out the floor ... once ... twice ... three times. The point here is lost to me. Then the glass is breaking. Any action is a source of cinema, but anyone involved should have a glassy look. You should watch the fight scenes in particular. Tell anyone not to talk to them or to talk at slips very little. Then, to keep cherry on the train racket, they have a human body with SETH (computer) and how appropriate they are when making a villain block (Michael Jai White). Nothing seems to work better than a white good person fighting a black bad guy. Potentially objectionable and just clear slowness. <br /> <br /> Universal Soldier 2 is a lousy sequel. It's loud, dumb it and ignores it. The original was not poetic, but it made a general sense of concept with a science fiction element and was enjoyed at a basic level. No sequel. They were placed in the ninety minutes' time and found a way to grab some strip club order. So credit is due to credit.
