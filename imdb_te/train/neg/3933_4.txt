A huge hit with Australian audiences may still be funny, but its over-the-top political imbalance and blunt, unsubtle humor make it a bit of a cringer. It goes too long; <br /> <br /> The content is saved for the sequel, Barry McKenzie's Own Owns Holds, although it needs some new stuff. True, his okker Aussie attitude is fun, but the film becomes annoying as drugs. Some crocker songs are the best bits, and they are definitely the same, but "happy"? Barry McKenzie's adventures will be a milestone in the Australian movie, but everything in our power is to ensure that no foreign audience can see the number of Australian audiences like Barry McKenzies (or, in that case, Mick Dundies!). . Rating: 5/10
