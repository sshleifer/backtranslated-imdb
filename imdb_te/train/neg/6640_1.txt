I find it unnecessary to comment on this "motion picture" for a simple reason that there is nothing to comment on it. It's like a rotten knife, which is not good to show the World Expert for the fact that the other endlessly decomposed is the number of eggs. <br /> <br /> Philip is the perfect word to describe the film as well as the other Romanian "motion picture" directed by Lalin Pinteli. <br /> <br /> In the circumstances recommended for people outside of Romania (such as Amazing Camera, Plot Loss, Direction / No Quality of Actors, Sounds etc.) Advanced and Art-like): Enjoy this "movie" (Like I know you) but with other good intentions, be good for IMDb members <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film (with others) has some value Will, it is an example of Education. : "How not to film."
