Sadly the IMDb does not allow me to judge less than 1 judges. What a shame. This deadly picture is very bad, it turned out to be a very damn thing before I really end up. <br /> <br /> The script has some bright movements, but judges can not fully bear the timing of directing, editing, acting, audio quality and line delivery. <br /> <br /> Judges are a modern day comic book style Western, but not actually sort of. The dog on your shoe is very fond of dog pope. <br /> <br /> Video Stories In the audio stream rather than the high school drama class, acting is beyond me. We rent movies to watch what's on television. But the judges are very pathetic SCIFI channel's original messy. I demand my money back from Hollywood video.
