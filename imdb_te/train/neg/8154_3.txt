I do not like until the long list of "big" names in the movie (including the ubiquitous John Mills) could not get me in the role. Stereotypes, satire and standard, set scenes from humble air-ace hero to a lounge furry anchor flyer. At one end of the hour, there was a music track in one song, I thought the film was over: loud, growing crescendo, grand thriving, silent, but the film continued! I found it with an exciting little flurry of real storytelling, chaotic writing, but cleverly uniformed uniforms and pretty jean simons (anterior nose job). I can not say that this film has any of the ingredients made of a movie great. I found moudlins, mockyrs and minors.
