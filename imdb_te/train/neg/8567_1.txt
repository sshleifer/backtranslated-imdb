When I rented this film, I had very few expectations ... but when I saw it, I realized that the film was less (much less) than expected. Actors are bad (doctor's wife is the worst), the story is very stupid ... it works for a Disney movie (except for murders), but this is not comedy, it's a ridiculous work folly. The title is chosen except one thing: add a stupid movie after the Dead Husband! I'll give it from 5 to 0 and half.
