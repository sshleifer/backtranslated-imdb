Light spoilers are here. I'm damaging this picture to make you feel bad. <br /> <br /> Japanese Li's films come in two categories: Shaolin is set in modern Hong Kong, which circulates around triads or triads, such as movies and movies. Each generation has the best and worst films. Twin Warriors' Jet Li's Best Shaolin era film, 'The Evil Cult' is his worst. Recently 'Legend Fist' is the best modern era of 'Jet Lee'. <br /> <br /> Jet Li plays a self-exiled hire, who has received an injection that gives him superhuman ability, but his lifespan is reduced. In his new life of immigrant he plays a peaceful librarian. When his old hire team went on a devastation, Jet Li would be vigilant to stop them. He makes a very silly corrugated mask to hide his identity as a librarian from the police (and public), as well as to hide his true identity to his former comrades in his true Commons. <br /> The dubbed version I saw, and that is terrible at that. If he is a peacekeeper, why does Jet Li capture his library colleague and hold it? Is there a love story between them? Why is the police chief not aware of the real identity of the black mask? The plot is just plain bad. <br /> <br /> Action roles are at the top of the superhero cheese, and martial arts sequences. The film features blood, gore (inappropriate body parts), explosions and matrix style supernatural martial arts. Unfortunately these images are the best and the only selling point. If you want to play Jet Vis a vigilant super hero in Mission Impossible style movie `Black Mask '. The rest of us have a real disappointment for the jet le fans. This is one of the films Jet Lee has never been a jet lite, and he has no chance of charming his charm and is not likely to impress us with his impressive and original martial arts capabilities. <br /> <br /> Ozzy Osbourne's Chinese maqaf is enough to enjoy me in a movie, and the 'black mask' of the sin has been proven to be exception. In fact, he is seen as a modern and old Ozzy Osbourne, in the film, his long hair and trademark round sunglasses. However, the villain is not worth the screen for long enough to make gimmick. I thought it was deliberate on Ozzy; In addition to the villain's appearance, he also led the secret base of satan. Ozzy Osbourne has been able to do far more from the villain Jimmym! <br /> <br /> The first jet Lee film "Black Mask", released on video in the USA, was the only writer or director who suffered only to provide background and trouble with anyone. After Lethal Weapon 4, and I'm happy to stay away from it until now. It destroyed my whole understanding of Jet Li's martial artist and actor. If you want to see Jet Li at his worst, take the 'Black Mask' and 'The Evil Cult' and rent it with double feature or horror, intentionally and accidentally. Otherwise the jet lick's talent sticks to the movements, and the platforms are partially well thought out and acceptable. 3/9 stars.
