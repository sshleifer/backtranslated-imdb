I have read the book "Regularly Written". To be perfectly honest, after seeing this movie, do I really want to do it? Well, I can not review this film. Next I will say that I can not forget the TV movie. Do you know why I say? I forgot what happened in it. I said I forgot. To be perfectly honest, it is better than any TV movie "Merlin". <br /> How can I describe the TV movie? I have never written for a review before. Well, I'll say that they usually have some celebrities. Wrinkle in time is only one. Alfre Woodarddard (or Woodward, I'm not sure), Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The film has special effects on the cheesy, with a slightly more interesting plot, "WTF". This image is too bad and makes you go "WTF". What am I doing? This is a TV movie. They are not usually good. This way. Waste a wrinkle time in time and is a big time lazy. To top it off, you'll have to forget about it a second. Well, maybe secondly. But within a few minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> Wrinkle in: * / ****
