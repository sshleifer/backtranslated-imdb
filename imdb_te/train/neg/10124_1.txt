There is no suspense in this serial! Acting is rare when an episode ends, the effects are very weak, and the script is very painful, the last thing in your mind is how to save Batman and Robin's day. No, actually, the last thing in your mind is watching the next episode! This presentation is very appreciative, I can not see what ever happened, release on DVD only! Obviously, the effects are not similar to contemporary Batman images, but the script is also terrifying. Some nasty professor and an irrelevant blur mess about something like a ray gun or something like this, I'm not quite sure because it's very terrible. 60 version, or 90 versions, or Batman Begins, just look anything on this version!
