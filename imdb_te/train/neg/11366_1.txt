The first (and only) time I saw "shades" took place during a sneak peek. It is not even in the premiere. I remember there was someone in the staff of the directors, even do not remember. This is a Belgian film, we have never heard of it, so we are no neutral and do not have to guess. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he is all miles ahead. He is playing an actor who plays an actor. <br /> <br /> He helps in finding a movie titled "Sheds" in Belgium. <br /> <br /> As soon as the film begins, we notice how much of the standards there are. Nothing against the occasional criterion term. But it's more than annoying. When Rourke uses the F *** term to decrypt something, it comes naturally. However, when someone uses the non-English speaker F **** or S *** from the cast, it becomes proud and aggressive. <br /> F and S are used words. Everyone is happy from the theater. And we have to vote, but it's very hard for us because it's only 0 to 10 and we're looking for -10.
