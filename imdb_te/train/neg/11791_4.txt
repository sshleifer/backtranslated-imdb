I can not get it. The film is clearly a pretty good budget. This is a very good cinematography. It has good motion, good editing and pretty good direction. Why why not hire such lousy actors so it's not so bad cheesy and why they would not work their way into a paper bag so they did not hire someone to make the script's final rewriting? This image may be good. <br /> <br /> This is a very good and good experience but ultimately you realize that this film is not good. <br /> What else is it? Really one!
