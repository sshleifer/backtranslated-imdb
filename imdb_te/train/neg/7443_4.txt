There are some scary scenes, I've always loved more than straight gore, but otherwise the film is weak. It has not answered many questions, and is still unclear when trying to explain anything in the picture. After seeing this film, I lost many ways. It sort of reminds me of Silent Hill a few years back. The film was also unsatisfactory, but it was better than that because it tried to work and the story actually made sense. <br /> <br /> Most of the performance in Abandoned is good, but the film is dragged on and no satisfactory resolution is offered. As I mentioned above, there are some creepy scenes, however, this film is a mess. Sorry, I can not recommend.
