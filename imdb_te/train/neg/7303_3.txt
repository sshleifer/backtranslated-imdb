The first film to be directed by Cabin Fever Eli Roth. Roth and Randy Perlstein co-wrote this story written by Rath. It was a zombie movie featuring George Romero and his "dead movie", and the original Texas Chainsaw Maccarnot of Sam Ramy's "Evil Dead". There is nothing here, and the story is not perfect. This act is similar to the genre, which fails the story. If the film does not achieve the artistic success of the film, he is a director and non-violent, arrogant, irrational (although more prestigious) worst fest hostel. Cabin Fever is not a good movie, but it's artistic work compared to hostel. I believe that someone (psychiatrist) is absorbing this picture. Cabin Fever, Weak 3/10 Not Absolutely No Small as Hostel
