OK Maybe a 13 year old is a little old for me for this film. It's about this pampered rat living in a palace. Then the rat rat snatches him in a toilet! He ends up in this rat city and this girl catches the mouse, he wants a greedy frog. He will send the whole army after this gem and will do anything for this gem. He plans to take the gem and the flood rat city! The slugs for the coolest part about this film. They all make sound effects. They sing, sounds, its amazing, its also pretty funny. OK Bottom line, it is at the age of 7 years. Otherwise, a great film to take a young family member to watch. I'm not like WAllace and Gromit, though the animation is a true dreamwork art. I think they slacked on a little bit. Sorry, the image is not worth the $ 9.50 cost.
