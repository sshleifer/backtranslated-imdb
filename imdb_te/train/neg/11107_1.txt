It's a terrible picture. There is no story. It's all top-off, when they do not explain the blood and gore (only a good part) ... they threw some aliens! I hate when the directors (or whatever) run away from the ideas and blame foreigners! Look at this picture if you like it. But do not say I did not warn you. Two things: how can Winnie say "welcome" when he does not have a tongue? Its zone Jones does not have a big role. The second thing that I am innocent is why we show Vinny Jones' socks and cut them off and keep them blue, then they do not have another character. Why not? I've shown something and nothing with the story's story. In short. Bad story. I would not waste my time - I wish I'd watched the mirrors instead.
