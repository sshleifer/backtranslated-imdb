The most terrible thing for classic characters made by Chuck Jones is "Unique Lonatics Unleashed". "Looney Tunes" has many spin-offs and different versions, some are good, others are not very good .But "Lonatics" is the worst. Performances such as "The Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans" are stupid and derivative. . There is no comparison with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made. The new designs are ugly and animated with curiosity. This program just does not work .The terrible waste of this animation is a complete failure and it 's not more than a bad joke. Togo! Zero stars
