No horrible movie! For some reason, scientific laboratories and outposts are always staffed with a grubby, dirty, average-enthusiastic and inner lifestyle. Those who work with complex scientific schemes do not think that a CGI dragon can agree to how to cope with death. Spoilers: Its main acting skill is "disruptive" and "nasty stars" clone a dragon. The lab is working on this type of thing, and other scientists are surprised because they clearly have to be lagging behind their experiments and catching their pants. Think the rest of the story, or ten little Indians, where the crew was hunted and killed when they tried to create a way to escape and / or defeat "dragon". The CGI Dragon creature is a dark gray color, the most popular color for CGI Special Effects. It looks better than the cartoon, and dark gray tones are hard to see any interesting details in the body of the dragon. It looks gray blob. Acting is less than terrible. These scientists work as a bunch of children who can not agree anything, and this dragon makes it easier to escape, hide, hide etc. Many different attempts to kill them. Dean Cain is the best actors of any film than the cast. He drowned to the level of his supporting actors. The film is actually really bad. Good acting. The story is dumb. CGI is very cheap and arbitrary. There's nothing to be appreciated about this movie, it's not a good time-killer when doing things or doing other things.
