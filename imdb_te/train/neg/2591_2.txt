For starters, I'd say that the American Pie series is a fan. <br /> <br /> Even though the "naked mile" is both worse, this leads to a whole series of downsides. <br /> <br /> At first, the best part of the film is <br /> <br /> There are tons of bad stuff about this movie. First of all, this story has a very old arc structure. First, introduce the characters, then the beta house pledge and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of which is exactly 25 minutes long. In addition to the general stability of the plot, there is little for development of any character, which makes a double whammy of a bad plot. <br /> <br /> <br> Displays jacks such as cool, just-thinking-about-sex guys, and demonstrates clearly that the geeks look less. Women and men are more likely to be as sexual objects as sexual objects. <br /> <br /> Besides, acting is also weak. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you see from a complex horror movie, usually a horror movie. If I see from a teen point, I guess it's good, but this movie is rated 18+ in many countries, so this should not really be visible to minors.
