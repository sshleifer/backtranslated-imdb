This video has an external way to mess up and relate to Americans about Islam. It is believed that the American people believe that Americans are a citizen, perhaps, to protest against this kind of rubbish. If you want to know the truth about Islam, no one will tell you ... Qur'an Public! <br /> <br /> This video uses audio tactics and intended to correct and disrupt them. Even if they do not understand what they see, they prepare people to hate what they see. They use incorrect images from their original content. <br /> I want to respond to the end of the comment ... Do not think that you can do the exact same picture with each religion?
