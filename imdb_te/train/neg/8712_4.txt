Well I have a lot of hopes for this Cannonour movie because the sequels are improved as they come out. I did like Carnosaur 2 better than 1. Should I correctly correct this I figured this a new one correctly? Well ... I realized it was wrong. I was very confused with casting. They brought Ric Dean, a police officer for another spotlight role and Michael MacDonald. For Rick Dein Lall now, in Carnasar 2 I thought he was better suited to the character and was not really frustrated with him, and now in Carnassur 3 WOW they put him as a senior soldier. Now we're getting goofy here. The film actually started a good start to flee out of the small paris trucks out there with a good gun fight and dinos, but soon came the Scott Valentine team we had a romantic comic mix of very funny shows from retarded and floppy dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want, <br /> "Now when they walk, they are back and the heads are not moving. <br /> <br /> There were little hands, and they were less stupid and in place as they were portraying the director <br /> <br /> t-rex is very curious, from the previous 2 movies and at least one frightening look. LOL has seen one thing in the movie, it's the joy of the legs, the old one in the old western and the stuff that's in the john.The LOL has noticed another thing that it does not move hands, they are stuck next to its body and it (the terrible god of sound effects) retarded! Now I am the director and I realize I have this work, maybe I'm impatient Acadaniki try a little harder. The rest of the movie, I have seen so far, the military team sloppiest and loud. They have not understood that drsyamanataku weapons. In the warehouse in the corners roaming they had a hand wrestling scene, now I'm trapped in this scene, because I think this stupidity happened and some losses. Instead the director wasted about 7 minutes of our time. I would like to see 3 stooges of dinosaur films. <br /> You have a military, retarded dinosaurs, retarded illustrations and you have an amazing 83 minutes to spend the day you are looking for. Everyone recommends this movie for 83 minutes of pure entertainment. It may seem like I'm studying but really I am hiding this picture. It's so fun to see, because if you look at yourself, "Did the director really do this badly?"
