I was really hoping that this was a funny show, given all the hype and brilliant preview clips. <br /> Unfortunately, this presentation does not even come to deliver, and talk about the hype, I also interviewed an interview with the show's creator in BBC World Today. . All of the jokes are clear - the kind of funny sound is the first time you've heard them but after being dull - and they have not given any new treatment or twist. All characters are a dimensional. Acting - very mediocre (I'm fine). <br /> <br /> If you are Muslim, I feel like you are stupid to believe in all white characters, and if you are white you probably will. Almost all the white characters are slightly worried about the fact that they are filmed in large, ignorant, or both. The white issue of the white is not the problem - many of the most ridiculous folks emerge. <br /> <br /> <br /> Canada breaks with funny people - most of us can export to Hollywood every day. So what kind of producers of this show can not find?
