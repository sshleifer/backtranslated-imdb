Dark Rising has created a distinctive, distinctly horror / science fiction / fantasy film. It has a strange and vague plot, so you can have big holes that fit the elephant. A lot of the time I do not know what hell is going on but it does not really matter, it's a simple troll hunter from the size of hell to save the story of the campers with the confusing stuff added on witches and the plot is a book plot Elements and characters and completely disappear without any reason. Acting is not bad but honestly I can guess with this script I am guessing. There are only one unrepeatable twin scenes of this bad movie (like most other bad movies). T.V. Give this pass if nothing else.
