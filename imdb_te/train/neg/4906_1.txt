I do not know where to start. Naturally this is designed for a TV movie, so my expectations are low. I was surprised at the whole direction for the second time, but the pictures of the figures appeared before or so earlier. <br /> <br /> And talk about bad chemistry between disappearing Lovebird detectives. <br /> I'm going to go deeper, but this film is not truly deserved. Grade: D + (IMDB Rating 3/10)
