Incredible. Is there any dumber than this? There is no chance. Foolishness in the film was also felt that Ed Wood, De Palma, and Wu were ashamed. If the first part of the series contains the mediocre dialog and the second is a bad dialogue, this is a sad dialogue. Amazing. But at this point the story is also reduced to dialogue level. Despite acting and dialogue, I liked the first two films, but "Cube Zero" certainly kills the franchise. <br /> <br /> I am sometimes surprised when such left-wingers also realize the anti-democratic and fascist opposition. Will they clearly target the US in this film? Democracy. Why did Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. do not target anti-military films? Obviously, most of these places would be very little to create this credit at any given time, but it's next to it. It's obvious: the worst writers like this actually worship these kinds of governments, whether they are aware of it or not. <br /> <br /> Returning to the film: Even though it is still far away, it is not yet funny, the film has many obvious carelessness. For example, for some reason two men under Cube supervision have done this for some time and are reluctant to the pain and unlawfulness of the plan, and the first to reverse against the system! Anyone who thinks about human nature will see through this inertia. Or how about a brutal character, one-eyed officers speaking as if he was in a bad Mel Brooks comedy. In fact, as soon as this creature appears, the film loses all the intensity and makes it exciting: it's really comedy.
