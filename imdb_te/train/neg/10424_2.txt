I love this film. Acting is very good and Barbara Stanwick is very good but this film is always very soft to me. The film will make the working class people less and less attractive. It's a bit harder for me to say that the daughter is ashamed to her mother and that the daughter is not up. Barbara Stanwick worships the daughter as a mother, but the daughter prefers parents to enjoy the happiness with her mother to do the parent's family. Some of the others I think about this film have thought about this. Acting is very good and worth watching. I really do not like story line. Just a personal preference .Thank you
