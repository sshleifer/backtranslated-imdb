Ah, dull t.v. The performances and the pilots were slammed together in the 70s, equally dull t.v. Movies! Some examples include Riding with Death (most frankly cheese), stranged in space (confusing and undermining), San Francisco International (horrible dull and unbelievable confusing), and a bit of queen martin glamor. <br /> <br /> <br /> In Hawaii, you're not known from the outer shots, which is a failed pilot for a lame spy appearance. The real problem is that the main character of Dian is not all of the characters, including Diamond Head, but silent for the whole movie; His boss 'Aunt Mary', the untidy delivery of his lines and the white hairs tight, holding the kan tan; Diamond Headfriend / Companion (hell, I can not even remember his name) is a flat wave that speaks slimmer, not sexy or interesting to the wooden woman; And the Pakistani julu (again, unable to remember his character), who was not bad in the small pieces. The most interesting person in the whole production is Ian McShane, who is a bad guy, but his acting chaps proves. Alone is ridiculous to make jobs that are called 'oscarwelli' used to hide themselves. I'm not sure what he is doing or he's trying to steal from the American-made artist's laboratory with the American general. Or I do not care. Plot is not interested enough to hold your attention even for ten minutes at a time, let alone an hour or a half goes. Hawaii Five Number!
