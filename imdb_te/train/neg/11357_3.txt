1st good news. 3-D is exceptionally well done, and they do not go for Goku Jimmyx. The film is based on the true story of the high point in human history and contains one of the participants: Buzz Aldrin <br /> <br /> Now the meat of the thing: it's for FLIES, Kriskes! Large, google human eyes, real, but flies with flies. Remember when I compared "underworld" movies to mice. This is not intended to praise, it's literally anyone I'm not expecting. This one has less sympathy. Baby Magotto? The Hague. One of those odd interactions of the Hollywood group, this flick drawing boards at the same time "space chimp", is also clear about critics in space. <br /> <br /> Go to "Apollo 13" and watch a REAL SPACE PROGRAM (RIP) 9-Rated film.
