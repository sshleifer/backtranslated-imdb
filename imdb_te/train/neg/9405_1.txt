I finished watching this on TV and what can I say but this is the worst image I have ever seen! The film from Melbourne has suffered. Diabolical looking rituals, amateur makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack. For the plot, well, thats more stupid! I was surprised at how bad some scenes were. There is one reason they put these kind of images on TV overnight - because they are completely worse! Avoid all costs.
