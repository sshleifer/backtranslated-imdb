Everybody (even critics) I think this is a good movie. It's a very clich√© thriller I've seen. We have a bad guy (or girls in this case) that we want to do something or as a consequence. In this movie 'good girl' defeats the evil guy and uses her smarts and skills to save her and her loved ones. Save the day using bravery, bravery, and even luck. <br /> Where to Start? A young man named Lisa Reisert meets a young man at Jackson Ripner's name (nice name) at an airport. A random one leads to another and destiny will appear immediately if it is bringing these two together. Sharing drinks, sitting next to each other, seemingly in every way ... is this strangeness more? Is this mutual intention? Is there a reason for their "strange" and strange encounter? <br /> When it turns out, unfortunately yes. Jackson needs Lisa to kill the Director of Homeland Security by moving his man from one room to another to attack his men. Oh, if she does not do this, her father dies. <br /> <br /> If anyone who is behind these tragedies and who really really knows the exact reasons, Jackson explains how this is going to happen and how Lisa can help him. <br /> <br /> <br /> Lisa loses his evil deeds with his villains and prevents him from his neck, travels him on chairs and hits him with a field hockey stick. Oh, and before, she leads on the jungle chase through the Miami airport she needs to steal a 11-car safety 11 and steal a car that she later used to run on a man who ordered her to kill her father. <br /> <br /> First, a hotel manager like Jackson, who can get his hands on high tech weapons, needs help from a hotel manager. Does not he just insert the bomb into the building? Is it safe for him and his team to leave any third party? And why do the characters like Jackson explain to whom they are afraid of whom they are? Is not it easy to stop them by the same individuals? <br /> <br /> Actors made the film a good thing for them. Racheal McAdams and Silly Murphy still look for actors. Moreover, we believe that we will most likely see Jayamma Mes (played by the 'love' Cynthia). <br /> <br>
