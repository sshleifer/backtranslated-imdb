Because of the popularity of movies such as Land of the Deed and Resident Evil Series for Mass Feeding the Dead, it is just another film trying to make little money on a zombie craze around. It starts at a television station, which is a military guard, and reports that Lazarus virus (zombies) are close to resistance and the city can regain their business again. The problem is, it's totally wrong. Zombies run rampantly and people know only minor minority. Among them were Torch (William Gibbina), camera man, Sherry (Rachel Morris), main interpreter Woman (some played on Shelley on this website) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their Army Escort. Torch and Sherry are not lying to the public but the station is run by secret service (or some other government agency) and they are heavily censored. <br /> <br /> We have a mass of more than three of the "Dead" films by George A. Rumbero on the back of the film "Box-cover". <br /> <br /> Tell me the movie is Baad. I'm not worried that I'm more (though I'm sure), but I have not found any ransom features in the film. Performance in all episodes is complete or very wooden. Does anyone mark their lines or read the cue cards? I can not even think about the best part of the film or the best actor / actress. Not really one. <br /> If I were to give someone the approval, I told Roger that the army was probably a very interesting role but did not say much. <br /> <br /> In this film, the box-cover is pretty cool (it really impressed me for the movie). 3/10
