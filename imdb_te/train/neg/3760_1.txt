This I saw a large part of Lama. It is boring tension I sit down through a seminar rather than creatively if I know I'm going to be boring. 40 seconds of hot chick in bikini with big talk tisss is not riddim for less than 1. <br /> <br /> The reviews of the film are "inappropriate and funny" and are just plain correct. One thing about this film is not funny. They spend the first 50 or so minutes walking through the woods you understand or stuff about stuff or because they are also dull when they start death because they are also uninteresting. Honestly, I did not see until the end, but it should say something about how terrible it is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Rent this movie. Then Zach made his pants. Thank you for your time.
