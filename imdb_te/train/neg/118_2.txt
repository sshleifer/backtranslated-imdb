This is said to be a personal film for Peter Bogdanovic. Although he relied on his life, he changed the way to the detective characters. These detectives have beautiful designs and there is no problem getting them. Being more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective? The full movie is written by Peter, and shows how he is in a relationship with real people. You want to write what you know, and he actually did. And for that matter the audience will be frustrated and leaving confusion and jealousy. This is a move for people who would like to see the Dorothy Strait, which was exactly killed after the shoot. In honesty life, Patty Hanson, who is married to Keith Richards, is also a model like the Stratten, but it is a very good and very effective piece. In fact, the part of the stripten was visible; Added. She does not have much to do with the story, it's pretty cool to start with. In all, every character in this film is someone who has very little contact with you, unless you're millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your calling call. For the rest of us, it is an irritating happy day. What happens when you are outside the touch. You entertain your few friends within the jokes, and all the rest of the burden.
