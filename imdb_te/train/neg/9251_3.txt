The film, despite its "independent" status, is a stupid Hollywood version of a frustrated mother-daughter relationship. It's not bad at first, but somewhere in the cinema - when the daughter goes out with that person, I think - it turns into a cheesy mother's daughter bonding image. Sorry, but I dont know what moms out there that kind of relate to their daughter ... its probably the best way, though.
