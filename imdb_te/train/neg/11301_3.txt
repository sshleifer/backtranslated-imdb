Nothing can ruin the movie with a combination of poor script and poor direction. <br /> <br /> Remaining ideas from old, improved universal horror flax like "Dracula" and "Frankenstein". The direction is simple and old. Acting is normal. Chaney Kharis is weak compared to Tom Tyler's "The Mummies Hand" and the producers are addicted to Christie Cobain's improved prequel and have enough to indicate the weakness of their own film! <br /> <br /> Universal realized how evil this film was, and two years later, "The Mummy's Ghost" was originally reconstructed with a better script and a better director. As a result, their best film in the four-film "Mummy" cycle is probably not as good as Karl Fried's 1932 original. <br /> <br /> Cubene's footage increases the image of this image. The "new" thing is 2 better. Dick Faran and Wallace Ford are probably happy to see their characters flatten, so they should not be seen in such bricks before!
