It ended up as a whole mess, so what happened in the making of this film? After "The Breakfast Club", "St Elmos Fire" (as well as many of the actors, after a brilliant film "The Breakfast Club", it is not directed or written, but it is the same person (Joel Schumacher) It must have both, but then the Schumacher has "Body and Robin" and "Batman Forever" from good to great direction. "StEF" something went wrong <br /> <br /> Example: Character Wendy (a handsome little girl with good works) and a little luck by Mary Winningham) Billy (The hugely cheated cheated cheats on his wife and his friends, most drinks by Rob Lowe She does not have the order in her life). She is still a virgin. Billy really looks a challenge and possible success but silver is "not ready". Silver is not hard to believe that she is in the group of friends. In the next story, Billy has somehow filmed a few strings of his life as his wife took his child and married another. Billy left all parental responsibility for her baby daughter, left her for New York, convinced that her virginity to silver was "a perfect gift" from her. And the windmill, who works as a social worker to help broken families, seems to be not at all staged at this disaster. Will you be. She can give only one time, losing one of her family and friends. Schumacher's frame makes this scene an exciting and touching moment. <br /> There are more examples of complete disconnection between true and thrown on values ​​and actions appear to be virtuous. br> </ ref> I might say some "80s" but I'd be sure to remember in the "80's" that the children held responsible for whether they were getting married or not. /> <br /> This movie is very bad, because it really is worthy and right. </ p> <br /> The technique (not the story), it's awfully good. It's confusing and feels like a 3 hour picture up to 1 hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and jumps in time just do not make sense. Pick up what's on the editing room floor and re-introduce it and the film is probably going to flow better ... but it's still a horrible film. <br /> <br /> Maybe Shuammer became a good and strong director when he wrote a screenplay for Saint Elmo's Fire from 1986 (he must have) or possibly on his head, or perhaps a team of actors went to their own way - I really think what happened.
