The film mocks religious morals and ideologies, and at any level fails to create a coherent argument against the death penalty. This film enhances the parental killer for a martyr for Christ by demonstrating legal execution of a flawed murder of the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of humanity. However, according to the plot, God had killed their parents, and God wanted them to remove the self-relief of the one who killed his parents while sleeping in their beds. However, there is no anger for the killer actions of this god. The main character, a nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman, gives her own life in a defiant but unsustainable attempt to eventually fail to save this guilty killer. In the other scriptures of the undeveloped bundle, Jesus is a powerless and unhappy promise to remember God's wrath. Christ's modernly poor embodiment is not a barbaric one, but it also covers the Messianic ideal of all religions. Humanity has not been able to influence humanity, and the margins of life that are waiting for self-destruction to humanity are good. Meanwhile, with little help from Jesus, the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to rebuild herself to her newborn sonless child, which saves somewhat from the omnipotent person of mankind. I also commented that it was a statement to support abortion on some levels. The film which attempts to portray many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious content that we can clearly understand when abusing people's beliefs. Trying to answer many questions, even if it's never. It ignores the religious values ​​of its audience when trying to paint the assignment version of their successes. Silly
