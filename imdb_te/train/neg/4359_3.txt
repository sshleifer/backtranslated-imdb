Wow, I was interested in this film after about 15 Minutes (more than cursing the South Park mean more ... I guess some people do not get it) Blowing up the disc of Timo roses "Rout City". I read very positive things and looked very far from the whole trash I expected after the film's packaging and look "Route City". <br /> <br /> Surprise: This film is not the whole garbage but the problem is perfect. Timo Rose tries to walk like Olaf Ettenbach and the likes in the footsteps of German Horror / Pustaer. That means "barricade" components are very cryptic and detailed parts. Gore FX is not really trustworthy but OK, acting is ok but in some cases the plain sucks. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this film is a modern concept for the promise of the ghar, a typical German underground storm (including classic) body shots in the blood), OK FX and package? <br /> The script is a total BS. You get a simple hillbilly / lost in Woods's story with some guys + out of the camp camp and meeting a depleted hillbilly family. Everything has led to violence / molition scenes and is unreliable, random and nonsense. <br /> <br /> "Barricade" is what makes you so hearty. Random also the perfect description for most of the camera work (I liked to cut the tweezers recurring in the extended hat torture scene ... they work as a hardware store with any material or editor). The worst editing ... Sure, its modern and many other movies are in much genre but its RANDOM. You have the excessive excessive meaning of the exposure exposure everywhere ... it does not mean ... all the time. <br /> <br /> "There are a lot of recurring things here, like the preceding effects, for example, killing and punishing many repetitions in the dead Its OK is once but its irritating and fake, especially towards the end.Tension also attributes the "music" that has been used permanently without change in the background. <br /> <br /> If you make this image very rare, then the big issue of the movie (and many others in my opinion) will make you look good with a special FX and a new school edition, with its cute idiot making a bad image It's no fun because good humor FX is wasting in this case  ియు ఎక్కడ క్లాసిక్ గోరే FX సరిగ్గా నోటిలో కత్తిపోట్లు లేదా తుంటి షాట్ లో తుపాకీ షాట్లను వంటి సన్నివేశాలలో కంప్యూటర్ FX ఎక్కడ (మరియు 3D splatter ఎక్కువగా ఒక బడ్జెట్ మరియు మంచి 3D కళాకారులు తో సినిమాలు నాకు సక్స్). /> <br /> I often wondered if the time of extreme publish movies is over and the "barricade" is another example of the time in the tomb. Its fun, there is no role and its appearance is very trashy. The script "Wrong Turn" and "TCM" is a lesser effort somewhat popular all over. You can take literally ... end only here and there are many other things such as coincidence ("I love you" in a vague image ... come on !!). "Barricade" tries to embed a lot and fails ... You can move quickly through this image while hitting some extensive decomowellament, acid face melting, nipple and classics on a Friday 13th style (bloody boobies hooray!). But this is really hard to get through. Especially because you can see something like that.
