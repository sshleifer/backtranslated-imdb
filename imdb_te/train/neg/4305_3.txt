<br /> <br /> I first saw this video on a video CD. <br /> <br /> I would like to mention the good points. <br /> <br /> First, not partiality, a role is not shown as black and white. The two main characters are well-known in friends and in a country and the economy, while failing at the same time, but flourish. <br /> <br /> But, after the first 15 minutes, the plot enters a fork in the road. The audience feel that these friends hate each other because of unknown reasons. Bosnia is not the cause of conflict now. Sure, the script adds to the TV footage that appears to be watching live news programs in English, but clips are starting from 1993 to 1992. <br /> <br /> History, 1990 elections, people of war are not mentioned. The film tries to defy Bazzar, the presidential candidate and leader of the parliament's second largest party (SDP), Corridge. According to the Constitution of Bosnia, the SDP had the Presidency in 1992, but in January there was Cooper. The Bosnia Islamic Democratic Action Party seized total control and declared it in Bosnia and announced the Sessions and a referendum in March. <br /> The history of the IDAP is a suspicious person from the Bosnian Muslim alijah ezetbegovic, "STTH". He is a student of Nazism in WW2. He wrote his own "Main Compfa" in which he states: "There is no possibility of any peace or coexistence between Islamic religion and Islamic social and political organizations. In 1990, he lost the IDP polls to a" Bosnian Yugoslavia "Ficet Abdiq, a Bosnian Muslim, It worked with the Christian Serbs in the Civil War and his support as brothers <br /> <br /> Isabelgovic, who lost the elections, blocked the seat, but seized the seat of power. <br /> <br /> The events that came from above are missing from the movie, but they are the real events that lead to war. In the movie, the Serb soldiers wearing Soviet WW2 helmets, they are not used. Yugosleviya ar only used an M-1944 WW2 soldier holding a rifle. <br /> <br /> raitarsku director and the script had a chance, but they chose to re-write history.
