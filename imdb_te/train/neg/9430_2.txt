I, too, was fooled by the packaging. I, too, dropped for crying packaging and DVD casing to mention that "every copy is dragging fans from the shelves". Although it is inexpensive ($ 6.99), it's not really valuable - no fears, and very limited gore. The finish is very cheesy and it does not deliver the punch. With how much I really do not know how much it has become a "Video Nasty". Story drugs, characters clearly ambitious actors ... it does not survive until the promise. Director Bonus Feature ("Interview") Director is very upset and does not appear in all. She has actresses acting in a Shakespearean production. This is a great laugh.
