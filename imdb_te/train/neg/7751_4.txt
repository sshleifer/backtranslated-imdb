First, CGI is terrible in the film. I have seen during a marathon of bad movies on the SCIFI channel. When I finally killed the owner of the park, I could also see one of the worst examples of CGI. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> Why are they particularly on the island? Well, it's not stated in the movie. And, why would people come into the area of ​​the cat? <br /> <br /> One thing that has happened in this film is moderately good acting. In the so-called "B for the TV movie", acting is very good. <br /> <br /> If you do not do anything on Saturday, see this movie. It may be good for some memorable crores.
