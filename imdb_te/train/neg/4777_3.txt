The idea behind this film is good. Not too bad. It was a good idea to cast a Sydney Poetier as an FBI agent, and he did an unusual job. On the other hand, Tom Berenger is very angry at his movies. Kirstie Alley's role was a great man, and showed some possibilities, but the writer was able to lower us by playing her role more readily. It is totally different from the tight independent character she needs to be. I do not care for Ally's performance anyway. This movie is about fifteen minutes ago. The cow milked the milk before the director's unbelievable final action. I will put an example of Poetier's performance in my collection.
