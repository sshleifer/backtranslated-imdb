I entered the film as a fine football drama (in the same vein to remember the Timnes); Nevertheless, I felt like I attended Ted Haggard's speech about the rapture. The only thing missing is the request for a decade at the end of this film. In fact, you can learn more about a televised lecture than this poor consent for entertainment. There are quotes from Scripture rather than quotes from the popular self-help pulp with a TVwest discourse. The plot is entirely imaginable to say that in the first 15 minutes of the film the entire plot was constructed with anyone with long-term care.
