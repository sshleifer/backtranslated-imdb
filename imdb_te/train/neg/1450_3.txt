If anyone really wants to understand Hitler, WWI does not read history of WWI. Find out what happened in the war, soldiers must live dead dead bodies from time to time. How many soldiers went mad, since they watched during WWI, they called it "fired" after firing. If you learn about WWI's true horror, you will understand Hitler. <br /> <br /> You understand what a human is about to die, because not because of their evil, because it's the same way for the horrors that surround them. <br /> <br /> This movie is unfortunately, many others do. Read some books on this topic and you should see "the paths of fame", a good WWI film ever made. <br /> <br /> Soldiers' frustration, helplessness, and full value of human life are not more than bullet catches. <br /> <br /> This is what the film will do, its point to really understand the key German. In the war, millions and millions of Germans lost their lives, and there was no real reason. Then, following the war, it is totally financial collapse. <br /> <br /> The loss of family members and massive poverty can always lead to terrorism. Unfortunately this film has neglected these factors, and just another piece of throw away on the pile has become a piece away. In fact there is no real value, and there are fictional stories based on fiction films that can give Hitler a better idea than you do. They threw Hitler's name in this regard, so it sold more.
