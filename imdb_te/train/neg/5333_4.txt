A squash slap stick that plays a funny actress. Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull-riding champagram leaving Elvis in Illinois, where the government suites invested in just a cattle flock (the terrible necessity of a stud). Peter Texarke has had some narrative skills, although he does not expect he is in sloppy comedy antiques (his social commentary is not correctly mentioned, but Takesbury has some funny scenes for his eccentricity). Although there are colorful assistive turns by Katy Jurado and Joan Blondellah, there are many Hupin and Hollerin who come in the usual sensation and increase their interest. For Elvis, he is loose and frisky throughout - and although it is nice to see him have fun on the screen, he is just wondering if he's given on the movies at this time. These implications of the image are different, and although the spirits are high, the returns are high. **** from * 1/2
