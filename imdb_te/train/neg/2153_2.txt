The DUMB, DUMB, refers to the DUMB "The Man Who Was Not There" premiered in 3-D! This frivolous comedy looks good by matching 3-D effects "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday 13th Part 3". The film did not say asinine seriously. This is one of many 1983 movies featuring pop-off-screen-effect effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tomber were involved in this mess, but at least it did not kill their career. Thumbor appeared on HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show" and Ron Howard's box office smash "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", but Gutenberg continued with this "failure" with "Police Academy" and "Cobbun". Instead of what they are in "The Man Who Would Not" in them. If you do, you will be hurt. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (From four)
