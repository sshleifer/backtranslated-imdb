While we were in junior high school, some of our boys were occasionally stumpbams. It is considered funny. But producers, directors and "Semana Santa" ("Angel's Death" in the DVD section of your local video rental) are adults and they are still equipped. <br /> <br /> I suspect the tapes are more than one of the scenes. <br /> <br /> "Mighty Aphrodite" and other top-rated movies, she is back to this project. <br /> <br /> Her performance is not quite present, it is very limited to being bored, indicating how "sensitive" the plight of the various victims of the film. <br /> But let me warn you - the next victim! If you find it on the shelf, take away from the DVD. Mira's many good leg shots (not the only high points I can find in the film) and the supporting cast is not the low quality of the stage production as the "special" accents of the best high school desperately disturb the mishmash of full-blown conversations.
