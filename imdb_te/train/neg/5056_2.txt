*** Spoirs *** Let's start with the film's "Good" - acting as the servant of Cynthia Roth Rock and Richard Norton. The rest of the acting is awful (it does not help through this horrible script). The worst offender is Villan, Bantuo, head of Asia Crime Syndicate (played by Franz Tambon). I had a headache when expressing his "fury" when he lost some money. Terrible appearance. Patrick Maldon was not very good, and was badly distributed to his "it's hostile possession" line (the rest of the title of the film). There are no other major characters, but the other actor / actress in the film is not different. We came to the next story. It should inform all the details you need to know: In the original "Rage and Honor", Cynthia Rothrock, played by Chris Fair Child, is a teacher in the interior city. Now, she is C.I.A. Agent (or some other government agency in it - sorry, but this movie is very bad, I do not even remember). Hmmm ... I'm C.I.A. The application is like the process. Interviewer: What's your last job experience? Chris: I am a teacher. Interviewer: Okay; You're hired! I give a "2" (although we know Tommy (Muldoon), the secret villain, a nice plot and a nice plot twist at the end.
