Wait, do not tell me ... they dispossessed the movie and took them out. You know, the film may have shot a rear in New York. "Gangster Banger" I guess. Gangster rap, designer gangster dust wear, which somehow moved from the neck to protect from dust storms. I guess it is to protect the head from heat filter by K-Mart tots. "Budget Rental-a-Hardy", it seems, supplying horses. The girl was talking about a bedroom scene and the guy was mouthing her words .... while I was talking to him. You know, verifying this movie is not just about acting ... it looks and has money about it. The film is not too much of anxiety. Well, in all, I think that this film will always go down as the worst image of all time. Yet another thing, where is ice cream? Did he finally go to Oprah?
