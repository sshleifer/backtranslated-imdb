No complete waste of time. The film begins as a clone in the series, but begins with worse acting. Melissa Zone Heart is totally terrible. The end is ridiculous and the story has no twists, no plot surprises and a plain bad end. I liked some of the characters and I hoped to be all together in the end. This did not happen. It's the whole "wrestler" that ended up with no good performance. I can not believe I have spent this time. This is not "fun" as some people say. In a mask, a person kidnapped people connected and forced them to identify them. Connection is a stretch and he must have shot the first major actress.
