As a fan of Sookie Stock House books, I recognize that this series is a complete cross-representation. The Vampire Bill is not very good looking and is much older than what is described in the book. I have already discovered that the colorful characters are pretty much of course and vulgar. One of the things I loved about books is that she is always a woman despite all the worst going through Sookie, and yet in the TV series she does not seem at all. In addition, the bias that are shown in the TV series do not spread quite widely in books. I can not imagine the exact replication of the books, but at least I guess the feeling I used for the series.
