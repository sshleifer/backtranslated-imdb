I saw this film the other night and honestly said one of the worst films I've ever seen. Acting is okay, but the plot is completely ridiculous. Killer is killed because if a killer is "the energy used to make the film" and the film is dead? How unbelievable is this? The characters grew to say the least ... For example, suddenly the man said, "Are you trying to finish the film because your mother can not do it?" So why do we want to go along with this? By half of the film she did not have any idea of ​​her daughter. The film was not really interested in anybody, we do not know about the surviving mainstream people except Ringwald's character, both of whom were dead actresses, while people were dead when people died and Rafi wanted to be a director like his mother. Not really diving in knowing who they are. Murders seemed to have taken place. The whole plot was too weak for my taste and I was disappointed. Anyone who enjoyed this piece of garbage, clearly needs to learn a thing or two about making the film. I can not believe anyone will agree or act in this film. It's not funny, it's not horrendous and cliche through the whole picture. I imagined what happened before each scene, and you believe that you do not have to struggle with everything. It's a disgrace and I'm so sad, I've wasted an hour and a half while I'm confused. 1/10.
