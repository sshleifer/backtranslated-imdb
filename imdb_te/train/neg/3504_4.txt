I gave this performance (I saw seven episodes) with four stars because her jokes / setups have failed too much. Some are not funny fun, but some are fun - in a 12 year old boy kind of way. She reminds me of New York artist who throws paint on canvas, calling it art and sells for money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not like it, It is like a finished potato.
