I am absolutely lazy this film. The talent available to the director-particularly Stanley Tucsey, Chris Wackin, Hank Azri and Alan Arkin (without mentioning the four main Leeds) has been completely wiped out, its final decision has been completely ignored for horrific, stereo-typed characters. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is just plain (high reliability, reappearing her role from minus humor), Crystal is just her same old hyper-active, nervous, unpleasant mosaic and cousin her character <br / > Because there is no need to romance between central characters, not only chemistry, but comedy-spoilers) as it is necessary to be considered 'romantic comedy' Â£, only a few moments of humor grosse point Cusack's character and his relationship with Alan Arkin - a reality not able to script writer. (Spoiler's) Amusing twists like Mexico Girlfriend and Wakeen Azaaria was rationally entertaining as an entertaining-Maverick-Dogmie type director-but these episodes had a very small screen time and instead (spoilers) we blew a groin with a gauze by Billy Crystal. Pune genius. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to mention the great fans of John Cusack's performance and the wonderful performers, the good ideas are completely broken down by a plenty of film. At the same time, it is not entirely unlikely that any of them will explore or elaborate, as well as sheltering the stories of older artists, and at times reduced the 'gross-out, teen-movie' depth of humor. <br /> <br /> Very poor 4/10.
