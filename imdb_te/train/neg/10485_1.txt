Elvis Presley walks into the ocean of counterfeiters while talking at meetings at the Darkly Comic Serendipity, Nevada, about the beauty of the odd relationship ... accidentally kills every one of them. Kim Basinger, a notable celebrity actress, prefers to choose quirky movies to play, but this terrible screenplay (by Mitchell Kennem and Adam-Michael Garber) does not have the eota of good humor. Stereotypes and low ball gags are not the elements of classic comedy, but also on a shambling, shameful level, the image is raw and sloppy. If you watch, see if you can count how much extra shots of Basinger behind her Pink Cadillac wheel, always hands on the same position and non-plussed look on her face. Hopefully she and Elvis paid well. **** from stars
