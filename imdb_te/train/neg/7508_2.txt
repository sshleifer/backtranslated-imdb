I've chosen a different title for Spike Lee. "Song of Sum" depicts an opinion about the infamous serial killer, David Berkowitz. It's not. It was a sand-soft, soft image of NYC street life in the summer of 77 'when Berkowitz was scared of that city. Sam is the son of a threat. Winnie and his wife are Dionna; Richie and Ruby and many other characters. <br /> The problem is not that these characters are unlikely. They are often hurt, sometimes unable to bear. Lee is then filled with their high power, confused lives, and anger, lust, and general crisis. There are at least two long-range combat scenes between Winnie and his wife, unnecessary disco dance scenes, countless gobfests ... over and over I'm wondering: where is the movie editor <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, The possibility of giving any real feel to the fear or fear that arises from the Son of God. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> When you're in the Italian-American neighborhood of NYC in 1977, with the addition of 70s of disco music, Careful, you really think. <br /> <br /> The film's atmospheric validity is almost insufficient to overcome a widespread, exhaustive script about the lives of people who are grossly frustrated.
