Wow, it's a bad movie ... As in other comments, there is no role in the film, no character has developed, they probably have some kind of script but it's hard to tell based on the actual results. <br /> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/index.html"> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/index.html"> <a href="http://www.gnu.org"> </ br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The album's collection does not really exist and will distance the scene from the scene, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only thing that has been saved from 1 or 2 of this picture is the gore factor, <br /> <br /> You can justify them I think where would they spend the money they tried to do? <br /> <br /> Find all the zombie flicks you find. Period.
