Anita and your novel and screenwriter Meera Sial is slightly more than a pardon for her, she airs misconceptions, grievances, and general divergence in English. <br /> <br /> The English people in this movie are overweight, violent, foul-mouthed, sensational, child neglect, stupid, illiterate. , Turning to Indian culture is "redeemed" at the end of the local priest. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the Indian family can speak beautiful, intelligent, educated, many languages, care and loving parents and grammar-school grazing. I was surprised that the film was funded by BBC. <br /> <br /> An English family is depicted in this Indian society as a racist character. <br /> <br /> There are a few moments where my eyebrows have so far burned my forehead. , I thought I lived in my hair. First, the gossip scene between the women at the Divi festival - in the end: English is dirty and narrow - and men - in the end: English women are prostitutes. Secondly, the Nita family lunch with her about your pruning - in the end: they are foolish in English, you can do anything. <br /> <br Weddings are adventurous - all the way through the movie is clear. <br /> <br /> The character is very serious with the film - almost the fallen female trophy - I finished the film angry. <br /> <br /> "Bend Like Beckham", which focuses on the love of humor, is the image of a society's behavior and ritual, and the two girls coming from different backgrounds. Instead, Anita and Me, other cultural apartheid is inevitable, because English is almost a form of Indian anatomical caste and this is evident from a thinly-veiled serial attack on the film's "other" society: English. <br /> <br /> I was Anita and I was a hate-filled, anxious-based work. Based on that, the BBC did not fund its production.
