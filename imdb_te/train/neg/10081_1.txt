I read a few comments about this film and guess it was easy for some to entertain. This movie is nothing. It's written badly, directed, and it just makes an impression. The characters speak in the clich√©-ridden dialogue and the conditions are totally inconvenient. When camping and fun, this is very disappointing because the movie is discouraging. Le Rose decided to write a play about a woman struggling with her sexuality, but her studio executives did not allow the story to give some real-life thanks, or the Kojones. The film is the standard-issue in the nichepopedia as a bad lifetime TV movie.
