1 to 3/3/2003 - 10 to 2 (Dir-Brad Sykes): A 3-D film on the brains of zombies who eat meat in a movie history. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D !! Wow, not !! In the 2D in a zombie movie is not the original story that takes time and time again but does not original story that usually makes a zombie movie better. That's what made the original zombie classic better. Eating meat was just as thrown as an additional. In these 3-part history we have actually found it to be really foolish (like the Twilight-Zone) and have slowly exited the outside end. The last story actually opened the cinema (one has to investigate a devil's town in a so-called investigation) and of course we get to see the same as a meat-eating zombie. Well, I say enough. This is a 3D bare dinner, look classic.
