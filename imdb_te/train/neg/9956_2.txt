I made a special effort to see this movie and the result was completely disappointing. On paper, the script was promising, and left with one of the hopes of actors' choice - I liked the pace of a woman's scent and saw all Dupree and Marty Keller in many French and other movies in the 70s / 80s. But I forgot how important to play the dialogues in a film in a movie, they are perfect in the film ... The worst! Filming sites are also attractive but hopeless, laughable and forced conversations have reduced the whole thing to zero. In addition to that, I am pretty allergic to motor racing world and find interest in this sport. Even incomprehensible conversations in "Love Story" are better than those in the film (and it says somehow !!). I really looked forward to this film and was very disappointed to let down.
