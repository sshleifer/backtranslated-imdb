I saw a lot about Nutcracker's many productions. Now I have seen this film, but I was disappointed in the eyes of the theater director. I found this product impressive in a particular business of ballet choreography but from thorough theoretical perspective I found that everything from design to choreography was poor and ineffective of "motion picture". Traditionally there were no "weird" and attractive clothes (ie candies did not look like candies, rats did not appear to be rats, but chocolate kisses), acting was probably too weak for the screen, and choreography just did not do anything for me. This makes the overall performance very satisfying (best), which is intended to be no different from any other product. But remember, again, this is not a dancer or a choreographer, but a straight female theater director, from a theatrical director's artistic perspective.
