This is Peter Faulk's film. <br /> I'm 10 years old when this film arrives. I was already a movie film. True, my parents did not see me when I got this film, but I'm in love with the typeface of its advertising. Okay, 34 years later I finally saw the film - never seen any cassette's directing in the past. He is a hack, total. Zero concept of timing, compilation. Zen's performance reminds me of Dustin Hoffmann's performance in "Rain Man": a technically equal but totally a note. <br /> <br /> Faulk takes the cake to the film when steals Tom Cruise's "Rain Man". <br /> <br /> I was really annoyed with Zen's performance - it was well suited for "Awakenings" (Bleach!). It's not her fault: a basket case from her debut scene. Why have we ever found <br /> <br /> The character of the Falk character is real and is performed by Faulk as a flawed man. <br /> At least one hour (an editor is required!) Sorry, it was a woman's arrest film <br /> <br /> <br /> "There is a good director, he has his own style of overstating - he has performed well in the film."
