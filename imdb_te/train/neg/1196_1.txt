Amy, Posey and Reckless are a fun movie? Believe it or not 'house bunny' made this a nice and ridiculous. Hopefully the Principals have a good holiday and some money - this film is embarrassing to all of them. It has a cliché from beginning to end. Clocks work well with the script or at least one idea. The film does not use the cliche after the cliché instead of ideas or script. It uses the personnel of the actress rather than developing the characters. Bad, sad, and worst. Now I have ten lines to comment. Really? Why? It is another example of tired coding as an IT IT manager.
