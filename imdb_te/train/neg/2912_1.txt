"Metbell Machine" I became one of the most intriguing, ridiculous and over-exaggerated science fiction horror films. It's good to have a good, nasty and humorous story, entertaining against bad and upcoming stories. Hence violence is not particularly gruesome and it will not work for you, but the free blood vessel and nakedness run freely. The performances by ECC Takahashi and Toru Teeka is a sad thing I have seen, if it does not fit, the director is not known as Udayi Yamaguchi. This film is just everything, it's very boring to the bone! Must watch for every b-movie freak! ... just an enjoyable and rare gem.
