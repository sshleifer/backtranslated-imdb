I gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open-ended and left unexplained, and because of nausea scenes of anyone eating in such a tremendous disgusting way, plus the scenes of a decayed corpse. <br /> <br /> Necessary to be shown in a graphic manner above. <br /> <br /> Cinema story, none of the three and loose integrating stories and worries that ended up satisfying as it was. <br /> Bounty hunter, who played Bruce Dern. <br /> <br /> <br /> First we have Dylan McDermott, as a wanted criminal, looking darn fine and Helen Hunt when he rides through a border town. <br /> <tragic faces Saloon girl is fleeing Mexico to escape both the spots, law and bounty hunter. Then we are one of Hemingway girls, one of which is not sure, we soon realize that the Badlands is a little too long a neighboring woman, an attractive red Head, who goes to see about the Lonely Borders on the western side Play out of the chariot. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is done by him to the last scene in the movie, returning a bountiful hunter and being completely rational.
