I have already seen amazing stories, but on this premises it is so unbelievable that it comes very close to astounding. A wealthy man and a young man gets a heart transplant on his wedding the next day, and he sees his own surgery and the plot of his surgeries to kill him. If there is a medical explanation for such a phenomenon, the mixture of the dialogue in what's next will happen ... Say ... the souls? ... Perhaps and in real life her mother will make all her dedicated parents to maintain her son's life. <br /> There is no shadow of suspense or thrill with a combination of truth and simple story with random coincidence that never happened in life. <br /> <br /> This film is not entirely incomplete - it is actually a good job of directing the good team of actors Hayden Christensen in his lead role after director Jaby Harold Anakin Skywalker's dress, striking Jessica Alba and the super gorgeous Lena Olin. . All good story is desirable.
