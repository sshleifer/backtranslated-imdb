This is probably the "lowest budget hit movies" to credit the dinosaurs style. It's imaginable for you to go, cook your dinner, answer the phone or whatever, and come back to know exactly what happened when you come back. Special effects are too weak to imagine that you use Lego bricks and make it look like a super predator like "super fast" dinosaurs. Acting cooked. They try very hard, and do not have the role behind them to come up with characters and take them as a scientist ... Yes yes we know exactly what will happen to the white chic chic in glasses. Stereotypical has been created in the same films. If you want to see this film, I suggest that you are not in serious mood as the cast and team are clear. If you really really know everything in the world about dinosaurs and about them, do not watch it, you may break the screen - the fact that the distance.
