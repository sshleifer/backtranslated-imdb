This weekend I just saw it after 28 weeks, it's very good. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> "The scenes are unreal, there are no script and plots, but the alien creature is not true and there are light combat scenes compared to the school yard fight. A person named chody has an uncontrollable loose tongue that draws attention from the mainstream. <br /> <br /> Forget about this film and watch it after 28 weeks Aniki. <br /> <br /> Cheers, maseke C.
