Keenan Ivory Weines is probably one of the worst directors, I swear he has the true knowledge of how to make movies. He did a wonderful movie and it is a horror movie. The scary image 2 Okay but Keenan has all the real disasters. Avoid such titles as you can not have a threat to the South Center like drinking your juice in the hood ..... I know, no title !!! <br /> <br /> There is also a movie on Keeneyan's credit for the film. Believe me just because some people in this movie probably love these pictures but in all this film never will have a good taste in movies ... 1/10 ....... jd Seaton
