This helps to find out why it has long been ready for the movie as "The House Next Door" adopted for film or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One reason may be problems with the design of 'house'. In this lifetime movie the house is really nasty, I can not imagine that I can not buy anyone. <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy about intimidating genres, but it is not difficult to fall when I come. About ten years ago. The main characters are not the kind of people people look for anything in the Occult in life, and one of the strengths of this book. The architect is not a type of ghost (or ghost personality) but does not analyze the events that are well described in the book. However, this is a downbeat book for the most part, and I do not think those appeals to people running during their lifetime. Maybe someone will come with another version of the book in years to come. Better house .. Better music .. Good screenplay and dark lighting ... definitely help.
