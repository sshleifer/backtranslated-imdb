The "Freddies Dead" made the glamorous thing done after the disappointment of the fifth film. It started from scratch. Sure, this "final" film is saga in saga, but it's original. Visuals are just a bit breathe. <br /> <br /> In total, this movie is not just a cartoon to get children in the theater. It is a group of good actors (Jane, Yafe Cotto, and Lazzly Deane), who primarily revolve around the dumbs and kill the sheep. This is one hand, it's a magic-trick, and, finally, it's not Goofy, childish entertainment. <br /> <br />
