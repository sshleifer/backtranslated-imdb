Please stop someone from starring Ben Stiller in the movie. Write Studios, hell, and write your local Congress member. I've got a lot of smiles going to a cemetery, then I'm seeing a Stiller flick. Jack Black's disappearing dog trash, and Christopher Walken, perhaps trying to do something about a comedy in his generation's greatest actors, is just as embarrassing. Stiller has his untoward self, but now even with his giving bail, he proves that the path is overrated as a comic. No wonder why this film was badly bad and a few weeks later, the movie is available in movie theaters. I warn you, warn your friends, do not watch this movie, it's awful, gothika (individually, I never say), plan 9, garbage Ishtar, worst then golden child. Hollywood, please let Ben Stiller drop out of your films, he is not funny, he is an awful actor, and he brought others with him. The following image was ranked # 1 because no negative scores are available, so when the board says one, I will give it Zero.
