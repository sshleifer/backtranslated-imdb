This film features some great noirish / neorealist visuals, and just tells a story that it is refreshingly free of Hollywood's sugar coating because it is essentially an independent foreign motion. But some of the scenes go for too long (especially for the wedding,), and I have silver screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is more distracting, with the exaggerated acting and dubious dialogue to be more fit to the stage than the dialogue, and it seemed to get worse. In the twenties and thirties there were many Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York, but they were making lines for Shakespeare's play, they were mixed cement and bowed bricks. In the end, because I wanted to smile and filmmakers wanted me. I tend to be happy with the Italian speaking stilted poetry characters, the dialogue is expected to be defended by saying a literary translation of how they really speak. <br /> <br /> Another way of dialogue is laughing for me: the son of a born and grown main character in the 1920s, suddenly fascinating spots British accent. I'm only guessing to have something with the fact that this film is made in England /> <br /> <br. I am a 'A' for the effort and purpose of this film, but give significantly less grade for execution.
