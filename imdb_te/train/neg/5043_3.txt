I will go to any movie to see if I take the big Jia Jiang fan, Purple Butter. If I want to make this film, I have to accept with many commentators on it. It is very confusing and very slow. The film seems to have been filmed with a handheld camera, because important parts of it are not in sight. <br /> <br /> There is very little dialog for this movie. The endless scenes of people are just around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room without a conversation and sitting in the room. Image time changes are also very confusing and difficult to follow. Although I have read a lot of reviews in advance, though I have a simple idea about this film, I still have difficulty understanding what's going on. <br /> <br /> Earlier, the film was known to be not remotely resembling Ziyi Zhang's films, but she was finally disappointed when she looked at something else. In this movie, she admits that she never smiles and loses. I thought you would expect to find out without a clear feeling between the participants without the sexual scenes.
