An idiot dentist discovers that his wife is treacherous. So there are no new stories here. Nevertheless, the authors have created stupid, boring images. If you are looking for children with vomiting, or if a dentist imagines his wife drugging his bloody horror-type, see (or rent) the film. Otherwise, something (my fair lady, someone?)
