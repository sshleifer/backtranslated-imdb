There must be a very clear clarification that films like Resident Evil will be made in the spirit of the game, but it is possible to be able to. RE is a survival horror game, and a damn effective one at that, yet no other video game film that comes along with Paul WS Anderson. None in Dark has the same kind of a soul as Resident Evil, so, there is little hope that the director manage to have a piece of brain enough to make a horror movie and an action movie. Instead, Darn in Alone proves that there is no hope for video games motion anymore. <br /> <br /> The plot, though not clear, is the largest of the many problems with the image. The film will initially describe only five minutes of scrolling text, which over a minute crosses the audience and catches the rest of the items by hitting them closely with them. Then there is something about the orphanage, some artifacts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy and some demons, all of which can not really see what happens to the viewers. The characters go out in the story and out of the candy, and some have huge structures for meaningless deaths. Basically, what I mean is that some demons are released and Edward Cornby (Slater) has been grateful to him for some of the surgeries given to him in the orphanage. He finds a masterpiece featuring demons and takes him to a former sweetheart anthropologist, where he deals with sex without any good reason. Then, there is nowhere, all hell will be broken, and the couple end up with a military squad led by some donkey commander (Dorf) who has mutual hatred for the Cornish. <br /> It's all funnier, and the reason I do not really understand is because it's complicated and upsetting, but someone really leaves no room for attention. <br /> <br /> Instead, if you want to see the film, the plot will confuse you to capture a tennis ball or something. </ P> <p> This terrible must bring it to at least a little, right? Too bad, this film is like any other wreckage ever made with quick cuts to lay down the chickens' co-workers. <br /> <br /> It depends on the horror game, which is not an action game, but especially annoying. <br /> <br /> The first action scene I've ever had to bear witness to the person running to Cranby from a taxi, and the rest is not all that great. Even when they were dry, the effect was damaged. Instead of scenes with guns that seem to be good to watch the scenes, mute fuses are light and camera zooming and panning faster than the head of the crash slave. <br /> <br /> I would like to invite these actors to act without doing anything. Slater is important for the whole film but makes noise, yet he has more talent than he is. It's also true for Darf, he really has some talent (he's very much done). <br /> <br /> "This is a picture of my worry about future video game films, if they are destroying the soul like this, Samus Aran The only thing before the middle-east killing and Tommy Vercetti aliens fighting with a AK-47 is unlike Resident Evil, this is not a second chance, I do not think anything will help me forget how terrible this movie is. It is unattractive and unexciting.This film is equal to the diarrhea, all of which are thrown together, nothing is really good and, in the end, you're just happy. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: 4%
