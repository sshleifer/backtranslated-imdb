You think the film is good with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter. <br /> <br /> In this film Ingrid Bergman is coming to work for the Stoddard family. Everything is very peachy and bloat - family Bergman and things can not be more accurate. In 1907, stock market crashes (wiping out the fortune of the family) and Bergman would return home to France until the death of the mother (faye). <br /> <br /> After the family's fortunes are improved, Bergman returns. Now all four boys have grown up and there is not really a reason why they should once again appoint her as a governess. But, briefly, everything shakes again. But, when the WWI occurs, four will go to war - Gosh! In the meantime, the sons (David) will bring his new wife (Susan Hayward) home. Miss Hayward's character is black and white like the others, although they are good and sleepy, she is obviously a horny-devil. <br /> <br /> Previously, this movie is actually dumb - brain - intentionally drifting. Hayward has a relationship with one of David's brothers but when watching the silhouette of his father's lovers, Bergman enters the room from another entry and pretends that she does not have a haww with the jack! Why? If it expresses any regrets, does it necessarily protect the evil and the pregnant woman's butt? This is definitely the exact sort of Bergman need to get rid of the gutter-snippet once and for all! It was just a lousy writing case and made me mad ... and did the same for audiences in 1941. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film failed after Hayward's failure. Disclosure of wickedness. It flies in a simple sense and the film has made a foolish dramatic dilemma. As expected, however, the truth finally comes out and everyone is lying down once --- a minus-beloved like a big family, nity, and heward. Hayward's affair does not have any understanding - how it's managed. And, so the characters that are good or bad (nothing in the middle) will sink into the second-rate soap. The only thing that saved it at all is acting --- they tried best with a turgid script. It's OK to say that the Columbia Pictures authors of the movie will be killed by a dead man!
