Please do not hate me but I have to be honest, watching this film, I'm fun, <br /> <br /> It's a cinema with stupid cast and stupid songs! <br /> Unnecessary songs! Mehbubah ... the original one is total insult to Holi .... well .. okay! Tradition Every Movie has got a !! Chad Raha High Nasha ... A very big grown stupid song ji le ... as a playboy song stupid song ... <br /> <br /> Unlike songs. The Om Om is the film's own adaptation of Ram Gopal Varma ... if you feel that you like this movie <br /> <br /> This film depends on the viewer and he / she can copy the movie / he / she will hit her head on the cinema seat / Her feelings of directors feel he / she relaxed and take a look at this film <br /> <br /> I want to congratulate Ram Gopal for this disaster In both ways I saw abuse. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan / Gabbar Bachchan / Gabbar (Amitabh is a funny director in his own remake of the movie) Ajay Devgan Heero / Bobby Deol Prasanth Raj Raj / Jai (Abhishek is seen in the song Mehbooba in particular) Sushmita Sen Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan Wright Tabu is correct for this role) Nisha Kota <br /> <br /> The movie is also the same as Ghaggaro / Basanti (I was great with Hi Deol) Mohan Lal Narishma / Thakur (Mohan Lal So So God .... I'm sorry Hachehe, br> <br /> <br /> I'm not good at the movie, the movie is just okay, just looking at <br /> <br /> Directional ... 8/10 I have some credit cinematography for him Got ... 9/10 Script ... 3/10 Movie Songs ... 5/10 unnecessary scripting ad, it might be advisable, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pakistan out of a total of 310 Syed Shabbir ... Ali Naqvi
