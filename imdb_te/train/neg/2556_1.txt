Well, it's all about this movie and I hate it when everyone writes reviews. But the thing is, I've seen movies zillions and I'm working on writing reviews of all the movies I've seen. So, I have to write anything. <br /> Stupid acting. It's stupid to the news of the grief over flight misuse. Nun is good and professional assistant who has come to take care of the child. You will be surprised at how the three major murders of the film can stupid the makers of the film. They do not even realize that the rip-offs may still be scary. We do not see the village being killed. I feel that the dentist and his assistant deserve me to die, and you will be sympathetic to them. And in the garage the uncle dies as a good work. We have heard him strong and we can not see anything!
