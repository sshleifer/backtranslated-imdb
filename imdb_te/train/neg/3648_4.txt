A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Henggem) go to a doctor (James Karen) trying to get pregnant. It works but Adams learns that there is something seriously with the baby slowly <br /> <br /> Pretty interesting idea is entirely done through a lousy script - the basic idea is ok but firmly end up dull to the end. I've seen every "twist" coming. Directing is poorly - he does not know how to shoot a basic scene. Product Values ​​- Good - lousy. Very shabby. And, the gore scenes are very unpleasant (I've almost changed when a stomach stomach started in the stomach) with lousy special effects. <br /> <br /> When the film ended unexpectedly, the film was stagnant. <br /> <br /> Some good acting is somewhat bearable. Adams, Heyenga and Karen have played good roles and have been watching me but it's about. The film was released in 1991 and is still unknown - why it's easy to watch. I'll give it to 4.
