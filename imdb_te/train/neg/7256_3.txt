I bought this movie on Blu-ray because it guaranteed great visuals and music. I'm a great fan of this film ... Baraka. After Baraka there are different angles, cameras are similar shots to capture a long time on each shot. Some scenes are similar (street with traffic). The film was shot with an average musical score and then filmed with a story that was burned by Baraka, telling a great story, and portraying images of nature, man-made climates, spirituality and horror moves, music and great music in the world. ... POOF, it's done! I thought I should have some sort of mistake! World history? Half the image of Egypt and landscape (looks like Arizona, but I do not bother to check). Seriously, it's terrible, you must rent, but do not buy it. Filmmakers will be shy to reveal this.
