The premise sucks me, but it's clear about 30 seconds that David Lynch or something terribly terrible. Interestingly looking just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list. I will have a sucker for a confusing spiritual piece (Romero comes in mind), but there is nothing a spiritual about this. This message we have for 80 years (or just what a lobotomy - Jennifer yah?) And bind bind without any self-examination or we will trigger a second time. This is the viewpoint of the Jumbo jets attracting people in 110 storey buildings (I work around the corner from the former WTC's site). I feel that God is little more than that.
