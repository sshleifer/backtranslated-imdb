Of course, most of the films are very bad in this movie. The film Manaus: Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 (yes, I saw them twice), but at the same time this film is not a foreign, predator or even an enema. Predator (Yes, that movie also surpasses). It's too bad for movies like this to make the battlefield look like a Star Wars. The Razzie awards place, your big competitions come to theaters only. I'm talking about this film is of course in Alone in Dark. <br /> <br /> Acting - The first part of the film is the best part of the film. Christstraater was proud of her and proved that she had the opportunity to be treated politely in a successful film, although he had his terrible dialogue, so to speak, it surprised me not why he was half a half walk. Perhaps Steffen Dorf is probably because the movie (he may be happy but it fails) Tara Reid is a bad actress but a bed Seeing and movies like this is really the subject. It's not an average, good, and probably not good thing but it's not good to say that the movie is the only thing in the movie <br /> <br /> The Soundtrack - except 'Wish I an An Angel' , Soundtrack punked into the ears of the audience and bad big medal, change the awful story (I'll be back soon). <br /> Directed by Hollywood's favorite director Woo Ball, we brought us the classic house of the Dead. "Yes, movies can get this completely evil and it's my worst story of horrible movies". At least it is directed by Wool Ball. I was not expecting a monkey kidnapped from Congo, brought here and forced to make comments on how to do the film under a surprisingly penalty. The photography director is probably a camcorder recorded on a skateboard and it goes ahead to burn a wall. The camera is still in a still-sighted, constantly moving, we are not stopping anywhere and it's moving in action, the camera will stop for some reason. <br /> <br /> Build-building-Who's stupid enough to put money on this bomb on the ground? I forgive and forgive ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> Writing / Storyboard - Trying to analyze the story is painful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Edward Cornbyby escapes as a boy from an orphanage. Children to go under science experiments. He escaped and hid in an electrical outlet with an electrocuted (which was very bad, I started laughing). He was a mental disorder detective several years later when he was very much forward. Some zombie attackers who are not shot dead are killed, killing and moves with life. <br /> <br /> "A random text about a dubious civilization called" Ashcani "is about 10 minutes with a feeling of 100, The film does not have a twist after another, the audience is still able to perform, the audience still wants to do it, the audience can not care at all times, this story is also good for rock bottom bad, double dragon. <br /> Overall, I'll lose this movie, I gave it 1 in 10 but it's not 0.
