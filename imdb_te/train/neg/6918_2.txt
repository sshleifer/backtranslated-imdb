I have gone for this film to believe that I have good ratings. First, it was ridiculous that a film originally produced in 2008 was released in 2008 after seven years in India. Everything in this picture will look. The film will also appear in 2001 as a shoe string budget. There is a scene where a taxi will explain how you can get a low budget. Anthony Hopkins does not know what he's doing in the film. He ends up giving a long monologue at the end. If the film had bright sparks in the scene, I lost it while sleeping in my seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt is similar to the Devil. She wears uniformly dressed dresses and knives in random children. For Alec Baldwin, he should not exclude the scene that he is going to meet with Webster for the first time. How much money is wasted! Anthony Hopkins correctly said, "Go home and write good!"
