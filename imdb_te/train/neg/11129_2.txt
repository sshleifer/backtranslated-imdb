See version 1936. Personally annoying I find Charles Boyer's voice and more of a match he paid for cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolph - but it is very beautiful and vibrant, as I try Omar Sharif. Carin Denewey (age) does not look like Mary - nothing! <br /> <br /> In the entire movie they learn about the role they play, Eva Gardner is the only actor who has been the only actor to be played as Empress Elisabeth. Historically historically, most of Empress Elisabeth Rudolf's life did not participate.
