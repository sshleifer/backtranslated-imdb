Absolutely amazing. <br /> <br /> Now, let the film purists explain to me before they laugh at their lotus. I enjoyed it, it's one of the worst bad movies I've ever seen and the worst movie I have ever seen in the film (as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen, a wonderful comment). Both Leeds (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) are the best and most apparently horrific at horror. In fact, they did not help by the script with emotional depth, such as the Daphne & Celeste single and the characteristic of OJ's protection. The plot (extending the word to some extent) does not exist and 'gore' scenes, undoubtedly cruel, abusive and ridiculous formulas. Any plot revolves around twenty model (cuthbert), captured and subjected to various visceral violence, mental and physical. The torture scenes feel the collective pieces that are disconnected and are astonishingly rather than frightening the audience. While the film is really quite a few positives drawn from this movie, its redeeming qualities have become a very rare film. I have never heard more vocal audience in the film. Within twenty minutes, the whole film was stitched and so on. I was laughing with frustration for my part, and I saw the film that climbed to the climax of the filmmaking. A cinematography and blueprint for future director winners who clearly explain how you can not make a film about how you look. <br /> <br /> I can not tell you that the image managed to get free of charge ... so I can afford to laugh about it. I'm still searching for my money back ... it's really bad.
