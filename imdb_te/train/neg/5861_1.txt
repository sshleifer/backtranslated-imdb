When I was in high school in 1978, I saw this film when the film first came. I took the date to see. I do not need any "get", because the image is very bad! Jon Rivers' career has never been badly removed as it deserved after making this awful, unfunny garbage. In fact, the injustice is not a serious enough word: this film is anti-funny! What's happening before you start laughing as you like. It is not worth watching from curiosity, or in any sense it is "very bad-good." Even the gang at MST3K could have made this value looking! The fact that this early suicide attempt survived the Billy Crystal career is a miracle.
