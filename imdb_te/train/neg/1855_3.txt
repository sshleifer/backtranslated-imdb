This is the crappiest movie I have ever seen but in all aesthetics it is watchable and rather funny. I thought it would be your typical Hollywood blockbuster quality for filmmakers. It is simply stupid about a serial killer dipping in with the weight of toxic waste that causes him to react with him and the snow (which is in the middle of the winter). He turns it into a killer snowman, which is enough to laugh at you. This film is really stupid but funny. These killings are happy. I did not advise you to go and buy it (as I did-the cover is good!) But if it's done on TV in one night, if you're doing a laugh, press it.
