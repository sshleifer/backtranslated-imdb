This film is not just bad - it's terrible. After I saw it, I felt the need to take a shower to actually get me wrong. 'Gag' runs with an elderly couple making it not funny, but it's frustrating. The monster is cool made, but it's all there. Continued deficiencies alone are angry at you - at least I am. <br /> You can probably do more than spend time watching this movie. Even if your buddy group is 'bad movies' it's unusual in inefficiency, I'll laugh it out. You are alerted.
