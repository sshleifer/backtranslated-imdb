The previous comments encouraged me to check this when it appeared on TCM, but it was a serious disappointment. LP Valdez is great, but does not have enough screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play familiar but exciting characters, but the script loses them. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Lee Tracey's ego, which flips his self-centered, physical, and speechless. The reflexes of the "public" are poorly thought and unreliable, "phenomena" appear to be the evil author's hysteria. <br /> You must rely on a "sting-one-liner" observer mentioned in another review, I have noticed and noticed.
