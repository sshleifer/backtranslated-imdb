I never heard of Adam Sandler's film until I saw the wall on the blockbuster. I was rented as the Adam Sandler fan at the time. I see only 30 minutes. It. Very bad. Do whatever it takes to keep it from the hands of the people. I honestly hope this movie will soon go OOP, and I hope it will be that way!
