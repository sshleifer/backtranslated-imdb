I often make a point of watching bad movies, and these films are one of the best themes you can find in the original films of science fiction channel. Also, I'm sure you can imagine my depression when I saw Sands of Oblivion. This act is sub-equal to the disparity, and we're usually in the store against a tremendous offensive display psyche. Even if you do not know their names, there are some camos by people you can identify with most people. CGI special effects are very low, as well as one of the biggest comedy resources in the psychedelic feature. Certainly, there are some funny moments like a man being cut down by a bulldozer, or the main character ends up missing his friend when he goes to his friend to die to save a girl known for a couple of days, but the whole thing just does not have it <br /> <br /> If I rated a 10 star scale specifically designed to judge, I probably would not I wanted to give a 4, perhaps even a 5. I was a real shame that I should wait until the next science fiction film to get a good laugh, and I really hope this film is not part of some overall quality growth in science -fi original films.
