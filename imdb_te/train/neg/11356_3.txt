It's not a good movie. Components and storyline are very subtitle. 3D is okay, but not spectacular. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are 3 young flies in this story. Without the letters, I really do not care about these characters and feel that there is nothing to keep an adult interest. <br /> <br /> I would love to see more special 3D effects. Also I would like to see more fly jokes than ever saying "flies of lord" Pretty sexist showing women like house wives and epilepsy.
