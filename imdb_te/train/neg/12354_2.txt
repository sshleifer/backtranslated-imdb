Obviously I'm GI Jane 'is not selected from selection. <br /> <br /> Jane made his loyalty straight, lending it to persuade the viewer. Not. As a result, the story is automatically bound by obstacles, limiting the amount of humor (none of these) or entertaining action sequences, and will soon become very serious. <br /> <br /> James Bond, Dirty Harry and many other films are bigger than life and never ever announced because other action films 'GIJain' will fail. Otherwise. They are adventurous, and so are entertaining. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing film from Ridley Scott, with a very credible storyline, an incomprehensible acting act, and some of the reasons I give is 2/10 instead of 1/10 for technical work.
