The sarcasm of the characters created by Saks Rogermer is unfair to Dr. Fu Munch's Fidelid Plot Sellers career who plays Peter Sellers. The plot is very simple, and managed to maintain the right path well, but instead it is less implemented. <br /> <br /> The reason why the film is a poor dialogue, cheap laughter, choppy direction, and why the film is somewhat incomplete is not an awkward feeling. <br /> Acting, on the other hand, is really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up image. I found myself playing the role of Sellers of bright Manchu, with occasional lines that would be remembered. For instance, Fu Manchu is a confusing scenery where there is a hennachan, in which he said, "Ah, you see me the same way." <br /> <br /> Then a fistful with strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of Helen Mirren, backstabbing constable, David Tommelson Sir Roger Avery (not the way to end his final film, career), and Sid Caesar A strange worker who works for the FBI's cousin). <br /> <br /> These characters also continued to look at me. <br /> <br /> The Oriental designs and English Society in 1941 were filmed with elegance on this dud-a-picture. <br /> In all honesty, you are a Peter Sellers or Sid Caesar Fan. Otherwise, you're better off settling on the aluminum foil to chewing.
