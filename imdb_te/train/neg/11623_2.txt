I am happy to support a movie with a Christian background from all the things I've read about the film. Everything about this film is not professionally done. Especially writing! There is no chance of film without good writing. The author / director said in an interview that he did not want to give a title to the hero. I believe it is not a big surprise. I waited to look forward to teens / teenagers' stories, but it never did. I was disappointed as a divorced person. When I went for the first time in the emotional chaos that could bring you to your life as a divorced Christian, this film would not have had any comfort!
