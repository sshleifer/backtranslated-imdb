The film was the best of Jerry Bruckheimer in 1997, because its release did not come with a film hype and quality film for the year before. I'm not a film critic, but this film is as predictable as they imagined. Every effort in a joke, a touching effort and a love story is a pathetic effort, in my mind is exactly what I expected. Make yourself a favor and save money on this money.
