The film is based on the novel by John Phantine. Why would anyone tell me This good book does not need to be followed. If you want to make a romantic dramatic Hollywood design with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, then you can probably connect to Dust (novel) to query? If you want to make this story movie, then why would you want to do a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farl and Selma Hayek? <br /> <br /> The story's follow-up is not correct, and if you've read the book and liked it, you're not sure what to do with tonny. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this film you will probably be a bit of casting, acting bad and cinematography. But hope for the best you can. I really hope so much during this film. I really wanted it to be good. But it's only messy, and it's very simple: if you read the novel of the Phaetes, it's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> Colin Fares has plenty of shots of naked butt. <br /> I've complained too much about this film, but why not waste my time. I saw it. Alright. I liked the book and I had to see it because I was curious. <br /> <br /> <br /> In the end, So sweet ... he wore it all over the time, I'd given 2/10.
