Reynolds has made a mistake in taking her to California with Winters. Winters plays her deeply religious lady. <br /> <br /> To dance, women living together get threatening phone calls. <br /> <br /> "Agnes Moorhead, one of her last films, as she briefly saw her, is one of her wealthy father, Reynolds, the film really belongs to Shelley Winters. She is huge here and she improves her performance. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the Winters at the piano that is terrible and completely mad at the end?
