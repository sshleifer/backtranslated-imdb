Because of budget cuts, Athel Janowski (again portrayed by Priscilla Alden) was released from a mental institution (though she killed six of them), Hope Bartolome distributed half the home. Once there, she will soon return to the frantic routes and kill those who are between her and her food. <br /> <br /> <br /> Holly Molly! This picture sucks! You know that when you open open credits, you're in trouble, they are the first movie credits, clearly shot from a TV screen. Ten years later Nick Millard (under his nickname Nick Phillips) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel and spend a blank tape over the weekend and cover a video camera rental probably with a budget. Tell me that Merrard's unique style is not well translated to the video. Seriously, I did home movies with more value than this. And half the time with the footage from the first image (it looks like the VHS copy of the wearer) has been partially attempted to turn the corpse into a night of night. Alden again looks good like Ethhe, but you can not begin to forgive her for acting in this trash. I mean, at least tried the first film. Here we have music, weak effects (if it's possible), moving camera work, terrible audio and editing with two VCRs. Avoid all these costs!
