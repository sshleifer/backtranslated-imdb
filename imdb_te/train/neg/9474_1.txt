Eastern Europe's life in modern times is one of the only career options for strenuous and young women's prostitution and, reluctantly, is one taken by Melania. She attracts the attention of an American, Seymour, who is engaged to her, and she is forced to pay a long time to earn some money for her. She had two pimps different from her emotional attachments and she usually passed around as some piece of luggage with her own feelings. However, we are in the "Modern Art House Cinema" area, so the camera techniques that can be canceled, such as narrative structure, exposure to the topic, and leverage practices and vague constant plots are all over. Very rarely I did not care much about what I was going through. <br /> <br /> The film is important for the director - the characters are slowly emerging or disappear dark on the dark, there is nothing special and a sex scene takes place in Infra Red. In fact, sex scenes for such traditional films are exceptional. There are plenty of missionary positions among the naked people in the bed and include drugs or related weirdness. <br /> <br /> These days, the most common are the exceptions. <br /> <br /> Overall, almost completely merit. <br />
