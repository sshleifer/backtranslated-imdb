** Sprayers have. <br /> <br /> I have heard from different sources that the film is controversial and the ending is especially horrible. I do not anticipate a complete change that goes on for twenty minutes. Suddenly, as a typical cowboy / Indian Western, suddenly comes in a very dull romance 'comedy' about Husus (Peter Strauss' s title Souler Blue) and Cresta (Candice Bergen). This romantic comedy bit is the majority in the film. Donald Plejens then points out and dissolves them both without real reason. They flee and are two different at the Cavalry base during the attack on Chenen's base. When she married one of the leaders of Cresta Cheyenne, she escapes the cavalcade base and meets them. So far is common. Then comes the end. After more than an hour of poor performance involving one click they do not cause the hero, and then the other things turn to the top exploitation of a decapitation and a child's shot at the back of the head. Although similarities with the wild bunch of draw at this time of the film, the wild bunch kept the same tone and did not resort to violent violence. In some ways, Soldier reminds me of the Last Fortress of the Blue Fort Perry, which completely changed the talk for the shock end. I did not hate the Sainy Blue or finally found the worst thing but it was pretty dull with the unnecessarily violent end. If you want to see the innocent people really disturbing, I would recommend Elm Climov Come and Seine.
