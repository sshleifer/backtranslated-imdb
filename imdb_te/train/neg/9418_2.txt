This is a weak image with history of hardship and reinstatement history. It does not work at all. First drama is all wrong. This first slowly moves slowly and then quickly and unhappy with the end. But also the difficult move between the genres (and the need to be made with those cuts). It starts with being a thriller to pick up at face value, and then turns into a frustration instead of satire. The end may be funny but it is also blunt that I thought I was insulting my intelligence (there was no little). Thus the film will try everything, but no level will really succeed. You can also look at the development of a very unstable character.You almost play Canary three characters.
