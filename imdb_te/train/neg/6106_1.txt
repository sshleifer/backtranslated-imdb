It's terrible, the plot is right, but the rest are bad. I come on the puppet and they even tried to make the film digital and did it even worse! Normally I'd like a low-budget movie, but it's just a waste of time and I like to return to the set that came to me. I have ten low-budget films with me, 6-8 of them are films and I want them to be the worst film ever. Even the words are off and they also use a fake plastic machets that do not seem to be a real one, a real one looked even closer to a real one so they do not watch your time and money and see this is a horror movie.
