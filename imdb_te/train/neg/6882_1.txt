I hated the role of Perez Puerto Ricans! We are not all ghetto - and we do not speak Spanish- Puerto Rico is not! I can not speak for illiterate people you walk. But our language is intact, our island is proud of us. Puerto Rico is financially better than any other Caribbean island! Do not we like Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Haiti? U.S. of poverty Not oath, free in real poverty. We are not victims, we are sincere, humble, honest and intelligent people. <br /> <br /> Pedro Albizu, Che Guevara and Martin El. The analogy between the kings is a strong African origin, but we do not have "black" roots. <br /> <br /> MLK A great leader is a true revolutionary - one day honest man, we saw all the free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevara Castro today create Cuba, and why the Cuban people 's boat is full of their lives to come to the United States - because they did such a better place for them? You have a great, wonderful, bright idea, but you have made it so politic. We have many things to be proud of our people - not to insult us by misusing our people. I'm not a neuroric and maybe I can not share your opinions. I'm in Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I'm not a victim and have achieved my goals in the United States. If the future is part 2 - less stories of more politics and stories of success - there are many. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
