Okay, so this film tells you that the previews are constantly going to live with his grandmother for a rebel young lady in the order of the order. Of course not! <br /> <br /> It is a young rebellious 17-year-old girl who knows what it is true or not. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the idea of ​​this film to be honest. They have a good plot and good theme of a love / hate relationship between the mother and daughter. Even though I did not enjoy watching Lindsay Lohan's performance. In fact, if the film is a different one, it's probably a good act if it is a good actress. <br /> <br /> Rachel (Lohan) is a character who is very sexually aggressive and reminds us of the real Lindsay, so it takes away from the movie. <br /> If I did, next to Lindsay, you would enjoy this movie. The end is very beautiful (and sad).
