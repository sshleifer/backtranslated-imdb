Well the previews looked funny and because I usually do not go to movies on the screen especially night at night ...... well you never did. The jokes are very reasonable for children and there is a film that does not appeal to children or adults and is completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults. I hate to stay with me 9 and 6 years old and have my 6 years old S to have S H * T spells. What is essentially happening here is the classic amount of Dr. Seuss's twisting. It adds a nasty and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the mother of the child for her money. If there was a subplot, then it would have been fine but it plays the role of the subplot in the main plot and the "cat" introduction of mom neighborhood for who he really is. Take my advice and read the book and pass in the movie.
