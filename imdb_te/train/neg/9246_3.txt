When I first broadcast it, I refused to spend this time, and eventually wore memory, lamenting the 1960s series with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Kop, but I always face the challenge. I should be well aware of it. Too much reconstruction, and more ridiculous than a tribute, this show does not know how to play a lot, and infant comedy and cartoon is stuffed with plot and characters. There are three main characters less than the cinemas of these actors and Emilia Fox can only work (Bob Mortimer is painful in the linear). Supporting actors are very well aware of the situation in the comedian-intellect and dealer who just wants to be part of Vick and Bob's joke. And CGI did not help improve the effects on the available 30 years ago, alerted the viewer with lights and camera work and made little of masking the quality of scripts and conversations. All style and ingredient. (And despite the fact that the 1960s show had a lot of time, this 'upgrade' still leads to the 'Matrix' style styles, the prescribed 'girl power' landscapes, and the lowering of micro-pressure between the two living things.)
