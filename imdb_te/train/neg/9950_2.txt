The idea for the original actors (Hunting Rutger, Ice-T), may have worked on this film. Sad, racism came into the image (literally) and do not mess up it. Mainly the black product crew does not allow the villain to be black, so they change the roles of Rutzer and Ice-T. It started with the downturn of the film. Ernest Dickerson's news-room approach to 'directing' confirmed that this is another definitive-job job appointment. Master shot, close up, close up. Gads, 'Who's Line Is It Atway' also uses more creative camera work. At least one attempt to modernize the traditional story of 'The Most Dangerous Game' was Eric, but we did not give us any inspiration about why the characters do it. No reasons were given, "no one will lose these people", why the leader (rewritten as a rutter) does so. In addition to the heart feeling by John McGinny, a fair job by Charles Dutton does not bother in this regard. A small bit of trivia, resulting in F. Murray Abraham, who was injured in a real alcohol-driving accident during the shoot, and the death of a young driver who was responsible for the accident.
