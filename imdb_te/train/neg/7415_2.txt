What do you call horror story without horror and story? <br /> <br /> This is something very frustrating: the authors do not really think of what's going to happen in the movie! Besides giving the audience suggestions and not exposing it completely, the story writers do not know where the film is not known and the viewers do not know the audience! <br /> <br /> I've used a lot of 80's horror / gore movies and the film certainly has roots in those films. But the most important things are missing. We do not really know anything about the characters. They keep repeating the empty lines over and over again. The story is really developing - it does not go anywhere. B-acting is perfect in this kind of horror films, but there is not much to do in the script. We do not care about the characters. Nothing to remember about them. There is also cheesy humor or unwanted sex. <br /> <br /> You will only get some commonly used items of horror movies. They showed lority monsters one by one, but their characters did not really contribute anything to the story. <br /> The honest story, character development and overall size of the environment are low level crews and equipment. Oops, filmmakers used it - some more - 20 years ago! I felt the feeling of an audience that finished the film. That's really bad.
