Scary, but mostly I thought 70 before I revolved. I saw it back as a late night and re-run in 1976 and thought it ended forever. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but just). <br /> <br /> Ray Milad is a scary, because he appears to be stuffed with a toxidermist. Yvette Mimeux looks like if she smoked up all the beautiful downtown Burbank Brown. <br /> It's a sort of Rosemary's BabyRoy Rogers version. This is a turkey that never did. And if you have insomnia and it's Saturday 1:30 and nothing but the replays of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamissium, then I guess I have to beat it. God can help you if this is the only option for you to entertain.
