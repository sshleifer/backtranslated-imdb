It's made poor by Bimalada's classic Parineeta, poor remake. The story is based on Sharat Chandra's book of the same name and it has the original curve. Well a creativity a little appreciate but sham is not creativity. Performance is affected by everyone and the whole picture is a sham. The words chosen by Shaker's father for words in the abuse of Lolita (Balan) are cheaper and morbid and destroy the soul of the original story. Sokhar (Saif) Lollita is far from the flick of the film and characters, the sensation is very confusing and easy to avoid. Similarly, the sex scene between Saif and Balan is a feature film and an inexpensive gimmick to attract audiences. A creative work is not realistic, and if it destroys the spirit, the work is different. The song "Puy Bole" is okay. In the dark group of the film, another silver lining Saif is standing with his father and rebels on his father. This is a positive departure from the original departure and deserved credit. The film is eligible for 3 stars. The song and dance by the rectangle is the smoke of the art and it is a put. The song is tuneful but I have heard it somewhere before and if I did not make it wrong, it seems tuned. <br /> <br /> Since then, the changes have changed. But this film is not even reflected in modern times. <br /> <br /> Modern Bollywood filmmakers are NRIs Attracting the lucrative NRI entertainment market, such films are not of India or any other part of the world.
