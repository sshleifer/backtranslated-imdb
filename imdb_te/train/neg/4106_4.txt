It was very uneven that this film was not a fall but I was disappointed. Over the years, I have sold the DVD down dramatically and thought it was worth a shot. The earliest credits for Pequinfa fans have been cut between man and animals, but here we have a diary of ambient noise in children or children who play the bomb. Excellent suspense. Then, when Perpes, Ken and Duvall traveled to their next mission, Doubl had a STD last night on her date, but Ken was found to be close to her when she was snoozed by her purse. The upcoming laughter is wonderful, and apparently in Brian Depalma's dressing to kill, Angle Dickson's short-term cost is grateful. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after the opening credits, the film is flat. Even Head of Bring Me Alfredo Garcia has a strong product value, a bold call to anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Peckinfa's credits as an affiliate speech, but once they're done, The Killer Elite.
