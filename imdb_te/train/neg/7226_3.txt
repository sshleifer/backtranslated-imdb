I love comics. Although I have problems in understanding the stories completely? The visual style is unique with all its dust, dust and decay. So I know what I did. Surprisingly, I understood the main plot? But some brilliant decisions have been made for its visual style. <br /> I mean - is it really bad looking at "CG human actors"? ?? Why? It does not work at all !! Horus - and other Ignition gods - have been successfully made in CG and are close to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I feel like a real actor for this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> "
