I was about 7 when this diary of an image released MONSTROSITY. In the UK it was promoted on TV as some fantastic blockbuster film in the summer of 1977. In fact it was the first film I had ever seen in a movie, and in the years to come, I refused. The following week I was invited to go to the new movie "Star Wars" and I refused. Today I have never seen the protest at having Sasquatch to see! Seriously, at 7 years I can say I'm looking for the worst. This is very bad, it's almost unbelievable. It never got a movie. But I was never directed as a director but I am very happy to read that as long as I am concerned. Avoid all fees !!!
