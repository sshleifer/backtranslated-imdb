I was drawn to this film which was curious to see how I was following Hubert Shelby's cruel novel. I felt like a deep literary piece of characters, terrible conditions and social criticism could not be translated as a bad movie. I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is a terrible film experience, not for its content, for its form. Director Ulrich Edel is my honest opinion, working on a terrible direct job that does not do justice to the original book. Edel is not a TV director; It looks like the movie looks and is badly "made for TV". Some views on this bomb (** spoilers forward **): <br /> <br /> - Lack of direction creativity. The scenes are slow, feel slower, poorly painted, and just move from an anchor point. The only freedom they take is in the cinematography area, with good black tone. Instead, it is the same technical innovation as the TV sop-opera. <br /> <br /> All actors make an excellent job of portraying these painful characters. The problem is that the basic element does not exceed the development of platforms: motivation. These characters are like robots, their actions are not clear inspiration. From blue to robots, for no reason, they do things. Edel misses every opportunity to improve the role of the character without exploring the character's impulses and does not develop the character of each character in its full range. <br /> <br /> It is patently in Tralaala because the character does not develop. Jennifer Jason Leet makes a great job playing this cheating spouse, but her decision not to spell her for the violation of her sailors is not explained. It looks very foolish, and we see that the character is blue. <br /> <br /> The most secondary and token characters for the film are nothing, nothing, and the plot is nothing. For example, I'd like to learn more about Harry's wife, and interact between the two. <br /> <br /> Edel harries Harry to develop and reach his stabilization with his homosexuals, in the end it is not only the last one, but clearly explaining his motives. <br /> - Soundtrack is one of the worst things I've ever encountered. Terrible work by Mark Knopfler I have evaluated more seriously from the former leader of the Dire Straits, but his job in this film is not serious. Sometimes, as in the war between union workers and police, the music was completely disconnected in the film. It's totally poor and anachronic; The entire soundtrack is made with Casio Toy Keyboard. <br /> <br /> Desmond Nakano's book is a literature that removes the word of the story. <br /> <br /> If they are trying hard to keep the action-through-action story in the book, they actually forgot to develop the characters and explain their actions and motivations. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie because I am not a serious Shelby fan, because it can destroy the original book. It's a very unpleasant attempt to simulate the novel, and shows little creative input.
