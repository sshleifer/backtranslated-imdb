This film is insulting for all submarines. It's stupid. It seems that monkeys wrote. Acting has been abused. If it had a lot of navy, I cried for our salvation. This film is terrifying. I went to the submarine movies and placed under "the bottom of the ocean". Jean Hackman should really have money to rent to make this garbage. Denzel Washington should be overwhelming. The plot is not low. And the end. Need a criminal to pay off his guilt? Only Hollywood can think of this dirt. If you find it yet, I do not like it. And if not for all pro comments, I would not be bothered by the post.
