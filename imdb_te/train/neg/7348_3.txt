I was really upset with this film. The first waters I saw were serial Mom and I enjoyed it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I saw the polyester and really hated it. The thing that I liked about the film is just Divin. She / he has a very talent hell. I was really surprised. Overall, I do not recommend this film ...
