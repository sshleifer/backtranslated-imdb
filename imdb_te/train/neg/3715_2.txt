Black Guy becomes a wealthy White Guy, and Rich White Guy embraces hip-hop culture, and plays "funny" moments of the film. <br /> <br /> Okay, Lance does not expect this to catch a body and suddenly act like Charles Wellington. It is very high. I will grant it. But at the same time, it goes the other direction too far. I want to imagine the great white guy playing the hip-hop traditional turret and the utter disappointment, and the people * will * accept him? Though he does not care about money or energy, I'm not in love with a rich man. * I can not refuse the infidelity, I can not finish the film. It added an extra star because it laughs me twice. But never get past the "White Hip Hop White Guy" never ever made in any movie I have ever tried. This is no exception.
