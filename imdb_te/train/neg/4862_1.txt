This program is one of the worst performances of all time! Completely original jokes and they're always a year late. As of 2009, they do not mention Michael Vick's Dogfights. All cast members wanted to stay on the SNL but the terrible Jon Stewart Wanna told the bees that the mad one was not funny with the opening of the jokes witch for an hour toasted mad, low, mad TV.its less. So tell me love to hear the opinion of 3 people who see this show if you have any problem love. The family guy put it well "Osama bin Ladin hides in one place where no one can watch cast of Mad TV, there is no reason why no one will look at the show.
