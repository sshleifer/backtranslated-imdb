If I checked the IMDb before renting this DVD from Netflix, I had two hours of my life back. I'm clearly suspicious when I see that the director of the film has also written. In this case, according to credits, the same person "author and director" - unfortunately, this product represents the overall quality. There are some interesting moments (e.g., the scene of Judi Tenata referring to her early comedy routines about Judy-Isam), which led me to rate these two stars. Those movements were very low ... and I could not see them because the opening scene was not nearly incomprehensible to me, and it was not infamous in its violence. I'm going to see the whole thing once will help me figure out if I missed something and see that part again to go back to see that. No, but I realized that the characters were later important. "Spinning Camera" technique is overseas and most importantly. I'm talking to the TV screen: "What's that ?!" Or "Give Good for It and Provide It!" Not recommended.
