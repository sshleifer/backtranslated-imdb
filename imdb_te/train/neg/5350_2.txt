Yes, talk about bad sequels. Rick Morrison starred in this awful third sequel-once-funny and entertaining "Honey Eye Shunk the Kids". The concept is primarily the same as the first film, but the interior house instead of the cat instead of killing children and exploring in the universe. If I think this is interesting, think again. <br /> <br /> The continuation of the film is completely gone to the toilet. The first actor is Rick Morrison of the first film. The actor changed his wife, played the children, played the neighbors, changed the name ... you name it. <br /> <br /> Second, this story is not realistic, but first of all is rebuilding. <br /> <br /> Just a few jokes (and not just nothing) from "Honey Eye Shark the Kids" and dangerous situations provided in the movie are straight. <br /> <br /> The third issue, special effects. I'm sure I have done this little budget, but they are worse than the ones in the other series, the way worse. <br /> <br /> You may want these little dolls to fear when you go home, but you're probably worrying too much time. <br /> <br /> The fourth issue is boring. Only a few things happen, and when they happen, they are not excited at all. The first film is entertaining because children are dealing with nature, grass and the flaws in it. This one, adults dealing with dirt, cockroach and cockroach trap (when kids come up rather boring). <br /> <br /> The idea for Disney's executives to release a similar sequel to the already moribund series has been appealing. I am warning you: Keep this tasteless cash in the garbage, stay here: get dust in the shelves of shops.
