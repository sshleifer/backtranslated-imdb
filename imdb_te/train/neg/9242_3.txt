What a wonderful premise: a picture about Berlin Arif. It must have everything. Tragedy. Suspense. Fellowship. Rivals. Bernier Freulins and tough US pilots. Love and tears. We've got a picture that's not mentioned above. Heino Ferch attempts to star as John Wayne, but he fails miserably. He works with wood, and at any time he must be broken. He tries to play a tough guy instead of being a tough guy! Why is Betina Zimmerman's character falling in love with him? Did they throw stones in a lake? Is he responsible for bringing his coal bricks? SFX works very well. Too much. Hundreds or more flights on Berlin appear to be a battlefield-structure-squadron rather than an organized aircraft? It really is. Interestingly, the White House, the Kremlin, and the General Lucius de Clace office all seem to be the same and dark and dirty. Notice the same dapping, if the windows are deeply down and masked against nuclear decline. Why is almost every scene dark and filthy? By the way, the general LUCIUS D. CLAY, a short time, unsecured, general general of the loose, comes across all his own noble thinking is unbelievable. He is quite the opposite. So you combine all the personal blunders and the outcome is a picture created on any hobby, no suspense and historical accuracy. Sadly, it started promising?
