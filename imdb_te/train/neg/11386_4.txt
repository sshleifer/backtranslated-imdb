One of them-God-I-I-Be-There-Thank you for the documentaries. This is a Columbia, Guerrilla and Paramilitary, and people around Medellín about the two struggling factions. <br /> <br /> Guns, drugs and death are predominant. Those under the age of 22 are in jail, not participating in the war. Girls ?? Not women and girls ?? When one of them kills, they respond in the same way with tears and throws. You scratch your head; What would they really do? I do not know what's more unnecessary: ​​night shootouts and civil unrest, or everything seems to be dull. Or, what was the 10th, that boy was drinking exactly what his debut beer was not? <br /> <br /> If you want to get these young people out of their situation, put them in places where they are more likely. This documentary, all, I'm scared.
