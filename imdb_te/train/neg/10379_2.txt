The movie begins in Japan in 1840, where a man kills his wife and her lover and commits suicide. This is a very cryptic, bloody sequence. Then it jumps to the present day ... well 1982 must be perfect. Ted (Edward Albert), wife Laura (Susan George) and their annoying little boy go to Japan for the work of Habby. They rent a house - surprise! Surprise - it will be a house if murders happen! <br /> <br /> The three dead people make ghosts for the demons (the evil and the evil ones) and the family. <br /> Okay, but it's really helpless. There is a bloody start and the end and nothing happens in between. It is just ruthlessly attacking big crabs! They look fake - I swear I saw strings pulling along one - and they mutter !!!!! In the first 20 minutes (perhaps just to show the body of George) there is an irrefutable sex sequencer, another 40 minutes later (but that requires the plot) and eventually a really crazy exorcism. <br /> <br /> The fight between Albert and Doug McClure is supposed to be believed. <br /> For acting - Albert's husband OK and McQueer is pretty good as a family friend. But George - as usual - in a lousy movie is amazing. She gives the film a much needed lift but does not save it. I've given this 2 for her and I'll open and close the crypt. Next, this is a very boring image.
