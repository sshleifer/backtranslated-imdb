I'll give this movie two stars because it teems with beautiful photography. Otherwise, it mainly speaks with cliques and generalizations: mountaineers are dumb or mute silver trash of religious or religious racist or brilliant white Indians. Indians are mentally circling around without a sound, can not speak in the eye blink, talk with animals, and read minds on big distances. <br /> <br /> While the plot touches the whole range of problems, none of them are deeply appearing. No, or it's not about being an orphan or fighting for identity. <br /> <br /> While this film is about the Little Tree's education, maybe it's about He has learned a brief summary of people's history (daring and brave) and distillery performance; he broke his clapping (he failed) and whiskey tried his hand while running (and possibly writing) with the help of Grand and her dictionary, Learned - and this was done. <br /> <br /> However, grandma and grandfather And then "I'm riding in Navagos" and "caught up in a couple battles" - the grandmother of Grandmother and grandfather and the planet Greene "to meet" the paradise In (instead, dating girls, have marriage, children or other absurdity). <br /> Last but not least I'll say grandfather's trade is dangerous. Why should all things be still whiskey? To face the theme of "drunken Indian"?
