Funky Forest to say: First Contact A bad image is an understatement of the incredible proportions. <br /> <br /> I really like this surreal, FFFC every deep and intellectual, like the good art house film, El Topo, Naked Lunch, and Survive Style 5+, especially the film does not have material. The film is bad, the visuals in the film are not inspiring, the dialogue is worse, the musical numbers destroy the movie .. I chuckled for the guitar brothers, but it was completely unnecessarily and abusive. It tried to be as deep and meaningful as I thought, but its just laughing inability. <br /> <br /> Continuous stamps between guitar brothers and skates will get 1 point, all just as bad, fake-creative, heavy handed efforts like other real-time directors, such as Sago Ishihi, David Lynch, and Juwovarsky . Will you be. I believe that people who are fond of FFFC are doing this because they do not have any idea what they see because you move on your own boots, there is nothing to be mixed and mixed. <br /> <br /> This scenery is quite awesome, it's style 5+, really scenery, cinematography, impressive dialogue, funny moments, good soundtrack, amazing performances, excellent pacing and flow. FFFC is the exact opposite of each other, the boring scene (at a bland beach of 20 minutes at night? Would it be a whitewash? Will it float on eight balls of white space, in a sinking school hallway and then in a school hall), terrible cinematography, unforgettable dialogue, There is nothing funny or funny, you wasting your life for a two-hour soundtrack Waves, uneven demonstrations, inefficient, confusing, and often pulling zero, dragging zero flow. <br /> <br /> These are the suits that make the FFFC a great image, so that its pure intellect is so unusual at every turn. "Boring", "Inner", and "Terrible" can be a good quality for an image if it goes missing because it stroke your own ego. Personally, I spoke to two people who agreed to me, FFFC was terrible when they left the theater, but with the art-house superficials, I saw a movie again and then came back with me ... "<br /> <br /> I'm going to shake my feet , The film is sloping, when Roger Ebert says that the film is the best, she has lost her own virginity. The new dress of the crown "I said ... this movie does not represent other psychedelic / tripi movies from Japan in the past 10 years.Tea, Party 7 and Kamikaze Girls taste well with movies (even with a low budget), and no one honestly style 5 + Survive If you're interested in making a pretentious pile in a shoestring budget only see the FFFC.
