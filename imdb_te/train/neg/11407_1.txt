The film is a perfect example of damaging a wonderful book. Jacob is very probably the worst movie I've ever seen. No storyline, plot disappear, and editing is awful. It's all off to the top, sounds straight from the music synthesizer and unbelievably terrible. Bridget Fonda's performance is good, but it's totally enthusiastic for everyone's performance. I have suggested this film to learn how to be a film producer as a producer. Bad cut-scenes, bad transitions, and acting. Read the book and do not waste your time with this movie.
