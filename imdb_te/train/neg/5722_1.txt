<br /> <br /> I'm not my hand-hardcore-fan, but I liked that movie. Live feed, though, big time! I have never seen a gour-film with fantastic acting, but hey wake up? Acting on Live Feed ... Well, there is no! Some have seen this comment as I have to be a school project or something. Okay, but not students in the media or acting school. It's not class! What about the story? A really sad rip off in the hostel. And what about Gore? Twist your jeeps and what do you think about the mental torture scenes that you might want to leave cold-sweating? It's frustrating about the hole image! Small, fast and NO edge. It is a death penalty than a violence. Okay, here's the buckets of blood, but it's not even realistic. Killing and violence is more than a hostel or reminiscent of the more sound than the Bradman. And Braindead is fun! Okay, I laughed twice in live feed, but it was more frustrating than fun! <br /> <br /> Instead of wasting 80 minutes by looking at the live feed, no one can see!
