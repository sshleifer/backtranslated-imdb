I'm confused. What about this movie in the world? What is the killer's inspiration? He seemed very angry, but I still realized why. Nothing in this picture makes sense. It has zero depth. Or less than zero. I guess it makes it a hill. Or pile. The worst. Acting is terrible. When I searched for some of the actors in the film, I had a lot of little things to hear about, which made me totally surprised. I feel that I do not feel like doing this unfortunate movie or I do not want someone else to do the job. Starting. . . NOW! (Seinfeld Reference.) Really, however, this does not waste your time. There is nothing small to be just fun because there is nothing there. This is undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks - NO, I have always had a bad luck, and I've seen quite a few of which are one of the worst flicks of the eye.
