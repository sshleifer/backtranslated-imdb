This is one of these great movies. The basic mantle is good - the immortal cat people who are killed to live, etc. - the sort of variation in the vampire concept. <br /> <br /> The whole of the main characters are neglected when it completely degrades. <br /> If you want to live, you also need to have a low profile - see how long it took to capture Uniborber, and it was discovered by a family member. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the kid (and sometime, the mother) behave as though they are untouchables. Kills a child without a thought to escape evidence or trial or alive evidence. <br /> This is really a shame - if it is very good, <br /> <br /> The main characters should give the level of common sense of the previous one. When every cat in town came home, I finally liked bit - every time I put food for a drive and I see my cats coming from where they were from, I think about that scene.
