If you see Shoal in 1975, do not watch this movie. If you do not see the shots of 1975, look for it. But do not look at this film. Shale's reconstruction in the film contains all the possible things that can happen. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babbhan' Bachchan plays the role of a mental villain in the best (only 40 minutes in the absence of fraud). If you remove the rest of your role and play Amitabh with his role, it is still a watch. But like Insp. Narsimha and Mohan Lal do justice to his talent. Ajay Devgan (Hiroo) is very worldly and the only reason I feel is that they played Prashant Raj in the role of Raj, because he had a wonderful comparison with Amitabh in his short days. Sushmita Sen is fine, gracious and ready for her. But for the role of "worst performance and date" Nisha Kothari should go to the award. <br /> If you have an elite-enemy play, take him to this film. :)
