I'm doing Puerto Rico and this is the worst documentary I've ever seen before. You can see that people in it are clueless. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. From Puerto Rican descendants they are called Puerto Rican, but they are probably less than anyone who is not there. You can see when they talk about talking to themselves. If you want to see real and I understand the real realistic documentary from Puerto Rico, then you should see "My Puerto Rico". That's a serious, real documentary. Like this piece of junk. Rossi Perez relies on her documentary. I think about Puerto Ricans. They do not know me repeat. Well, they are known only about this topic called the documentary. I hate to see the worst piece using Island's name. This will reduce the standards.
