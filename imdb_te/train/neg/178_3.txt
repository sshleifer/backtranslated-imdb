The movie is made for TV, so if it takes into account, I can not see it as hard as a movie. The script is a sub-par, but it can succeed in being joking with a bed. This performance is mostly over-the-top, but it applies to very low-budget films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> The only thing I really hate is that the film is about 90-95%, but in random places, the footage is 5-10 seconds filmed in the video. Because of the low contrast, the colors are low, and the footage is 24 frames per second, instead of 30 frames per second. I'm not sure if these scenes will be burned later and they do not have money to shoot at the time (however, I thought this way), but it is negligent and shadydorier in film. <br /> Anyhow, I saw the worst films, but I I can not say that I enjoyed this movie and I can not recommend it to anyone.
