I do not know what these Brady kids do. Originally, Barry Williams was publicly sexy with his TV sister, Maureen McCormick, and later with his TV mother, Florence Haydenson. Then, Susan (Cindy) Olsen made some music movies. Then Mike (Bobby) was lynched for driving to Llandland. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) may have a small homosexual towards McCormick and Eve (Jana) Plum. Now, Christopher (Peter) followed a beautiful young model at the beginning of the twentieth century in "The Surreal Life", which was fun to watch for the first time, and now they are married and in a very unstable and conflicting relationship. The last part she faced nude photographs with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give Christopher for her birthday is not a good move on her. And he acted in a very mature way, just over his head and gave up. I think he always bowing his every need and now he's finally taking a stand. And I hate what I say, but with her words, I think it will misuse her. She is an engagement ring and the way of torturing him for the way she reams him for every little thing. She speaks openly with other women, and it is clear that she is sleeping around him with women and men, which should not make any self-esteemed man when already married. If this man speaks to his wife, and goes to the party every night and having sex with other people, everyone is left behind by the wife to leave him. Why this should be different. A beautiful little love in another reality show began to grow in a huge disaster. Adrian, like herself, looks like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, clearly requires some treatment because she cries like a baby on very silly things. I'm sorry for her, but Chris wants to leave herself because he is a good guy who is not ashamed of this kind.
