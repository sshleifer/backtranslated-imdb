The whole thing is very pretty to look at .. European location shooting is a good idea. The main actors are attractive. Serve score. <br /> <br /> Sponge! And non-plot development! And from there all downhill is. Pacino is in sleep and Keller is bored, hell, dear, you're not alone. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine whether my actor or director Sydney Polach had any connection or goodness in this regard. <br /> <br /> In almost every scene of death, one way or another represents you, you have less happiness here. Maybe it wants to be as empty and cold as death. But I can not recommend it yet.
