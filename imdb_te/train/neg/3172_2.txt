This film is shoddily, unnatural garbage. Sometimes I like romantic comedies. Ice cream is good for dinner. It's not what you're going to do at all times, but the experience you can ignore is how pleasurable you are. I thought it was a lot of stupid to keep the film running continuously throughout the running time. Everything about it is cheap and hard. It looks like they have been shot in the movie at some point they werehed away. It has very cheesy CGI and lute sets. <br /> The writing is clunky. I know that you can usually face some plot problems in a screwball comedy, but you really laugh because you do not really care. The movie is very uneven, you sit there and wonder about random conversations and totally unbelievable behavior. Events in the film are kept in the film to move or express characters from a scene in the film. Sure, this is how all the movies work, but you do not notice it happening. Awkwardly. <br /> <br /> No one really liked this movie. I did not care to end up with someone, as long as they stopped hell away from me, I was not talking about it anymore. Why only the cool character in this film, Paul Rudd's character, Eva Longoria played by Toto bitchy, blame, disappointment, wish to have something to do with freak? In addition, nearly all the characters have chosen a burial solution for any eventuality. A modest man is the best moment to come up with a happy ending for the same schmoe where he gets together with a fascinating lying, kleptomaniac sister with a fascinating lying woman (and bathing) in five years, Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are attractive and attractive women. They will probably find the good looks on the road.
