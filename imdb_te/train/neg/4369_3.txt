*** Spoilers *** *** Spoilers *** Juggernaut is the first British release of the British "Thriller" in the US. Carlof Dr. Sorterius, dried up his funds because he had to leave his research. Carlofe needs to go to France and start a medical system. She was nominated by a conniving woman who wants to get rid of a very old husband. <br /> <br /> Carlofe agrees to the proposal and will soon become the husband's personal physician. All the time, the wife is sprinkling the town with a good playboy. Carlow finally excites the old geezer with poison and he kicks off. However, his son arrives a few days before killing (from another marriage) and finds that the determination has changed. When he killed Beans wife, she went to Basher, where the son melted the hand. <br /> Meanwhile, Carlof's nurse mistakenly used Hipo Carlof to kill the old man. When Karloff learns he does not make money, he asks his wife for the son. Nurse suspects Carlof and finds the missing hypotenuse. <br /> <br /> To get a long story short, the nurse escapes, gets the police, and protects the implanted son. By Carlof. <br /> <br /> There are some good points in this movie. Carlofe has a mad doctor named Devil Commands and The Man Who Had a Live Again. Still, it is strange to see him walk and watch a little hunted. He's never seen why he can walk this way. <br /> <br /> The actress who pretends to be a 2-timing wife goes awry. She has a French voice. <br /> <br /> Although she is unfortunate, you still hate her (or she hates her because of her acting). <br /> <br /> Carlf is a little less average on the vehicle. If you buy a bad movie VHS copy, the audio is a bit choppy.
