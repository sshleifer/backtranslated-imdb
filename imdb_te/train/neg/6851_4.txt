Feh. The film opened in a very interesting way, but quickly confused from the confusion. The confusing episodes were originally started, where the cut scenes are very large, the first twenty minutes or so it would be hard to tell what's going on. After being discouraged, it is difficult to love between the two beings (both the pusses). The girl's revenge inspiration is actually the most living person in the tragedy. If the rest of the cast is her skill, the film might be better. <br /> Maybe. The mad priest of the dead sixteen-year-old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter since her death, which will take on a solid humanoid form, with the decisive misfortunes that all other dead people will return, and most will begin killing each other. Living Dead is a sort of Japanese spiritual night of stuff. But this did not happen. If this priest is a pedestal priest with a small butterfly head with a small head, it turns out that if the priest completes his ritual, she will have her daughter, Pujari, finish her ritual. There is no dead body number, no army of dead bodies. The priest would like to crack her spine just as a bridegroom (she was engaged in loud amazement at the time, as the girl's soul makes the dead land back, she takes a boyfriend's washed out with her idiot kissing the dead girl, Thin!). Rabbitsen's inhale and ultimately the disappeared shot when he left the countryside at the end of the ultimate best friend. What genuine horror is much better than any Japanese and Japanese American filmmakers, which makes the makeup for the over-the-top cheesy face, shouting at Mimis. I was very disappointed.
