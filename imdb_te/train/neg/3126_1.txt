Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked it like a football ball. Unfortunately, it did not score. The historic thing of the Giants is good, but Gon will pour in the milk and ends with the bigger wheel of the cheese. I say, take this reel wheel and go over a hill. I could not see the whole movie. I said a lot because I rarely walk away from any movie. I want to give them the opportunity to finally get rid of the last minute. This bad thing is impossible to redeem something. Well, at least acting is not good! <br /> <br /> The only thing that is "falling" in this movie is rating. 1/10 and sink into negative numbers!
