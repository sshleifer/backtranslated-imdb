In Bridgeport, the disturbed high school teacher Richard Fenton (Zhanton Schck) was engaged by the teenager Donna Kuppel (Brittany Snow); She testifies that she will kill her family to stay with her, but Richard was imprisoned and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the painful Donna feel better, but still in psychotherapy and pills. In her Prom Night, she goes to the Pacific Grand Hotel for her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two friends. But mental Richard has escaped from jail and has gone on the same floor in the Donna chasing hotel, chasing her hotel friends and staff beyond her path. <br /> <br /> The unforgettable slash is "Prom Night", which is a realistic total collections collection. Stupid story is rubbish and silly, with the bad acting of Jeannan Schke in the role of a frenzy killer. The imagined screenplay is surprising because you can imagine what will happen in the next scenes. <br /> The title (Brazil): "A Mort Condado Para Dancer" ("Death Devotes to Dance")
