<br /> <br /> Two examples: A priest running through the cemetery at night suddenly invades the ghost. Spirits. After his fight, when he comes to his friend, he will keep his walk calm. "Anything wrong?" He asks his friend to see the attack. "Some demonic spirits-I could not do anything." Not just any response, no surprise he'd changed a tire. His friend is not equally concerned ... the standard priest must be trained ... ["Then you put the bush in their mouth .. any questions? Well, Demon Spirit Attacks ..."] <br> Two: Answer it, and only a demon (or thinker) can offer it. How? Why, you should ask the person who is dying! So the devil is hanging in front of the two priests, and thereby digging up their questions and damaging the man. "Hey, do not kill him!" Or perhaps "it's not good!" Their response later was more realistic. They never ask people to go or stop people - in fact, they are very passionate to respond. <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you want to do, <br /> <br />
