I saw that "Fire" was on the other night cable and I started looking at because I did not remember anything special about it other than remembering it being a terrible movie I saw back in '85. Twenty years later, the film is still awful. In addition to the synthesizer, the saxophone is the most vulnerable in pop music in the late 1980s, the title track is clear. Again I heard that song, and I liked to jab a screwdriver in my ears. And Rob Lowe's role in this musical attack played the role of saxophone, and he portrayed a solo role he read as Charlie Parker, his dark tone and a monkey playing the only game in the game. All the roles have gone unnoticed, but I must say that they have done a great job of acting in a cast that does not appear to be equal to them. In fact, I thought that WinningHom was attractive and she initially apologized for her role as she wearing funny lingerie, but when the film ends, she decides to romance with Rob Lowe's role.
