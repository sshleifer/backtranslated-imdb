The film, which has lived in Japan for many years, reflects Japanese culture and does not come close to describing what Geisha is. Unfortunately, there is not a great opportunity to demystify a country that is far from the vast Western audience of Japan's culture, and Jen, a samurai, originated from the world of geisha of Kyoto. Some of the most sharp movements of the film are when Americans show up in Japanese. Geisha dances are not standard. There is much use in Chinese music. A small but necessary detail: Proper use of spices is not found anywhere. Sakura scenes are almost unclear! Interestingly, some Chinese actors have been very convinced of the Japanese people.
