I've completed a marathon of this array, and it's getting worse to see it as it progresses. In the later episodes of Ohherlieh's horror accent, the show goes further from the historical concepts. If you are looking for a slightly lower quality product for WW2 soft drops, I would recommend Season 1, but thereafter, something can be avoided, making it a step away from a soap opera, with story lines and sensibility. <br /> The old B & W image attached to it is best for what kind of entertainment with the name Colditz, and that is not what it is for hope also.
