Lin Hollister, a small town attorney, goes to a nearby city in a business associated with the death of his friend Johnny. (Yes, Lynn was a woman despite the feminine-verbal Christian name.) John Wane's birth name "Merion" was originally a script writer who attempted to make a sniff reference?) Halister first believed Johnny's death was in danger, but soon realized that Johnny was murdered. Further investigations reveal the web of corruption, crime and election rigging that is connected with the bass Cameron, the leading light of the city's political machine. <br /> <br /> It was a gritty crime thriller film Noir style in 1941. It's not. "A Man Betrayed", despite its background, is a lighter romantic comedy than a crime scene. Houserster Cameron's fond girlfriend falls in love with Sabra and the film focuses more on their sexual effects on suspense issues. <br /> <br /> This is the drama. One critic said that John Wane was not trusted as a lawyer, but he was unable to play a cowboy in every film and possibly harsh hard-driving lawyer on organized crime bosses in his compass. I disagree with that critic, when he told me that Wayne was not Carrie Grant's impersonation. Romantic comedy is not on his street. One of the weaknesses of the studio system, whether the actors or their owners are on their street or not, their owners have to demand and one of the few main actors working for Wayne Republic Pictures <br /> <br /> Cary Grant also acts as a comedy "A Man Betrayed" Could not create itself. It is not a reflection of his comic talent; This film reflects the complete lack of fun material. Anyone who has developed their sense of humor, I have something to see and laugh. The film's light-hearted sound did not make it a hit comedy; This only prevents you from being taken seriously. This is one of those fish or meat or chicken or good red herring. 3/10
