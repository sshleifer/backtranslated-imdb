The film's version of Sandra Bernhard's One-Woman Off-Broadway Show is serious about the expression. Sandra spoof lounge activities and superstars, but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting, and fitfully funny. Her fans say she is honest and honest and this may be true. But she is also shrill, with an unapologetic, in-your face bold in a sculpture that does not fit well in this sculpture. She does not need to be good - and she's not able to make her friends - and it always rubs the wrong way. But if you meet her half, here's her bad thing. The filmmaker Nicholas Rogue worked as an executive producer and did not direct him, which featured his chilled, separated signature style in the film. Bernhard wrote the show with director John Boskovich; Sandra's internal audiences are completely bored - a lot of their true audience participates. **** from * 1/2
