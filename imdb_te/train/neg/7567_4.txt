Story: Young-Gone is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution when she believes that she is actually a cyborg. <br /> If you're reading this, you'll probably know how talented Chan-walk is. But 'I'm a cyborg ...' well known, and (unfortunately) departed from a stronger land. I'm a big fan of any movie or story trying to do anything else. God knows, we have suffered enough in our local cinema. <br /> <br /> The main thing about the movie I want to say is that I can not say anything about mental illness or create roles that you care about. <br /> <br /> This story is the best I've seen in years ... but weird is not enough. The heart of the film is not ... just surreal and confused. The chaos will be the main theme of the film. The characters try to understand all their own problems, but this suggests that Chan-uk Park is his most confusing.
