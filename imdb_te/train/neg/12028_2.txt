I concur with everyone on who told me what this fantastically amazed movie was to convince not to wasting a briefest moments. Very poor acting, offhand production values, totally pedestrian direction, and a script so never write, which is not useless and anonymous. Even the Hollywood "experts" apparently go to work just for a paycheck, although no one should have paid this bad work. <br /> <br /> Oth, jaw-dropping is attractive about looking at something bad. And Chad Lowe is terrifically and consistently bad.
