This film is very powerful - strong cast, a reasonably strong idea and clearly a good budget. I'm not sure where it all went wrong, but each of those items was wasted. The story did not go somewhere, the characters are empty to say the least and the result is very boring, meaningless, a film waste. I hate it. Determining by other votes, I'm in a minority here and in some ways be crazy. However, I thought this film was terrible. I had so many hopes, but was very disappointed. Jody Foster's character is a special disappointment. A lot of varieties are strongly "fixer" that makes a nice idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did not do anything and did not go anywhere. Denzel Washington is always playing his role - enjoyable but nothing new.
