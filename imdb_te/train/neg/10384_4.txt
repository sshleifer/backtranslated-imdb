..It is this one! <br /> <br /> When there is a good enough script for the rich characters and a ghost story but here are the things that suffered me: when the ghosts appeared, which I really liked by the way; How it happened, how it looks ... The relationship of the devil is the only thing. Due to the way the things went down in the first scene you think their dynamic is different. <br /> The Things I Slight Slightly Slightly In The Middle, And The Crab / Spider Scene Is Not Just Good. But the ending is really nice! Certainly, 'The Grudge' was basically a polished lens or the same samurai as I said about the film. <br /> <br /> Please republish a person who has remade this movie. /> <br /> 'Silent Rage Fans' will definitely love this movie.
