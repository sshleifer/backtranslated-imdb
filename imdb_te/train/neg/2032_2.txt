I gave these two stars for the awesome DV shot clarity, which gives the cool and darkest stellar of its character. It's generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This film will fail on all accounts. I can not recommend it because it's not poetic or blunt. No dramatic, or breathtaking. Controversial, not common. <br /> <br /> It is a waste of time that anyone who can advocate any frightening or predatory fan with good faith. . <br /> <br /> Get away from this awful product. <br /> Thank you.
