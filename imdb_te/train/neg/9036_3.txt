I can not believe I wasted my time watching this rubbish! I gave it "AA" rating by Leonard Maltin and it is generally a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment for TV movies. <br /> Acting, but whoever wrote it should never be denied any medium of communication. The plot is ridiculous, the motivations of "bad guys" are totally absent, and different family versus versus and shallow. For example, the DAD preaches a violent response to the invasion, but he is "pretty good" with his fist as he is "abandoning idiots" rather than "admirable" ... <br /> <br /> The only message I can earn shortly from this pop is nuclear The family is good and alternate living arrangements are bad. Oh, and bad people are going to be good people.
