The Alley (Sophie Holland) long weekend 'somewhere in the middle' of their father, sister & sister Emilio (Richard Cambridge) & Judd (Daniel MacLanan), Molly (Nicole Petty) & Andrew (David Hood) Words are not mine. However, before they know they're deep in a forest & emilio on a girl (Francis da Costa), who, unfortunately, wound their problems along with the injured van they do not launch the van they are traveling to and do not get any signs on their mobile phones. As Molly & Judge pass the time, they need help quickly to get back home in hopes of finding a home, they are not alone that the darkness begins and in the woods there are evil powers ... <br /> <br /> The English production was written and directed by Johannes Roberts. There are many other commentary & reviews on IMW and Internet. No, there is not much for all personally. This script is credited to Roberts on screen, but here in the IMDB Joseph lists the list with 'extra screenplay material', which is your basic backwood slasher type, Texas Chainsaw Masqueror (1974), victims of your basic stranded faceless teens Killing people for the reason but never let the wild roam & satisfy any great deal of satisfaction Who has fallen angels uses an interesting feeling. Steffen, who then played a wonderful Tom Savin, did not do what he did. Is he there to get angelic victims? So why did he kill Andrew by hitting his head? The story is a lot loose, it does not look like the right image. The character's poor, the conversation is not very good & the lack of any important story makes it hard to care about or getting something going on. <br /> <br /> Director Johannes does not do anything special, it is not particularly stylish or flash. There are some good horror scenes. Tom Savi's role was good when he was on the screen (why did he not hear when he threw the door door while fleeing with Molly?) When he was on the screen was shy. There are good gorgeous scenes here, someone has frozen in their head, there is a beheading, someone gets a gun explosion, someone blew up, someone bitten off the lips and ripped it off in half. <br /> <br /> The Damnade's technical forest is perfect, it is reasonably well made, but there is nothing special or eye catching. It was filmed in England & Wales & quite an odd to see an English setting for most American background back horror. This acting is generally good for Savini and deserves to be good. Horror writer Shawn Hutson has an awkward guest role at the end and proves that he is committed to writing rather than acting. <br /> <br /> The Forest of the Damned is a pretty poor horror film, I'm missing something but I'm not the most enjoyable film. Unlike one or two good moments, there is not much to recommend here.
