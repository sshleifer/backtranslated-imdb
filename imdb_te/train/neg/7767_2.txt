This film should be interesting for anyone who does not get acquainted with CS. It depicts colorful, well-played and high-profile adventure, but it's terrible for us to know the original stories. <br /> <br /> Some screen-writers have been forced to rewrite the stories they are working on. However, the spoken word is different from the written word, and some parts of the time the film is harder. But, does the screen-writers rewrite the story instead of it instead? In this case, the authors themselves did. <br /> Just a few examples: Do not rebel against celebrities. When the half-mad captain fell side-by-side, the officers took the boat. The court is not marshal. The trial court was conducted in an almost congratulatory environment. Captain Pellev does not appear in this episode of the Hornblower Saga, and Colonel Ortega did not even have a wife. Hornblower, he was never in the Brigade on the ship or on the coast. There are many such manipulations of the story of Fortress. <br /> <br /> Based on a thoroughly technical, I think the recurring consumption of this film will hurt the continuation of the story. Why, oh why the screen writers have a good story dirty?
