Terrible acting, terrible cast and cheap items. If action is set to parody style film it is very good. No waste. <br /> <br /> "Enemy" is the name of "Action Movie". (Contributing parody effect). A policeman who looks like a 60-year-old sportsman, has a pretty boring look on her face. At the end of the movie and she worked together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it feels like cheap lines given just before the sex scene in a romantic movie. Horrible. Do not waste your time.
