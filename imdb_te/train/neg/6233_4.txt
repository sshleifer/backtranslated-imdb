The worst karate / horror thriller confusing with loads of gary violence and inappropriate nudity, and totally insulting and bizarre "plot". It's less weighty and low-level entertainment, especially appeal to viewers who have a kinky taste, but it's a happy bad thing and I'm confident that I'm not really bored when looking at it .... (* 1/2)
