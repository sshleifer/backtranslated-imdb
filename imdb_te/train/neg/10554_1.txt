An avan-garde nightmare, a very low-budget "movie", which fights greatness. It's hard to sit by. I get a message that child abuse is wrong. Wow is the big revelation. I have no evidence that it is wrong before seeing this. Yes it's irony. This "movie" can not be seen if you are hurt by nudity of a male or female gender. It does not see if you are at least bit less. If you do not care about acting, you can not see it. <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Movie, Premiere, Interview with Christie Bowers, Removed Scenes, Movie Stills, Commentary Director, 2 versions of Teaser Trailer, The Azoic Music Music, & Video Experiment in a Classroom
