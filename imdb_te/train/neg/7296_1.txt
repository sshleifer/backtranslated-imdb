Colombo movies are going deep into the year, this year it can reach the bottom. Peter Fawl gives the same uninterested performance and comes in as creepy in the film. As in the series, the crime scene protocols are not heard, so there is no proximity. Brenda Waccaro scratched the eyebrow and pulls the pantomime faces and Andrew Stephens is an amazing contractual lady. (His poor, though, a hoot!) Through the script numbers and its delivery. They never brought to the nineties Colombo, with only one or two happy memories left with intelligent plot, good scripts and sharp characters.
