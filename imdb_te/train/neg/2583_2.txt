Another American film image has been shoved down by our throats and this one is the worst one of them all. It is not desirable to name the American. They should stay in "the wedding". <br /> <br /> The film is considered to be just a big romantic film, which hit the title of American tie. I seemed to see a different series when I was looking. It's not like an American pie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] <br /> I do not recommend it ever. Actually I do not recommend anything in the "American Pie Presents". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
