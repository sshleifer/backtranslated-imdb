There will be a suspense shaker in the form of cinema. There are surprises, turns and turns, recessions and enthusiasts. Sometimes, it's really a "edge off seat" film. <br /> <br /> The villain is not reliable in this song; His character does not come together. <br /> <br /> In this movie, I refuse to "spoil the movie", but the end of the character we have just met is not what we see at the end. <br /> The second major disappointment in this movie - Finally, it becomes a bit more, it is a bloody slasher image. One of the most recent and "Friday 13" films has a less qualitative difference. <br /> <br /> Although the film has a magnificent Sean Connery, he does not comply with his normal standards and is often just walking through the pace.
