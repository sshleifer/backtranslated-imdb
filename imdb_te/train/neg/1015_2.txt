The curious thing is worse than the evil that made the TV movie. I can not believe that Spiesy and Freeman are in the film. The reason for Morgan Freeman's role is to talk constantly and say "pussy" when pointing NSync boyfriend. Morgan Freeman calls women "pussy" is just awkward ... what's the people behind this actor? The film was completely unbearable with many plot holes combined with horror acting, confusing camera angles, dull script and inexpensive background music. <br /> I've rented this flap for fewer expectations. .. well ... it really sucks.
