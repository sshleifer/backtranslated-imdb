I have seen many good Korean movies, including thrillers and movies, dark spots, but this is a suck. The director was a vicious man who came to produce a waste material. This film does not have any entertainment value and is not a thriller too. I can not believe that someone really made such a film. Though acting, the story and the feeling of it being left is awful. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I'm going to see any films like this film director. There is no awareness of filmmaking in having thriller movements. All of these are depicted with seriously painted mental illnesses, showing more painted scenes and more blood and violent ideas. Very frustrating image and I strongly recommend skipping all the movies of this sort.
