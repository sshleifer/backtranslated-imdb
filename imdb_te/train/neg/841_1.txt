I saw this movie 15 minutes ago and I still saw it. Basically I think of an image about "Star" of CD Roms that is realistic about Cartoons Online about the Internet S & M Flash. She was murdered by someone, a crack team of 2 FBI agents to investigate her sister and death. The local homicide unit in Big City, USA is also investigating, although most of his work has actually referred to CD ROMs as "real thing". I know. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only film he has no credits. He has been in the film for about 15 minutes, half of which is the main reason for no reason. I can not even explain the end because I can not do it very clearly. But before the final scene, we will treat the 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the picture. Honestly, they were able to drive the final scene and had the same effect with the cross-eyed direction and everything. <br /> Keep everything away from this film. I love bad movies and I came because I love Michael Madsen. I really used something else for 80 minutes and was more satisfied. Like playing that game with the knife, you have a jab in your hand repeatedly. 80 minutes more entertaining.
