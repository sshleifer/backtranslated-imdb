Taste. I can not make a smile about the movie. I laughed the whole movie. It was not funny. Matt Farmsworth did not know what he was doing. His story is written, which I do not know about Ivo culture and meth. I know that I have come from Forensworth Ayyo, which made me more confused by his film. Why are the two main characters accents? It does not have any sense. This performance is best and sometimes difficult to look at. Deadly violence and romance filled the image. I'm guessing the violence and sex image to be experimental, but it came across unbelievable and dangerous. The ending of this movie is pretty bad and I can see the rolling credits with all the laughs and dislikes. The theater I left was laughing with me when everyone went out. The film was intended to induce the end tears, but it made the exact opposite. Do not waste your time in this terrible movie, if you do not want to see the innocent, ill, ill, and moves.
