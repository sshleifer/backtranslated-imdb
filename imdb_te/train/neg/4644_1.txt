This film is terrible. The story relates to a woman trying to find out what happened to her sister. The film has worked hard on its recognition, from Noir / Thriller to Sexuality, and is fighting against the horrific elements thrown for good measure. The film has a very confusing structure, for example the use of the past often without getting into this story. The plot has grown significantly, and it is hard to distinguish between who and who they are playing. Some movies featured in many films, but the main journalist willingly agreed to go to the scene with a real stranger for his home, the gun minus, the police call, brought to her, believing it difficult. Some of the cinematography is very poor: 42 I'm looking at TV, so I know that anyone with a small set will work in any darkened scenes. Overall, the chaotic mess.
