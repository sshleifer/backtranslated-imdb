It's good to tell about this movie. Cleveland star, I'm there and the city did not see this good. <br /> <br /> The film is going to go ahead with the expectation that the film will not see a real world relevance. Shoot down firearms and shoot guns without any consequence. For example, Rob Lowe's character's house has a shootout-two cars are stolen, and most copies do not appear in the next movie. <br /> Whoever wrote the film should receive countless scarce bullets of movies? Most of the actors in this movie are much better than this. To verify that the writer's strike was not written during the strike I will check the movie date but that's not the case. Universal's HD channel is currently in rotation - there is no reason to see it except that you have to come up with Lowe.
