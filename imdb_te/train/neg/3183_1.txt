Sergio Leone spins in his grave ... The movie will work on any film that casts a man's life. The main character's "camel wolf" is bold and lame, and the script is clearly written by an eight-grade schoolmate. Whoever wants to knock down the horse. The only reason I spend the trash time is because there is a 10 line minimum. Sergio Leone's family must be sued because of its worst, but now it has become worse by MST 3000. Grumbling. I blame Hollywood ... Gary Bassie is angry but cocaine users and arms experts ... this film is a pure blasphemy.
