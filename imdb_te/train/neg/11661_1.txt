Basically it's overlapping, unfunny, action / comedy. The first thing I said was that Brother Vierce's brother had enjoyed Scary movie and the sequel had moments. Unfortunately unhappy white chicks can not laugh. <br /> It's totally raw. If you like to sieve, farting, stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this. It's idiotic when it's not crude. The first 10 minutes of the film gave me everything away, completely unfunny, just idiotic. <br /> While I'm with a friend, I see the whole thing (otherwise I'm not bothered). The story is undeniably thin, it's in a very scary movie but at least smiling is quick and stable. I think this film is one of the most major problems, laughing does not come quickly enough. Some jokes are pulling out for a long time when the first place is more frustrating than funny. If you like your brain with some brain cells, you should avoid it. <br /> <br /> If a completely unfunny, narrow storyline, a film based on a thought, if the white chicks wearing the film?) But there is not enough material.
