Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes are the team of hustlers on the basketball court. Well, it sounds like everything there. It leaves our room for good comedy and good story. But such an incident happened in the next boring minutes of this enthusiastic attempt of the film. The film is repeated after the first twenty seconds, has become retarded and ridiculous. Woody Harrelson my favorite t.v. Characters, Woody from Cheers, and I'm looking forward to seeing him in this film. But after seeing his "acting performance" he came to the conclusion that he must play in the mute country hicks who bartend. His acting film is dull and poor. Rossi Perez is another actor in this dubious movie. I liked movies with Perez before, but the reason I enjoyed other works in her career is that she is not a major figure and has decided that there are not many spoken lines (right thing). But now she has made her central character in many lines in the White Men, and so the audience means she should put it with the most annoying and whining voice. So after seeing this movie (the word is used loose) and heard more Rossi Perez than for praise I now say I am a white man and I'm getting ready to jump. . . Twenty stories apartment building.
