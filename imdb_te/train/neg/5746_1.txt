Now about the worst picture in distribution! I love zombie movies and saw this in the rock so I used to think why? Oh my god is a shame for zombie movies and fans in this movie! Whoever made this movie, remove your camcorder and go to the movie school! There were so many gour hounds where they had time and effort for their movies and they had something that did not respect the film. I know what I want to make movies and I have a lot of time spent in making money and meet the market, but that money and time is not good. You need to invest in some books on how to make actors, scripts, real cameras, and independent images. I got you how to release the DVD but whoever banging their head on a good friend or wall. It's not quality in Gore films, the effects are weak! I'm actually very angry at these stores, and I can not get my money back. Please, if you have written this picture here, just finish it. I know that I'm very strict, because I have 10 lines, so I'm trying to get the point.
