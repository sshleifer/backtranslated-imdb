When I released Gold Child in 1986 it was criticized worldwide by critics, and I said it was very bad that AP Murphy's blinking career was too bad, but it was one of the pictures. <br /> <br /> It is a blanket expression on his face with the expression on the face of the budded saints knee It goes bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do you want to chop the baby carriages monks? Bad guys giant bird cage withdraw and stick inside the baby that is sitting now ... Go to speculate? If you bring him for a sleepover at Michael Jackson's fairy ranch and even give him the same empty expression, get the impression that this film is a good wooden chill title. <br /> <br /> The title sequence starts and has a pop soundtrack in the 1980s. Naturally this time it was cold and fun but now it's been a long time in 2004. It also begins with somewhat bleeding. In fact, the main problem with the film (and the boy is a serious one) - the whole mood seems to switch from scenery to the scene, sometimes it's like watching scenes from completely different movies. Even if I personally blame the director, the screenwriter and the producer must also share the same blame. What kind of filming is there in this film? This is part of the fantasy, part martial arts, part buddy movie, part comedy and all the worst
