I tried to like this slasher, as I try to enjoy all the slasher movies. I mean a little nudity and mindless killing combined with some suspense, how can you make a mistake. But unpunched is an example of the formula that I said was wrong. The main three girls landed at home and the main three girls are terrible acting. They seem to be discouraging, which stands out to be of interest to their plight. The image is intended for suspense and creepiness but the direction of the numbers that saps it, and the picture leaves pretty dull. If the image is well executed it may be ace. The story and characters are pretty creepy and there are some dark and bizarre comic movements of interaction between the mother, the girls and the daughter in the old house. There are some good nudity and occasionally elegant bloodbath, not enough to give the kick of the film. The finish is pretty distorted and terrify, and the film does not give a big lift but sadly, it's too late. So, in my opinion, one to avoid, unless you really love the obscure slasher movies. There is a potential quantitative amount, but the picture provides a lot less to be worthwhile.
