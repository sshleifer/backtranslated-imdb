Judging by the hype, and other reviews on this site, I'm focusing on the junkies that is ready for a fantastic horror movie. I've got to focus on the worst junkies I've got. I wonder if these people have a movie called "Cookers" reviewed? There are only 3 main characters, none of them have written me well or you liked me well. <br /> <br /> I was shocked and surprised by the headache of these drugs. Do not rent this movie. Rental "Cabin Fever" or some other good horror movie. Hell, rental "Mary Papins"! Animated penguins are scarier than anything you will find and are more convincing "cookers."
