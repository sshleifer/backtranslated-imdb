At least 100 votes or more movies. Nominated for the best screenplay written directly for the screen? Brenda Bletheen was nominated as Best Actress in the Leading Role? Nomination for Best Picture? I disagree with many Oscar picks but respected by the academy is the worst movie of all time. Writing and acting are terrible. Particularly Blethin's satisfaction is one of the worst worries I've ever seen, and perhaps the performance acting more than all the time. Not suitable for the big screen, many cable or television channels have been played regularly, including the HBO (I see here). I am very grateful, I do not pay to see one of the highest rated movies of all time.
