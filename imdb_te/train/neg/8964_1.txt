Bobby is a small group of people trapped inside a group of trapped mood disorders, mood disorder, bad acting ... This one is a bit different though: know that two previous cube movies know pretty much what they can expect. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this movie Half of the cube takes place. Here people see people in the cube (or at least five). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Cube Zero emphasizes this notion that it is rather cheap than its ancestors (as well as its ancestors), and this shows that the empty rooms show more than just a couple. I said that the actors will not win any future prizes. <br /> <br /> They brought back traps from Cube 1. This film and the first to congratulate its relationships, but I think that it is not entirely unwanted cooperation with a franchise that is not great. [1/10]
