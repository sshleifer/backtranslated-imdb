First of all, this plot is overdone the way - the girl pulls it by the girl, everyone loves it, snobby girl loves, lost all the looks, everyone crush on an attractive male, throw in the fitting in something that she loves again ... Second, I really hate to break classical music. They're not really reminiscent of the quote, but I remember at a point in the movie, "Why are they? So climbing up ... Traditionally?" It's really humiliating. <br /> <br /> Third, I have crossed dozens, but the only reason I can think of is the encouragement of Britney Spears. <br /> <br /> Oh, but the actress who played the role of the Holly (I'm not sure whether she is really singing or not) is a reasonably good voice that is not as exciting as they make it - especially when she's running. <br /> <br /> Her whole time is over supporting. <br /> <br/>
