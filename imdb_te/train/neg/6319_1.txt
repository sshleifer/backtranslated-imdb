This film reminds me of how college students protested against the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> When the coward had heard that some babies were eating without cheesebugs in cow dumpled kale, the president immediately changed the American foreign policy. <br /> <br /> The most dangerous is that if you go to the USSR and US war it can work at the end of the world. <br /> <br /> If you do not have a US and USSR ward. <br /> We have only conventional weapons, the concept of another war, an unexpected "victorious" war in Europe and Asia. <br /> I thought they would get rid of this film. <br /> <br /> It is an excellent example of how not to make a film by filmmakers. <br /> It should be 0 stars or maybe black holes ...
