I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I love the running man. So clearly I was very excited that someone made a movie. And when I showed a local network picture, I was in heaven. <br /> When I saw someone playing Arnold Schwarzenegger, the first indicator was something wrong. As I have explained in the book, I can not believe that Renny will play a fraudulent person who is famous for movies' filled with 'a shuttle' But I still have convinced it is a good movie. Who knows, maybe Arnold have some hidden talent? <br /> Well, he did not. I immediately found out that he was the only reason why I wrote the whole story about the 'cast'. Oops, it's classic Arnold-film: The hero is done wrong, the hero solves problems by driving his powerful muscles and pushes everyone away and gets the hero of the hero. <br /> I was surprised. This book is not what it is. I do not know the books should not be literally, but this does not have a link to the book. Stephen King publicly publicly disclose any affiliation with the film, and he is banned for the shameless waste of the film as The Running Man. I often do not say, but this film is Baad. If I do not see the house, I throw thrown tomatoes on the screen. <br /> <br /> "I've never used many people because I've done this because I'm ashamed that a lot of people have done this work here, naming them Make them more embarrassed)
