Yes, I'm going to tell you about this, so do not read it if you want to be surprised. I got this one with the title Christmas Evil. There is another Christmas horror on the DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night. Silent Night, Bloody Night (quiet night, can not be confusing with Deadly Knight), is very good and good, it's not very good. It started interesting enough to be watching the villain (you can call him) watching neighboring kids and writing in books about naughty and nice, but after a while you are looking for some action and do not deliver this film. You still need to develop the character, but you still are not sure why this goes into and hecks the guy. About an hour he will kill three of the four, and the whole audience will see terror, and he will not kill his targets, they are just mocking him. This is one of the most unsuccessful attempts to hit the naughty killer. He goes to kill and kill this other person, and he tries to enter his home so he tries himself by pressing the oven. He immediately gets stuck and just manages to get out. He enters the dungeon and breathes in his bedroom and tries to kill a man. He does not seem to kill the guy, so he stops a star from the tree and strikes the throat. Was the heck tree in the bedroom for the first time? Oh, kill this before the killer stopped at a party and have some fun too. Well that town town people chasing with torches and his brother and that tune except that part of the uninvited he wants to play. What's that too? He kept talking about something he never really explained. I have spoilers, so I will tell you how it will be. He runs off the road in his van and proceeds, well say it is lame !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
