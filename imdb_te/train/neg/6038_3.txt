<br /> <br /> "I have denied special effects" are a bit hokey. That's exactly why I enjoyed the movie too. It's enough to fit this style of a 70's horror classic. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to another film from the producers and directors to go for talent actors and staff and sharpen your techniques.
