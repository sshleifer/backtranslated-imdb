I watched it free, thankfully, wanted to be better than that, but it was the old thing that Movie Studios laughs in the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer <br /> <br /> If the plot line does not surprise you, it does not look like a thrill. <br /> <br /> Lots of focus gocus and fart jokes. By Halfway's film I started to realize that Ben Stiller was not really that funny, but he tries very hard. And Jennifer Anniston is not really pretty, but her hair looks great. <br /> <br /> Ham Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman had to pay a lot of money to stay in the average hi-ham movie of this kind, and I hoped for more of them. I really saw this movie, which really saw the funny and original American spinner - and I compared the two parts of my head and the cinematic officials turned back the two films. <br /> <br /> Without the formulaic stuff, Improved movies have been made.
