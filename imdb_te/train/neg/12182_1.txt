Where did I start? I feel like a very disgruntled one with Eileen Quimn. I love the movie All, and I was expecting this to be a fantastic movie, but I was disappointed! Acting is awful, the original came out a few years before I was born, I'm now 25 and all still one of my favorite films, I was really excited to see All 2. What is the original character, which is awful in acting? Very badly written, directed and acted. It is not a movie that I want to see again, and I would recommend no one to see this movie because you are very disappointed. The young people singing are not bad but still do not compare to the original
