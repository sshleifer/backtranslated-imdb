I'm honest, it's always one of the worst movies. Otherwise, it is very close. The bad teens have always seen soap opera. Well this is like one. Except for the worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know, If you ever read the book, avoid the film like the plague, they will change the personality of the characters and events, in addition, they will just get rid of things and end up before this book is an AWFUL image so you read the book If you read the book, burn it (film) If you want less than the quality stupid teen soap operators than your average low-quality teen soap opera, go for it again.What else would we expect differently from MVV ?
