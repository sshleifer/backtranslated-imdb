The rebellion of zombies does not have any ransom features. I'm tired of the people who claim that it's not that bad, and the arguments should be packed more of a punch in 1936. I suspect this is not the truth: IQ's is not as significant as the last 7 decades. As an average viewer today, he was frustrated by this trash as an average viewer in 1936. Why? Just try to look at the first scenes, and calculate the interruptions between the ongoing times, the awful selection to cut off anytime, and the slapshot edition that appears to have an extra two seconds on each shot to pad the running time. Take a complete list of repetitive conversations: "I will make some tea / go out / read my book now." "Do you?" "Yes I am." Such conversion takes place several times. Usually I'm a huge fan of bad movies, but they love to see mumbling listless actors mumbling their unassuming and tedious lines, and the movie will love all the desire to laugh away fades away. This powerful, predictable mind-blowers plan of unpredictable, pot-boiling time-water is much worse than the Martians, ninome or outer space or Santa Claus conquerors. They say that the idea of ​​"good" entertainment is better than these interesting films. This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw is awesome: your eyes are bad in the sense of being bored with slow boredom. It's very bad.
