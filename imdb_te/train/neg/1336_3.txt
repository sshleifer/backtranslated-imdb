The film is not exactly one of the best films of Mary-Kate and Ashley. I did not really like it, and I was kind of disappointed in that movie. For some reasons, it really is a fast film together. In some areas, I got boring and I got to speed ahead. It's not as exciting as any other intellectuals or their other films.
