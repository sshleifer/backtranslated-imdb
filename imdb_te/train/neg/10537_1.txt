<br /> <br /> Here are some fantastic actors (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but they are apparently spending money. <br /> <br /> Lizat Anthony and Marcus Gilbert appear in two other cartland epics - Anthony Hugh Grant (suspiciously disturbed) and Gilbert Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> You're really "watchable" Cartel's adaptation, one of Bonham Carter ("A Hazard of Hearts" - no title !!). Gilbert is the weak link, but Bonham Carter is suitably attacked and actually actually works, and the remaining cast sharp words (Edward Fox & Diana Rig)
