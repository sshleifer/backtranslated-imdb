Rosario Dawson was cast as a raped girl on a date, and then good in the dark as it is possible with a vengeance. When Dassen was clearly aware of why she took this role, it was an opportunity to show her acting chaps and a small independent, constructive un-Hollywood movie, although she did not appear to be the role of Dawson. I'm sorry, I can not find her. It's not mistaken, I do not know where I am, I do not know where she is. Yes I'm on her screen but I've never been able to print anytime, even though I spent a couple of hours better. I have seen any real sense that the script was blamed on the heck screen from the end, not the other from the end. People seem more pose than the truth and do not seem to have happened. (I like to talk about it but it does not cause it to spoil it), Rosario Dawson 's image is no more than an image .I can tell you what it can say, it is not, it' s not the time to come back. For Rosario Dawson fans, warn NCN why there are so many real reasons. (And Rosario-please, you choose good actress, better scripts)
