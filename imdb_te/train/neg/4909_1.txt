This is true, you heard me. I'm a fan of James Patterson. I own in his 10 books, and I read the entire series about Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the screenwriter should be filmed. <br /> <br /> What filmmaker would you like to shoot at the movie and make a mockery of mystery genre? I thought Harry Potter was cut off, then Michael Hara proved to be wrong with me. <br /> <br /> I pray that the next story writer who gets this wonderful book intact will do it very well. Michael Hara and Russell Malkahi: Do not leave your day job.
