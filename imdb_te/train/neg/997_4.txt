For the first time in the recent "lipstick" history of seeing back in a few decades, even though I have heard more negative comments than good from other movie friends as I'm changing the backdrop into "Dessant" <br /> <br /> From this, the Rape Revenge movie is unique to how the contrast has been made tasteful of the problem in "Charging" to "lipstick," to tawdry sensationalism of bloodshed "I spit on your grave," on curiously completed in the past 32 years management. But "importance", although doing some important things, is not really what's really real with the realmeter meaning. No, the "wealth" is made with very little painted and sound quality, which can confirm it from any important message --- when closely examined, is not sensational. <br /> <I pretty much know where I am going to go * There is * "descent" or decline of Dasson's character. Being a big fan of Rosario, I'm getting rid of the layers and she's been born slowly ... it's anxious to see what you know, the kind of filming to Denoiro "Taxi Driver." Unfortunately, the script and the author / author's options do not offer incredible transformation. <br /> <br /> The biggest point of failure is the second act. It's clear for the filmmaker's intentions for this section with the club-hopping, drug use, big black male adrian (every white boy nightmare, natch) from Q & A on DVD, but this excursion in Dawson's role is believably never rendered. She does not know exactly what the hell is half the time, what she does next, or why she is doing it. The poor quality of audio / video does not help again, but this range is too long and nonsense. It can eliminate any momentum and investments in the main role without destroying it. By the time we end, our interest has already been obscured. <br /> <br /> The success that suggests in Dawson Q & A is the point of "revenge" by the end of a "revenge" scene where we get the draw out of reality and find it ugly. <br /> If you have a DVD, check the deleted "classroom" scene. This is an incredible 8 minute plus powerless and inspiring anthis (though not all verbal) that really showcases Dawson's slow crack-up as her prissy, degraded accommodation counselor vivisects of delightfully poor Francis Swift. If there are more of these expository scenes added and the middle third is reduced, there may be an interesting psychological study about the effect of innocent violent acts. <br /> <br /> Final Cut, though, is what we've seen before, all in more graphic rendering. What is that?
