I think this is a terrible production and direction film. Benicio del Toro should not work in the production of movies, he should put his voice on his acting and that's it. The whole point of thinking about Steven Soderbergh Revolution is that it is not about the ideals and Che Guevara's life. The camera is terrified, fired with the two working days of experience, music ... I do not know .. Is there a music in the film? I do not recommend this piece sh .. No one. It's just 4 hours before TV or anything wasted .... I can not figure out how to rate this movie over 3 stars. Awesome .... awesome .... extreme ... do not see extravagant. "Movie" from this movie
