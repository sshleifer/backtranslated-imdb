John Hector is totally horrific in this movie. For the first time in a student film I thought I was looking for a bad college boy. Anna Farris, course is not good, but it's not terrible (plus she's beautiful). Diane Keeton should know very well. Jeff Daniels was the only one to be saved in this film (even though it was a poor judgment on his role). <br /> <br /> For all, I can lower these costs. I'm glad I did not pay to see it! <br /> <br /> John Hayder has always been in the role of a 'Darky Kid', unless he does some serious work in his acting chaps.
