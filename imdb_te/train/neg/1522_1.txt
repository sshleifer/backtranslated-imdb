I see most of the type of person to end the finale of movies, often with the most melodic curiosity. I finally saw Leprechaun before the temptation of tearing my eyes and hitting them. I have made a frantic leap for the stop button and should know that this film is in my VCR less than half an hour before draining back to the rental store just to keep my distance and as long as possible.
