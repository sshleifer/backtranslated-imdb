I've shown history to know about it, and I'll give it 3 to prevent it from happening again. I agree with comments from the UK gentleman. The picture is pretty terrible. All clich√©, no real plot. Historic and technical bugs are extending. DE 529, or Everts Class Destroyer See technical specs on Escort, and you'll see what I think. I now call it a black racism in America, and e is a racist to say this, but this ship's history is not so great. They did some escort work, they followed the "submarine", which overwhelmed them with a medal. Sorry, but the blacks in WWII have done so much, then this silly movie gives them credit. This film makes them look like whiners. I do not call it the starting name, and I can handle it.
