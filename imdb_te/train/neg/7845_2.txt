THHE remake is a remake of a superior film in every way. Most reconstructions were the worst of all, but Alexander Aaja's talented direction became one of the best of reconstructions, and there was also a mutually constant human sub-generation of horrors. In the second episode directed by another man Martin Weisz and Jonathan and Wes 's father and son combo, "I can not make a good horror film to save my life" Craven and It' s Weisz Directing Skills and Young Crowne We are the first to fail THHE 2 and fail at any level of entertaining failure Write for a painful future The strength of skills. <br /> <br /> We are normally born with a graphic mutant baby but it's not only good for the upcoming full garbage but the only reference to the film. Then we see a team of scientists and introduce our team briefly and reject our broadcast. <br /> Mainstream problems are at our main cast stage of the Army Reserve. <br /> <br /> Since most of the sub-part acting (yes for this kind of movie) its run time is true, the THHE 2 of the genuine carnage is not altered by the most monotonous soldiers, but there are no mutants where they are mutant. Think the only opposite of the Marines in Aliens and you have come up with how well you train these soldiers. The real shame of the film is that you do not want to see many of the inhabitants of the Hills want to see it in the first film, in fact it is the beginning of THHE 2 attachment and brief description <br /> <br /> Mutant Mountbillies are not very entertaining at this time, in fact it is very small. Our all batch to our front batch as they were rather designing and uninteresting. The person who takes the cake is also a nutty mug that helps them in the 3rd law (you know from a gowns slot). I look forward to asking him for baby Ruth or to find out about Rocky Road ice cream. Very disappointing and shameful is the only way to describe most of the area here. <br /> <br /> Gore is in the film but does not seem to be the original of the Vishral, ​​in fact it does not really stand out as the first of any other than the mutant baby birth scene. Another big strike for the film. So what's working here, there's nothing to answer. It was originally thought to be a specially designed sequel to make money for success and did not actually make a "good" film. <br /> <br /> I can go about bad drill SGT. The same character as the exact same character as our "hero" in the first film is a speech impediment similar to the mold (the man who'd radioing for help in the real crisis, he or some kind) but has a peaceful fight but I point you. The film is not in the same league or the very same planet. It was given another title and was added to Saturday Night Line on the Sci-Fi channel. A solid shame like a solid sequel will be done but a wow drops the ball at almost every level and another horror movie will appear and I will get one of my lowest scores to give THHE 2 the same score for its score: 2/10 Horror: The words are no worse than the Polar , Uninspired and downright are not described as unnecessary. If your sequel is bad for your next time ... do not panic. Do not support this trash in the theaters, save your money and then thank you!
