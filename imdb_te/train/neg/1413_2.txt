I love Morgan freeman. Paz is an attractive, attractive, and talented actress. I'm sure some good movie has been done in this film. Nothing. It's small (less than 90 minutes). This is 75 minutes long. One hour after the disappointment, I scanned the rest of the 20-odd minutes. <br /> <br /> Freeman has investigated a piece of music that he could play as a checkout climber on a supermarket - an actor - for a while. He visits the supermarket where he works. Nothing happened. She decides to give him a ride home and they go to Arby, a Target, a car wash. Nothing happened. They talk about their lives. Nothing happened. <br /> I can not get it. But I can not even get the "Lost in Translation" and "Broken Flowers" flicks by Bill Murray. If you like those movies, you might like it. Many people find these weird, lovely, or movies - for reasons to escape me - to find the dialogue is smart. A simple instrument in the films of the film is to take a long silence / silence after providing a line that feels like an actor is meaningful. We know this is meaningful because it's nothing on the screen for two minutes. Sorry, I should be Phillipine. I can not get it. For me, these types of films are not funny or lovely or thought-provoking. They're just boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. No play. There is no tension. Funny. No suspense. No action was taken. Nothing to see. In short, I do not have any things to go to the movies. I'm bored free of charge. In real life I see oddball / quirky characters. I'm going to target, and fast food restaurants, and car washways. Even if the stars do this thing, these elements do not make an image. <br /> <br /> If you are crazy about Morgan Freeman, enjoy having fun to hear nothing about him. If you bend over the pause speed, you can see and listen to her. But nothing will happen, I promise. Total Snojefest.
