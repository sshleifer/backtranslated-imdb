After reading some good reviews about this film, I am going away. I do not know why I'm bothered. Mainly this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to the whole big stash of the ancient treasure hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence. Apparently it had to be taken out of British hands at all costs. First, why did the Knights say that the fund has moved to Europe from Europe? How does Charlotte actually portray Nick Kauses as a ship? How do you recognize all the clues and implications in a minute? And how two people suddenly become master robbers and possibly steal what is the best protective bit of paper in the world? There are only some plots holes in this inner bit of Hollywood action. Cage has some great action films - 'Face-Off' and 'The Rock' - so why did he cut himself? Is he too old? His character is pretty annoying - some people steal the Independent's statement, the thieves escapes with guns, and usually looks impenetrable. The whole picture really does not make any sense and all is very disappointed in all.
