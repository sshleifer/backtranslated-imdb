I Am Curious is truly one of two movies - it's her curiosity on half of Lennon's sexual experimental side and the other half political / socialism. Whatever the director's intention, both of them do not really mesh together. The director was stuck with the romantic side of Lena and made a special film in politics. Political / war rallies, Doctor King, serious political interviews, chest breasts and pubic hair. The film is more like a fictional documentary. Besides interesting romantic scenes, you are bored to watch this movie. Unlike many other critics, I think naked / sexy scenes are overdone for what it does. If you want to see real romance, I'm sure you have good choices. Pervasive nudity is the main distraction from the plot here. I thought the cast was a fine job. They were confident in their parts. This is the lowest part I've ever used in American movies at this time.
