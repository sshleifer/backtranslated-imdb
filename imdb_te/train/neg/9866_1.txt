You want to see "The Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. This is not a movie. This movie is not funny. It's time to waste it. <br /> Here are all good comments (poorly disguised) false third parties. People who made this film are trying to synthesize fake advantage. </ P> <br /> The film is not well-known mockumentary. Comparisons of "Spinal Top" or Christopher's guest are disgraced. <br /> <br /> The film is so exciting that I can not imagine anyone finding it funny. <br /> <br /> It is an important feature to laugh at yourself, but if you accept it in this way, you have to hate yourself to find happiness. The great satirical work of the banned items but due to its continuous zeal.
