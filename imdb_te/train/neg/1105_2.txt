Oh my. How can they make such beautiful images, but it's terrible. I mean, even the Uwe boll does not make the worst like this. There is also a good story, multiple layered characters, or a reference to the attraction. It is in the rare order of almost unremarkable to make 'movie'. Suppose I only enjoy the age at age 3, so the whole world is totally sized and the story is incomplete, which makes the old things irritating. <br /> <br /> Again, no one is scary to anyone in the age of six, no one will ever see this movie. <br /> Make my advice and stay far away from this film. Your younger daughter can get a better storyline, and even if she does not make these pictures beautiful, her stories are very valuable. And you, in the name of whoever you believe, **** this piece does not reveal your children. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> ... remember that I warned you.
