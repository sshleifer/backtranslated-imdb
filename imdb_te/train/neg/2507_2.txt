It's not a good movie. It's confusing, all acting is bad, and thousands of times I've seen thousands of times. You can not say, you can see every plot coming from mile. All the worst, no one bothered to say Lonette Mckee not to spoil her. But who cares, she's so nice to be sooooo damn good. But here I am nothing new. Bottom line, hot girl group takes advantage, gets some medicines hooked, someone gets hooked, some gets a hell, and then terrible stuff happens. Surprise and surprise. Welcome to music business. I think this movie is very good. Many of you would like to use a sliding scale when black films arrive. I do not play that! If you want to support these images by going to see them - great! If you enjoyed it - super! Each his own. But do not say it's good. Pleeeease! Because they have black actors, they do not tend to color movies in this kind of movies. Want to see a good African-American film? See Love Jones. Ray. Or purple purple. The color of the actors skin is great movies. Why? For some time after you left the theater, they felt compelling stories with great acting. This is our experience, so it does not automatically make a good movie. It's fine - it's fine. Period.
