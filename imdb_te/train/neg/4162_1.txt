If you really enjoy the 2002 Resident Evil movie, you should see that you should never wait again for 2 hours. I can not believe that no one can comment on the fact that I'm losing the movie RE low. First, a "special" commando power is an exclusive protection for a facility with an AI and a computer matrix with a holographic projection. And these "hive" rip-off are a series of nets that inevitably kill a member of the team at one time. There is also a chess reference in the code names in the RE's dialog. While there is no zombies, "Rook" is a very sort of bio-creature referring to the colored necrotic tissue, with a lot of cyborg parts like "The Rogue", the film's nemesis, a super mutant of RE. <br /> <br /> Mr. Richard Taylor is a Wake-Off-Finger to give any credit to this story. <br /> They are not the same movie, but the author Resident Evil.
