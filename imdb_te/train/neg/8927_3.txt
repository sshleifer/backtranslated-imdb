Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) Receives a sex change from a doctor (John Kardreen - dead drunk) and comes out of Myra (Rockwell Welch). She then decides to destroy the male males (or something like) and Lechsho John Huston (do not ask) and the younger Happy Couple (young, cute, hunky Roger Herren and Farah Fawat - yes Farrah Faucet). <br /> <br /> They removed a wonderful novel by Gore Vidal, naturally, trying to portray it. వారు నిర్ణీత వ్యతిరేక అమెరికన్ వైఖరితో ఆంగ్ల వ్యక్తిని నియమించుకున్నారు మరియు ప్రశ్నించదగ్గ "ప్రతిభ" (వెల్చ్, రీడ్) మరియు అత్యవసర పాత నిపుణుల (హస్టన్, కారడైన్, ఆండీ డివినే, జిమ్ బుకస్, మే వెస్ట్) తో కొంతమంది నటులను నియమించారు, దానిని విసిరి అన్ని కలిసి మరియు .... Bold !!! A complete disaster. /> <br /> The release of the film an X rating <br received (it was reduced to an R), the Welch Rusty (Roger Herren) preparing to /> <br /> This is a real corny image of the scene and the company was very cool <br ... the scenes have jumped up and say things that people do not understand at all. It's better than all but I'm never bored. <br /> The acting becomes wildly terrible ... Reid is terrible ... really sad. Heston again kills the scene again and gets bored again. Welch's actually not as bad as Myra, but she knows what she's lines, so you never make any sense. The West film (a blessing) is rare and almost 80 years old cracking sex jokes is really kind of sick to hear a woman. Roger Henren (occurring ...) Very small, Rusty is not as pretty and bad. /> <br /> This is the most difficult things to say about <br is ... you'll see it in disbelief. Must see a picture - believe !!!!
