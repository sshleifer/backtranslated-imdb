Thanks to the BBC for this presentation. I'm suffering from a low-quality complexity, leaving a home, talking to new people, and I have a sense that people have hated me. But after losing an episode of non blondes, my luck has changed. After episode 2 I started applying for new jobs, starting to wear fashionable clothes and actually I was skilled. When the series was over, I was running a sales division at work, and women's dominance would often win concert competitions to my bottom. If you ever have a credible crisis and then take a trip down to Poundland and pick up the DVD, it's not just 99p.
