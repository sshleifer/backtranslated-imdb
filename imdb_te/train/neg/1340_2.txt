This 96 minutes ruthless and I love the old Munster. Yes, the subject of the plot; Yes lines are simple; But whoever is in power is not that fan. I wonder if it is an old Starsky & Hatch episode 'conspiracy' (and I use that word to great break). I lost the number of numbers I had observed that I lost the spot near that period. Prohibitively refusing to be accepted as of mid-60s (ridiculous), producers replace Marilyn & Eddie with younger players. Why do not they grow up and age? Grandpa is very much in the back of the transylvania and is back in a few hours (prestosterus.) Sid Caesar is very high, yes the most unbelievable character (I am doing bad robots) because he unintentionally meets Gaiershard & Ivitte's unintended combination but argues that he is the oldest Arabic ruler . No laugh tracks, yeah, it looks. In fact, there are many spots in the dead wind, and then laughs are added after the track. Actors seem to have been waiting for Fox audience. It's not ridiculous; It is painful. Oh, and the best part! Yvonne DeCarlo is just a line that goes to show you how to touch the authors and producers. Marilyn says: "Where's Ancle Hermann and his grandfather? They could survive an accident, they could have hit a car or a train!" Lily responds: "Uncle Hermann is here if you want to go out of the train track." This is amazing: Yvonne Decker's husband lost a stuntman and a leg at the beginning of the 60's and almost died in a train stunt. He did not recover and it was financially ruining her family. (Check out the amazing review of her life and career's biography) This line may have easily changed her to be more sensitive <br /> <br /> If you're a true fan of Munster then you get this mess. It explains how to leave some things alone. (Almost) with original actors, it's bad as a remake of the show a few years ago.
