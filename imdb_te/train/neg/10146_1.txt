A frightening but worst of all the boring action film of 'Fury of Fury' - I do not expect much from a Seagull cinema, all of the expectations is amusing some mindless action 90 minutes or so - unfortunately this is the lowest of action scenes, The plot is complicated throughout (and not entirely associated with these films) I find it hard to believe that this horrible mess is $ 12M any more than $ 11m of 12 $ CM's - $ 12 million is being the most outstanding of the 3rd raters sorry to be embarrassing with Seagal and an expression of his whispering is really messy with acting - I doubt something! Straight Guys or Homosexuals A Moment of Interest Inaccurately, two hot chicks end up with homosexual sex scenes, other than that of heavy bombs in other shows - this is no different from many things <br /> <br /> <br /> I end up with Michael Dudikoff B-Movies
