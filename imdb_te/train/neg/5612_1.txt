A spiritual and non-Christian. I really think I'm going to hold on to my faith, but I'll load what I see. I thought the film had great arguments, but got a side views from atheists and Jews ??? This street is being interviewed for all people who do not know their backs from their head. The right philosophers and the priests, and where they got arguments from. Not the retirement nuts written in books and completed their studies in 1970. Personally this DVD is a waste of time and my time is not valuable to check whether the facts are right or wrong, or if I do not object. Please think of his own ego and think that the demons have come up with the end he can not discover God because he got better. It is amazing to help dramatists who read this film feel better about themselves. But if you really want to show the world, take care of the poor who believe in Jesus, try to entice us with your value, not drumming.
