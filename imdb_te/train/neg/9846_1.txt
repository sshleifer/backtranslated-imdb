You may be tempted to rent this image because you have found it in Peter Sellers. That's wrong. This is one of the most nonsensical films ever made. I'm looking forward to joking, but there is nothing funny in this movie. The film industry is also considered a very weak film and did not even try to promote it. <br /> <br /> I am wondering what kind of contract is involved in these contract sellers. I'm even wonder why the people responsible for the film have allowed other bad films to be made. Surely this film is waste of money used to create it, and wasting time of anyone watching it. There are certainly a high school students who write / construct a story.
