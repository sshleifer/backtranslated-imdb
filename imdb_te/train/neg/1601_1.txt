Stereotypical slazer flicks are much less likely to send up. Giant Graham, Michael Lerner, Jane Busby, and in fact the entire cast are totally waste. Sluggish jokes are plenty and each punch line is well worth. The dumb comes at one linear fast pace, and almost every one is flat like fluffy grapes. Music numbers only contribute to the boredom implanted in the whole film. Another disadvantage is the claustrophobic arrangement in the walls of an abandoned high school.
