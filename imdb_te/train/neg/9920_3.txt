I love Clash's music and I loved the music of Jo Strommer and The Meseleros. I went to this film hoping to learn about the man behind that too. But after reading the entry in Wikipedia, I came out of the theater without knowing much about Zoe. The movie is really the guy, never gets through his thoughts and feelings. What did they do to interview the little things they did, collecting vague videos and interviewing some people about Joe Stromer on the Camp Fire. Most of these people found him to be little or unaware, and the director just now asked them in the film, "Oh, he's an inspiration for us all". Bono or Johnny Depp (whom he asked to keep his pirate dresses to benefit from his current achievements in Pirates of the Caribbean). The director may not wait until he dies, before he sells his life to "great punk rocker and hippie heart", he has always purified the person without knowledge of himself. Sure, I'm a fan of the band's pictures and enjoyed watching the band's pictures, but eventually I could easily tell Joe Stromer's portrait. -90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan, do not look at the movie, otherwise it's better to know some of Clash's music or unfamiliar mesaleros, Joe Stormmer melts together all his great effects with his death, a great sound in his musical development.
