The film is held in and around Seattle. Why, why did Porteau Cove show P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L park? Regional parks are in Canada, and not the United States. The inspector completes a peril pilot with stylus, which is 'read' that someone hacked into the wedding shop's computer. I do not know if it is possible using the database storage device. Without any introduction, a woman appears in the film and has never been introduced. We will learn half way in the film that works in the district attorney's office. Then, a guard at the correction center actually forced Jenks through a door and puts his back on the offender! This is never done in true correction setting. The director really messed up on this - this did not happen in real life. Acting is enough. Plot is good. Cinematography is good. However, many errors in the continuation resulted in 10 votes to 10.
