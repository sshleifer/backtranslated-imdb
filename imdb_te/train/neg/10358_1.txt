I read a wrinkle in the whole time 'book and then saw the movie. This book contains all the aspects of the book, but since the book is thought to be really crazy with 190 pages and the film is 2 hours more effective and bad. <br /> <br /> A wrinkled mag, a girl named Charles Wallace and Calvin, is trying to find Mag's father and get the Kamazotz Island. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film is really stinker. The acting is awful, the funniest in the direction, so far no conditions are required. I've written a book and created a film that has never been seen by Madeline, and has made a great book and a horrible film. Acting is worse than any straight-video-acting. Yes, I agree with cool effects. But seriously they were not terrible and serial in any way possible. If you read the book, the film will be crushed. I would like to give it up, but sadly I will give it. 1 half may be useful.
