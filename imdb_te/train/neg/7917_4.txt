"Cement" is a bad image about a bad attitude (bad pencil), which is a bad attitude and a bad trend. When we're waiting for the cement to wait and the film is waiting to find out about it, we have periodically revoked the timeline or reasonlessly, so we can see the events that lead to cement. Overall, a boring junk film, "Cement" is not a story, a blatant execution, and a lot of ubiquitous of film errors; No reason for labor. A killer for the bedtime bed potato at the best time. (D +)
