I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people can sit and watch this trash ?? OK my daddy and mum love it lol but make sure I'm better off the room before I arrive. I'm acting to stand all detective programs like this because its discouraging and daunting but the worst thing about it is that the detectives are so woody and hearty. What happened to detective programs with real mystery? I want to know what happened to fictional characters that I knew about my death 20 years ago ??? I want BBC put more humor on bbc1 cos Now the dibley's vicar is full of room for worst like this.
