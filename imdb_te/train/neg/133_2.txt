The reason for seeing it in the movie is that it's a sneak preview, yet I have never seen this horrible young slasher movie. Are we still not correct before? The scream and scary movie did not take them self serious at least! The plot sucks, and acting is the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film is the only Goddess in the film which is the only seriously compete film I have ever seen in the film. <br /> <br /> There are many plot holes in the story, and the girls are the same, you are also killed now, and who is not. (And you do not care.) I know earlier that Denis, and I was the most talented actress in this unfortunate expression of this movie. <br /> The distance from this film as far as possible. (2/10)
