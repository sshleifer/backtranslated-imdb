Okay, the film festival viewers probably liked it. But your average, popcorn munching movie Gayer, which suffers to ten or fifteen bucks costs to see these pictures, wondering why he or she chooses these days. It's a great thing if it's a "copol" stamp, right? Wrong! It's nicely spoof of filmmakers. But it's terrible "in." Filmmakers are more concerned about themselves being entertaining themselves than people. It's interesting as a cinematic koreo and it has a stuck or two. But if you run its course in movies and TV, the thickness of the film will have thick boxes and tape boxes. Original epochal or epic!
