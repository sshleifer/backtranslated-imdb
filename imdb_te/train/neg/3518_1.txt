I have seen this movie with my rock climbing instructor and we found that it's totally ridiculous to be considered beyond the imagination. (For one, if Stallone himself is out of free climbing, no gear is needed, but I guess that dangling carabiners sorta "mountain climby," so let them throw. For those lobotomized people who think that anything like Colorado dolomites in Italy Well, the Hollywood moguls got the most ridiculous & foul-smelling stuff for you to swallow.
