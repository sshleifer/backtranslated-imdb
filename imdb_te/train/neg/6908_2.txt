The series has probability, but I do not think the budget does not allow it to see that capability. An interesting setup, this is not a "lost" inequality, it comes flat after 1st episode. The whole series, 6 episodes, was able to construct a 90-minute film, but the makers opted to drag it on and on. Many scenes are slow and long to catch up with moving forward action. The music is very annoying and does not work. There are a few characters we have thought about because their roles do not grow during the time frame --- well, a bit increased. The end is terrible in the series. The spectacle here is for art art and set dressers, who created an interesting look, a very bad writer and director did not have a vision to make it interesting
