Villa Rides (1968) is a big disappointment! Although Sam Pecksppa has an arm in the screenplay alongside Robert Tonny, it is still notable as a mainly written movie but directed by Buzz Kulik. First, the part of Bullner's billed as part of the Pancho Villa is wrong! He is not attractive enough to play great Mexican revolutionary! His note on the show was that fire and happiness could not be played by Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland. Bryner appears to be just like a Russian aristocrat, like a Mexican bandit, instead of the Russian revolution in the center of the Mexican Revolution. Also, the Robert Mitchem bill is completely ruined in both! The smallest role played by any part of the smallest star was the Bumpman fly that flows from the air due to the revolution. Mitch does not have a good role throughout the film and his other Mexican revolution brings a picture of the highest "Bandido" (1956), which unfortunately seems to have no interest in releasing on DVD. The style "Villa Journeys" suffers without being a male star besides being without any kind! As a young Mexican girl, Starat is Glasia Buchhelm, Michaem gives a cheerful eye, but her actors just do not work properly. Claudia Cardinal or Jean Peters were probably able to add some of the worst stories to the story to repel. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in the film, but some good scenes <br /> <br /> There is nothing like the paramount's habit - not the trailer itself! Hmm, that is a frustrating image and DVD performance and the amount should be very good.
