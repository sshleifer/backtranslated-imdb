I tried to remove anything that I think is a spoiler. <br /> Plot: The movie breaks down the audience. Head with philosophical ramblings tired again and again in an attempt to get the theme across. <br /> <br /> "Neo, woke up from the last movie, begins now to learn about its own existence. <br /> <br /> There are so many revelations in the film, <br /> <br /> If you are still unclear, the vague instructions will spoil the movie <br /> <br /> The strength and weakness of faith is revealed. strengths Ryu's weaknesses, and its temporary nature, have also been exposed to our belief in human and technological interaction and technology, and the importance of choice and experience is going to be very detailed, explaining more about what is being revealed, so I do not criticize (asks for commentary guides) <br /> <br /> Storyline: So Neo In short, they have confidence, and use and overly stylized actions and bullet-time it's coming out of style (and after this show, I'm a movie-going, and makers are subtlety and originality More to congratulate). More then. I'm saying no more than the promo items: Mayo is trying to recognize the Matrix, looking for answers when trying to save humans, and Jian, while following him and his colleagues. <br /> <br /> Action: Marshall Arts Action and gun generation has grown its ancestors for a while, the film focuses more on martial arts than gunplay, knives, sais, etc. Special effects are often used, which is really tiresome on the face of the audience. I talked about the film, talked with friends and co-workers and found almost all of the action scenes - especially "Smith Fight" we could hear in all the films - long and tedious. This is a huge red flag for action fans, because if you want a little bit more to the end of an action sequence, or be fully satisfied with the complete surprise. <br /> These fighting scenes. Over-stylized, over the top sequences they are engraved and unpredictable. In the first film, there is a realistic feeling in desperation for some actions, not only for combat survival, but also for black and leather (I do not want them to be relayed anyway). Go to Watch Drunken Master or Iron Monkey to remind you of what's good fighting scenes - you will not regret it. In addition, "Matrix abilities" are not stable in people reloaded, and what they do is not stable. The first film is its irregularities, but they are not much better - rather than reloaded. <br /> <br /> Special effects and up and down. <br /> <br /> Slow mode, bullet timed, or over destruction is a small thing for anyone, it just jumps, somersault, spin, and in many cases. It is evident that W Brooss has a ton of money throwing at this film, and the boy did not throw it, with real restraint. The editors were able to really help in this matter, but the first film was such a success. Free rule is clearly given. . <br /> <br /> Character and dialogue: I have already done more or less of the conversation and have done with philosophical conversations. Actuality in the script and direction The actors can not really bring much depth to their role when the face of the audience moves, or completely neglected. The audience does not have any nuance and substance at any given time, so they can think of their own sense of character. <br /> <br /> The key of the key is fine. Keen's acting is good in chaos, and he's all in this movie. <br /> <br /> Mafios tries to do everything from Laurence Morrisface to Henry V and is cool as a cat. With the script he provided, he makes a great effort, but it also comes flat. <br /> The mass is not too believable. <br /> <br /> Hugo once again brought his unnatural feeling again. An agent is an event, but he also suffered the hand of the script. <br /> <br /> I really found him to be Bunch's most interesting character, but instead of improving, let him take a big, drag-out action scene. <br /> All of this is disappointing, if you have good guesses, and on its own, a stand-alone film (not how it's supposed to be taken), it's still horrible. I did not see the matrix deeper, but I saw at least some interesting ideas, good actions, some funny lines and attentive amusing symbols and a blend of blues like Elusius. Reloaded this amount will fail, and I hope W Bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment. Granted, after this film I have many hopes.
