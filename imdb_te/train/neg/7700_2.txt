I saw the movie last night here at home, but I thought this was the first time. Secondly, I thought that the things I had seen in the film were also a comedy genre, like the rest. The movie is not funny in this movie: a fianc√©e who hits his girlfriend. This image is too long - sleep and sleep when you wake up and it's about to be surprised when you're still playing! Some of the things in the reunion are too much to capture - like singing the lady - I almost saw a spiritual song show here! If you get to Perry, you can do it well!
