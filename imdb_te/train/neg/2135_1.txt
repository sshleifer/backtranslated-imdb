Just the worst of the trash. I saw this movie because I saw this movie, but the only reason I can see their existence is their complete characters from Gracey Point Blanc, with full and low quality. In addition, the role of political satire has not been clearly visible as any illness for any purpose. And chimps to the bill which is a satirical irony can also be plain insulting. The simulation is obviously the best form, but when this Grosse Point is nothing near Blanc and in the same league (if you have a morse) the Spartans seem to be faced with a political satire, it fade in the dark.
