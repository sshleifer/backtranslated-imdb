I do not know anything about the Iliad, the story is not accurate. However, a stand alone film I found this very boring. <br /> <br /> This act is poor and is cast to attract Brad Pitt ladies. <br /> <br /> "This film is good for landscape and castle buildings / walls.I like at least a movie that tries to get the realities of characters at least We can hear anything about American, Scottish English but what about what you thought for the film about ancient Eastern civilization. <br /> <br /> Okna, I will not sit in this family and recommend this film, it is too long and young bored. <br /> <br /> For adults, if you do not care about reality then that's OK.
