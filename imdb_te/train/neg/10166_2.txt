If he wanted to be right, he was not a group of NY actors who knew nothing about some Frisco locals and Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I lived in my entire life on SF, and here they did not act or talk to them. Everything was dramatic, and the only cat I saw from Bay was a rapper with his little song as Big Big Fig. He is really the only shock in the movie where he dressed as cats here (ie his Warriors Jersey). I did not notice any Giants or 9 Gears wears once. Instead he placed some cheesy fitted around them in the SF or Oakland jersey. There are no bowling areas for HP, the black and the Asian team wears heads or wrist bands with an Olympic team of Africa or China, or every Chinese gangster wears a Yao Ming jersey and tries to black out during the Hoops shooting. Moreover, it is now a white whites and self-declared "100% West Coast borough", although it is now an important Yupp√© community to invade the mission. It's not New York! Here are the Puerto Ricans, and the mission is very different from ONE shown here, who, without doubt, from Latino's NY. Also, HP is not just a black neighbor in the city. The exact representation of HP shows drama between their own hood and Fillmore, Sunnydale, Leviweview etc. <br /> <br /> This film is a good storyline for Lee and some homework and work.
