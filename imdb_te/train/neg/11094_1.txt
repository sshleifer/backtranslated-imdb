Movie does not bother my list of movies. I was a teenager aged 40 years ago and was late to do that, 95% of sex, 4% remaining, 1% history was very boring. It's what I call a lure call and switch picture, with an interesting title, the original image is a scam. It is a matter of deserving treatment for a good film, which almost insulted those who worked. The original members of Lafayette Escradelli are not in effect from the law or are not the products of the abusive household, and are actually the real idealists who want to help France. And I suspect most people came from a more elite class background than the character of the tab hunter. Flying school is not for smart alecks and it alls know, a man who filmed here would not last for two days, it had either stock or infantry. Discipline in the French Army was often feared. In short, another halviard version of the historic episode that deserves proper treatment.
