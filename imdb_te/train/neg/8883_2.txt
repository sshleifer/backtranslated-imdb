If Cliff Robertson had a racist-worthy job as a husband married to a wealthy wife, if she had one; Director Michael Anderson "can not dial," said Robardson, "when he was trained for his hard work, his little bullhorn would have been inferior to zombie." The rest of the cast is just fine; Jennifer Agutzer of Logan's run reputation does not need to play a key role. If the quality of acting is three times better; If more gap plots filled with some of the holes; And if the shot of adrenaline is given a shot, this Hallmark Hallmark Life Time Channel can bring an acceptable standard for the audience. Meanwhile, its rating is not very low, and you can not help thinking that DOMINIQUE is used to capture the chances of long-term insomnia. Maybe late night TV telemarkers do not have a major chance of not shilling.
