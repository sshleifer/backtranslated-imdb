I loved this presentation when I was a kid. The helicopter I saw was thought to be the coolest thing. It's ultra high-tech for time. It will repel the enemy fire, do all kinds of stunts in the air and take almost nothing in its path. Now I can go back and see today and this show really looks good. Members of vowels are hardly compelling, cheesy moments have a lot, and fight scenes are looking too fake. And at almost every end, Grene fights with the same helicopter with a clear reuse of low-quality stock footage. Most of the footages have come from the Vietnam War Age. <br /> <br /> Airville has mainly a theme like Night Rider, a helicopter instead of a car-fighting vehicle. After seeing some episodes, I'm completely bored. I love the theme music, though.
