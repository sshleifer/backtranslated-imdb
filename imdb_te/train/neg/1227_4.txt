Many people here praised the film, and I warn you. It's no logic. <br /> <br /> I feel that Bashir has done a good job in acting, but you can not do a thriller without realism. <br /> <br /> In this scene you will paint a good picture for the film: she will be followed by murderers who sit on a picture from her pocket. The film is from her daughter and reads "Mommy Love You Mommy". Who is that What loot? Trust me when I say it's not stupid in some other scenes in the film. Someone called this "hidden gem". Well, I did not agree very strongly, this film is hidden for a reason. And it's not a gem. Oh, and please, I want to start commenting on the red toolbox. This will hurt my brain: D logical absence does not hurt me if there is a small amount, but this film is mainly due to lack of logic. <br /> <br /> But I still give it 4 because it is erroneous in logic but there is some mood that looks at me till the end. <br /> If you choose to view it, be warned.
