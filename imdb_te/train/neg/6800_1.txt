I've signed in to comment on how stupid this film is. Unlike Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other type of terrorist protagonist, this is the image that you think will take the same basic ideas as well. When performing such a stupid, clich√©-ridded script for actors, it is harder to work. It is very painful if you are closed in a movie once you are insulting your intellect, but when you're back again, the director is also not the brightest bulb in the cinematic business, or the producers who make the decision to bring this story back. Being a part of this joke-off-a-movie, you have a lot of lesser rented actors to take on the awards, rather than to earn any awards, more money and exposure. Recognition. It may be difficult for them to have a very unjust judgment to take part in such losers. There is no point in summarizing the plot or giving evidence of my case, to do so, being a cruel and unpredictable punishment for anyone involved in this loser. While studying well-made movies, how can you make a good, talented art and beauty of the work, not just what you can learn from seeing this mastery? Alert.
