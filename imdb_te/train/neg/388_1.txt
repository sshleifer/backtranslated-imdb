I can not stand up to reality shows too and this is a worst thing than a Paris Hilton, and definitely his company. But how many seasons have you been "deleted" or "you are appointed"? <br /> <br /> After watching this show I would like to work with his ego and everyone and see the paint powder having a more fun valve. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] He is also trying to buy fame in Wrestling WWE. I do not see his curiosity face anymore so I hope he will be harmed. It does not need fame and does not have any talent and tries to buy it. If I could, I'd like to give this presentation a negative mark, but it gets a 1 and does not deserve it.
