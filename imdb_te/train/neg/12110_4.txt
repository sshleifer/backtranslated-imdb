This semi-concert concert was a great cinematography and album of Berlin in the 1920s. It is the first national in these sectors from the top of the line. The story is polite and Miller's other two films (Sunny, Sally) resemble the plot, where the girl refuses to work with the girl, the complexity and the ultimate moves with the ultimate motion. At the beginning of the film, all four musical numbers are bunched and we do a long stretch of music without any musical movement. I sing the part of Miller and you're frustrated. <br /> <br /> Here Miller is very appealing and delightful, Irene Dunne is very hilarious in humility and delivery. She does not dance as her fortress. The latter and poorly sunny soon became the best film to be the least dramatic runner. Her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before days and days such antibiotics could prevent such tragedies. It is worth visiting these images while looking at the jigfeld's best star at twenty years old.
