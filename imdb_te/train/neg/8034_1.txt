<div> </ div> <div> However, six young men go to the same house and die behind the screen. One of the brains, the latter, the other slut, the black man, the killer, the stereotypes. After a shook eaten a boat, others get stalked by some guy wearing a mask that has turned people at all the poor box. There is a pretty good murder somewhere in between, but it returns more bored, and especially worse scares.Seriously, after each character you expect each person to die, the standard ugly blonde chick and her soon-to-be boyfriend Captured by the killer (they bow, then crush and scream) and the killer reveals himself.  ేను ఈ చిత్రం రచయితలు కేవలం ఒక కళ్లకు వంగి మరియు ఒక పెన్ పట్టింది మరియు అక్షరాలు జాబితాలో ఎక్కడా అది చాలు అనుకుంటున్నాను. The motive is just lame and I have not started on the damn secret. The killer then gets a lot of time to explain everything he takes the course of course (and then he gets about ten minutes of extra) which he slips his own hand for some reason) and eventually gets overpowered by a guy with a gun. Hey, no white! One of the most awkward films I've ever seen. I enjoyed by watching a Lindsay Lohan-Movie, and I would standardize it.Many 80 slashers as well as athletic but at least they threw in some T & A. Nothing to that.
