Now I'm a lover of B movie movie but this piece of pieces insulted me at the end. The first of all cinemas is the brother of Lizzy McGair as a child who is looking for his lost 3-legged dog. What is the dumb mistake of men now that I am asking you for a goddess mutated crocodile with a three-legged dog? And there is another point surprisingly, why are they big on the back of the dinosaur film box and actually in the water? If memory is spent in 2.6 minutes, it is a 6-foot-long shingle that breaks the heart. But the film's zealous features are bad because I was laughing and die because I was bad for me and wanted to die. In fact, this issue is created by another military testing site, thus training super-crocodiles for military crocodiles, or anything else from the source of the bad EV.I.L corporation. And let's not let the characters let's have a flip on the main lead and half way the female lead as we are wow we have wow good off the chick (who does not know how to work) # 1! The worst thing is that when the acting is over, the leaders spend about 2 hours, which for a short time can kill about 15 seconds to kill and plan a simple way to kill and kill a wide range of dinosaurs. All in all this film is gay with its Random opera music in the background and it is actually gayest fact of all CGI monsters that actually did it along with bullets and bombs (otherwise it was not made for military DUH!). Lizzy McGrey's brother runs the shock when he runs into the shock and the DinoCrack eats him, eats his head to pop up with the sound of the pop. I believe you'll do well between the eyes to see the dinosaur. I believe the director, some people take a man to kill him and kicking him in a punch to hunt an hour and half of our life until he finally dies. To survive.
