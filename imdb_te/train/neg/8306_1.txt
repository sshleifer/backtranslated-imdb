ET's siege with Dannielynn Smith is despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the persistent attention she will increasingly become obscure, depressed or worse. Think about Princess Diana and how she wanted for privacy. Now the poor little rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to leave alone. Greta Garbo became a saint and said, "I want to be alone." How much is this little girl ET? ET is not good to report I really bet there is lots of people who do not care what color her birthday cake and balloons. By the way, I never heard Anna Nichol ever wins and won any of those court cases on her legacy. Who is paying for the lifestyle of Laurie, Howard, and the little Danlions? Could it be ET?
