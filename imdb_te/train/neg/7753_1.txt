Everything about this film washed hog. Pitiful acting, awful dialogue, ugly local girls. This film sinks into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director should be a weekend bender. Robert C. completely loses and is not based on what is happening. College children are worse. All acting talent, very stupid reasoning, and just down right dumbbells. Special effects for birds. The security squad around the park is within the toy territory: stupid looking guns, vakky talkies are useless; And computer system with a roll of toilet paper. The park is under construction and if nothing works; Why is it difficult to invite potential clients until everything is done. The writers must be the first victims of confusion with the producers and the band. The septic tank shot belongs to another grip to view the entire movie. No gem. Corporations need to see it, so they can commit suicide.
