I'm Lon Chaney's great admirer, but the screenplay of this film did not work for me. This story is unusually jumping around (I have noticed that the film is not in the movie), and the character suddenly becomes irritating and disappears. - "You're a woman!" - Cut back the image for a long, slow beat - yes, the first time we got it) but there are some spoken scenes that do not hesitate for unseen explanations. (Let's listen to Luigi and his elegant girlfriend's argument, please!) Desired (though not technically), it's hard to see. To the author's credit, this issue was considered an issue and some Mary Pickford films (e.g., "daddy-long-legs") did not have a May-December match as a right-and-good inability. Chaney usually gives a good performance, but I think he's been a good director in the past - he exclusively here, IMHO. I enjoyed the clown scenes, and the adventurous attracted a lot of attention. Although surprisingly young, Loretta Young is beautiful. The movie has its moments, but so far, it is my least favorite chan movie.
