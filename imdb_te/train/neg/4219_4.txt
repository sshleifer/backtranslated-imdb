This is an amateur film that has been filmed in the video, not a "electrifying drama" to mislead DVD liner notes. From the undergraduate students I saw a lot of good stuff. Most of the story ends with the Al-Night Taxi ride around Jakarta. The film may have been made using the same video camera, but some of the cameras used were some sections, and later the content bounced. Editing is very strict. The final editing is probably done with two cameras, back and back content instead of the correct editor. Maybe they were editing in the taxi too? English subtitles are not impartial in English, eg: where are you going now? It is generous to say that the quality of production with Blair Witch is equal. If you're still not afraid, this film is a cherished and creative effort, like cool and funky imagery from all over Jakarta.
