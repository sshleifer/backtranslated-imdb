A wife who murdered her husband by murdering a husband (wife who once directed Mary Ellen Troyer, wife of director Robert Gemikis, who directed this episode), collapsed with a perfect murder, and the body was found outside. A Santa Claus escaped the mad nail wearing in the suit (played by a tremendous extreme Larry Drake). She fends for her life when trying to find a way to hide her corpse. To kill a killer for her husband's murder, Santa Killer once loses many opportunities to get a woman's ax to the head, once she decides to use an ax. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Santa Claus is locked up in a room and chases her daughter when she asks her to leave her to save the kid. <br /> <br /> This episode of these tales from CRYPT is an attachment of the old "Santa Kills" theme (inclusion nauseum) with feminine-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she's-cheating-routine routine. It is also a trainer who is trying to find a way to avoid being caught with her dead body while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There is nothing refreshing or new about this theme that goes through very good moves. Not one of the highlights of the show.
