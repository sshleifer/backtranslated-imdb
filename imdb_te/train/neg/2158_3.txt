Robin Hood can now clearly see how to break up. It's the worst ever thing that the first episode was probably broadcast on the BBC. Early sequences were two monkeys struggling, meaningful and clever, Robin Hood does not play the role, and the sword fight is just ridiculous. The worst part of the episode was the cries of some cows produced at the beginning of Robin Hood episode - how many people wore eyelids in the 12th century? None. This series has since been improved periodically, but this first episode quickly decreases people's hopes and is definitely the pile of cr * p. <br /> <br /> A great leader of England is insulting. Not sure what the BBC is to understand what a brilliant investment is. 3/10
