Beverly Harrad was born at the wrong time. Before she was herself an actress, she had previously acted in Carmen films, in Gunslingls, Sheriff's wife's town. He gets out, so she takes up her job to kill her killers. She's better than what she's been doing so far. This film is gray, stilted, and mostly boring. There is some (random) humor with tire tracks everywhere, people running behind another building (I've heard about the wrong frontiers, but it's ridiculous!), And the newly-founded true stupid plot line sheriff falls in love with the person who ordered her to kill her. Although she does not love her husband, it has only one or two times since his death! And she, however, will eventually end up shooting the death guy. <br /> <br /> The villain of this song is another lady, saloon owner. She goes through the railroad and she plans to buy a bunch of land to be her richest. She's planning her work and she's very lame-she'll steal a lot from her skedaddle town. Hell, it's just her and her hired gun in the whole town. Do you tell me that these people are not a weapon? Bank robbers see what happened in the real towns of Old West when the bank robbed, then cut the hull of bullets with armed and dangerous urban folklore. <br /> There is a lot of understanding and turn around, some sluggish shoot. Ultimately, it is common in a Corman film, yet we do not have moral harassment at the end of the grateful world. Sheriff converts her badge to Sam Bass and goes into the sunset, although the film never saw the sun.
