For almost all the events I had to deal with teen-aged, high school angst and family controversy. I am excited about their relationships with high school girls. I have spent my time in hell dealing with such problems and I do not care about the fictional youths who make me through the horror "light" reforms that I've suffered. I have science fiction. The only reason I'm here. The show has a few seconds of science fiction. We've seen a proto-silen. It's fine but it's a problem. Its red eye-chunk is locked on an object. We all know that Silen Loupe will always scan back and forth, giving the machine the world map. <br /> <br /> I really hope the authors of this abuse will be handled before the second episode.
