I really wanted this film a lot more than I'd like. Especially strange ones that can catch you completely by surprise - because I love the absurd foreign comedy. However, although this often surprises me, these are not nearly as pleasant surprise. It reminds me of South Park's violation of almost all social codes, and it is very ill to be funny until only the brochure remains. For example, adultery, drug abuse (pace, heroin, glue sniffing speed), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc. This film is fun (?) Pedophilia. Her mother encouraged her son (from 12 years of age) to sleep with her neighbors. In fact, at one point in the film, she paid the dentist to the dentist for dental work! Funny? You have to be funny. The film goes a long way and comes into the "black hole of comedy". Next, what do they do with cancer or males?
