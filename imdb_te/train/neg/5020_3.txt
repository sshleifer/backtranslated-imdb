It was very confusing on the IMDb, and I still made mistakes. The earlier critics acted like this. This is not a movie. Instead it is an additional feature on DVD of "The One" DVD, which is somewhere near 90 minutes. In fact, this is better than jet Li combat paths in more than 13 minutes. And the image is his reflections. So yes this IMDb entry is quite a bit fubar. They do not listen to any of the other reviews like all the mistakes. <br /> <br /> "I can never eat you, reader, BS I guess I'm one" reviewer is important.
