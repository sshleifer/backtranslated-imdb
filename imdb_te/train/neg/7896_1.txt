<br /> <br /> When looking at the "bang" of a night on TV, I'm frustrated by the involuntary, random storyline on the screen. The fact that the meaning of the filmmaker's meaningless, fictional-director / writer can go through a name can just undermine this feeling. <br /> <br /> Those who are interested in indie flicks are better written and look for brave I say.
