Who blame, the timid writers or the clueless director do not know. It was seen as one of the movies, and the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denis, Rosanna, and Jon) were paid a lot of money that really did not make enough for the film. It may be quite entertaining, but the coward who hung on every scene is also cowardly. Whatever it was an R rating, why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and Angie Harman? Will Sheen fall asleep in hot and cold relationships with both the most beautiful and romantic actresses in the world? Why do not you let Uupi Goldberg and Judy Tintu know if they are only looking to laugh? It's very imaginable, and I'm surprised that the director is not five years old. No waste, not just for the audience but for the actors.
