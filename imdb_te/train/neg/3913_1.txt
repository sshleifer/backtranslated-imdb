This film is a good example of how to destroy a book in 109 minutes. The movie is too small for the film except for the names of the characters. A book filled with strong Latino characters and they are largely by Latino non-Latino. The character does not develop any character and does not cause us to love or hate the characters. And do not justify the elimination of the entire generation. Isabel Allede wrote a powerful book and read what the book reads!
