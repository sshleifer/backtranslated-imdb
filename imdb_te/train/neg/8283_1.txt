It is difficult for everyone and everything used to make this joke. I personally do not care about one way or the joy of Jessica Simpson and her talent or whatever most people find out about her lovely. This is a film that can not pass even in film school. The script is a mess, acting is outrageous, and indeed Luke Wilson (co-author of "Battle Rocket") has made me wonder what hell he's thinking. He did "Old School" for crying out loud! It does not belong to the same state as my "Old School" DVD! Please do not look at this for any reason! It's a comment that looks great, but it's obviously very kind. We certainly do not keep trying When apparently stop looking at the singers, I hope it will end soon. The worst part is that there are actually some good actors (Penelope On Miller, Rachel Lee Cook, & Luke Wilson) who are part of this dump. Like the plot, it almost exists and is very poorly completed and written (yes I know another rehash) I suspect most people will remember anything about this. Please waste your time, but if you do this, sorry for the original actors participating in wasting the time of the bombing. Jessica Simpson is beautiful, but I wear to sing, but I'm not quite a fan. And whoever made this film, I can not put it on your resume. 1/10 because you can not give zero.
