Everything about this film is terrible. Starting with this film, there are pretty good actors and it is impossible to perform a great deal of great trouble with gangster painting. The sound track is one of the most bad slapstick comedy. It has this music through the whole movie and it started to get irritated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
