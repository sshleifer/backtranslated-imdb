Awful, just awful! My old room mate used to see this waste and I ran crazy. The book is my favorite and one of their shame is something that really never really is what it really is because from their first impressions dribble like this. They are rarely recognizable. However, the book is a soap opera, however, providing enough fodder for modern entertainment. It is one of the lifetime films that "based on the true story" but is totally fictional. There's nothing in the emotion or depth of the book, just the mindless play. If you're a high school student looking for a way to read, try another version.
