The plot is not original. If anyone sees "L'ultimo Bacio", there is nothing new. Everyday life in Rome, the wealthy family is boring and false, when everyone asks what others think about them. To understand what the story is going to be quite simple is boring after half an hour. Since the film's ethical approach to the film is easy to see, the hardest parts are also common. It is enough to summarize in the first 2 minutes of the film, and the goal of the film is already stated. The family has seen from a 30 year old, I do not like to see the movie I want to show reality but his ideas will be more than normal conditions for coherent. The niccone camera camera is moving along the hooked corks and it's not just sleeping in the movie, but from the intrigue to the movie always sleeps. It is good to see what they actually are, and do not blame something from it. Morante is as intense and great as simple but unfortunate over a bad movie!
