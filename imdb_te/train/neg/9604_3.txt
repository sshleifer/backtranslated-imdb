I saw the unnecessary amount of nudity in the film. It does not hit nude or anything, but it does not need much. Anek Borrell believes that her family plays the role of a disturbing woman who believes in soul stories and believes that her ancestor is a cheerful wolf, and believes their fate is the same. In fact I found it very interesting. The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely mental picture, but Universal original Wolf threw a man and you do not have to look for an extra buck or two. I really find this concept of someone being interesting as a werewolf. Unfortunately this is not a movie I'm looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead, we are not wolves from the beginning, so no thrill or twist, as the film tries to make it look as if it really is in the scenario. One or two episodes of the film also fail to represent this originality. I am happy to read the film first. <br /> <br /> Audit Bourl is a good actor who plays a great psychological role, or a good actor who plays as a really bad actor. The character Dannyal does not have any brains and runs around a fist and buttocks and hits it as a wolf, which takes very little skill to play. Her moments break her performance through a creepy moment, but it will quickly destroy with poor camera work and light. The idea was great, but it was undoubtedly implemented throughout the film. 3/10
