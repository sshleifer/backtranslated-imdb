<br /> <br /> It is rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site, but this picture is very small, how little is it created, what its product is. <br /> <br /> As a part of filmmakers I would be showing unfair and unfaithfulness to the Palestinian family. We hear to hear the sadness that they feel from oppression, yet the film is shot and shot in the way that the Jewish Israeli population thinks are politically oppressed populations. There is no evidence of parallel to the Palestinian youth. We are only hearing from other Palestinians in jail. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am from the movie that the mother of the victim thinks that her maternity is selfish and completely closed. The fence to talk, due to his side. She did not like to see the pompous sorrow of her parents, and she was angry and closed-deliberate words that resulted in a dirty final meeting of control. It's quite realistic in my mind to see the origin of Israel's viewpoint problem; <br /> <br /> The neglected requests for the process of land acquisition of the Jewish population are not to be ignored. <br /> <br /> Because of these selfish weaknesses, in a documentary is admirable, but lack of impartiality, it seems all the exploitative. The lack of background in the original background for the poor modification, ultimately lack of proper representation towards the Palestine. In the end, it is poor documentary and poor movie. I agree that this is partially due to political conditions, but I have to admit that I have to look for errors in the direction regardless of heartache and tragedy.
