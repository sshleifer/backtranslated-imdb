I saw the Incredible Melting Man for the second time, it was more boring than the first time. I do not understand why that changed to such a 'cult classic'. The opening sequence is good, the fat nurse reduces blood circulation and runs in her beloved life. This is really done after some woods man stalks around the woods and houses, while an astronaut had a flashback in his life. The decoration looks great, and his melting goose face is very realistic. He has a cool view of a man in a river in the river, which falls into the waterfall and breaks the stones and breaks it. Even though it's not easy on you, most of the scenes are darkened and you can not really see what's going on. Not too gore, at least I saw in the Vipco DVD. <br /> <br /> No, the Incredible Melting Man is not great at all. I give marks for its cheese factor but it's about it. If you want a real sci-fi / horror cult classic, instead of The Deadly Span Watch!
