This movie should not be rented. Despite this (English) title, there is nothing to escape death penalty. I can not think of a good thing to say about the movie. Poor performance, poor editing, poor direction ... The funniest "storyline", and the sound / music is very frustrating, the film does not come with a warning label. The only way to sit and enjoy through this movie is the historical pest quality. They no longer have these bad films anymore.
