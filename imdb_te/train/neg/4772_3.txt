Before looking at this film, I already have a full copy of Saw (who wanted to break his arm out of the shock-like place and black man to get out of the cuffs). <br /> <br /> Initially, I had a bit of interest. Acting is definitely terrible and I am laughing at almost every reaction (especially the "Sullie" character) from the characters. MJH was worse, but I continued to watch it. <br /> <br /> However, they are the biggest joke of their end! <br /> <br /> I thought this rubbish punch was more than just the "worst movie" spoons!
