An interesting picture about the actual incident in Civil War in Vermont. It finally put my attention and I'm not sorry to see it. I was curious to see if the rebels removed it, so I had read this attack incident anytime. <br /> <br /> My big complaint is with federal uniforms. They look very good !!! Acting is sometimes a bit too tight. Like old man who likes mashed potatoes because he has no teeth. A strange soldier with a hound is a little strange. Overall this is an image of a descendant.
