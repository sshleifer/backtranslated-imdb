Only can be described as awful. It's bad to start and get worse. It's impossible to believe when you start because it's hard to believe that it can get worse - but not because of fear. Number of previous movie stars - another poorly written script for a donkey director for talent children. It is difficult to determine whether the script is worse than acting or worse than both. For the hero - well belt up everyone including a scene where he open the wardrobe door and swinging the country daylights out of tough by cutting him with the window. In another scene he throws it through a window and 20ft on the concrete will crash - do not even blink - then gets up immediately and becomes harder into baddies. This is really a funniest movie. Lucky is for me to rent a $ 1.
