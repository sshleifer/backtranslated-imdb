I think it's a lost cause to lose "The Best of Times". I have always heard that the opening campus (overtaking a rival highscore team overcame a touch down pass, failing to win it and again try to play again). I would be surprised if Ron Shelton went to write better sports movies. <br /> <br /> I hope the film will not be shining green when I take Shelton's story as I wrote above. You can think of going out there, or there may be some turns along the way to hope, keep things lively. No such luck. This script follows every predictable clich√© that you can imagine. There is not a moment in this film. You can not see the movie coming before and the end of a mile .... If you do not realize that the end by the end of the first reel then you are Haven <br /> <br /> Robin Williams and Kurt Russell actors ). Williamson's poor pass and poor Russell Quarterback, he was a lucky passer. Gay, do you match Russell once again to see if he and William did not forget the town? It's such a lame duck comedy with a lame duck comedy that surprises how their heads look. There is definitely a few chuckles and, to be honest, is a really funny scene. Williams and Russell had marital problems and wives invited for dinner to settle them. Nobody finds that the guy was invited on Monday night and yes, Monday night is football. Remember that having two teams playing together has a win, try to resist the temptation to learn how men (Williams are especially) are going into the game. The scene melts into some delightful bits when Williams goes to check a score by using a bathroom visit as a reputation. When he comes back he has tossed Russell. Russell then began to make movements in their eyes from one room to another on his wife Williams's wheels. <br /> <br /> This is a very inspirational and stupid movie inspired and funny scene.
