American pie: Beta House is unclear between genres. On the one hand, it's humor without plot and some genuinely brilliant jokes. On the other side, poros is tad-too soft-core. Particularly beta house sex scenes are a collage - some insulting, others just laughing at humor - a couple thrown in an attempt at a narrow plot points cooperative. The characters are only two-dimensional, depending on the knowledge of Naked Miles depends so much and the "important" landscape scenes are so different, why do the authors also feel about a story? <br /> <br /> All fair, without expectations I did not go into this film. I liked the original three American pie films, and the band camp and Naked Mile were considered solid rentals. I thought it would be nice to release in Naked Mile theaters, so when I saw that some of the same characters returned for the Beta House, I am glad to see this instrument. I know there are many scenarios of tension and sexually offensive in many forms. And I was fine with it, because in the past, these scenes were supported by the story and were well integrated into the plot. In the Beta House, the authors forget that the principle of other AP films is working, which is almost the same. They spent so much energy working naked, in fact they forgot to write a story. <br /> <br /> This film is not worth a disadvantage and a dollar rent. The jokes are dull, the story is not absolute, and the romantic-factor if you really care.
