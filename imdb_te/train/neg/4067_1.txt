I'm wrong, or the 2007 version is actually the original rip-off? The DVD I bought because I have seen one of the DDD movies I've ever seen ... bad acting, bad editing etc. ... Here's the only "exploitative" factor we have come up with how to buy this piece of garbage. It's not more than a warm romantic movie ... true gore, no scary pictures, the worst just the full bit of cheap. If you want to see a stunning image with no actors, some thicker gore and a good storyline ... get baby blood ... did not do well in the cheap budget but well made ... and the original story too! Money is waste but I put it for a laugh ... it's curious! The new comment ... September 3 ... I will keep this film forever because it's great ... it's great ... in a bad way ... the worst acting ever ... the real worst-picture Classic!
