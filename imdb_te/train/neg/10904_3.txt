I hired some of these laughs, I was surprised by myself, but I felt very bad. The film has shown very little moments of humor and curiosity jokes shy for me to hire ... At 10-15 years of age, this film will surely leave the viewers out of the boundaries out of this boundary. It is not worth 3 votes to anyone who does not waste 2 hours in their lives.
