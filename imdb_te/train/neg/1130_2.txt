Dramatic drama that is not capable of any real point. So she became an actress - so what? She learned love - big deal. There is a kind of evil which is bad for the movie, causing a particular eccentricity between the characters and the dialogue and situations, but there is often no doubt that it is often absurd. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the summer Phoenix, She certainly learned to hide her emotions, which she describes the face of the autistic stone, but the film suffers for it, as we say at the opening (ie, "Barry Lyndon"). She is not very trustworthy to walk around like a zombie, and her lack of emotions in her success as an actress. Occasionally, the film has a dull, sleek look of the Dogma 95 film. Is this one? I am not surprised at all at all. <br /> <br /> The summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the sister of the Phoenix River at the end. Treating rarely works. <br /> If you would like to contact me via e-mail to see my Hollywood watchlist list, with over 350 images / registrations.
