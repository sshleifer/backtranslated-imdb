First, I think the "1" rating should be reserved for the worst of the worst. This film is derived from me because it is a self-awareness, not as bad as a critic opines, a way to allow some comic or cult value. It just misses its mark in each calculation. ** Possible spoilers have the ** Dialog is absolutely disingenuous. Continuity is very painful. Daniel was just talking about his lost love, and his last word flamenco started with dancers. When her husband (The Baldwin) first said that her friend was bad, what was her name (see? Remember the name of her character, let alone the name of an unforgettable actress). All right steps along the car and motorcycle. Vegetable wagons are flying. Cars crash into each other. Motorcycles on the steps. People are almost hit, but unusually, no one is. Oh, that's right ... stumbling along the pavements with knife injuries, except for a person that has been cut many times, and a approaching car is clearly not noticeable there. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> It is a great thing for me to make films like this. There is a lot of stress in the film industry to make money, I think someone in Hollywood wants to make good pictures. Now there is a novel idea. <br /> My advice: Do not look at this picture. Do not rent a DVD. Do not look at the cable. There are a lot of other things you can do if you leave feeling more satisfied.
