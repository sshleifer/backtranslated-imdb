The hardest thing about this film is to say nothing positive about it. The characters were "white trash", the "storyline" of the film began at the beginning, and the worst feature of the film is that the nakedness is clear from the body and it's fun. Unfortunately, the film is only a funny thing. In the future, Ms. Jenkins worked out that she should not use her life as "fun". It's not just bad. A positive aspect of the film (nothing left without the quality of the film) my brother hit money for this stinker.
