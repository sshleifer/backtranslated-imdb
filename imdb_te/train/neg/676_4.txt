For two reasons I wanted to see. One, the remake of High Sierra with Bogart, is played by Jack Balance as part of Bogart, both of whom play dramatic roles with some sedative, like in Big Knife. Why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same story from Him Sierra; Only here, the actors do not care, the director will lose his thoughts, and know what the producer thought. Jack Falcons is bored looking at Shelley Winters and she asks what Shelley Winters is doing in this movie. I do not like to compare her with Ida Lupino in the same role. And of course, they had to use the dog story again! They came up with some different ideas. <br /> <br /> It may be nice to see the same spot where the high Sierra is shot, but it certainly does not add any quality to the film. <br /> <br /> Before you see the high Sierra. Otherwise, why not see a fake-film Noir. For me, I'll die rather than once again ...
