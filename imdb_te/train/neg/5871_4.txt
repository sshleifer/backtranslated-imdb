The only reason I have a look at this remake is to see how bad and funny it is. I saw the "oyna i am" (1968) because there is no doubt about it being funny and bad. Should we start? <br /> <br /> Robert Darnherm & Brendan Donninson Pierre Bezukhov - a lean companion who does not have the original depth; Natasha Rostova of Robert Darnhelm & Brendan Donninson - a scarecrow, her film may cause insomnia; Robert Darnherm & Andrey Bolkonsky of Brendan DÃ¶sernon - A Sun avatar, Lean fellow (above cf.), the depth of the Russian soul and the "inside fight"; Napoleon of Robert Darnherm & Brendon Donninson - a vigilant leader; Robert Darnherm & Brendon Doninson Prince Bolconsky - an injury with an English face; Robert Darnherm & Brendan Doyinson's Count Bezukhov - spineless freak-show ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are not much better. <br /> <br /> They speak and watch the movements and the path of the actors. They behave like modern EU citizens dressed for a day masquerade. <br /> <br /> It is not near the standards of our Russian men and women in the early 19th century. <br /> <br /> It's fun and fun entertainment <br /> <br /> "Our customers rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I guess, we recall this modern product that was shown on the previous evening on our TV. Most young people have never seen our film ("Woyona I Mir" 1968) or the weird sense of "Tarantino-Spielberg" quality. Recall the scene when our houser protects his friend, revolves around, shoots, and the bridge flourish? <br /> <br /> The best version of the country that has been correctly displayed in our country is not any knowledge or expertise. But I'm glad to see a Russian remake of "Gone With The Wind". Hey, the directors, wake up and stay busy with it, rather than disperse our classics. <br /> <br /> Now go back to the common sense. Jokes aside. <br /> The foreign actors attempt to pass the Russians (when participating in the most intense myths and plays). This is a mistake and the filmmakers make this mistake. Again and again. In fact, it has many laughing results - especially Clemence Posey is inconvenient to be ridiculous and her dancing and singing makes it possible for a Russian viewer to think: "It's a lot of fun!"). <br /> <br /> New, I would like to say about the pace of the film. In my mind, this new version is a lot worse. The story and scenes are not naturally flowing - they are sophisticated and pop-up in the modern video. <br /> I'll have to remember my "Voila Eye Mir" again, where the action is very intuitive and the narrative is easy, you just sit back and enjoy "going on the stream." <br /> <br /> The Battle of Borodino is great (to somehow repeat several shortcomings) but it does not match the war scenes shot in 1968. <br /> <br /> You have to be good in this movie. And there is. Actors seem to be trying hard to make it all work. They did not have a chance from the start but they still joined in the "losing team". Plus 1 point for neglect. It makes a Russian viewer uncomfortable - some scenes are ridiculously ridiculous, but they are dramatically strong and the actors are doing their best. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's all up to you, sometimes - laugh enough. <br /> <br /> The last part I still wanted about this serial. This shows very clearly how to get her or her "salary and taxes". Moreover, I thought that the film would have an adult sex scene to judge by movie trailers, which would definitely kill the entire project. But, fortunately, there is no such trash. <br /> <br /> "Weoni I mean" is not "Harry Potter", but now we do not have enough expertise to correctly present in Russia. Am I saying that the moral value of our life is deteriorating? Fortunately, in our Soviet period the correct picture was presented. The American version of the 1950s has been somewhat upheld - the mass is not yet present. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 4 (1 point is given from the beginning, 1 point is neglected, and 2 points of the serial last part.
