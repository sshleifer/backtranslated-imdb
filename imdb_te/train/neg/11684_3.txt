This film does not make sense, there's a huge plot enough to drive huge NYPD vehicles. The characters do not work any doubt. I put my comments on the chat board, but save your time and money, it's stupid. I can not stand on the fancy amendment and cool music when I have spent millions of dollars in Hollywood flash bang equipment and does not have the most fundamental plot plots. But Dunzle W. comes in three types of people, Jodie Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Captain Van Trap. A good young boy is also a good video game.
