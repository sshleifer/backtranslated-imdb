I finally checked this experimental Lynch shortcode after a long wait ... and unfortunately, it's not worth it! <br /> <br /> Nothing is happening, nothing is happening, nothing is happening, long term, monotonous speeches. And what happened before and after what the hell is all about, complete with the viewer, or caring, all about the whole thing. <br /> <br /> There is a Mulholland Drive Alocution - a blonde girl and a brunette with a lot of Diane and Rita-Sek, and the Last Highway moment is related to some important events, but can not be talked about clearly. <br /> Unfortunately, this is very interesting and very dull, nothing is happening, it's very unforgettable and I will remove it from my computer and I think I'll ever be looking at it anymore. Sorry David!
