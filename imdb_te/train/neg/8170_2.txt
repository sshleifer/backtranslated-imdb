A friend and I took a few years (alot) years ago to select the crappest horror movies in the video store for an evening entertainment. <br /> <br /> Cheap synth soundtrack is a classic in its time and style. There are also some very entertaining scenes. One of them was attacked by a man, a scene that could save himself with many things, laughing at me (not much fun in revision but you go there). <br /> <br /> Apart from the whole rubbish, mind you. If you like movies like "chapping mall", perhaps the watch value. Yes, I also saw it.
