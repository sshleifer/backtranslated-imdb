I've found out that any horror film is unrealistic with Orson Welles. Necromancy is perfect but it's a little too weird for own good. The film that deals with satanists / witches in a small town and the youth's effort to escape them is really a creepy experience. The director intentionally attempts to dazzle the audience and dreams of using the past. At the end of the time, there are very unanswered questions. Worse, the story is so confusing, it is very hard to root for any of the characters. Wells is willing to lead the film because he does not need much to do in the film. Probably someday, the tape of the outside and the sleeper is laid out. Now it's really fun!
