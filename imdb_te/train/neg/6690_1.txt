I sat down to see this movie with my friends who have very low expectations. My expectations are not enough. I can not tell you what kind of thing honestly is from watching this movie, and if it's comedy, humor is totally missing. There is no plot and acting horror. My friends and I have seen this movie for about 30 to 40 minutes, stop it and request a video store immediately to take it back. You should not always recommend this movie because you are trying to see the worst pictures of all time. I honestly stayed over for more than a day in the theater, and I can not understand why it is not meant to be seen by anyone, it's not just a very interesting title, it's also the absence of any major actors / actresses in the cast. This review is not a joke and I honestly think this could probably be the worst movie ever. It's definitely the worst picture I've ever had to sit in.
