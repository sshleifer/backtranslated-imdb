I look forward to Catherine Bigelow's film with great imagination after the Anantha Hype and 6 Oscar Awards. Unfortunately it is not really good movie. The description of the situation was certainly accurate and reliable on all topics, but the story came incomplete and the film's direction seemed uncertain and haphazard. The actors came in a good way, but I did not really find what the movie was trying to do. It's not the atmosphere and gripping as a full metal jacket, like the epic as the band Brothers, action pack ... well, anything else. I can not see why it was nominated, or why people would 'cut it' to these epic ratios. You do not have to worry about giving filmmakers in years past.
