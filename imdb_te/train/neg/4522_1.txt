Did not the most vulgar film of all time "Indians" go to white in white with brown color? While my favorite episodes have to be blush as the girls are pasted and bikers pull them off with gang rape them. Rape is fun! Who knows? The "hustler" (the role of the fat character actually plays a role in the planning of the destruction of the Indians with the main uprising), the horror acting, the nose-they-the-best-just-say-you-what-do-you musical cues, there really is no Indian in this film. And who do we want to root out for? I love this film by Quentin Tarantino. Even though his films are the winner of strong women, I have heard from at least one source that he is an innocent man idiot in real life. Why do you see me, do you ask Do not ask.
