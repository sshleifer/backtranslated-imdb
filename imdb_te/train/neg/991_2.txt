If you want to see how good women can fight against sexual harassment, this film is not a movie you want to see. This is a social commentary about the victim and the woman who is struggling again. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns his thugs into tables. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim uses vigilism. Her summary will abolish the legal system. The film "accused" is a very good movie because the victim uses judiciary and achievements. What does the "ghost" say to victims of the violence they have to resort to violence? The victim is the victim? Siblings !!!
