A great image of this waste of time is completely unnecessary remake. No new or original additions will be added to the back of Perry's back, which have marginal interest. It does not have a documentary feel of the first film and has made it essential to the raw requirement. The sharp quince Jones soundtrack is also a lot added to the original film not sharp. I can not understand any higher ratings for this. This is very bad. Why do not anyone wasting time or money making these things worse and why do not I waste time watching?
