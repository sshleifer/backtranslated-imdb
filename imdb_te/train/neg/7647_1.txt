Madison County's bridges are the best version of the story. I thought this movie was not as sensitive as it did in the original English film. The movie is very memorable, if you're a very sensitive person in the movie, you are laughing at the picture, on the other hand if you are a battlefield in life and you're crying, it's not so late. But overall it is a good thing. The old man is good as a wife and mother. Everyone played well.
