"Intensive Care" by Dorna von Rouveroy is one of the most deadly horror movies made easy. This very cheap Dutch slasher image offers some gore and absurd situations. The horrific veteran George Kennedy is totally waste like Professor Bruckner. The alert, the action is slow and the climax is ridiculous.The famous surgeon is a car accident. He has been in coma for seven years and he is waking up and bloody devastation. "Intensive Care" is clearly the American slasher films "Hello" and "Friday the 13th" series. Murders are fun and dialogues are painful stupid.If you are in the right mood, you can see this rubbish piece. One - you believe me!
