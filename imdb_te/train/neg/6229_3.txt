First of all, let's say here a few things: a) I'm an anime fan - always relevant (I see speed razor in all presents at preschools). B) They prefer very B-movies because they're happy. c) I love Godzilla movies - too. <br /> When the movie comes first, it sounds like your normal B-movie, it comes down to the shrunken FX, but all of a sudden - Boom! Anime comes! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Of course, it's very cheap, out of a bunch of children I'm one of the few scenes from remembering "clear" when it's canceled ... and it's the same again! FX is terrible; Dinosaurs are worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition is unorganized for animating the living, the dialogue & the voices (especially the English dub I saw) terrible & DVD / VHS player that I tested to my father; The only thing I have survived is jokes, comments like robots, like Mozilla / Mike in MST3K (you pick up the season). <br /> <br /> Heck, I'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku Paul of mine for a B-, honestly, movie night. It's stupid, very painful to watch, and at the same time unexpectedly happy, I am giving this movie 3/10, and I'm starting to give an improvement from 0.5 / 10. <br /> (According to my grading scale: 3/10 is pretty boring & bad meaning.) If you find a way of fun, it is fun to count as many as 15 counting fun)
