Pretty much killer insect script is a beautiful work worth preparing for the following television movie. Ants secretly turn into a killer ants near a hotel. The hotel drains directly from the kitchen kitchen to sewage ant because I feel from hotel food. It is not scary because there is no suspicion in this film. <br /> <br /> The spoiler section Heroes stupidity is incredible. The health inspector said he was not an anthropologist. It should be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says, the hero takes his bulldozer and destroys a huge ants colony. It executes millions of ants and people in the hotel. <br /> <br /> End spellers overall this movie is very slick. I do not understand why it's released DVD when none of the most desirable movies ever existed. My only estimate for the DVD release is in the picture of Suzanne Summers. This is an image to avoid.
