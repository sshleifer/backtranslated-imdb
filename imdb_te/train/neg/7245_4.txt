I did not lose interest on The Polybar, it was not very bad, but it was very slow at most times. The movie is gone, it's a little more interesting, but not brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a huge Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but I do not mind her sometimes and she's right here. Polifera is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like Leeds you can enjoy it.
