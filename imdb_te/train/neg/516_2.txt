<br /> <br /> When are the sounds like Burt Reynolds' smiling breathless brakes in his next films? <br /> <br /> Do you like hanging with Hull Neidham? <br /> <br /> "Stroker Ace", WAY is very high. <br /> <br /> Do you believe that this book is based on it? I can not, but it is not. And perhaps a best seller, I'll bet. <br /> <br /> Burt is another good-age-boy in his NASCAR circuit, who beat Beatty as a fried chicken magnet designed by his team. Anderson has an interest in love and Nabs will make his umpteenth gomer pyle the faithful mechanic / best friend lags. <br /> <br /> Many people here are friends of Burt's or Hall. Others need to work on it. And real NASCAR drivers also get in the law, and see that SAG cards have more talent than that. <br /> <br /> When most laughs, Bubba Smith (formerly "Police Academy") gets them as Beatty's driver. And Pietersen, in full Elvira mode, real gets lots of levers that favors as a woman who wants to know the lugs well. <br /> <br /> Burt threw out much time and effort in the film like Stroke Ace, but it does not matter if he does not work or ignore it. They do not bother to write a character for him, why bother to work? <br /> The two stars. Mostly for Pietersen, and ultimately for the out-take. Now they are fun.
