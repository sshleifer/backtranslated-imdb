No, it's not a horror film ... it's really a love story. <br /> <br /> The ring is a silent film run by two boxers and a woman from 1927. She loves the boxer called "One Round" Jack. She loves him until the champion gets along, ie. Even though she married a round, she ran up to the climatic final boxing competition between a round and winner. <br /> <br /> 'But the limits of time should not make him a lasting image. Despite the exclusive film tricks, although some comedy relief, the film did not continue in any of its work. With pornographic illicit wife, it is very dangerous for a time frame. It may have been drawn back in 1927. When looking at all of these old films, it's surprising how I really think it could be redone on today's screen. <br /> <br /> You must watch this movie unless you see all the hitchcock movies. You can sleep in the middle.
