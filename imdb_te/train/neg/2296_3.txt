"Beyond of Beyond" at Dive Diner / Gas Station, in the middle of an Australian desert, run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a cowardly man who suddenly gets into trouble when some visitors are unexpectedly. First, he's confusing he and his sister (who later understood their relationship with each other) seem to be confusing by speeding through the desert on his motorcycle. <br /> Surprisingly quiet, and sometimes, Moody looks forward to his arrival in the role. <br /> <br /> We have one thing and it's Magogar's kind of spiritual sense, his vision of danger, and the like - the story of his hero's story is the equivalent of the story, three of which are broken up by three diamond thieves and their help from the spot Tom rely on to make. However, Tom comes to the thief as a young man named Charlie, and suddenly, three unfriendly friends run each other. But it's not really a lot of secret or action. In fact, the whole picture wants to increase something at all times, but really fails to do so. <br /> <br /> It's almost ridiculous to end up with a tremendous campfire story (and really a lot of storytelling errors). Keep in mind that terribly slow pacing, but in the mood, at least, for something that is slightly different than usual.
