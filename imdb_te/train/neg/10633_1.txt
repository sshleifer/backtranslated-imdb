I saw this video in a friend's house. I'm glad I did not waste money buying this one. The video cover has a scene from the 1975 film Okram One. The film starts with several clips of rocket blow-ups, most of which are not in flight. Cibral's smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts who make a video stream. Instead of listening to what the staff told him, he edited his own voice over. This video ends with Zaporuder's presentation. His arguments about radiation, shielding, star photography, and others are very ignorant or nasa, astronauts, or just a little bit against the Americans. His science is bad, and this video is also.
