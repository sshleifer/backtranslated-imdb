<br /> This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I disagree with another commentator who said that the Special Effects is okay. I have found them very bad: it's not just realistic and they are duplicate from the realistic story. <br /> I did not fully understand the story. Archaeologists are looking for "set". They do not bother to tell what set they are, or is so special about it. It is unclear why this is looking in California, but the introduction of the film takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you're shooting a movie in the desert, then actually go to the desert. In the beginning - the ancient ceremony - it was filmed inside the studio instead of the desert. <br /> <br /> Action level is not static across the image, there is no height and downside, no climax. It's a pro look for the image, and certainly this particular image.
