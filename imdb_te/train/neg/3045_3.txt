Believe it or not, I have my own DVD copy of this "film" that I bought at Walgreens for a great big amount dollar. <br /> <br /> I am not sure if the dollar or dollar deliberately wasted while spending beautifully. <br /> Pretty amazing set designs and costumes. Apparently most thought and effort went into their making. Most Mexican in styling set patterns. I liked them a lot. And Santa is impressed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> But, somehow, it is very upset. <br /> <br /> It may be English dubbing that can be very dangerous and extreme. One of the reasons I wanted to experience movies in the original language I made and the use of dubbing of English subtitles often gives an unintentional stranger. <br /> <br /> Do you know how to make ghosts in the hell to dance their free time around? Kid voices are the same as the original kid's voices while playing at least children. Ballet in the long run? You did not do anything until I saw this movie. <br /> Is this film really worth watching? Now, it's a tossup. I can not recommend a good conscience to anyone as it is very worried in its own bizarre way. And, unfortunately, it's worth surprising to see it. You decide what you're going to do. I dunno ... For me, it made me feel uncomfortable seeing the demons doing cutesy ballet moves constantly. Now, this is wrong ...
