While I was correctly warned, I really sat down to see this movie. I usually gave a break to every movie and because I thought the same movie was not bad. I need to fix it. Even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stain could save this turkey since sinking like a ton of bricks. In a ludicrous time, I left a spoof's mockery. Sean said during Simon. Other jokes are either poorly maintained or just plain unfunny. And some of them you really see coming in a mile away. This film is just a good parody of the plane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III) or Scary Movie. They are all the most important of a funny clothes, B. good dialogue and all C. unforgettable quotes. Men in white have none of D on the top. There is a gross depiction to call this image bad. You must not be anyone else! Think of it a great deal!
