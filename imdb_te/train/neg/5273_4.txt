*** Spears *** *** Spears *** When I see a preview for this movie it is going to be a little appreciative. But most of the superstitious movies I left disapointed. This gullible family takes this break and ends with driving through this "deserted" town to find this video camera they find all their donig everything and eventually disappear, the family all goes through these mysterious stages and the heck stacking them. There are more spaces than I can calculate, and they do not explain what they are going to do. It ends up getting family car accident and getting posest or brainwashed or something (never explained it). The next thing you know when you know what happened is that they are totally confused.
