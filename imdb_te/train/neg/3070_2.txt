Oh, dear lord .... They have turned the film up provoking a lot of thinking into a sweetest testosterone fest. <br /> <br /> The original 1971 version of the film is pretty clear about our hero Kowals. He is a man trying to drive from Denver to San Francisco to win a race. Why are he willing to risk his life for the price of some uppers? <br /> <br /> We certainly can not play. <br /> We have a few flashbacks given to us that he is an adrenaline drug cartoonist, and probably tried to bring his entire life to the vanishing point. The point that you see in the distance to the left and right shoulders come together, and the road also disappears. He lives free and is not sick for anyone. <br /> When he lives his life when he finds the waste of his search, rather than spending the arrest and life of captivity. <br /> <br /> Kovalalski has a history of the remake (the first name, also.) He is trying to go to a hospital with his wife's problems. She was pregnant. He is a dedicated husband, and enthusiastic father. He comes to the conclusion of his wife's death in the delivery of his wife, but they also leave behind when they suggest that he may have jumped from the car before they go to bulldozers. They were also part of "Super Spirit", Blind DJ (brilliantly filmed by Clevelton Little) Jason PRIESTLY to ??!?!?!?!? Will you be.
