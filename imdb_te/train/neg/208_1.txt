Ramones battered about the horrible movie with bits. Some whimsical planning take over school and your kids are worse than the average 1970's / 80's funny format. This film is terrible. This place is a girl who has a school bent fought against the Ramones and their suppression rulership. Do not forget this movie and see if you like an entertaining B movie like a Wild Zero featuring Guitar Wolf. The terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the horrific acting, terrible writing, Ramones's approval, maybe they needed some money, so they said yes to the film. This is the only logical thing I can think of because the film is blowing.
