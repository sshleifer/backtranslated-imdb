I liked Batman: Dead End. A dark emotional film-noir setting for Batman is perfect. Batman: Dead End is Good. It's not. <br /> Let me start with the first acting. Which is not really good. Clark Bartham may be better as Batman. But do not tell too much. He is good at first glance, and then he is the body-builder who works as an actor he can understand. But the main problem is that Batman is not in daytime, he looks like a freak running in a bat suit. Instead of a terrible spots man trying to make past mistakes. The dead end of this trailer reveals an irritating dorky scout on Bartram's face, which had never left in the dead end of the Dead End, Batman. Barthrot seems to think he is shaking and stubborn about his head, which is not, it is quite the opposite. <br /> <br /> This is not true, the real actors escapes the plague. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why Cororo was making the body as a leads. It makes more sense to give an actor the role to handle, instead of maintaining it as a body builder but he locks much like comic! <br /> <br /> The whole trailer is concentrated around the entire trailer (yes, the trailer does not have a full-length image) Superman then Batman. But everything on the Superman side is corny, cloying and enthusiastic. Michael O'Hern (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He is around, smiles, says his lines. About it. Although I was not surprised because he was just a bodybuilder they received hire and some acting lessons. Once again I told Corolla, actors acted. No bodybuilders. We forgive the fact that the actors may not be more precisely in the comic book. <br /> <br /> This costume is supposed to be you wore Superman. For Batman suit. Well, I'm in the dark. <br /> <br /> In this movie a few shots appear as if you are buying from a Halloween gift shop. <br /> Superman will fly in this picture. But this is not a good thing. These shots are particularly enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> The movie "Motion Picture" appears to have been filmed in their backyard with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> The best shots are Superman holding a car in his hand. Finally the final shot of both Face and Batman. For those who have seen the trailer. You are talking about me. <br /> In the end, I will ask. If you're trying to show your talent as a director, do you make the trailer a small movie? This does not prove that it is the original director's management story. Here's my only suggestion for Kallara, the difference between being able to tell a story and the ability to work in marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead End Do not feel aspiring. I can not recognize this is wrong.
