Priyadarshan - His first idea when a person listens to his name is 'comedy'. This man is known, or rather, famous. After giving him excellent blockbuster comics such as Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hanzul, his train has slowly shuffled with movies such as Chipke Chupke and some others can not be named. <br /> <br /> When Dhol, after hearing his name, removes our minds, it can lead to violence. <br /> <br /> The dol is evil, inadequate toilet jokes, drama, suspense and racism. The good thing about Dhol is that one or two sequences are fun but not intriguing, secondly, except for the Kunal Khemu and the foolish grandmother, acting is good. <br /> <br /> I thought that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were the first to talk about acting (compared to others in the film) then Tushar Kapoor and Tanushree came to the top two Idiots. The fault in Kunal Khe is also loud in his jokes and his performance. Grandma was originally a ghost, and she was not fun for everyone. <br /> <br /> This is one of the plot, before seeing. Four guys behind the need for girls and money, but with some turns. The innocent is the foolish and the evil one, the evil one. And in the end, the good and the better over the good is that the wins are fine. The idea to have a full sound with Dhol is not just witty. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is its length. After an hour, you want to leave the theater after you exit. But as a critic, I am responsible for the film to last for two and a half hours. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> If your movie comes to your home Send her and enjoy her for this movie. 3 in 10.
