<br /> <br /> The "Bat People" is a bad image that is suitable for other films, such as "The Crying Terror" that requires MST3K treatment. <br /> <br /> In this we have a breezy mountain range. We see that the bats are flying, attacking, wave of station wagon, accident in the emergency room and much more! Also, the 1970s classic cheerleader (hey, think of "Mitchell!"), "The Bat People" is the best of the last "Mystery Science Theater 3000" sequels in the series! Moviewise, it's awful. <br /> "The Bat People" - "The Bad People!" This is just like a plague. <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
