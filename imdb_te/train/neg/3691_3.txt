I was not a big fan of Rajnakant in the first place, but Baba was very disappointed. Between a terrible storyline, action and songs are only mediocre. The storyline is very preachy. Instead of an office like NTR, MGR, Rajani is seen as the next big teacher of Tamil Nadu. <br /> <br /> After the release of this film, my wife tells me that Rajini has decided to make films. <br /> <br /> When you try this purchase, Babu (at the age of Sivajingasana) is a great movie that bought this dude ... It looks worse than Baba! <br /> <br /> Brian
