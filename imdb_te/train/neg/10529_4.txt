12/6/2009 - 10 to 4 (Dir-Walter Lang): The role played by Rodgers and Hummerstein from my point of view, is a desperate music from a character development perspective. There are good songs and good comedies of the King of Siam by Yul Brauner - but this film does not really do a good job of displaying the situation and settings. I can only blame some of the screenplay and perhaps acting on why we do not understand the character and their circumstances. I know it might be a little bit more to ask a music that is meant for songs and dance pleasure, but even this part does not stand out too much for me. The basic storyline is an English woman coming to Siam to teach children about high level European topics. We learn later that the king is really the biggest student. Rita Morino (an Arab - Come on !!) and a former lover who suffers some problems, but there is a biased sex between the newest wife of King, who does not really make mesmerizing. Deborah Kerr, the role of the main lady is all - ok but not convincing either. King learns some things because of his existence, and then the film is dark as he does. This is really a small story of some songs and dancing but really a great experience for a viewer.
