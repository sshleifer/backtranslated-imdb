In a word, this film is boring. It's not life and no spark. There is a big problem with two adults. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow have no chemistry. He is boring, and she is annoying. <br /> <br /> Visuals are interesting, but they do not improve scenes. If anything, the visuals separated the audience from what is happening on the screen. These action scenes did not seem to be genuine, so the film could not create any real drama or danger. <br /> <br /> The film is capable of being a good script, good acting and good director. Harrison Ford is the ski captain, Karen Allen Polli and Steven Spielberg. <br /> Forget the critically acclaimed film for the film. Critics are praising the film because they want to succeed, and they need to succeed even though they fail at a very different level.
