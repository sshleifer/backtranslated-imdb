The director's commentary should work in theory. The talented Robbread plays the role of a former television director Peter Delane, who remembers his experiences behind the camera. He also has 'Bonanza', 'Flambards', 'Duchess of Duke Street' and 'The Bounter'. <br /> <br /> In practice, it failed. It's a joke program, and the joke is not particularly funny. The scripts are not totally intelligent, and Bryden fails to convince the old man. In every five seconds, he will be laughing when anyone is entertaining. Besides entertaining by DeLane, you want to shoot him. <br /> <br /> "Mister and Mrs" and "Crossroads" are mocking the show, it's not good, it's not good. For joke work, they should be scary as 'Charlie's Angels', 'OTT', 'Tell Attacks', 'Neighbors', and 'New Faces'. <br /> <br /> This show is a big time, so thankfully we have escaped the horror of future editions. 'Directors commentary' Would it be a habit if you have a spoof?
