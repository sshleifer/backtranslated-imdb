Okay, I tried it and I tried it, but I still can not get this guy Maddin thing. Tales from the Gymi hospital about the Austrian villagers and a movie about the ice nymph has never bothered me and is not in the story line ... And the nudie film about this miscarriage and hockey is just boring. I'm silent, Madin has been acclaimed for silent movies, but I did not like his films because he did not like Quentin Tarantino's pictures: they were empty for better, more imaginative movies - artistic or broken images were new ground - and all the style and ingredients. Although Madden is an unparalleled David Lynch Vanabe, the jump cuts and odd camera angles can not hide anything, he has made a benefit on Tarantino: most of his movies depend on the in-person celebrities because he usually does not write an awkward conversation. Bottom line, clever intelligent film making for madness's schtick movies intelligence.
