<br /> <br /> The plot of "Genoa" is promised, but unfortunately it is empty and without. Vision. The film features scenes that capture the family's daily life, swimming, piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are recurring and tiresome, and the viewers have completely failed to engage emotionally. It's very frustrating because it's not the end of the exciting, moving or emotional. I was disappointed and I would say bored by "Genova", the good thing about the film is the beauty of the sunny weather and Genoa. "Genoa" serves as an extended tourist destination for the city, but it will not be featured as a film.
