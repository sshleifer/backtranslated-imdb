No, I have never seen the "Santa Slasher" series, such as 'Silent Night, Deadly Night,' original 'Black Christmas' or this Christmas, Evil. I heard about their fame, or, about MADS (Mother Against Deranged Santas.), I thought I would rent this movie, and I heard it be a reference to 'Fat Guys in Movies' as a reference. /> <br /> Mothers must be against this, but ooooohhhh "killer" for Santa, but in reality this picture is just plain rubbish. Boring, long lasting? <br /> <br /> The little boy Santa comes to the chimney in 1947, handing out gifts, eating some goodies, and surprisingly, floats the chimney. The boy goes to bed, but comes back to the room to witness Mummy and Santa (sort of). Apparently this kid was in the chaos of his life, even though the scene was steamy about when Ralphie's father got "Leg Lamp" in the "A Christmas Story". He was very confusing, he went to the attic and cut his hands. <br /> Fast forward to the future! Now, it's in chaos in the 1980s and boy toy factory. We keep him a little distant, and he will have two children and parents together. Who is naughty, who is good, blah blah. Will it take about two-thirds of a better one of the film to finally get a snap? If the frame is not an advance from a. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> I agree, the film has its tension structure, but I am hoping to do something for anyone. He eventually, well, "who is naughty," graphic like a "garbage pile kid" card that punishes it. And I did not say the end of WTF. I'm thinking of a metaphor, but in fact, it's as strange as the rest of the movie. Take brother who is upset by his sibling killing, and his solution is? UH, killing.) Do not open this mess even Christmas Eve, or Evil. Again, I did not see other "Santa-slazars", but this was bad. It produced the suspense due to the nature of the film and never delivered a good presentation at all.
