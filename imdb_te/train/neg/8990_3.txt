Steven Vasquez, and James Townsend, Starr, co-wrote a lot of good ideas and intentions with this weird little drama scene: a different storyline than a different, judging its merit as a thriller. So why not work? For starters, the film is deprived of the opening frame and leads to a dead body in a suspense thriller, rather than a goal throughout the film, but satisfies the viewers who want to see the nude crowd. It's not a bad thing: some of Hollywood's achievements can definitely be improved. And the murder - the young men and women, ties, disturbed parenting, tries to talk about all the wild antics along with such events as the club scene experiences. <br /> <br /> Devon (James Townsend) is a successful boyfriend with a kind girlfriend Jenna (Sarah Kelly) through all the shows, but he meets boys and Brian (Alex Wilson) who has the same way down and offer Devon help in each level A bar visits. Devon's stepfather psychologist Dr. Kirk Tyler (Don Swart) was not seen by him and Devon's consolation mother Donna (Sonja Fisher) had acted on the streets due to his new relationship. This seems to be in the dark business with Dr. Tyler Hunky Detective Cunningham (Earl McDougale), who investigates the missing boys ... Devon gathers his resources from his understanding friend Jenna and her allies and the group opens the dark work of the group. Tyler and his detective sidekick. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors are happy with the eye (and the eye is often less likely to be observed)!) But the level of acting is low. The only thing that will apologize for us (and in some cases it's not too little to forgive) is the commitment of everyone else involved. Yes, this is a low-budget movie and yes, the director needs time to find out his business. But in the end there is something for people involved in trying to take a gay image to a different level. Their next one will be further improved. Grady Harp
