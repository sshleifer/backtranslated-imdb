I enjoyed this movie because I enjoyed the book very much. However, if I read this book, I do not think I'll understand the cinematography of the film. The film was a great effort to demonstrate the disappointment of trying to break the bonds of government rule, but this book was more painful. Corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while ordinary people are struggling for the necessity of survival. Perhaps most people think of their leaders and rulers, regardless of whether they were suppressed or suppressed. Orwell's Dystopia appears to exist in many places in our modern world. It has been a long time since I read this book, but Big Brother, Thought Police and NewsPack have frequent references to media and casual conversations. Most people who are using these terms do not know where the terms come from. I strongly recommend you read the book.
