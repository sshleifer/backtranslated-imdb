There's absolutely nothing about this apology for an image! Rachel Griffiths needs money. The film is made in a very low budget because the lighting does not exist too much. I've always seen Pete's postmodernist. I will commit suicide. I'd be happy if I was 1) a plot or a script. My biggest remorse is wasting my time looking at this rubbish.
