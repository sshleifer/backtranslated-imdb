Although I consider myself a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original film introducing the series is a weak start. Despite the fact that there are many factors that are later matured and more compelling elements in the series, the speed of the gadgets is slow, the makeup is inadequate and the plot is confusing. Worse, classification in the premiere episode is poor. Although the ratings chart shows that most fans are willing to overlook these problems, I remember that the Gathering has turned me off off what has almost increased a magnificent series.
