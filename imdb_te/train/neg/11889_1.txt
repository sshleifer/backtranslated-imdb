Very funny looking at the "Beretta Island" as the kind of intuitive garbage. It is like the answer of Jess Franko's b-movie type. Strikes the faceboards (face face!) To the boards. Very stupid strike! : Incredibly bad direction shooting (shooting) scenes appear to be better than hand-to-hand combat battles. Funniest scenes are ridiculous. The scenes are very faint. t Miss: at the end of Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke and a cousin of Franco Columbus. Special attraction: forgot naked bosom.Almoust - Franco can sing!
