In particular, Parsispur is not an opera that appeals to everyone, it is my favorite Naperts Bush, 1951, especially. Siberberg's overall approach is quite stable. When the music suddenly swells ... Cyberberg's cast moves at the same speed. Amortas and Clikier are endless. What happened to the film editing? The result is melt physically to see. The viewer is not transmitted spiritually. Siberberg had to make a mistake by recording your rush home and recording to confirm that Wagner was right. And decorating the decoration with "ingenious" reminders of Wagner anti-Semitism - would there be any viewer of the film without Wagner's prior knowledge?
