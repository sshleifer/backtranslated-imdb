First I saw this movie with TV and dubbing English - it could completely destroy the atmosphere. However, I'll assess what I've seen and hope to keep people away from that version. I found this movie to be mildly dull. The atmosphere of all film has lost dubbing leaving an incognito picture slowly disappointing. Sorry, but the worst picture in my book is about the philosophy of sin is flawless. I do not see any deep philosophical meaning in this film. Perhaps I missed something, but it should say as I have seen it. I rated it as "1". What can i say, U.S. Based flavor, perhaps.
