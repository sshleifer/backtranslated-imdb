Did the filmmakers preview this before they even released it? The script goes from place to place without much explanation. The start is not clear if it does not restore or start. It starts with the launch of Superman on Earth, then the final film then goes to the point - but this really does not warn the viewer. Very confusing! Superman needs himself weak and prozac. He is portrayed as a potential housing-scene character, an incognito, and apparently depressed and confused person. This kind of character rarely makes for an interesting hero. The end is totally ridiculous. Superman ends up in a hospital, and I make him kill me. I'm looking forward to the SNL skitter found in Superman Maure Powvich and Maurey says, "Superman in the case of a child, you are the father." Compilation - This works perfectly by Superman and Kevin Spacey, but the horrible script. The film is basically unwatchable.
