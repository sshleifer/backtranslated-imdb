The tragic scenery produced by these TV stylists, running the clock on their careers, about the ship's tiny rustic hulk - may be more appropriate to the boat. The entire production feels cheap and torn, and does not help a "big name" star that is capable of spitting some of the lines he has given in "a loyal style." <br /> <br /> At any time the cast will rise above the material; They are clearly seeing the clock here. <br /> <br /> It is particularly badly scripted or filmed; There are no real clashes, it is just anoden, and a very limited number of narrow sets with a very small cast. Pacing is a little strange; <br /> <br /> Maiden does not score two scores scored on Voyage scores, but also a "Kiwi bit parts"; Most of the cast is the Qndlands Standard Street Street or Xena: Warrior Princess. The fun thing about this product is that this film is probably their biggest break.
