Well, I could NT into the plot, but it just might be me. Relentless camera-movements at times, but the film has a beautiful vintage quality. Acting is sometimes fun and occasionally entertaining with the chase sequence, which is very small. Climax is confusing and confusing, but still ... Stella stevens off, Forks. <br /> <br /> These stunts are especially interesting in the 70s Las Vegas Backdrop. At the end there were some jerky hand-held camera-moves, which for a while continued to guess. But I'm still going to the DVD, I still can not think.
