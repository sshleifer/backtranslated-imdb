Misscasting takes place. Susanna Yorke is a bright young Jane Eyre, and her acting is not a sin. However, Edward Rochester is supposed to be 35. White-haired George C Scott looks and behaves like a rhythmic 80th. Jane's uncle is in good shape! He creaks and snarls, bad and terrible. He looks like a beard-murderer sent to sharpen his ax; We do not surprise him that he puts a wife caged in the attic! The great love story looks like a sado-masochistic nightmare. The novel was dark enough, but BrontÃ«'s Rochester was relatively young, athletic, powerful, and beautiful when he chose him. He has a good speech and singing voice, good mind and conscience, he tries to fail.
