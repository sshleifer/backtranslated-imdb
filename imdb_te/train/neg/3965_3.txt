I agree that most comments here are fake. If this film is not necessarily bad, it will be less. "Dark Remains" is basically a Ghost movie that will make you haunt your own ghosts and bad emotions. The film already starts with 2 stories loose wrapped webbd, which is not connected later. A couple loses its child found found slashed in its bed. They imagined what they were going to flee out of their country ... haunted at home, kind. From here, Dark Remains starts with very horrible moves (the first ghost shows are cool and flashlight sequence is very good). OK, then ... the woman looks at the devil of the daughter, has seen other ghosts of people who died in accidents or suicides, man attempts to solve the mysterious houses of the man, the woman looks depressed, strange neighbors. Its pretty much all, but the premise of being in their own emotions is nice, so you wait for the twist. There is no twist, you are confused by a haunted house history story, strange neighbors, thoroughly nonsense creepy jail and dead daughter thrown up with a photo of "Shutter" reminding me a lot. When you start this slow and piano music, you are finally ridiculous when it comes to slowly passing and piano music, as it seems like a zombie flick, to be able to add some horns of ghosts at once. <br /> <br /> It may be a nice scary ghost story with Dark Remains that do not go anywhere where the script goes everywhere. Contrary to the concept and the basic environment of the film. And next ... Please do not use repeat jails again. It is wearing it and in this case it also makes no sense. "Hey, this creepy jail is up, let's open fire". I threw so many ingredients in the Dark Remains in this way.
