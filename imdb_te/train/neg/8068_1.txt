I did not have big expectations for this image when renting $ 1 at the video store, but the box was at least "more gore! More sex!" With a "assassin cut" offered little assurance. There can not be! Well ... Needless to say, cheat the box. <br /> <br /> All this is a drinking college girl going out of the fray house or other building and talking to her as a cameras in a bad career (?) for her friend. Then she must follow some guy in a clear plastic cover and hold another. <br /> <br /> From there, they can see when someone "cut" herself with the haircut that looks like a polite look. <br /> <br /> From there, the two boys suddenly killed at around 84 minutes. Add in a tiered shot. <br /> <br /> When I was not offered a rent at the box office, I encountered this problem. If I rent a bad image that seems to have more violence and sex .... I want more violence and sex! A full frontal shot of 85 minutes from a chicken that is clear and daring and a child is not intimidating does not cut it. If this killer is cut, what is the theatrical cut ?! However, it is suspected that the worst was in the first place in theaters. Actors are disrespectful in this film. Since I could not do anything at first, they were able to see their screen initially, but they were all set before it was released. I do not know whether they were shot before construction or that the studio was shot until the semi-big names in the movie. But I want to know ... They really spent $ 14 million in this film!
