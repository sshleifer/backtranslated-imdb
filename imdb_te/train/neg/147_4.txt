Another horror film for "Valentine" stalk and slash film list ("Halloween", "Friday 13", "Scream" and "I What You're Dead Last Summer"). It's certainly not as good as those movies I've listed about, but the first "Friday 13" film is better than a lot of ripoffs that come out after the movie. One of those films made 1981 Canadian "My Bloody Valentine", and I hated it. "Valentine" is a better picture than one, but it does not say much. The plot: In the beginning of the film, he was tied to a young boy in a co-worker with a mate. When all those colleagues grow up, the film moves in later years, then they choose each other. The killer is considered to be a young man, and now everyone is waiting for vengeance. But is it? Or can someone else? An attractive cast of "Valentine's" Denis Richards, David Bournez, Marley Shelton, Jessica Coppas, and Catherine Heigl. What they do with the thing they get, but the poor script really does not do them justice. But there are some horrible moments. <br /> <br /> ** (from four)
