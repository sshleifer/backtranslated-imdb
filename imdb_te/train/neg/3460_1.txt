Oh man, this film will always bite! If you are afraid of seeing the rehash of the slasher style, it is cut as well as cut and cut at the same time (ie what is friendly, no nudity, a classic element of slasher films). Each clue prevents a self-awareness and without reference to acting. Oh, acting word horror redefinition. I know very well that the title of the title of the title comes from me.
