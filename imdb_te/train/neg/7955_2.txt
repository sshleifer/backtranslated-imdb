Kary Fisher reported in more than one occasion, even though she had a huge cocaine problem during her lifetime, and she was not very grateful. She explains why she made the film, but it did not explain why anyone in the cast or crew described it; I can not believe everyone has a coke problem. It is one of the worst films ever made and it says something. Absentee "director" Tim Kinked or "writer" Buddy Gioniajozo should not wear at the feet, it is clear that the film was neither written nor directed. It is naturally attributable to reasonability, persistence, design, plot, intuition, intelligence or anything else. There are some real professionals who are involved in this globe who is really amazing. Co-star Robert Joy has done good work in other films, and composer Jimmy Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marx are industry veterans, Marx is also a director, and not a bad one. Why not take part in the steam of the hose is not to be understood. Tim Kincaid, alleged "director", has made less sci-fi science fiction and horror films, and, seeing a lot of them, I tell you what's good for one of them. However, the worst thing he has ever done is that it is a great achievement on him. Everything, absolutely everything, 12th rate about this film - at best. Cinematography is terrible, acting is ridiculous, "Special Effects" produces "Plan 9 From Outer Space", which looks like "Spider-Man", the story is common, derivative and stupid. Watching in the video box cover also wastes your time and let it rent. Full, totally, bizarre, total money.
