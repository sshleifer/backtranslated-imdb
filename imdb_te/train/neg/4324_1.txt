Goofy Graveshed T.V. Game Show "Pig in the Pig" wins the prize and the other combined with Europe is combined with a flip catastrophe. All the fraudulent, unfair money-beating sequels are these very beats. Harold Ramis' 1983 film below average was unfortunate, with the "holiday" on the nightmare throughout the Misfit family states. <br /> <br /> The Hughes script (with Rob Clan), Amy Hacherling ("Who Who's Talking") turns into a dangerous "comedy". Anthony Michael Hall and Emoenco Koko also understand why the likes like Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Engel are suffering from such a dead beat project. <br /> Furthermore, it is unimaginable to think that it was successful enough to guarantee a second sequel to "Europe Vacation"! This is definitely not possible. <br /> Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
