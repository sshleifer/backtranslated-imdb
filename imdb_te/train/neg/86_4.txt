Like a Southern Baptist, I should give an average rating below of the Christian film. I have never been to discourage movie producers from films that are in the diagnosis. However, honestly, "Loves Abiding Joy" is a low budget, low-key, self-motivated Christian film. Plot speculative, acting mediocre (I'm kind of), and outrageous editing. A TV movie might be a little over average, but as a feature film it leaves off as much. Keep the boys trying. You have come to earn a movie about real Christians inside you. Will I turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Louis for some inspiration?
