We have seen some eternal myths in our time, but this is the top of all of them! The film is very long and slow, just to keep things in perspective, I think it was too old when I left the film hall, than what I entered. Nearly 4 hours long, it can be made into the tele-serial. <br /> <br /> The comic comedy slowly starts to lose its pace. Nikhil Advani has fabricated the story around 6 love stories and he can not do justice to one of them ... There is no connection between starting with them, and the links shown in the last 20 minutes seem to be just a story. <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p> msgid "</ p> <p> <p> <p> Govinda and my face-twin-than-gim is better <br /> <br /> The good part of the film is the good acting / comedy acting by John and Education's Love Story & Social & Isha, Akshay Akshay Khanna. But they are so good in their roles that these two couples justify the image without jumbling with the other group of characters. <br /> <br /> My expectation - the director has combined all records with two different films (more may be!) and some veteran assistants, sorting them out and making no choice to show the director as a single film ... /> See if you want to test your patience!
