I have a problem with this program. <br /> <br /> If a simple list is now enough, I will go further depth later: surface letters, a laugh-track and boring humor. <br /> If you want to see the rest of this episode please review and read that you have a high degree of irked teen from Canada (I do not see anything in this program) I will summarize: Friends Sucks, New, Good Shows (Arrested Development, Dexter etc.) TV audience for Reality TV, "Two and a Half Men" and "The King of Queens" are great friends for televised executives. <br /> <br /> This article does not have any soul, they are similar in every way (outside of gender and hair color). They behave similarly in boring situations and are completely safe in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and its humor? Why not Rachel Monica attack when Monica met with Rachel's enemy? No one is serious about him because Joi does not think of suicide? Oh right, he's one of the dumb and he's comfortable with that. This is a curse of absolute characters: permanent conflict and (forbids God) personality becomes impossible. <br /> The laughter-track is dead after it was born. Anyone is absolutely funny opposite. How can I make such a broader generalization? A performance called "comedy" stimulates someone inspired by the audience, meaning the audience is not laughing without it. Loudspeakers can ruin comedy by preventing them quickly back. <br /> <br /> This leads to my next place: humor is boring. Our daily humor does not have the way to do anything precise to a little bit ridiculous (without obviously a grin-track) just because our defects come from identity. So what Monica is a 17 year old sow? She immediately recognizes that what she's doing is not correct and breaks down with him. It should be more controversial than an immediate solution. Perhaps her mother finds out or one of her friends attempts to get rid of him and misuse him. It's great, it's like a custody battle! So now I have witnessed my place. Because they did not hear your enthusiasm or arrested development kerb because most of my friends love this show, they recently started watching Kerb to develop your enthusiasm or arrest because most of my friends hate this presentation. <br /> <br /> "Friends" in my life looked very young, but in my opinion, I saw enough to identify the huge disadvantages of the show that was not fully visible. If you have read so far, thank you, and I hope to see at least some of the shows I mentioned.
