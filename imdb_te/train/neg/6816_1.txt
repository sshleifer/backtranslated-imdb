About IMO everything just seemed like a guy wrote a quick story, grabbed a camera, and started shooting. <br /> <br /> "I'm very hard in this movie, it's a great actor, and it's good in the movie, it's not the other people, how I'm fun and friends I was less expensive, relatives as cast, but it did not persuade acting. It looked like a way to shoot, trying to make a lot more scenes more interesting <br /> <br /> In a technology, it has digital artifacts on all locations.The good cars are in the first scene, they are slow When they scan, they seemed to jerk just a little bit back and forth.The problem was my viewing equipment, (the Beng PE-8700 84 "diagonal) but somewhere There is no sound then I've never seen that kind of masterpiece in a professionally made film before.
