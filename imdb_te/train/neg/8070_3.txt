It's not a very good movie, but it's not a stinker. <br /> <br /> If you remove the confusing unconscious-dream-state junk (95% of the image), First of all, this image is quite simple << br /> <br /> Ignore the junk, what really happened is: A group of school friends go for a night out. They leave the car in danger, but Cassie and Sean die. It is a simple cut down version. <br /> After the accident, Cassie got involved in a hospital in the center of life and death until the film was over. This dream begins. <br /> <br /> This film is called self confidence? Cassie's mind and spirit were interacted with confusions in mind (Sean, School and all around her), with the other spirits (Allie, Matt, Raven, The Weirdos and Jude) interacting with them. <br /> <br /> "Long ride, shown lots of drawings (it's my GF and I can not tie it yet) but it all boils <br /> <br /> In the end, Cassie grew up in a hospital shortly after "dead", her family and scene, which is a reality again. <br /> <br /> Then the director was strangled Attempting to add a little extra spice. But this part is really a nightmare, and she wakes up beside her scene, apparently still deals with her painful experience. <br /> <br /> Because of space constraints, we do not cover every little thing <br /> <br /> If you want us <br /> <br /> We give e-mail
