When I hear such praise about this game, I decided to see it when I am across the cable. I can not see how women and their "struggles" are "born" by focusing on this issue. If you are interested in stories about women's private parts, I guess how it affects their lives, then it's for you. Otherwise, it is rather dull and boring. <br /> I saw this girl and thought it was terrible. So, it's not just a person to "get it out".
