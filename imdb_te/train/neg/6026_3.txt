* Review may have spoilers <br /> <br /> Predictable, campy, bad special effects. It is a TV-movie concept. Unity is an interesting turning point in the Bible that Satan is captured by the end of the world. The mantle is interesting, but its pollution comes short of waaaay. If you want to change people to Christianity, which is a picture of this film, at least it is a quality! When I saw this piece, I looked at my watch tightly. I can not say about this film many years ago because it was a year ago and I did not really have a lot to say about this film ..... skip it!
