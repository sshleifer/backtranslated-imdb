"Wiped" is one of the most horrific films of all time. It may mean that the average part of me is the poorest part of the worst that has forced me to stay in theater over 2000, no other movie "Grinch." People called it, an insight of modern relationships. It is a small film called "High Fidelity". The movie is honest and sympathetic, "wiped" antagonism, dull, distorting cinema poison. If you do not want to see how bad it is to get "comedy", avoid many pests like this.
