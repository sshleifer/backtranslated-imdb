This stupid and unsustainable story only imposes the opening scene where the hard-boiled police detective provides the most audible lines confirming our great concerns: he died. The film was able to forgive the dazzling star power of director A. Martinez, which had a brief moment screen in favor of the sin-anonymous actor. No hack-tar from the road can protect such a dishwasher image A villain is less likely than the villain's murder by throwing stones into a quarry for an unsuspected diver. His moment is brief; His promise is immense. If we have a sequel to this unfortunate film, we will act through this lovely Thomas for a long time.
