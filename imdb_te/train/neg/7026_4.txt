On his birthday a young boy tells his mother, he is not his son and he wants his real mother to go home. <br /> <br /> In some ways, the comedy DML Innocence is for making a different film, perhaps 60 or 70's. It is precisely between Lucy's Secret Celebration (1968) and Richard Luckerin's Full Circle (1977), Parents and Lost Children (Interestingly Two Images by Star Mia Farrow). <br /> All three films are full of unreliable characters acting in strange and undefined ways . All three films have dynamic feelings, emotionally and literally. All three films focus on mother-child relationships, and in the end three films will fade this question - 'what's the truth, what's the imagination?' <br /> <br /> It's beautiful but flawed, it does not give you simple answers, it's very unexplained, strange.
