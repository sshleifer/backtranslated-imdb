Well, anybody who's afraid of the film is introduced with a free coffin hockey offer for anyone, so it's funny and it's funny. So the first "skull scene" was pulled out and it was fun. The original plot of the film is somewhat fine, with the idea of ​​the behavior of the characters has at least a little bit of food, and the story is as good as twist horror flicks. Acting average is not really bad. <br /> <br /> In total, this movie is not much of a flat 1/10 of the movie. It's not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or the second lowest rating. I read the screenplay and tell you that it's a good film. This is a terrible direction and production that destroys the film. So it's a bad movie, but there's a lot worse.
