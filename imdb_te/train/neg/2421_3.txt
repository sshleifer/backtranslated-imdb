The hit blockbuster "cheaper for a dozen" comes with an unpleasant taste, shallow stories, and cheesy reconstructions with this ABC family effort. Many of them have two good actors, the film is a major disappointment. Hollywood-vanhab ditto already had a bad plot. Then, because they need a lot of actors, that means they probably want more immersive. So acting is not five stars. The plot has been moved much faster, and the turns are bad and awkward. The junction of characters and "end times" are also very difficult for me. Rent yourself something better and better.
