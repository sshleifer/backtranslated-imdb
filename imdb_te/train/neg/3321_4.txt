Normally, I know if I hate it or adore it after the first minute of a film ... But now, I'm wrong. <br /> The beginning is great; "Based on this true story" and the blah blah stuff is funny. Later, the description of life with cartoons and pictures made me think I made the right choice. <br /> <br /> Then, Toronto's hilarious counterfeit look is cool. Also, the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first thought. <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of the film ... Then it looked like eternity. <br /> Maybe it's not for me that English Canadian humor (English Canadiens do not always mean the humorous humor), but hey ... a small movie, nothing * does not mean there's enough stuff that's more. Maybe that title can mean? <br /> <br /> However, almost everything is filling, in my opinion very little. <br /> In fact, "Making" is better than cinema. You understand the inspiration behind at least doing bad things. The potential of the idea was great; That's why I rented the movie, "The disappearance of the disappearing people" is interested in the subject. <br /> If you're English canadian, you can count on a surprising number and appreciate local humor. People who gave the film 8. If only you think twice before losing your precious time ...
