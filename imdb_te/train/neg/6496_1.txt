This film is disappointing. I look forward to watching a good movie. I was a kind of person who starts a movie and does not turn it off to the end, but I was forced to not turn it off. <br /> <br /> I thought I was not a big Christian slater fan and wanted to act in it. I'm really speechless after I finish watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the worst films I've seen in my life. Thanks for Christian Slater for keeping some humor in it. <br /> If you are not in this film, I'm frustrated by my mind. <br /> <br /> I agree with Anthony Hopkins' performance. By the end of the film, I did not even get a plot. I was both confused and bored.
