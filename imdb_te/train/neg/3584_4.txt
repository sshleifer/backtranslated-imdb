Interestingly, it emerged as the focal point of Jim Henson Pictures Production by Jean Tripton of Francis Ford Coppola, which was Ren√© Rosso's eyes and mouth - not buddy gorilla. However, countless short lines of Russo's face were approved in the post-production phases, and she literally opened poorly on the screen. Unexpectedly the real true story about Gertrude "Trudy" adopted a wealthy doctor's wife, which deals with Davis's livestock, and he turns their home in the zoo for animals and animals. This film is beyond good intentions ... It is good to be obedient. The movie "Family Picture" did not make any sparkles with magic and was apparently programmed for both people and animals long before (nothing is true here). For about ten minutes, the two chimpanzees revolved around the kitchen of Russia and started knocking the knife's knife (which loses Alan Cumming's head in inches); And yet, there are no eyebrows because it is a day of fun. However, when the full-grown gorilla Buddy gets crazy at the thunderstorm, the cops are called - everyone gets a buddy through the windows of the windows when the furniture is in the room. Anyone with furniture should get worried and disappointing. But, at least we know Russia is in good hands: when director Caroline Thompson needs a good pickup shot, she unstartled Rene gives up another serious close. Wondering what the lipstick budget is in this film? ** from **
