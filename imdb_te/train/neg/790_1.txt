<br /> <br /> 1) BBC1 and BBC2 are targeting different audiences to continue BBC's Heads and Jobs. <br /> 2) Lenny Henry <br /> <br /> 3) Head of BBC3 snaps them completely, ignoring the fact that they are not funny. <br /> <br /> Even worse, the characters play up to bad combinations. If a white person does this kind of thing, there's a lot of excitement! <br /> Trash.
