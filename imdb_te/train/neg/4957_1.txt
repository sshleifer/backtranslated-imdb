I do not believe that some people really like it. Yet they are still known as Batman fans. It went much to say that it is better than BTAS. It's not. It is libertarian to use the name of Batman for this rubbish piece. This is not Batman. <br /> <br /> The whole campus of the show '' If someone does not fight as a big weapon to help you, '' Batman is not about all the weapons. He uses his batgang and waist hook and batmobile, which is. He does not come with some new ingenious tech every time he beat someone. Nell did not know where they got the idea for a Batbot. Or whatever. They have destroyed all villains. Freeze walked out to a small criminal who had fallen short of a depressing sci-fi from a sympathetic scientist. Catwoman is now 40 or 50-year-old woman with dumb dresses. Penguin is now a ninja with a 50 foot tall hat. Ventiloquid is now called a scarface, a fake total for this role. They had a majestic one dumb idea to him! WTF? And the two worst characters changes The Joker and Ridler. They changed Ridler to gothic / retro young men. And the Joker is afraid of Akrobat. He looks like a Bob Marley wannabe. They were totally infected with Morio completely than B & R! I wish to meet the creators and writers and animators of this show so I could whack them head with a metal baseball bat.
