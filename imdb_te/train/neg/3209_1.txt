I also saw the fantastic bad piece of "anime" at the London Science Fiction Festival. If you look at this, do it with a large audience after a little beer and you'll have some fun from it. <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue geeky, the introduction of the creation creator in my mind. The animation is awful. It is badly designed and executed badly. <br /> There is nothing else to say, this film has failed at every level.
