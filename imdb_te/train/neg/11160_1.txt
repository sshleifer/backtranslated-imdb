This kind of "inspirational" saccharin can cause you illness. It will telegraph its feelings like the largest semaphore on earth. It removes the concept from its audience by making its own commentary and choices for it. It is big enough to surrender to the jumper cables in a dead car. I feel as if you were stupid enough to look in line and look relatively in this film. Strip Glows and if she really has the depth of feeling on the display or if that's just --- a display, like a light switch and off. I see how she probably finds herself in such a breathless life because I'm not for my life. It's based on a true story, and I'm sure it's a inspirational one, like setup, execution and performances like a third-level TV movie or half-borey high school drama.
