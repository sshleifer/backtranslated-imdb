This film is so, therefore, terrible, which angels will lose their wings. Shock Fu tried to make other crossover endeavors, such as the work for his NES and other dominant rap albums, and later produced a terrible film production called Steel. There is no good thing about this film. When I was younger I saw a group, but then I became idiot, because these films are enjoyable and tearful about movies. It's simply fun. For a while I saw it on the Disney Channel and a few minutes. <br /> <br /> If you see this on TV, try it: Seeing your movie and removing everything from it Shock uses his magic genetic powers. If you do this, it sounds like a movie about a little kid and a pedophile called him to come. <br /> <br /> The terrible example of the movie. If you do not see it, see this movie.
