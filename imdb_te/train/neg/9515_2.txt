Well, I saw the original French version. <br /> <br /> I've seen this a long time ago. The film does not have nearly redeemed features. That's why I did not understand all the positive reviews. It may be realistic in a sense, but some real stories are not mentioned better. <br /> <br /> I love movies that are slow to the point of the movie. Solaris of Tarkovsky is very slow, but it allows the initiative to be initiated and sets the mood of the film for example. But in this case, the film is filed with a mute dialogue that does not tell us about the characters. I can not recognize or labor. Many of the scenes I found thinking "are they going to wrap up"? Acting is very bad. Not an overacting clear kind of way. But none of the actors were not concerned about their roles and they wanted to be in different scenes elsewhere. This may be due to the uninspired dialog they have not given. The whole flow of the film has a very mechanical concept. Go from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The film is just (badly) written but directed. <br /> <br /> It is one of the few films that I can say that there is no emotional response from any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> I am a very good example of what is called anti-movie, no suspense, no fear, no imagination, no mourning, no introspection, intellectual inspiration.
