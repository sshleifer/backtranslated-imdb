Rob Schneider is a well-known comedian of his movements, faces and performances of "No Humans". This time he is the animal. Marvin is a loser trying to be a hero and one day, no one is calling from an attacker, so Marvin should take this case and save the assailant. But when going to the criminals, he crashed into his car and really damaged him. He knows what is going on and on the next normal day he finds his lifestyle as animal instincts. In fact, our main character is trying to reach our efforts, but his attempts are not worth it. She is played by Collen Haskell. No negative characters. The negative character is the fate if I can use this metaphor. Marvin again knows how to become a normal human being. Through his animal instincts, he can help him in certain situations. Schneider's performance is a way. The film gets stupid at a few moments but one of those movies that is null fun as I wrote above, is so unreal. So monkey style look for Rob Schneider but it is definitely not one of the best actors or Schneider is one of the best movies. He is a great comedian but this is not his best film.
