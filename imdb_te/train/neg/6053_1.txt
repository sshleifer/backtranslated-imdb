Completely trash. I liked Halloween and since then Joni was in a dirty bottom. About these pits. We get John in it. Pro-lifes are scary! <br /> <br /> Please tell me to make a smiley picture that you like. <br /> <br /> There is a pacing here. John seems to have a lot of work here. His credit looks like he did not leave this waste. The camera just sits and there are countless times waiting for the actors to look mute or say something dumb. I love the long cut. A very bad carpenter does not know how to use it. He was 30 years old with herzog and phosphider. Please John, you are a fool and death bore me!
