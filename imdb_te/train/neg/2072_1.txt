The film was rented this night because it was a fun movie. I really match that you are not wrong with the ex-girlfriend's feeling with super powers. <br /> <br /> This film is ... confused and nonsense ... <br /> <br /> Every turn is thrown in the junk. Teenage boy can love only a lot of toilet humor and sexual situations. <br /> <br /> It seems to be easy to pull a story from the fatal attraction superhero. But I guess. <br /> <br /> It was advertised as not a pleasant romance comedy. You can not take a kid to see it and you will be embarrassed by the date. <br /> <br /> If the writer makes a basic story around the concept and can clean it - the film will have a chance to fight. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
