.... This is the comedy acting intellectual level. The feature did not reach the length, "Can I do it .... til I need glasses" (mostly) a collection of dirty jokes. They are too small, you can not believe you are a pitchline (eg: Santa Claus Hogg); You can not believe when others realize that you need quite a long time to set up that punchline (for example: Students' Awards Hog). And almost all are directed without artistry. Do not get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually have to be funny (iron / phone is probably my favorite). There is also some fantastic full frontal nudity that the woman's body, especially in its natural form, proves to be the best thing on this planet (also has some comical nudity). And I agree with others that the deliberately stupid title song is actually pretty impressive impressive! But the reasons are enough to give the film 4 to 4.
