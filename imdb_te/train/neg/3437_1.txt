I saw this movie yesterday. I must admit, it's not my cup of tea. It was supposed to be a horror film of its kind. But when I look at it, I'm thinking .. 'This film did not make any sense.' Where did this man come to the dark coat on earth? Where are the two boys going back when they go back? <br /> <br /> You can not add all the elements in this image. <br /> <br /> I've seen very good horror films in my movies, but one of the most tricky horror flicks I've ever seen. At the end of the film, I said I did not see again .. So much papa show in this movie, I decided to give thumbs down! Count me this one! 10 to 0!
