Once again the film's classic has been remade with serious and unpredictable deadly results. Everything about this film is wrong. Can not persuade the time, and leads criminals to be too small and a lot of criminals as criminals. Arthur Penn's motion picture has a sense of humor, perspective and made by talented people. This is still an unnecessary movie, even though the 1967 version did not exist. The 1967 version was out of fact, giving Bonnie and Clyde's glamor version, but it was fantastic and new in 1967, and some amazing performances that allow you to take care of. This 1992 remake appears to have been taken from the original film unreal and in this version the actors are simple, simple, and not least bit interesting. Let's skip this one by all and expect the 2010 version to be good. Is this perhaps worse?
