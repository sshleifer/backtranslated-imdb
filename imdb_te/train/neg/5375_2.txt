<br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, I feel like I have wasted 2 hours in my life, but I did some good in everything. 1 or 2 tops, but I like grade low budget. In the picture, it can get 3 or 4. It's a movie 'perfect' and should not be too long passages for boring or wasting time. This is not a movie. But I have shown a lot of independent films and movie skills, which are some of the highlights. I direct that directors do what they do with their next project and have some quality of distorted sound effects. They can handle some of the characters, although the character structure is too long, as they are very abusive for the plot in the plot, so they do whatever they leave in their next project. Whatever the long spaces of the commitment to running around does not continue in the next project - what's the point? I guess this movie tries to be a little of everything (building characters, suspense and a plot), and being nothing (not too much) <br /> <br /> This film tries to be very high and very hard, and I have to cut a small picture expected. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of abusive things in this film. The story should be more streamlined. I need to do some mystery in the film, but the little surprise of the killer is not a secret. The story behind the "Mystery" is almost unanimous in the film, leaving the final "point" to be the fastest disappointing mask. <br /> <br /> I want to say that this is a good effort for the film, but I can not do it. <br /> <br /> The directors will learn from their mistakes and hope to produce a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in producing low-budget films, you will have to do something with the movie 10, as others have said. The film did not receive "10" judgment from any remote target goal.
