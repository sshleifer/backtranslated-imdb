The waste of my life, the director should be embarrassed. Why would not they make sense of why they think they want to make undesirable movies. When she died at the end of it, it laughs at me. I had to change the channel several times throughout the film, because I was suffering from such poor performance. Hopefully he who plays hopefully does not work again. On top of that I hope the director will never make another film, and his payment is taken back for this crap. {0/10}
