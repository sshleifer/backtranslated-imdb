This is one of the worst movies I've ever had bored with lots of boring dialog and have some very annoying characters and a laughable looking creature. The only reason I watched this piece of garbage is because I had 8-disc horror set that I got. Plastosters as finale and completely stupid. Which blood is the blood except the bloody marks, and a couple of bloody gun injuries. Acting Terrible !! Richard Cordella is terrible as sheriff and is very ridiculous and his character is annoying. Glenn Roberts is a funny relief and is not funny at all! Mark Sigel is not too annoying and even fun! Bob Hyman is good but not too much. Richard Garrison is a haggard and there is no chemistry with Casey Cobb yet. Kaisy Cobb is here and Richard does not have chemistry. Avoid this rubbish overall! BOMB from 5.
