The film is a terrifying acting - or anticipated actors - a boring direct and a story unattractive, copies exactly one scene from the classic "GeoLio" "Torso" directed by Sergio Martino 1973 (two years before), the most famous of the Italian movie One of the psycho-thrillers and a cult-movie around the world. In the "La sanguniu candudes la donja", the bed scene between director Black Girl and White Girl, with a bedding-Tom from a window of the bedroom. Obviously, the scene in the Rizzy film is soft and sweet and mild in the movie Mardino. Another black girl is another white girl, another white girl, and another white woman is the right way to prove that there is no ideas, reality, taste and nothing to replay the scene. I think such things are a crime for a viewer.
