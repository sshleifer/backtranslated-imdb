<br /> <br /> Film history: The film was directed by Random women around town. When his wife found the film reels, he quickly had to struggle for a story. He said that he is doing a movie called "The Burnless Brain". In the end, his wife asked her to show her "so-called film". That night he quickly painted some additional scenes with a friend and was born "The Brain An Die Die". <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Storytelling: The main character's fianc√©e dies in a horrific car accident (due to obviously ignoring the road signs posted). She will make her head tight from the ruins and rebuild it. After redefining the head, he goes and chooses a group of hookers. This is pretty good for the rest of the movie. At the end, he murdered a monster who was fighting and living in the room. The monster is much less visible without any explanation. However, the monster saves a prostitute and I think they will live happily anytime. <br /> Note: The ultimate credit screen is called "The Deadhead Die". /> <br /> I hate this movie!
