Ivan Reidman is a savior. The most tired plot (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come into his hands. His occasional fraud (Six Days, Seven Nights) is also useful for displaying signs of life and humor. So I was disappointed, and Reidman could not take a very original plot (man dumps superhero, superhero super power fueling revenge) and turned it into enjoyment. "Girlfriend" is an unexpected exercise. A trick pony plot is the longest in the tooth after the first ten minutes. The movie is not a romantic comedy or a superhero drama. The result is that the flip-flaps in the middle of the two pictures are very well. Uma Thurman is common, and Luke Wilson pulls his character off, but his slacker insects quickly grow tired. More scenes are that in some scenes (when Uma turns upside down on the wall when you turn around), you feel that you're throwing a witty, hooped retroman manist practically out. But after seconds, magic was lost, its films were almost as disappointing as the superheroine that was almost disappointed.
