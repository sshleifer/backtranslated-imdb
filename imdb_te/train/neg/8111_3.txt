Costa-Cavross is another great film. This is a great example of a situation where America is involved in Latin American and Latin American politics. Facts can not be absolutely or not, but it is true that the US supports rebellions and Latin American dictatorship. <br /> <br /> The spirit of this film is the campaign of the general left / communist Cold War. Costa-Gabras is a famous communist sympathizer and his films are always biased. For example, the actions of the US acting as cruel and inhumane indicate that Tupacaros' s dramatic activities are positive. <br /> <br /> Uruguay and other countries in Latin America. Europe is filled with the poor East European prostitutes. I have never heard of the poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls ever being mired in many Eastern European countries. Combat a dirty battle in the US and bless us that God has lost all the monster of Soviet communism. It's unfortunate what happened in Latin America (and elsewhere) but sometimes you have to play dirty. Costa-Gavra and Matomoros are not the ideal world to be believed. When Mamumoros came to power in Uruguay, we had another ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> <br /> In this movie, all of which are idealistic and morally correct in the past, following corruption and bankrupt ideology.
