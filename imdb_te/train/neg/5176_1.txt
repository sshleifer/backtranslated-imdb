When an image is independent and not rated as Hamildtons, I look forward to the rule, remove your heartbeat. I do not have good blood and torture, but I read reviews, I visited the site, and I also agreed that some of my friends would pay me $ 9,50 to see this awful movie with me. When a festival called Horror Fest, I look forward to horror, not Dawson's Creek, abusive speeches. My expectations were very low for the film, but after watching an hour before someone first came out of the finger, the picture was filmed with very low expectations. There are plots of holes in the plot and there are a lot of speculation. I do not worry about seeing Happy Feet. I think the film might have more violence and gore than in Hamilton!
