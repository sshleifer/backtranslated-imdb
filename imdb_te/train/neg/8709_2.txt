Arg. Shuffle dinosaur came back to take another bite with our integrity in the third film of this tragedy. At this time, European terrorists (I say Irish) will need to transport high-jack uranium. They open the truck, pulling them into a shipyard and discover our old friends carnosaurs. Rubber Dinos When visiting chiropractors, cops and some fleets, the piomonomium is visited. The whole movie (again) inspired from Eliom (like Carnotor 2) with naval forces going through the "dark" harbor? Guns at ready. This third opus is probably the only bloody and unfortunate image of rubber dino when a marine head falls off. Dinosaurs are tough, like living creatures and T-Rex sounds like the noisy Elephant (which also appears to have no eyes). When Copers reach the scene, one of the gopiest scenes in the movie is: a hijacked truck entering the building and some weird sounds coming from another truck. Open it and surprise! The rubber reptiles gang came out and devoured them. Why are diamonds locked on the second truck after the first flight of the first truck? How are they locked when the truck door is locked from the outside? What is this scene shot ??? Oh trouble, who cares? Two thumbs down for over-sized rubber Iguaz.
