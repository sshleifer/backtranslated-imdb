I gave a 2 rating for this film which showed a complete lack of effort to create a quality horror film. It's a random funny one 10. I do not recognize what's happening in the film or I know that I've been smiling every moment when I laugh at every scene. The dialogue is at least in all of the film, but I believe it's a script without a script. The fact that there is no plot is very diverse. It does not matter if you sit down and watch the movie first, or if you want to see it, you are happy with happiness. I especially like the scene where the prisoners take turns running around outside with hitting one another. I believe that the doctor suggests it as therapy. Genius!
