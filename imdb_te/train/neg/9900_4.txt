I think any novel that laughs like a Moby Dick does not quite favor the audience with the Depression era faced by their own difficulties. But no comparison of classic Hermann Melville's novel is a pure coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, the prequel to half the film's main story, most of which is not for the film. We met Mabel Bennett as the father of the father of Maapill first met Ahab Kreli (his last name and brother) as a joyous lucky soul with two legs and intentions. <br /> <br /> Lloyd Hughes wants to marry the brother Derek Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore Ahab is at the supreme show. Barrymore sound did not get much expertise in the film and he moves with all the silent era dances and a stage theater, which circulates the raft of the movie theater. The great whale is his leg for Moby Dick and I have to say that the dissection scene is pretty gruesome. It's actually the code before. <br /> <br /> After that, the story of Ahab hunted for awkwardness in the eyes of Johann Bennett. This is not exactly Melville's inspiration, and in fact Moby Dick does not have female characters. <br /> <br /> A man in Melville has invested Ahab's ship with Peckold staff. Cannibal cousins ​​are names except cuigug, but not personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs can also be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> This version of Moby Dick is curious and I have never seen anything else.
