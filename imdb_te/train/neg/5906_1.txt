This film is terrible. The plot is absorbing, acting is good, editing is ineffective and the film wants me to suppress my eyes. Looking back at this film, I want time to spend time with me. The balloon scene stupid, Mormon jokes are really old, the soundtrack sucks, I've seen chemistry between two leads, which is full of stereotypes, stupid native "Celeb" Cameo. The most noted Dell "I'm going to drive faster than I can .." computer idiot. What's the worst is that these actors play themselves on the spiritual side and they are screwed up with that. The film will help create a long line of poor efforts for major LDS beliefs in Hollywood. I.E. RM, Church Ball, etc. I see this movie and instead run the first head of the brick wall. You'll get more entertainment than watching this poor need for the show.
