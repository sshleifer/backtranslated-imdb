Empty Czech had a great suspense thriller for kids but instead it is one of the kids movies that's ripoff home with a lonely dull house that is not worth a dime. Quigley is a criminal who has just escaped from prison and earned his hidden million dollars from a big score, and we make Preston meet a disappointing child by his brothers to launch a business and because the father treats his brothers the same day he goes to a kid's birthday and his father From a cheapo When he goes to roller coasters with other children he goes to rides for little kids and then he receives a birthday card and a family of less than 11 bucks of this family? So he goes to the bank to open the account and the beautiful Shia Stanley meets her parents are Mets fans? Quigley gives his banker friend millions and finds that the bills are marked, so Preston sends a roulette called rasam to get things that he does not recognize when he runs his bike by Quigley. While taking his parents to his home and carrying cops and bolts to his home, his parents drowned him on the bike that drove him, and what did he do? Their kid was almost rushing and they were worried about a bike? Preston inspected a million dollars by his computer and thought he had given Preston money to his Juice, but real Zeus had come and learned that they kidnapped the kid! So Preston McKintosh buys a building named Limo Driver who says he is an unhealthy joke and talks about Shia when he goes to a legend shopping sphere and talks about opening his account kid and talking about opening an account? We soon learned that Shea was actually an FBI agent who recognizes Kwigle and his two colleagues, and then he earned a job working for his soft father, his McKintshaw and read the day laborers and spends the day he met with his lemon driver buddy. He left a date with Shia in a fancy restaurant Going 10 years old Is 20 people eating something an FBI agent? He then takes the street geyser and plays with the water beyond 300 dollars of Shia, and she is a bit realistic for Quigley and others still killing her to question the insane. If a small kid and a bunch of beans spit up quickly and Preston sang the Qigle And so on He finds that he really did not pay for the party to sit on his birthday and he really is hosting his birthday which is truly Manitosh's birthday chair and Dad talks he does not know his son in talking to it and talks about Preston should be a real kid and his whole childhood ahead and Preston begins to go home Wants to tire One hour ago you grill about his finances! కాబట్టి ప్రెస్టన్ ప్రతి ఒక్కరూ విడిచి వెళ్లి, క్విగ్లీ మరియు ఇతరులు ప్రెస్టన్ చెల్లించటానికి ఇంట్లో విచ్ఛిన్నం చేస్తున్నప్పుడు ఒంటరిగా ఉండాలని అడుగుతాడు మరియు అందువల్ల అతను ఒక ముగింపులో ఎదుర్కొంటాడు, ఇంతకుముందు క్విగ్లీ ఇంటికి వెళ్లిపోతాడు, ప్రెస్టన్ ఒక ప్రయాణంలో ఉన్నప్పుడు కార్ట్ రసం గజ్జలో హిట్ అవుతుంది మరియు ముగ్గురు ప్రెస్టన్లు ముడిపడివుంటూ ముప్పై సన్నివేశ   లను ఎదుర్కొంటారు, మరియు అన్ని ఆశలు కోల్పోతున్నాయని అనిపించడంతో షియా మరియు ఒక సమూహం SWAT అబ్బాయిలు రోజుని రక్షించడానికి వచ్చి క్విగ్లీ మరియు అతని సిబ్బంది జైలుకు పంపబడతారు ప్రెస్టన్ మరియు షియాలకు ఎలాంటి ఆశ ఉందా?
