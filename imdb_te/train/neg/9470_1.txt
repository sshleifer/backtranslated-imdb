Film critics of the world, I regret it. Your task to give a darker public advice so that they can choose what to spend money wisely. But I neglected your advice and I was seriously hurt. However, my decision to stop "The Cat in the Hot" was not interrupted. The critics you see three years ago did not say "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" should not be avoided. Then some of my friends took to see me, which became a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic ilette treat. So when critics put their anger against "The Cat in the Hot", another big budget was replaced with a big star name star in the title role, I thought it was the same old song. How wrong are I <br /> <br /> Five minutes I thought it was clear. Early credits are brilliant, children are lovely and product values ​​are top notch. Then the cat appeared. There are many issues from this point, but one of the largest is Mike Myers's annoying miscasting. "The Grinch" is protected by inspired casting of Jim Carrey, "The Cat" Myers was destroyed. He is very much fun when his powers belong to themselves and comic sketches. Every film he's made to be really funny is really just a feature length comedy sketch to "Austin Powers" from "The World's World". So he tries to do the same, and these comedy sketches are like sticky items at the end of SNL, not just painful. The authors did not help him. The film's closure after the lovely progression will change the physical humor to the hours and hours, the humble humor at times and the humiliating time and vengeance. This movie is the most worrying film experience I have ever had. Period. Most talent and work went into something very luxurious. I know that this movie is relatively unscathed by adult stars this mess, I hope that wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fenning will get more opportunities to show their charms with very good movies. If you are a parent, please avoid the plague. At present, you have a lot of choices with movies like "Elf" and "Brother Bear".
