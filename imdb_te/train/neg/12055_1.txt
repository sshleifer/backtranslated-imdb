Do not spend your money or your time in this pictorial picture in the cover of cinematography. Every third term is devoted to foul language and does not have a real storyline, as well as the cast of older actors, from the past to the same performances and their careers, which leaves a lot to say. I hoped for something from the award-winning actress Benício del Toro. Others may have Puertorricans distracted by the rubbish like Maldomores. It is used to emphasize the idea of ​​a foul word given in a picture and in that case (see Elsa and Fred as an example) may be funny or sad, but this should not expand the plot. The film is totally embarrassing and there is nothing funny or beautiful about this movie.
