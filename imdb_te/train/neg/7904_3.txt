Some boogers get stuck and reproduce themselves. This film is for horror-elements so far. The kisses play like a really retarded comedy that is so stupid that after 15 minutes all the rest you can no longer find funny. I can imagine little children cheering for these little boogers, but the blatant statement that came from the most famous scene from filmmakers is ET, leaving with only supposedly "smart" references to the only translate stuff on the screen like Captain Kirk's Log entries from adar STAR "Look! have achieved! " Clint Eastwood cut-out to tell us what's wrong about his Western paintings? The last thing is completely lost ... Oh yes, and the chemical waste disposal in the caves is a bad thing. <br /> You do not have to say that it's a very fraudulent film to sit for that matter. It's really dumb, really just really. <br /> <br /> If you smash a smile when you look at it, you feel like a drowning after completing the film. <br /> Good badness? Yes, but "dumb", "retarded" & "ridiculous" are just the standards you are looking for. 3/10 and, well, uhm, 6/10.
