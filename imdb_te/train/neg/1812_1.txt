Immediately go and rent this movie. This is on the bottom shelf of your local video store and covered in dirt. No one has touched it in years. It could also be a $ 50 special! It is worth ten bucks, I swear! Buy it! There are a lot more movies than this can be compared - a celluloid version of goo that forms a rubbish bottom can after a few years. Yes, I gave it '1,' but I mean it deserves so little. 1-10 standards are made in such cases.
