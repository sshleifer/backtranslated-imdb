Since reading all the comments here in the IMDb, this movie sounds pretty cool, but I did not think it was bad. <br /> <br /> "House House Where Evil Delves" is a spouse and a ghost story about his wife Ted and Laura Fletcher and their daughter Amy. Old house in Japan. Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and lover, killing a samurai knife 100 years ago. While strange things were happening, the ghosts of previous residents began to have living dead bodies to rebuild the bloody murder of 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> Picture and decided to give it a chance, from the cover it looked like a good ghost story. It's normal, and it's sad, but in my day I'm worse. The ghost scenes are slightly more complete, the translucent blue-tinted figurines are randomly seen to pop up randomly around the family and capture their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts in the movie reminded me of ghosts in a haunted mansion ride in Disneyland. I made a mistake, but after watching this, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror film "Ju-on: The Grudge" and the American remake of the film was a little ripped. <br /> <br /> "Do not go out of your way to see this, If desired, it will be on TV.
