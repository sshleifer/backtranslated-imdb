I thought this film was good despite its stereotypes, virtually the 'No-Name' cast and the obviously low budget; Better than I expected. I was skeptical at first - thought of a computer virus that even infect people seemed a little ironic to me. But ultimately, the film was well thought out (although some scenes were a little cliche). <br /> <br /> This cast is great, and the two heroes have seen their characters very seriously. However, I could not think Jainy Turner was a bit like a Gina Davis look. <br /> <br /> It is the face, hair and clothes made in her face or in this film but it kept my mind all the time civilized. <br /> It is an entertaining film that you can see 'must see' or a great movie by any standard, until the end of 'Fatal Error'.
