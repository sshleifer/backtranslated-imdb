The film is about my mind in my mind, the entry into the town of John Berlin (Andy Garcia). You will see his Mercedes pass in a forest loaded with redwood trees. It's very beautiful. <br /> <br /> Andy Garcia is playing a character with the last name of Berlin ... Andy This is very friendly / Latin. Maybe a Caucasian father married his Spanish mother for this story? No one knows. But when you put him on the farm forks and hacks town, he strangles, especially when he is angry when he is angry. Yes, I know, is the big deal right? <br /> The title is related to a serial killer by the nickname Jennifer of his victims. All the victims are blind, and he will drive them away. The murderer took a break but suddenly a helper (not to ask) appeared Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman). Thurman is doing a good job of playing a blind man, to my surprise. When I see Lance Heinrichs play Sergeant. Freddy Ross I was scared. Henrixen has acted in some pretty strange films, especially delaying. I still can not forget him in the bloody picture, pumpkin. <br /> <br /> In Berlin movies detective L.A. Come from a small town. Jennifer began investigating the killings after he found body parts in local landfills. His brilliance did not appear to find one of the victims. So * sprayer * Freddy murderous sarcastic recording and name identities. I was very confused by the logic of how the eight "genius" came out. And the purpose of the killer is that it does not pack many parts of the punch just as a disruptive. <br /> In the revision, the movie makes the truth more fun to show people who can kill the film because they have been for some time wacko or possibly born Looney Tanus. <br /> <br /> When John Malkovich questioned Garcia for a wonderful job! Press any police officer and hit anyone without breaking down properly. Until the end, it's a bit of a surprise, but it is highly arguable, much like Sgt. Ross murder. <br /> <br /> The killer chooses to walk to the driver running, instead I would like to predict. <br /> <br /> There are many opportunities for killing him. It's a good surprise, although it's shakiness because I do not destroy it for so long. Even then, as I said, you say, "The boy is lucky!" 4/10
