I get the feeling of making the most painful, ridiculous Western made by the producers of this chaos. <br /> On the plus side you have good color photography and beautiful and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy goes to Jacques Abbachan, who plays well in an annoying role, such an actor can give a happy performance. <br /> <br /> "I'm disappointed: Stewart Granger is his Western man, with his British voice White shirts in a crazy unconscious state surrounded by his nicely clothed clothes, and his son is constantly haranguing and insulting grung, and the way he never spoke back or answered back tiresome.

It does not bother to see it.
