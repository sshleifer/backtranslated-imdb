I do not think it's too bad at a show in the right conditions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a demonstration of attorneys that are not lawyers. God's law based on these programs went to school and nobody refused, and I saw some interviews in the program. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, Spender and Shutner, who are the stars of the show, are very worried. This may be some kind of compliments, which is not exactly here. Their constant abuse of women is the first. But since they're literally doing it all the time, I've realized that it is as deep as this is going to get the show. <br /> <br /> Alan Shore's gruesome and inappropriate "public service statements" he can not see and impress on his views. Denny Crane is just annoying. <br /> I am giving two stars because I thought of the show's efforts to deal with some contemporary issues. <br /> <br /> Demon's authors have learned that Denny and Alan are also discouraged from inviting them from the beginning of sexual abuse. In the subject, I do not care if the treatment of sexual abuse is well done, but I felt that the writer would insult me ​​to implanting all synthetically sexual bunks in the program hoping my Libido will keep me coming back. I'm no longer a youthful young man, but I think the program will guarantee if its aim is to deal with the lowest casualty of ratings. <br /> I realized that this is not better than it really is. This is one of those shows that I love to love because it's an insult.
