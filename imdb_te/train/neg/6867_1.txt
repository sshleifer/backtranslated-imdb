We start with wooden acting but this film is a disaster. After growing up in NY, I tell you that this film is insulting to anybody who knows the community or people. I'm no longer a savior of culture, and it is not right for anybody who sees Seinfeld as a worst Hollywood piece suited to its own fictional, ludicrous culture and language. This time is a huge waste and, worse, the outcome is obviously and is not exactly interesting because the clashing scenes are laughably bad. Who works this way? <br /> <br /> The author's name sounds something of Israeli or nature but it is clear that there is no clue about what he is writing. At his bio, he is shocked to live in New York and is surprised by how real connection he is with the community. Normal films like "A Stranger Among Us" are also good and are much closer to the truth than this itch. He was no wonder he read the credits of this guy, who wrote scripts in all C grade films, which somehow have stars. Shocking. Perhaps he knows who this script is for a bad dolph lundrene.
