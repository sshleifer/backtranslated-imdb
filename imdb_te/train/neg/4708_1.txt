I heard about this bad display the first time when one of my friends was playing a video like "JOHNY TEST". <br /> <br /> One day, watching TV, Cartoon Network, I changed the way to "Johnny Quest" ("One of the Best Cartoons I Have Seen in My Life", and "Quest" with "Test" I heard that this presentation is going to be the theme of this show, I have a chance to see it, and here my answer is "I want my dan huh back" <br /> <br /> "This is one of the worst performances I have ever seen, the first, in the beginning, the world's most stupid song, plot oh, where is my manners? <br /> <span class =" " If you know, I honestly believe that the Decker's La Miss B (which has been changed to the new Deckster, the whole worst). Do not look at it, make more productive in half an hour than this trash.
