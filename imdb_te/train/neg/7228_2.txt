Good: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Good dress. Top notch set product. <br /> <br /> The horror mix of actors with all CGI actors combines the fifth element with final fantasy. CGI actors look worse than video games a few years ago. Wrongful logic. It shows a large pyramid and no one can really question if no one can see it. <br /> <div> </ p> <p> The horror script. Many unnecessary subplots have many ideas that are not completely thoughts. The dialogue is almost ridiculous at some points. Unnecessary random letters and events. Dol characters. Jill is the source of this mystery, but apparently she is confidential in the writer. She has nothing. She is curious and boring to watch. She has no substance, no structure. Her character has no ransom features. In fact, there is no role in the whole film, no goals (along with Horus clear), no motivation. They are weak and bad. The works have no keys. Horus is not immortal, but, big deal, he is a bad guy. Horus or Jill can not even understand the main character. That's the problem: the author of half a portrait of each character means that the author never searches a character entirely, never brings one to the merit. Though they do not walk and talk and do not do much, the cardboard boxes are cut to explore fine collective pieces. First Passing Director Slow, slow, slow. I'm still watching when I write this picture. I can not pay attention because it's boring. Everything is flat. <br /> <br /> All in all, <br /> <br /> Do not be worth a watch. Threadbare story, development of sub par character, corny CGI nice save product is not saved.
