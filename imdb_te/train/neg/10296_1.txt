This is probably not recommended to try to watch this movie on my DVD - non DVD. <br /> I took the volume up to the top of my TV and heard about 80 percent of the dialogue. Some people are still sub-listeners. <br /> <br /> If you're a slim from Scotland, you have a chance. <br /> <br /> People's voices are almost exposed by all the surrounding sounds, including a package, footsteps, and puffing on the cigarette. <br /> <br /> When using the volume to the volume level of the volume, I can assure that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene turns into a loud environment. . <br /> <br /> The audio mixing field is also art, which is art. <br /> <br /> This effort is characterized by an atrocity on the international level during the war. <br /> <br /> Half an hour later, I did not redeem someone else in the movie.
