I'm not sure if filmmakers are following a sa-type film or 12 Angry Men (people who connect facts to get the truth at the truth). <br /> <br /> I can not see movies for blood and gore, but as the film goes on quite a bit, More. Many off-camera, reducing the horrors we experience in the dead. <br /> <br /> The policemen also caught me as one of the victims. He unknowingly helped the innocent young man who was going to jail by accepting evidence of plant evidence (given by MJH) into the evidence room. (And not a prosecutor advocate MJH, having access to that evidence - taking it wrong evidence - anyway, so does she need help from the police?). While others do not recognize this particular person who is harming them, he has also played bigger roles in his final episode. The gun dealer must know that his firearms will be used for evil intent. The insured person refused a person without a need. But the crime of the police appears to be small even if he does not know exactly what he's doing. The filmmakers took it one step further and encouraged him to testify to the MJH, which made him more erroneous. <br /> <br /> For both, why he / she deserves to be there and die. For example, he is worried because the insurance guy rejected his wretch; <br /> <br /> The oriental woman has opened her eyes because she is a false witness, and yes, more violent gun deaths, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is not witty, turns, and the end is one I never saw (if not the worst). <br /> <br /> The actors have given the worst lines and impulses that have their work. <br /> <br /> Overall, waste time.
