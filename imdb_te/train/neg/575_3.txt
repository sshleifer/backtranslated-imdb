This film is great. It's not too boring for the horror movie, and not too bloody. Toads along with the plot just did not quite happen. And I thought the female vampire was so stupid. She has many opportunities to kill her bloodthirsty hunters because she shows lighting like her reflexes. But whenever she is pinned, she will take her time and she will not always bite them. <br /> Final Verdict: The first Vampire film is not good. If you waste your time at this time you are a good cooker.
