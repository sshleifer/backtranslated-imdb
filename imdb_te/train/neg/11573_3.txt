I came here for a review here before, before deciding to settle on the TV movie, and I could not remove what I found. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is necessary to show firsthand that it is the daylight of the housewife. The performances are wooden, each sentence is a 'sharp' attempt to have a housewife's daytime movies and bad soaps, and it is particularly violent and incompassionate for men (especially soldiers). <br /> <br /> The whole movie 'drama' is clear when the characters threaten to develop a second dimension. <br /> <br /> If it is tolerant (or enjoyable) then you should be warned. Linda Hamilton's German accent, which looks good, her face, for some reason, caught the painful look. Other performances have been a source of embarrassment for their murderers, with narrow and clear roles with a daily routine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am surprised, <br /> <br /> If I had never been before, I would say a bad Christmas movie 'The Story of the Sense. It is a brilliant audience. <br /> See it in the following circumstances: 1: There is nothing else. 2: You are an imaginative 'fan of housewife, men and achievements' in TV movies. 3: Hollywood is the only way you can congratulate the true story when turning into a movie. 4: You have filled up enough nagging that your emotions are easily moved through a number of storytelling stories.
