Today, Bee Arthur, who was wounding around the IMDB website and wounding something called "Gloria", died. "All in the Family" is a fantastic performance in its first four or five years and I have seen each episode more than once. However, I promise that the program "Gloria" does not exist. Perhaps, that's a good thing. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "All in the Family" franchise franchise has fallen very short <br /> <br /> I rated Show 1 for two reasons - the system did not allow me to vote and the authors and TV executives Condemned for participation and remembered one of the great programs in TV history. <br /> <br /> Shalom, ZWRite
