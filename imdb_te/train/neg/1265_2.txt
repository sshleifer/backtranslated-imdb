I did not want to see this film first for the trailer offered a seal of a simple and very guessing image ... but I recently had a pleasure to find the "Mensonges et trahisons and plus si affinité" surprise and beautifully directed by Laurent Tirard ("prête-moi ta main" I've written by myself, change my mind and try it, "Prête-moi ta main", "Menchungs ..." and this is not exactly the script But not quite as honest as "Mensangs ...", the actors are generous (especially Charlotte, she is usually frustrating) Edward Berl or Clovis Cornilac, and I'm quite honest, I can not understand what kind of worst it is, with such a casting .. Whatever the story is a reason to create a plot is very interesting, but that's fine The start of tirlard "mensangs ..." as he wrote, simply, surprisingly, and to estimate the amount of work to be lazy!
