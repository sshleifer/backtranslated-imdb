Directly released in the video, the film must have a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and may be subject to the viewer for terminal boredom. This is another nice "goodwill" religious film which is a good guy (believer) suddenly vanishing and the rest of the bad guys (non-believers). It's an interesting concept, since we see it happen on an airplane by a believer's captain who deals with a sin dealing with a sin (no need for sinner to disappear!). Unfortunately, as all pilots are non-believers, the plane may not be crashed or the film is compassionate. Though it is interesting without heavy religious slaughter, the overall plating cinema makes a gag, the acting appalling and apparently the computer-generated simulations are very fake. In Canada, which is also called New York City, I appreciate myself ... I read the Bible.
