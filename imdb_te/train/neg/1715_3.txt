While this is not widely reported, it is not true. Excluding the people, they took advantage of the facts that they did not reach the facts in their lives in 30 years and took many liberties to recreate the events. There are many times in the gang of Bunny, Clyde, WDs, and those things are very much in those matters. Buck and Blanche Clyde went to persuade them to move far ahead of a shootout and were actually pulled back to the crime. Some of the events in the daytime were actually made overnight. Bonnie's lesion was very serious and never cured. It was so bad she should be held around anyone until it was healed, and even stiffened it up so it could walk hard. Clyde also walked with a limp because he had a big toe in the prison. Although there are no real errors in this "real" story, there have been many movements from the program to the event and looked at many of the special snapshots of their lives. <br /> If I want to reach the truth I recommend reading a book or watching a documentary am.
