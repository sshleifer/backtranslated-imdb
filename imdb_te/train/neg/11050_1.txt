Scene cuts are terribly useful. All the continuity is lost through terrible scripting or deafness. The villain robot ... is a jazz dancer necessarily? Also, one of the worst sound tracks I've ever heard (monstrous is usually drowned by music) and ... where'd they get their items? The ship looks like a milk carton ... I made special effects on the 8mm at the age of 13. <br /> <br /> If you are a film student, watch this movie (5 minutes a minute) to learn how to build a movie. <br /> <br /> It is bad for editors. <br /> <br /> It is very bad, because the scenario is actually a good idea ... not working properly around. (Sorry Malcom should have sent you a "stunt double". You're great for an actor for a stink bomb.)
