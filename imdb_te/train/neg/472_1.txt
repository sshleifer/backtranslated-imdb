The only thing I remember about this film was the two things: first, a twelve year old, even I thought it was stunk. Secondly, if Mad Magazine made its parody, they left the first page and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page, saying that they were completely banned. You want to see the great sophomoric comedy of this period, try the animal house. It is stupid and obscene, which also reduces high art. Another good choice, Greenskeeper Karl Spacer's "I'm wrong Sandy, it's right for me, but if I kill all the golfers, I'll lock myself off at Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray Classic Caddyshack at the end before becoming annoyingly fascinating, with great lines, as if to kill the golfers."
