A star. All of this documentary deserves. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed to see a big fan of the series "Walking With ...", including Nigel. Marvin spin-offs, for their joyful and informative information. Although the prehistory of the prehistoric man has never been of interest to other prehistoric organisms, the subject is still interesting and exploratory. "<br /> <br />" What is this doc? <br /> <br /> While the information they can get is interesting, It has a terrible stream that is very rare in trying to say (from database scrambled and sometimes from place), terrible effects (CGI's moments and especially decorative effects ), And high-end MTV-style camera effects. <br /> <br /> The makeup effects of a critique here show how this horrific scene is seen in the cave in the cave and is a 70-year-old man-suicide horror film There are plenty of moments where angry men are fraudulent and ridiculous. <br /> The worst part of all is an interesting Or dynamic way, as shown, or it looks like a real feast rimotli. It seems to get seriously believed. It consists of a series of ancestors did not have any emotional punch. Ornithociras (sp?) Of the fate of the "Walking with Dinosaurs" Remember the episode? That episode will still get me on the edge of tears every time I see. This is engaged in this kind of thing that is not much more than anything. And when you're engaged in this topic, it's a personal story, it's just speculation, and more about the facts around it. <br /> <br /> The only savings of this product are very nicely appreciated (at least in the BBC version I've seen) and music. Otherwise, if you do not want to smile, do not worry if I do not get this rent (I've often done it, but usually the eyes are rolling). <br /> <br /> It does not make sense to know that this document is directly related to people who are not directly or indirectly involved. Others in this series? Hmmm ...
