The film turns into Canadians and Britons Asin, Moronic Idiots. Men drink stones, and they beat / beat each other in each scene. Are women unusable to this story? Did not I understand what I was doing there? They would be hard on each scene, or worse, over-the-counter cattle. Apparently, vulgar tranches or hippie chicks that Canadian women argue. <br /> <br /> We have seen a long-forgotten girlfriend who has seen countless movies, her lover's boyfriend and his bad mother. <br /> Every character here is a carpeting, infant stereotype. Not to mention that they all looked like they needed a shower! What kind of scenery does the sex relationship with George Wend? Shout? Enough to make fun of someone! I saw the movie because Samuel West was in it? But I do not know why he accepted this role. Maybe he needs money. <br /> <br /> Ian Tracey is a fantastic actor - the only person with vague ransom moment, but his talent is ruined here. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the plot? Are three delusions trying to get back their dope ?? Ann - or Carl ?? Who died, but who really played a role in the minds of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece like Rebecca? I'm ashamed to compare these two pictures, why are you bothering me? <br /> <br /> At the end of this wretched film, I thought it would be good to go with him on that boat.
