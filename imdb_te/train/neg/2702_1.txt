Singleton has some serious issues that he got to grips. I get the feeling that he feels pretty smart; However, the film is almost transparent and self-judicial. In addition, our local Nazi jerks are hit by "ours-making-right" messages. I mean, who's going to root for a group of Nazi jerks in their right mind? However, the singleton is clearly known to have portrayed a "fighter" and is designed to show high combat characteristics of black heroes than anything else. The other is raped by one of the leaders of the movie "The Bad Person" (actually a drunk boy). In this case, I think Singleton actually does a good job, a participating woman asks a frat boy to use a condom and he does not have one or wants to use one. In any case, he would not be able to stop his demands and go on to interfere with his requests. This kind of rape is quite common and I think that many uniformed people are not even raped. <br /> How does Singleton deal after the establishment of rape? When Frat boy tries to call the woman, she refuses to keep the victim on the roommate phone, which at the time frat Boy Roommate is a "black bitch." The affected Roemette appeals to the advisor of Ice Cube, who goes to a mate for his racist remarks and goes on to be physically abusive and abusive for a long time "apologizing"; However (apparently in Singleton's mind) rape was not considered less offense. Again, no one really sorry for the frat boy; <br /> <br /> Singleton seems to be sending a double message to a dual message, then a racist commentary raises the conspiracy and in any case becomes a justice against violence. <br /> <br /> This film is ultimately so frustrating, really important but singleton something about, no doubt the talented director, pull something of this size does not have maturity or depth.
