This is done for hell, but it's probably the worst thing about the whole DVD, the worst picture I've seen over the years !!! I was surprised that people took the time to do something worse and still spend too much money, I'm only happy to rent. I realized that the true fans of this movie may be tribute and gothic without taking any other effects on CGI or that, perhaps I have learned a lesson about Alex Chandon lighting and SFX. In the future, that is, if he is still in work. <br /> Notes to buyers It's very frustrating, do not buy !!!!!
