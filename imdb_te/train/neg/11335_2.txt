I have recently seen Belle Ebok, which I think is fantastic for winning the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. The film's bit of imagination and simplicity made me a bit. Probably just as controversial, the film is now filmed, the plots of the fallen woman for beautiful women and finally the falling girl for the last time. Without plotting the plot, some of the scenes in the film are really exposed to the storyline (eg a special program in the wedding). At times the film's film and the Church is set in relation to the film's ideas and the Franco Age. The only thing going on for the film is the cutesy moments, scenery and the role of Violeta, a strong, independent woman in women who are not really associated with those qualities.
