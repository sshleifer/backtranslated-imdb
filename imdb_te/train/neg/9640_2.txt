I'm always curious about this film because it's very difficult, so when I threw it on eBay I purchased it and bought it, now I understand why it's rare! The film is a lot worse, very awkward, and desperately low cost, and the end lines, showing the cut scenes that have stumbled on their lines, are literally the highlight of the film. The film is about a psychic (Petizohan, a clear reason, she has acted for the scene without her), pulling objects from another dimension into reality, she uses her powers as an experimental machine. Dragging soldiers in a kind of box like object, rotating the army behind a truck that wants to guard a soldier, geek, what do you know? SURPRISE! A kid falls in a foam-rubber monster dress, scratching his face throughout his face, killing the soldier immediately and then flees to a nearby city. But it is not necessary to leave Pettyjohn and Ray to find their own, instead of finding half the armed forces in the county and protecting them to protect them, but the film will still be reliable for its longevity. This is just an inevitable one drama voted for me because someone is trying to alert the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" producers. 2 out of 10, really, really bad!
