Smaller semi low to look, but rarely attractive. Still, two or three funny moments. What I like is the slippery and morally questionable McNicol. She plays an invalid (one leg problem), and her men are far from "ugly duckling", but she also eats a man - and we're supposed to feel for her! Oh, poor little McConnell, her leg problem ... poor little McKincol ?? She is constantly going from men and spills them without making them shine! On one occasion she had a nightly affair with an elegant stud, and then she rumored her newly-discovered friend girlfriend, which took time to get him some time! The audience are surprised to see why every person wants to close her. Well, almost every person; After seeing his leg wrapped in the metal, he was really the only person to distance himself from the telephone. But she seems to be doing well with men! No shame, no lack of men's success, and throws them away like her dolls; She was fraudulent as she dumped her cardinal. Poor little invalid girl ?? I do not think so. And yet we intend to believe that this woman has a major faith problem; She performs a scene prepared to prepare a flute for a solo concert and to throw notes on the ground from some nervous system. Fear ?? The rest of the film does not show little or nothing, indicating that she has loyal problems, so this flute is inaccurate and inadequate in the big picture. I was amazed at how quickly and eagerly a French woman was hit by a McKincolman. The image on the surface appears "a sentimental story of a woman's struggle for acceptance" (or something like that) but it is not; <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br The calf grows on the muscles. She "only" has a simple-visible metal prosthetic correspondence to the lower part of her leg, so the filmmakers did not really understand why I could make it look like a woman quasimodo or something. It's not like she has a couple head growing out of her neck! Although McConnell is rarely a big catch. <br /> <br /> What does Karadin play with a fair (relatively) soft guy with McConnell and her pal? This man is in "Revenge of the Nairs"! But I guess the films with Kennedy in politics are similar to those of Cardiards: no matter how quickly, incomplete or in mute, all doors open for career in films and politics. <br /> <br /> If you want to read bogus biographies about cardiards and other Hollywood relatives and drugs, please contact me by e-mail.
