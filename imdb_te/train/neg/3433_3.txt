It's a strange picture, you can call awful or if you sit in with friends you can give a killer laughter-athleen. Strange again and again. Enthusiastic shot, messy and commands, probably none. Special effects are funny but the music along with a flying troll baby is definitely the biggest hit. See if you have time to kill. But do not try to take seriously. Wants to be a tribute to 'porno Holocaust'. Since I did not see it, I could think it was wrong. It should be given 1/10, but it gives me a good laugh or two, so it's a 3. Maximum gore, the only thing anyone can work with. If you do not worry, more than gotta smile. Wonder if the makers have a laugh to make it?
