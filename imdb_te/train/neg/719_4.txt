This film, though a comedy, is deadly serious. Imperialism (with Capital I): Britain, intentionally and insulting, tries to convince that it is still a great force after World War II. In the house, the empire's increased drum and merciless Tories run, who can not find the closest relatives; <br /> <br /> The governments have long forgotten archives (a quadrilateral?), totalitarian rats, and anterior rooms. Old pump; But the zeal of the context appears to be rotating and crazy, especially embodied in its male twits. Carlton-Brown is a disappointing film, which does not have a lachrymose rot that has caused the supposed empire of the Crown. <br /> <br /> The film is related to the Cold War, dangerous persecution, its participation, slander and contempt, not fear and respect. It has more symptoms than negligence rather than colonialism, which destroys the desert, destabilizing the desert, abilities, power, and abduct them with self esteem, and they are susceptible to dangerous cowboys. It's seriously, in fact, it kills. Morgan's Creek, Dr. Strangelow and Brian Life's miracle - all of the heavy things can not be treated in comedy. In fact, serious themes can only be treated with comedy - it allows a clear-sighted perspective. <br /> <br /> Carlton-Browning problem is just a comic for every condition, thereby becoming weight loss and unfunny. In the above three films, a very serious comedy arises from journalistic reaction, not a serious situation. Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John Le Mesurier - are criminal. <br /> <br /> Terry-Tomas, therefore, often showed that he did not hold the main parts and needed to play with the sneeze, proud boundaries and brainless tuffs. Although the music has brought a lot of comedy, its huge sarcasm keeps in mind the lack of joy on the screen. (Most commonly in British comedies, biotions often try to earn their points through the film, montage and composition) Huntley is a character who can only be able to play in his sleep, giving true laughs. <br /> <br /> Whatever boultings' farces do not exclude - they do not adequately consider it. Despite Carlton-Brown's fulfillment in the imperialist recession, it was also anti-democratic and militaristic. I'm not sure this is intended, but these blunders will happen when you allow for the purpose of promoting comic intelligence and film form.
