I remember watching the BSG pilot. That night I can correctly describe it. I recall the chair where I was sitting. That performance is magic. It's alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I enjoyed the third years, and I saw every episode of the fourth year, and it will be completely reliable. <br /> <br /> I saw the Copper Pilot and got trapped. There is hope for something better. Then I began to look at regular episodes, which are getting worse. <br /> It is very imaginative. It reminds me of his final failure and the political changes of reality. <br /> <br /> The newest work in DS9 is great. When he focuses on the BSG in an organized manner, that's fine. This is especially true in the beginning when the model of the episodes set by the first BSG series is more or less followed. When they went out with Admiral Cain and Pegasus, they all went to the pot. <br /> As he walks, it is as if he had written the rest of the programs. Maybe it's just some weak opening parts. But I'm very nervous.
