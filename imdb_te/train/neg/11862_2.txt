It's not all in the fantasy, there is no redemption moment, it's featured in a remote funny trailer (nothing in the trailer), performances (especially Molly's absolutely unbelievable). Some comic relief was theoretically a homomorphic friend with the motivation for Disney films; There is no one in his similarity, and I literally wait to find out all his little moral speeches are flat and meaningful. The so-called "rugged 10" is a very disappointing plastic creature (unlike a horse-like face with an abominable smile); I honestly found that her friend Patty (referred to as a Hamburger) would be much better than she was.

I feel that the film is beside rude jokes in a wretched ball without a form of raw sewage. Marketing is there to pump anything, shine whatever the mass of the fittest and call gold, people come (I work). Done with tirot.
