The film first appeared, they set up the characters' profiles ... the storyline seemed to go in the right direction ... However, the film was focused on the wrong type of content, as the film progressed. .. or too much edited from the movie. The character recognition in the film has become even worse. Moreover, there seems to be a very absurd meaning - in other words - there are things in the film that do not seem to fit into the movie. The title ... The title is not appropriate for the title ... I think the titles will work for the titles ... the actors have loved them ... they have a good director and the writer, perhaps this was a good job. But it did not. So now there's a new horrible film coming up this Friday .... in my opinion! Do not waste your time or money.
