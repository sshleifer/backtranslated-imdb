I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time in 1986. At that time I saw BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Jayla Clark. It's an amazing version and much like the book. A few years later, I was afraid of this computer and got worried. William Hurt is totally mistaken as Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is a passionate character, William Hurt portrayed ice as a block. That same Charlotte Gains goes to Baroque. It's like watching two zombies together. This is a story about love and passion, but I can not see in this version. No, back to BBC-version. A wonderful time guaranteed.
