Last night I saw one of these movie pay-per-view channels and I was amazed why I was bothered by it. In all honesty, I really wanted another from this movie. Maybe something 'Conspiracy Theory'. Why? Perhaps due to casting. I mean, Nicolas Cage and Harvey Keitel, after all. Not about Jon Woyt and Christopher Plummer. Now I am wondering, why are they embarrassed? But instead of an absorbing action mystery drama I was caught in a pastiche with a là 'goonies' breakneck silliness, which looks to some great critically acclaimed my greatest surprise. Teen is clearly targeted to audiences and teen audiences because 'gonus' probably can cause this. <br /> <br /> When judging from the "National Treasure" previews, it is intentionally intended to appeal to adult audiences. <br /> The suspension of disloyalty is one thing. How can it enjoy science fiction and horror? But I really hinder the hype tablets of intriguing conspiracy and conspiracy-engaging trips at the audience. Oh, thrown in all the jokes intended to be strongly engaged in the hero's confusion. "Wow! The Massons, The Knights Templeers, You Know, It May Be True!" I think the Gates really lost me when I hid the fatherhood of founding funds to keep me out of British hands! And just come from the Knights Templar? New coat? Oh, I forgot. From France! It goes a long way to explain how the revolution ended in Philadelphia. It was brought by Napoleonic agents! Anyway, see what I'm doing. The maze of the film is interesting. And I really think a serious mysterious play could not be successful. But it comes as a kid who has grown up in another adult. In the end, I'm refusing the audience and asking audiences without knowing just a degrading degree. <br /> <br /> I finished watching many things by Werner Herzog and Istvan Sabábola. <br /> <br /> Hollywood Big Mac and Fries are a shock to switch from fine dining. <br /> <br /> Okay, okay. If you look at chains, explosions, and 'gi-waz' jimmykri, you'll enjoy the 'National Treasure'. But sort of film, well, are you ever outside of a movie waiting to get out of the previous audience? And all the young children talk emotionally about themselves, "Wow! Did you see how that was broken up? The National Treasure was a kind of film.
