If it is considered a black experience, leave me in front or back door. <br /> <br /> One day for a mama boy, look at two young hoods. Angela Bassett, a shining grace in the film, plays his protective, religious mother. Despite her anger in how her life changed, in the middle of the film, she really decides to accept this. <br /> <br /> She allows her friends to come and suddenly has the right to use pornography until it is not before the child. <br /> <br /> This is a sad situation for gangster rap. <br /> In the end, when Bassett was laughed at the sound of his son's body, when his life was cut at age 24, he became a man. What man? He was a convicted criminal, who wrote most violent rapes with obsessive and obscene society. The exact example of what will happen in our schools is that he will earn more than a teacher in a classroom that teaches him as a teacher. <br /> <br /> The East Coast, West Coast gang rap competition is not fully explained. <br /> <br /> A horrific movie did nothing to prevent gang violence. How terrible character models are these rap singers and their foul music. The African American community should take the chain at their very existence. Who is the classless fat slab played by Biggie? He has done a fine appearance from the old television show. I know he is on the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant who changed this chubby little boy into the indecent monster that he called. Sorry for the so-called motion picture entertainment.
