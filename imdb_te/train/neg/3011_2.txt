I am very happy about this film as it has the types of knowledge like "rivers and tides" waiting for visual beauty about the artistic beauty and nature. However, I'm not receiving it. Instead, I am very excited about how bad the human industry is in nature. <br /> The photographer is contrary to the aesthetic qualities of his paintings, and he seems to have occasionally worked on the edges of the paintings to the workers in accordance with the "moral" fate. And frankly, the pictures are generally not impressive. <br /> <br /> "The artist" is the source of what makes it beautiful. <br /> <br /> In all things, stupid image. For people who like to feel better about their environmental consciousness ... but want to think about the complexity of the problems around it.
