This film was just mixed with MST3K and good reason. This is the first "Cap" movie starring Joe Dan Baker, who is the best actor of our country as Michael Jackson as a country Western singer. <br /> <br /> All the usual police image plot tools are performed by their ugly heads, bar stunts, children in hostile firearms, bad acting, lame police leaders, bad acting, revenge / justice, endless goons, and of course, bad acting . Do not see this without a MST3K filter folks.
