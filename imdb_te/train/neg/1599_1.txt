There was a flop when National Campbell's Class Reunion was released. It did not last long in theaters in my big city. Why? <br /> <br /> A good way but bad is not bad in a way that's useless. The total number of actors of these actors do not know much and are unknown after the turkey. <br /> <br /> This idea is indeed great (a simulation related to the slash), but in every aspect of implementation it is very small. <br /> <br /> This is a "comedy" just avoid. Your time is more valuable than having a nanosecond looking at this troublesome misfire.
