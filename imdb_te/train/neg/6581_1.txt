I've rented a "New Best Friend" for a movie like the cheerful teen thrillers like "Gossip" and "The Curve". Instead, "New Best Friend" is in "The Crowd", which does not have any thrillers and acting is very fraudulent. "New Best Friend" is boring, and the events in the film are identical. Skip this movie ... it's time wasted.
