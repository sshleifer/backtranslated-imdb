You would like to spend about 2 hours in your life. If you like them, God is scary, they will stay away. The worst picture I've ever seen in my life is without a doubt (and I've seen 'Long Time Dead'), and I say this as a fan of low budget horror / gore artist and compare it to a better one. I'm not even going to go into the specifics of what makes this movie bad, the only good thing about it is that it is so terrible that one of the funny things I have seen over the years. If you can afford the cheapest rent, it's definitely worth looking at, if you're doing it - humiliation. : o) IMDb is required to introduce a 0/10 ranking for this film, which is fully deserves.
