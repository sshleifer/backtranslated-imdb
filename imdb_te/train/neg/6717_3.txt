This is a terrible god. The story is in space and I am not confused because of terrible editing. No one has any sympathy because their characters are not adequately developed. They are very surface people without any size. Cheesy and ankle stereotypes. Stripper chick is a distraction, even though she's just fine. I do not know what this effort is, but how am I scared when they show this trash in Sundance? I almost canceled my membership. You might want to show you more quality pictures. There are many, there are better gay and lesbian background images. "The Celluloid Closet" is a wonderful documentary. I really enjoyed "Wiggstack: The Movie". I'm sure there are others who dropped my mind at the time, but what I'm trying to say is that this is not just worth it. <br /> There may be three or four shots that look really good (sad I can calculate them with one hand), otherwise cinematography is pretty crappy as well. Places are very bright. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " His performance is not too bad. <br /> <br /> Stick with real romantic, friend. <br /> <br />
