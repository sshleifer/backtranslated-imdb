At least in the entertaining fake-documentary original film "The Legend of Boogie Creek" is one of the worst wastes of the 35mm movie motion picture of the sequel. Bad script, worst acting etc. Don Wells had to expect that Gilligan would be able to save her and take her back to the island to escape this piece of Kapat-Trap.
