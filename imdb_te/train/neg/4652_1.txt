This is a painful example of cheap, boring and unnatural performances produced by Australian TV stations to complete local content castles. I'm not surprised that this work is really awful and the recent writers were responsible for the worst Australian film in respectable volley Norman. <br /> <br /> There is nothing about this TV series - fun fun. It's just weary and bAD and, the worst of all, it's really funny. <br /> <br /> There are many sauces about this show given at 10 on 10 on IMDb. Try to find a (true) review by the realist (real) Australian viewer (not there) and it's impossible. Or crazy. Bread breads are more ridiculous than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid performing at all costs and remember if you get on DVD, do not understand it.
