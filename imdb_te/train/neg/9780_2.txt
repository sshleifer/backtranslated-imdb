Good Lord, who needs to be buried alive by this turkey. I'm sorry, but the other reviewer should not have seen this movie, he must have seen something or never seen the film before ... what does he say in ten stars, whether it's Ben Hur or Gone with the Wind? Unexpectedly funny, heavily unbelievable characters, absurd situations, into a package of Griffith Park (which was filmed in Griffith Park), crappy script and everything that could make everything wrong with an image filmed. For all filmmakers it is necessary to look at how an image is terribly wrong. It reminds me of what a USC student can make for a film series. <br /> <br /> If you do not get drugs and go to camp, give exemption.
