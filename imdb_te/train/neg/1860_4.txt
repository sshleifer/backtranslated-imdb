The 1998 title of Michael Keaton's kiddie comedy of the same title condemns it, Um, for grotesque special effects, but they are compared to the mad gorges they are positively mind-guessing for this horror comedy.

The town doctor has a dozen of dozens of dozens of memorable characters in a small but happy role.
