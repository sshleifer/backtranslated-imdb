<br /> I watched this movie halfway and I did not like it. <br /> The first reason: Boring. Not just nothing, women sat down, how terrible they were, their hopes, no hopes, they read the weeds, magazines, care for their unhealthy friend, and occasionally cut the dead body. <br /> <br /> The second reason: There are many things that remain unexplained. Several scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter kidnapped by random men, a chair restrains them and inquires them. Who are these men? How do they know about illegal activities regarding damaged meat consumers? <br /> <br /> There is also a person who thinks that we already have a meat-borne disease, but he puts his fist in man's strength. We never explained what we originally thought! How frustrated? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I hurt women, the story is unpleasant, unfortunate, and unavoidable. Cover art is also misleading as you believe this movie is cool when it's not clear. I have rented this film based on some reviews made by other people on this website, and I respect the fact that some people will enjoy this film, and I have read two reviews from a movie right now. I will not see another movie renting.
