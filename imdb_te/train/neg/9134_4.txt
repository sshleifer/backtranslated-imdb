I like this program. I really did. I also bought the pilot image, first in VHS and later on DVD. However, I could not come into this story because its two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Madie" (Cybill Shepard) seemed to be in love for just one thing. I accepted some brilliant dialogue on the program, which is a key part of the TV program's success, and I appreciate a lot of dialogue. <br /> In general, it is similar to older screwball comedy films of '30s and' 40s between male and female. You are arguing, allegations, stiff and screaming. Many people love the kind of love that kind of obviously, but I hate it so I never got on the moonlighting. <br /> <br /> Alice Beesley is entertaining as the only unsuspecting assistant "Agnes". It is very small, she has such a short air time. Shepherd looks good on the eyes and I suppose women will say Willis is the same, but argues that both are between the two and finally turned off for me.
