I did not know that I had shot the brilliant talent of technology degree programs at the Devil University (or ITT Tech?) In the early 1990s. Well this film should be the product of class valedictorian. My friend and I rented a boogie in my Netflix 1980s and the movie is on the flip side of the DVD. Do not waste your time with this movie. Horror terrible. <br /> <br /> Filmmaker 2 adds the main character, a woman and her therapist. This woman dreams of the first film of Boogeymann and his victim. Over 50% of the film is stock from the original image. The rest of the movie is a commentator with the main character having bad dreams while her therapist drones. These scenes are filmed by a lot of thick letters. They are Angela Lansbury 25 years old. So, terrible, recapitious. Do not see this movie.
