Unfortunately, 0 is not for rating or I choose it. The film does not have the potential star in the original film. The film is lovely, directed by an expert from Kelly Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Carrie, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the newcomer of Aileen Quinn's innocence and spiced pro John Huston (father of actress Angelica Huston). The 1999 remake with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming, and Kristin Shonoth also gave more than just forgiveness for the sequel. Ashley Johnson is famous for her role before the film, as her portrayal of Little Christina Sever in the Growing Pains Show. She has some bit of parts in movies, but I think she has enough expertise to pick up herself. Adding Jon Collins as Lady Edwin Hogbot is funnier! Although they can not play the main characters like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan and Annie, will some of the British women sign up to Jon Collins to play? I'm not surprised that this film is very bad. Critics do not agree with the film, although it is made only for TV, it is a poor sequel in a lovely movie.
