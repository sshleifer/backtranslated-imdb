I remember playing Devil Dog nearly 20 years ago in TBS, and my older sister and her friends were looking at it and laughing the next day. It is not bad for the TV horror film, but it is a derivative (mostly the exorcist) and business as it does not have a good term. It does not blow away you with artistic cinematography or great acting, but it does not waste time either. <br /> <br /> If you go into the movie where you are looking for some laugh, you will not be disappointed. Head The Dolled Dog The first sequences with Lucky Devil Dog, humorous daunted hilariously with children with eyesight, and the climatic blue-screen effects of heavy black dogs (horns!) Are very beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know what you want,
