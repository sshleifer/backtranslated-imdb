Mary Schelarr has a Depression-era drama about a gracious bank owner who recently telecast in their April Fool's comedy months TCM. If you come out of the dreler-polly moron team with a big laugh, you're disappointed because this is really a lot downbeat movie. It's also very poorly made, so surprisingly considering it came from MGM. Leonard Smith's bare bones cinematography is definitely a 'camera set up and do not move it' from the school, often causing the cast to cast, thus sending the screens themselves (such as the presence of the pan and scan prints!) Or their heads cut. The film does not have a credit director, which is under a clear fly through the product's night nature. Overall, this is often unsatisfied with the dirty, late reel dash in the bathroom to make Dreamerle often over-emoting and apart.
