Well, writing is very sloppy, the direction is sloppier, and editing has made it even worse (at least I hope editing). Performance is not bad, but it is not good either. The characters are not very much liked. The film wasted at least 45 minutes and did not use it anywhere near the other hour or its full potential. It's a great idea, but it goes through another wasteful good idea. It ended up with 3 different places, but it was only the most prevalent Hollywood finale. And it's not so predictable that it does not matter so badly. The end is not worth looking at all. Sandra Bullock has come out of her element and needs to be avoided from these kind of movies. The film also looked to be moved. The picture was just not really worth it, and I had paid it for it was too mad. I was hoping for a very good hope and I was disappointed because I got a bad one. Not all of the images are scary, but I did not get it back. I gave it to 10 b / c. I liked a lot of thought and a role (I believe it is crumpled, super smart). And it has fewer ways to cover the plot holes. It's like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape, it's not pretty. However, if you see, wait for $ 1.50 theater or video, if you do not like every movie you'd like to see, you'd like it.
