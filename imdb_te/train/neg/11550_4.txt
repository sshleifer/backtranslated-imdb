I know I'm going to see a low-budget movie, but I've estimated a lot from Alex Cox's movie. The acting by two celebrities is terrible, especially the white person. The girl should win the Oscar compared to those two. I guess the movie industry is ridiculous to the public and to some other jokes I really understand and rarely make me laugh. With these laugh-loud moments I gave 2/10 to this film. <br /> <br /> Spare: <br /> <br /> After the end of the film, I have two questions. Why was the first man to visit another man's home? Did he say that his daughter had removed 100 people from her last job? Why did she break her own stuff when she was mad? I thought I went to Q & A after the movie, but I did not get up at 10am.
