A chemical spill people are becoming zombies. It is the two doctor's to survive the epidemic. It is an Andreas Schnaas movie so you can have what's par for the course. Bad acting, scary awful special effects and no budget to talk. Dubbing is ridiculous with a capital R and the saddest thing is that guides placed by me through the IMDB I feel compelled to write a word about the part of this stool, because I have a lot of ten lines. My original review of just one word: Crop does not fly I should edit it and go no matter how bad it is. But I do not know if I can not do it, I want to wait, I have enough words, or lines instead of passing this review. It's nice, I guess. So in the summer: this movie sucks balls, do not look at it. <br /> My Grade: F
