About 4 years ago, I liked this movie. I can see it and over and over. But now ... I will not. Actually, I think this film was great for the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It is a group of comment-heavy actors (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Wupie Goldberg), and a beautiful cheesy plot. My favorite part is when Culkin is riding on his bike and he comes across a gang and says a gang member, "Hey, Tyler! Where's Goin?" <br /> On the other hand, better than "Good Sun".
