This film is terrible. I could not wait to do that. I can not see this movie again if I paid it. The horror sequences in it are very imaginative and did not play. There's nothing really about this movie or it's worth $ 7.50. Do not let it go, do not rent it and do not read it, because your time in any of these is completely waste. Sarah Mitchell Geller gave a poor performance and really should be ashamed of her to satisfy her good name with the film. You have insulted Sarah for having a relationship with this terrible, horrible movie. The comedy is a must watch.
