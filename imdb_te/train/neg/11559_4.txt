<br /> <br /> The horror DVD-release of alpha video (I only look very bad) has only seen this magnificent piece of euro-tash. Video-transfer), but not from what I've seen, Shame's recent DVD-release is not nearly as interesting to buy. If you look at their amazing track record, it will undoubtedly develop mainly on all previous releases. And do not pay attention to the funniest cover shown here, which is not removed from the film (the girl who is on the head of Jim Carrey). <br /> Spaghetti Western star Anthony Stephen plays the role of Lord Alan Cunningham, who walks along with Hippo Headdo and his dead wife Evelyn's memorial. This leads to a nervous breakdown that retains him in a psychiatric clinic. Once released, the Cunningham Channels raided her rural area with the blood of the prostitutes, and with this injury, violently tortured them. His doctor and friend, Richard Timberlane (what do you mean, Italy make horror names sound "make?"), Forget the past and advise him to marry but Cunningham is engaged with Evelyn and also maintains a sena at the castle. Eventually, after killing some of the girls, he meets Gladys, another redhead, soon marries her, but his new wife's arrival will lead to a series of irregular events. Bloodthirsty creatures strike at the Sir Alan family, killing each and every one. To be more tragedy, Cunningham finds that Evelyn's visit to the grave is empty. Soon, "outsiders" suspect that they are fishing in the castle, and Lord Cunningham's treatment has not been successful at all. <br /> <br /> Director Emilio Miraglia attempts to combine gothic horror with Giolio with limited success. In general, the film did little to convince the audience set in England. The cars drive on the right side of the road, everyone is very patented Italian and castle (and the rest of the construction). It is common in Italian horror, but sometimes they take this quite a long way. The bad impression is very dark, even though it is very dark, you can not see the surroundings. But again, the reality of reality is not really a problem where anything else in this movie exploitation will happen. A large part of the castle torture chamber features sido-masochistic torture scenes, but most of the time, Anthony Steffen goes through this and displays a terrible performance. I will all depend on the state of your mind and guess this nonsense is a fun piece if you are in the right mood. I can not take it, not at least a print that I do not see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> The camera abcura --- 4/10
