Instead of a "1" ("awful") instead of "2", as many visuals do not refuse to be spectacular, and the talent has entered many special effects and artwork. <br /> <br /> "Sepia" tightened and the colors of the subject were washed away several times in other films. There's nothing new. I see some hat tips for other older, classic movies. As well. <br /> <br /> But the film is entertaining and interesting, though not sleeping. <br /> <br /> The story and script in this story is awful, the characters are two dimensional. Gradually moving. Some of the scenes look pretty, but ultimately, overall, it is very boring, I did not recommend it.
