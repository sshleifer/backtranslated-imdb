This dumb comedy does a good job of wasting humorous talent. In particular, Dan Ayrroyd and Howard Hesseman were badly abused here. I may be chuckled once or twice in this film, but in general, it is a boring image, with a little bit of stupidity thrown up for good measure. In the premise, however, is still not bad, but after setting the plot, the film did not go anywhere. Do not misuse this time.
