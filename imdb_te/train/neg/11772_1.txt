I'm a little boy ... this film is all about the cinematographer. It is a fact that the criticism of the sex tourism industry is very realistic until we "treat" a temporary dance scene. The plot is immense that BAD is the most exciting fan of horror. And please stop to tell a story of losing innocence or a story of female empowerment because this film is not very clear for the love of God (childish tantrums, what hell?). At the Edinburgh festival (which I have ever seen) was the worst film, it collapsed with something in the film because nothing of them could be taken. It may seem like a very critical critic, but I'm not sure unless the film's riddle's feature is really pure comedy. In short, this film looks better on the cocktail of Class A drugs.
