I do not know anything about this film, and I'm convinced it to see a friend, which says "the drama from drama is a continuous war scenario." This is not far from the truth. It's one of the most boring, poorly written, enthusiastic and horrific films that I've been unlucky to put my eyes on. I like the positions out there with the picture to consider the worst movie of all time ... Battlefield Land. It is hard to believe that the filmmakers believe that this cheesy soap opera can be considered a serious historical fact. It also has some of the worst conversation I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... the guy tells the girl "you smell like moon." Girl replies "What's the smell of the moon?" Oh god! You play me! It looked very ridiculous and the guy's drama and the good sequences in the quarter came from the audience as someone remembered me by making their voice a rare sound with the sound of the person fractured. If it's playing on a theater near you, avoid all the costs. The film is very bad, I took a decision about 45 minutes and I needed to meet my sleep ... and I did. Awful.
