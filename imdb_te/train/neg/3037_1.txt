That stereotypical Mtv generation is one of the dance movies, and I do not see all of this coming from the 'worst' trash. Acting is terrible, where all other 'dancing' films are exactly the same story. Its terrible! Name scream should not be seen. 'How will she move?' Movie titles From time to time without grammar? At least some of the dancing films have half a good dance scenes, and this watch is not even a watch. Because I do not have zero, I've given it from 10 to 1. I'm not looking at anyone with IQ of 60 people and I seriously scare you not to waste your money. 1.6 / 10 It should all say. This film should not be made.
