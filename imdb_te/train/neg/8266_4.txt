* Bliep * with this picture? Can not they sacrifice a good script? All in a 'nice' film, but ... it's been done more than once ... until the end I thought it was okay, but ... going back to the last ... * BARF * SO corny ... Waiting ... But Wow, it did not ... It's fine. <br /> <br /> I like Big Big with Tom Hanks, similar film in a new form with another kid he / she wanted to be older / old; <br /> When it comes on TV. Do not make me wrong, but it is not
