'I'm working for a bad company in the future of industrial spying and I'm starting to get confused about who really is, sh * # t! I've got a headache and things go wobbly, Oh here's another sophisticated and more sophisticated picture of sophisticated images coming out of space ... <br /> <br /> I've rented this movie because some reviews are all convenient. Why? Cifer is a low, derivative, discouraged film, with a poorly predictable future, with wooden leads, and a ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> <br /> With a Duran Duran video that combines a crazy bond before motion picture makers slip in the face <br />] Doctor Who has some good in style (if slightly Babylon 5) CGI sets pieces Special effects improved. This sub-fight club, the subsidiary Philip K Dick Future Noir thriller is working on a more comprehensive scope than its modest budget. <br /> <br /> Cool blue fraud is working with a po-faced intensity - an unhappy dumb. This is not a brilliant Size-Fi, this computer game plot.
