I grew up (1965) to love the Thunder birds. My colleagues at school looked at me. At noon and after school, we played "Thunder Birds" before school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. No one wanted to be Alan. Counting down from 5 has become an art form. I see my children love me as a child. How frustrated The only high point is complex theme tune. It does not mean that Thunder does not compare to the original score of birds. Thankfully early Saturday morning a television channel still plays remakes created by Gerry Anderson and his wife. Jonathan Frakes should be in his directors chair, his version is completely helpless. The film is waste. Absolutely rubbish. A CGI remake may be acceptable but replacing marionettes with Homo sapiens subsp. The huge error of the Sapiens judgment.
