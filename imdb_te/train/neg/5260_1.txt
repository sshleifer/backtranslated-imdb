<br /> <br /> In general, I do not have any problem with an image or story you are surprised to find out what really happened, but when it's done deliberately ... <br /> But, after the last 15 minutes, <br /> <br /> I saw in TBS ... I do not want you to spend money on it. If you are caught on TV, look at the last 15 minutes, then go and make your own ending in your mind. <br /> If they really are away, <br /> <br /> "I came back with the State Poses of Fates to know that the town and the car were buried, and never had all the shows ..." "I have more thumbs, that image can give 4 thumbs down! "
