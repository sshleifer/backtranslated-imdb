I've seen the DVD (known as the Black Widow in the USA) and this is really a really awful movie. But they should cut quite a bit from the original film, or I've missed a lot. Sex scenes have very little discomfort and nudity (not even a breast), but I have read many other comments about something that was dissatisfied with IMDb.com and about a champagne. I did not see anything like that, just a bad, unlikable roles boring image and a banal, sophomoric plot. Gida is paralyzed from the mouth of the colagrant mouth or botoks to the groves, and the crunch touches her face. And her name is considered super-sizzing as a drink at Taco Bell: "I have a cola grande!" It's great, I'm in my own Mystery Science Theater 3000, and it's pretty cool, saying Duff's skin is too big for her face. It's like crazy putty!
