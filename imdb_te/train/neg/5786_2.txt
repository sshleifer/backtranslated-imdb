It's amazing that you have just watched it "PG" to hear all the language here, but it's a 1970s rating system for you. Peter Falk spikes out the name of the Lord six times in vain in the first ten minutes alone in this film! However, some people are not sure of scams that make films or "rate" people. <br /> <br /> A description of how the cast was desecrated: Faulk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oats, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvado You are not exactly the actors "Sound of Music." <br /> <br /> I hate movies, and directors like William Freedin, but do not deliver this script and feel it's feel, visually and audible of "Sleepy 70". For TV lovers in TV's "Colombo", he must come as a shock to listen to him as being so unpleasant as he did in films. This is very small in the case.
