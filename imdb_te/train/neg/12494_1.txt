There is nothing about the film I liked. It is clearly low-budget with bad lighting and camera work (almost like the Blair Witch Project, it's not just that). The plot is not really much, and the film is just medicine and. By the last 1/3 of the movies I was fast forwarded, but it did not help much things. I thought it would be good from the box, but I should say again: nothing about this film is good. The good actors, the special effects are very fake, the camera work is terrible, and the conversation is terrible terrible. On my own personal level, I gave the film 10.
