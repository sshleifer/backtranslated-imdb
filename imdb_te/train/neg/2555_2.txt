The film is one of the most horrible horror flicks. The length is not nearly enough to include a good stretch. Also, the death of foster parents is just plain ridiculous. After tripping over an innocent person, the mother suddenly drops through a shower, and the father was shot dead by a police officer? Some realism I can see where they are going, but that's fine. Moreover, its dance is to stop it before. After listening to the name of Lucy, I recognized that 'Lucifer'. Yes, it's interesting that Lucifer is a woman, but look for the name. It's a male name. It should give a male character. For all, the film was a bore and a good plot to use.
