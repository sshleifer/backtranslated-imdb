A good deal of running around. An adversary who feels bad about the lowest complexity. A scientist working with information on sending and receiving signals into space, was captured by aliens. Along with his beautiful wife, he invades their territory and gives them the secret about them. He suffers from illness in this process. Of course, he could make a choice. He has a scene that gives everything they want. It's a long film with a long span of time. The plot is not technically bad. It is usually a car, a tour through a woods, a building to investigate. This is editing. I suppose the story is not technically more supportive. Not quite here.
