<br /> <br /> <p> Anil Kapoor, <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor is in a bikini ..... <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> Why do I forget why? <br /> <br /> The first half of the cinema for all criticisms is not that bad ... <br /> <br /> Here is the conspiracy of kirina ritchi movies when I see a lock stack and snatch . <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor is a very thin model model. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the Akki Kumar. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is worried but funny type, you can never forget it. > Saif pakka ala mein qiladi. <br /> <br /> Some of the goosebumps during the occasional laughter and some Chuckley Kareena-Seif love story (in Kareena Rain, behind my bike). <br /> <br /> The second half is equally enthusiastic when it comes to the break, because the second half of the innocents are the cause of Rank Kareena. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor and his cycles get on your nerves <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only person who has some madness, he can not be afraid for a while later <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Why is it ?? !!! When? <br /> <br /> <br / </ p> <p> <br /> </ p> <p> No longer relieved injury. <br /> <br /> This movie, which you shot as a BUZZ <br /> <br /> + s-when, when, when, when, when, Who is too (I need a book to fill). <br/> Over 3/10 (Trying to avoid 1s and 2s does not seem to be very intense, but it is not how good the movie is, if it's not the first half).
