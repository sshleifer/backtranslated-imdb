I do not believe they make this film. Absolutely unnecessary. The first picture is OK. But the sequel to the first sequel is not necessarily a sequel after a television series. The film feels like a soap opera. Writing is so bad, it's easy. Jokes do not come across, acting flat, which is portrayed as a soap, which is not in any direction. The first film has a good emotional backbone behind it. Each character has a little arc. It's very simple but somehow it worked and I could see the film's merit. But this time, there is no cohesive story-line. Characters do not make diligent stereotypes and nothing interesting. A good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is pretty well cast. A moment of creative success in the film. I have already heard the second television series shot down to 'Team Spirit 2', but please do not please God and do not make them the third traits ...
