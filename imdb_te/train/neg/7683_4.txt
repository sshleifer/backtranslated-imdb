"Cobweb" is an example of many films that have strong, sometimes notable performances and high points, but unfortunately broken and likelihood of the fragile plots and audiences. It works with Richard Widmark at a mental institution that has caused tremendous clashes in family problems and crisis, and it really is not a big deal. <br /> This plot. It's time for the organization to get new sounds for the library windows. An elderly woman wants to put her grapes on herself, but many patients want to do their own. And somehow, this ridiculous and unexpectedly breaks into the point where Lonely collision accident and lives begin to decline. <br /> <br /> The questionability of the logic of the plot and even if it is a miracle, buy it. Do not get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with acting. After Widmark's cast, the cast includes other great actors, most of them Academy Award-nominations and winners. And there is an occasional moment in the film that works brilliantly, but it always excludes stupid plot about window drapes. Unfortunately, truffles are very high, so the film is slowly decreasing. <br /> In a brief analysis, "The Cobweb" is an unrecognized image and it becomes clear. The audience will initially come to the attention of the plot, which makes it pretty quick. It does not really sound like a lot of fun to see and I tell you that it's not too fun to see.
