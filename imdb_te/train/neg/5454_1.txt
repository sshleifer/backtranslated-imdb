Wow, this movie is just a bloody hridi. <br /> <br /> When I did not pay to see, I wanted to withdraw my money back. <br /> <br /> This film is not understandable. Mish-mash of the science fiction cliche by a very talented filmmaker. The performances, especially Leeds, are on the way to the less attractive Ed Wood sort. Speaking of Ed Wood, he'd been proud of the character's role. It is just too taciturn without any reference to the sarcasm or sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are okay, but they are not enough to go "Oh wow, cool" and they just do not look like <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is another mishmash that does not really set any mood. <br /> <br /> The songs seemed to have thrown in the film in an effort to make the director just "cool". <br /> This brings me to my ultimate point. If the director was actually scared of the desire to be "cool" about plot, story and dialogue, he did not make such a dorky cliche of a small movie. <br /> <br />
