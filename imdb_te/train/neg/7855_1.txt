After seeing this film, I could not believe my eyes. By then there was no blood and violence. Unlike Gore and other horrendous paintings, the film is just killing the blood, gore and the other one. This film is not interesting, there is no meaningful plot or plot, nor does it have an intelligence. The blood seems to be quite a duplicate and the overall picture is pointless. Do not waste your time with it. It's just an hour or two for noise violence. It's terrifying the most horrifying scenes but it turns out to be plain. This is the worst horror film I've ever seen from all the horror films I've seen.
