It is a good image but according to information it is pretty accurate in describing torture techniques. The purpose of the film was to demonstrate the brutality of NK POW camping and at the time had worked efficiently with the surprising frankness. There are no technical disadvantages (and there are plenty of) by looking at the forgotten corner of the war you forgot and some pretty nasty stuff - again evil, because it's not in Guantanamo Bay, north of Dienza. <Br /> <br /> <br /> I do not think any Korean worker might be doing any work. Compared to Vietnam films, if you see movies like Pork Chop Hill and Pork Chop Hill. I do not know if it is WWII Concepts (boys are very knowledgeable) or people who are in battle '54, but it's interesting to look at it from the same system after 16 years. The films like "Spellans Go Go" were created.
