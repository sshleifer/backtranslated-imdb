There is potential. I saw a crypt, 'Oh, it's so interesting'. And yet some interesting storyline lines or neglect have never happened. The main character was irritating throughout the film, and at one time my outrageous and shouting that I both wanted her to die. There are some honestly horrifying / horrifying moments, but these are the moments that threaten me from scary moments. It's one of those horror movies, that's the crops and tricks you're all about, but finally you're bored and the filmmakers are a little confused about what they're trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> You know that the movie is bad, but bad you are losing more than the main character.
