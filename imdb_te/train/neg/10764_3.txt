I give credit to the author / director William Gove to find anyone who is financially "thriller" with this bad idea. A good argument that does not waste money without subscribing to HBO does not allow DVDs to be based on cover art and blurbs. Art direction is not half bad, but the pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Greary add to their resume nothing important. This conversation makes you wonder with its pride; It's in its worst story. There is no tension, no suspense, no fear, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, nothing. Some attractive and often naked women spice up boredom, but this is definitely a trailer. I'm sorry for the person who laughs on this topic. Good for midnight, zonal-view view only. You are alerted.
