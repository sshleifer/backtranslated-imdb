Bert i Who wanted to continue with Gordon's legendary trash Trash-film "Gods of Foods"? No one, of course, but director Damian Lee thought it was a good idea anyway, and he accompanied a delayed sequel to becoming one of the most unwanted movies in horror history. "Gnav" is only a sequel to the name, because this setting changes to 80th position (University campus), and cheap & cheesy gore effects 80s accurately. The script clips are not stolen from other (and more successful) horror classics, along with written dialogues and plot conditions. Neil Hamilton is a lovely two-shoe scientist, who experiences growing rats on the common rats in order to comply with fellow scientists. Due to the incredibly stupid animal rights activists, large and raven rats escape and devour pretty much everyone in the campus. Following a good old tradition of launching "Jaws" by Spielberg, there is a bad dean who has refused to accept the problem despite severely mutilated corpses everywhere. During a fainting stupid climax, rats attacked the campus' new sports complex opening ceremony! "Wisdom: Gods 2" is terrible evil and is very fun to watch! The characters and the spectacular stupid stuff is a realistic bizarre order to have sex with the hero with the effect of outrageous and rising serum, to say, acting and acting as they descend into abyss while learning (they are entrapped with rats)! I wonder what frood's doctrine will be on! Gore and sleaze is a satisfactory amount and ?? Is it to say? The music is surprisingly weather. If you can not get enough of this waste, the Italian sculk movie "Rats: Night of Terror" is the simplest 70s cult movie "Willard" and revolves around its evolutionary rodents. Lime Sequel "Ben", 2003 "Willard" remake, Crispin Glover and the surprisingly good recent rat-films Tibor Tikox ("Rats") and John Laffia ("The Rats"). Go nuts!
