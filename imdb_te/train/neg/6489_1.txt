It seemed a good campus for an image ... Unfortunately it failed to release to almost every level. The film was very hard to follow at the beginning and I found the combat to really turn off the biggest problem from a visual aspect of the camera work is just as much as "arti" splicings and semi- originally cutting across the entire story of the whole story. It really tries to be very difficult to immerse you in the moment and build a breathtaking ending but the movie is just a half thought idea characters and the corresponding script leave you feeling frustrated and confused why they tried to go too deep.
