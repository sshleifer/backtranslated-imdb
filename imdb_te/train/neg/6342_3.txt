Because of Tarantino's recommendation ("If you do not like this, you are F & ^% yourself!") I have chosen this video in the video store ... it looks like a ringing endorsement ... I look forward to a little more like "Death Proof". .. is not the actual torture or character of something, or the story of the conversation. <br /> Look at the poster. It's right there. Stunts, and rock. It will go back and forth. For a week or a LA Bond life, you can probably look at one of the low casinos off the strip, and find a new Aussie stuntman in the town finding his feet ... they work, they girls, they meet the party. The end of the story. <br /> <br /> Because they clearly have a second level, the band is essential for those items and has already played a style dating back to 1978. Stunts bits in this movie are genuinely spinetingling - there is something really wrong with the asset, and the film "art" seems more motivated by love and respect. I hung there to see the crazy thing he'd want to do next. He wants to find a good vehicle.
