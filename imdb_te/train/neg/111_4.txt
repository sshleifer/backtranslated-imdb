My interest in Dorothy Stratten bought me this video. Despite having great actors / actresses, there are more rewards to retain interest. Plus it's not just interesting. The conversation is stiff and confusing, and the story is very close to the story. I believe that Audrey is one of Hepburn's final movies. I always love John Ritter in a slapstick. He's very curious here.
