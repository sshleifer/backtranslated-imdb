I was curious to see this film. Many people are happy. There are also my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ but I am open to any opinions or opinions. It does not matter if Jesus exists as it is written in the Bible. Maria is a virgin or not, or all other pagan coincidences. <br /> <br /> When I was a skeptic, the idea of ​​love was the only way to create love in this world. <br /> If someone takes a sentence, without showing it a virtually written context. For example, they have judged greatly in the picture: "Take my enemies here and kill them before me that I may not be king over my enemies" (Luke 19:27). Jesus told a story about the wicked king. In the Bible, Jesus did not support murder. He is love! After the Bible was wrong, they presented us with hate speech (fake-Christians). I do not think the information provided by most of the viewers will be inspected because they start thinking me = I'm not good for me or someone = hate it. This is pure manipulation of people. Please use your brain. Do not take all the facts they say in this movie. We want to destroy our civilization, our civilization, we have started to redeem Jesus and the message that he brought to us. You saw the seated branch.
