Linda Lovelace is a feminist adversary, Chuck Troyer's victim. I have sexual abuse with the dog (abuse of animals, as well) can be found as entertaining or funny. Linda Lovelace is a real prisoner of making these films. I know that some criticize this comment but I feel strongly that such films will fill the hateful fire and the more vulnerable feelings of women. This society continued to portray women as sexual objects against women. We call ourselves "civilization", but I think we have a long way to go before we go on to make fashionable surface lines.
