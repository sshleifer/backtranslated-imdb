This film is very little effort to make money using a music theme. I love Superman movies, but I want to shoot myself in this. Very poor acting, terrible special effects and zero equivalent plot. Scientists have discovered the fragments of his home planet, some find (duh) in space, before his departure does not know anything, a spaceship (?!?), Superman leaves the land again I feel five years later, and again looking forward to hooking up with her girlfriend (Now his son is razing, son of it, my humble beginnings Write at least 7 years of age). What about Lex Luthor? Are you trying to grow a new continent to sell the land? <br /> <br /> I will vote for 10 people for this film because I do not allow them to vote. If you have anything to do with your time, do not go to see this movie, and stay home and watch TV, even if you do not have anything else!
