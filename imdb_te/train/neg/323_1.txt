This film is not very bad, I can not get it done without some more. There is no plot and point. I was frustrated and did not recall the precious funny line of a joke or description for the film in retaining the comedian. <br /> It does not speak in technical terms. But how was it made? What quality control does the film have? It is only frightening to see girls in bikini in this terrible experience. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler is popular and is able to survive after this exposure. He is not the least funny in the film, so it seems to be a very important role in an effective comedy.
