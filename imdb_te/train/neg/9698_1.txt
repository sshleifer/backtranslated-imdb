Now there are a lot of talented filmmakers / actors in Germany. <br /> <br /> Why did the producers of the world invest money in this way? With this worst budget you can take 10 good pictures! It's not entertaining that the seven-year-old fledgling shepherd boy plays dwarfs. <br /> <br /> The film's producer (who is the oldest bunch of bunch) is a fun game for young dwarf. <br /> <br /> These films "need to laugh now!" It is very difficult to think this garbage is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Many people left the film to be released in a 30 minute film. <br /> <br /> I was able to do the same for my time wasting time. <br /> The pain!
