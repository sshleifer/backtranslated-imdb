I have some special special effects, especially at the age of 50. There's some beautiful catchy scenery. However, the film attempts to flirt with Anne Francis "Altair Morbius" all of the men with very little mute dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was fun to see Francis again in the 90s after a long time, as the film's release was mostly a television actress ... and still played. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see Leslie Nielsen (Dr. John J. Adams "), a young man whom I did not recognize for this voice. Before the boredom of the film, the film was almost excessive and I had a strong desire to sleep. I returned this VHS tape back to stereo. But weaker effort. This "dominance" is an overrated film that is considered "huge" and "thought-provoking". It's nonsense. <br /> <br /> The rest of the science fiction films are very stupid. <br /> <br /> If you look at the earliest sequences, this is the time of writing. Maybe another look - 2.35: 1 Widescreen Transfer This time makes me change this review.
