It means comedy but basically bad taste, and remotely does not make a smile in this movie. The film is about a couple trying to have a baby, and wince at the descriptions that portrayed those individuals in real life in that situation. For example the scenes at the breeding clinic are not the least funny and are quite frankly awkward. The man who works as a producer and his hard hat does not have a poor need to refuse from the Village People. The male lead is trying to look younger than 20 years younger than she is. Both leads come across as unclear, unattractive and totally unreliable. There are various ridiculous and totally disillusioned scenes in the film, for example with a budget airline, it's not funny. The reason I gave this 3/10 to 1/10 instead of 1/10 is a mark for Sherly McLainin, a class above the picture in the picture, and a half (old) though.
