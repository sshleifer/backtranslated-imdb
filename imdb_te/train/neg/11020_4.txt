Fred Olen Rey, Brink Stevens and John Michael Vincent, plus distributors The names in the "Rhino" and "Troma" video box will tell you what you are doing in this case. B movie mania! If you really are expecting a thriller "Edgar Allan Poe", then forget it and head straight for the Roger Carman 60 poo movies excellent series. This R-rated, ready-for-video sex and nudity is a fully completed, pure, neglected sleaze (with a pediatric attempt at a plot similar to "premature"). <br /> <br /> Brinke (who had three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes) was a great, wounded, insomniac housewife, Victoria Monroe, from her belief that the same fate had her father (Hoke Howell). Her brilliant husband Terry (Jay Richardson) brinks her money for some serious gambling loan (the debtor to Robert Quarry), with the help of her kinky, blonde, European-active sexpit secretary Lisa (Delia Sheppard). Name-value actress Karen Black Hypnotist (the most talented to portray such a minor role), 50 science fiction / horror star Robert Clarke is a good doctor and family friend and Michael Berryman performances and a live Vicky autopsy. <br /> <br /> John-Michael Vincent is mostly sitting outside a house in his home and enters Brinke and leaves home. Millions of kill-her husband-hench wealth plots before the end of the plot are accidentally laughing (the end of the juni fetish doll segment of the terrorist trio of the terror) and the head and head of the head of the head of the head of the FX created for this release Whoever is a bit of skills. Brink makes his character somewhat sympathetic to a somewhat sympathetic, but one of the biggest surprises is how the former penthouse Pet Delia Sheppard is in his role. She stole every scene in there and gave it the ease of functioning.
