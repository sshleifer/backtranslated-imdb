What are they serious about thinking? In the years the Colombo series has tried a few new things and diverted from the typical successful formula but this film really goes beyond it. The film is different from the other Colombo film but the differences are not good for the movie. <br /> <br /> The principal thing is that it differs from any other colombo movie. No murder is committed. The entire premise of the film is completely different, and it has a completely different atmosphere and condition in the role of Colombo. <br /> <br /> Director Alan J. Levi has done some of the other colombos in the past. <br /> <br /> He also chooses an odd choice to direct the film. <br /> <br /> The character of Colombo is completely different, after which the bridegroom disappeared after he is married and he helps his nephew. <br /> <br /> The absence of some honesty and trademark Colombo humor does not exactly make this good or pleasant watch. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, the film is not too bad, and with its story there's more scandal. Such a stupid written kidnap thriller became more and more impossible with a story. This makes the film more undesirable. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting little enthusiast, even entertaining its audience. <br /> <br /> Supporting actors are not very talented. Although his role is set in such a different situation, the film is completely different, but Peter Faulk is still better and his presence still saves the film somewhat. Can you imagine how the film can be shot without him? <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> 4/10
