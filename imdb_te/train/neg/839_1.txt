The only redeeming part of this film is the price I paid for. At least I lost $ 3.00 and it's time to sit by this bomb. A member of a continuation crew lost the boat. When the female lead and the FBI person went to the alleged killers, Mr. FBI handed the revolver to the woman. When the suspicious killer door is out, the revolver is automatically transformed into an automatic. Should a FBI watch a weapon with a hand by a FBP agent? I'm not. Ms. Javier is a very attractive woman. R rating is too bad for not to allow her to see her. The image editor seems to have cropped up what could be the best part of the image.
