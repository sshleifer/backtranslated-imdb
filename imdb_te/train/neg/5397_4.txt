I think this Kenneth Branagh is weak in Shakespeare's works. Much Ado About Nothing, etc. After such great efforts. I thought this was poor. The cast was weak (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McIllon ???) but my big stomach cut a few dramas to keep them in confused and boring musical / dancing scenes. <Br /> You do not play Shakespeare with play, then do not play. Sorry, that's wrong. I love some Cole Porter like the next person, but Geez, do not mess with Shakespeare. If you want to skip and see the excellent Shakespearean style of the tempest, see "Prospero Books".
