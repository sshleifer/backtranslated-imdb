I've read the Cliff's notes version of the Philip Kaufman Rabbit novel and I want to make this film. Well, that's not actually the original punch. The novels of Kandera are great because the concept of narrative is his manipulation, his ability to move into stories and stories that he has built. Do not try this movie too! A dream sequence of Terreza, which is so important for the atmosphere of the book, has been rebuilt and has no meaning. Even, and this is probably the lowest point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks very much in Ben Stiller in this (I know I'm not really a valid complaint, but hey). A perfect example of good literature for Hollywood.
