I read that in a short period of Peter Sellers, "There's a Girl in My Soup". I'm not surprised watching the movie. Nothing has happened in the film. Bizarrely, Sellers and Goldie Han will help a very presence picture; It does not. The whole picture appears as if the scripting has been shot randomly. <br /> <br /> I do not see every film of the elderly in the elderly who are trying to be hippies, but the movie gives such films a pretty bad name. <br /> <br /> All of these are directed by Sellers and Han. Better movies than this, so this does not waste your time. Pretty no work.
