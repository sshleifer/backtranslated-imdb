The film has been getting a lot of play lately on HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they are eager to compare it with Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks Capper with the same name. Attractive Matt Lattacy is the only reason to see it. Yum! Although I told Matt, Matt spent a long time in the tooth to be a top tutor. If he was a woman, they would have been playing the mother of high school! (Shila Duval started to look like his daughter?) Oh, the plot - who cares? Normal teen hijinks played by adults.
