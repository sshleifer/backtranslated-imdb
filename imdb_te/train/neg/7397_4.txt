I saw this film a number of times in small-film festivals and I saw a movie trailer. <br /> <br /> A school is well-produced and directed by the movie, but the story is a big and interesting picture. The role of Tim Wacher requires some in-dip approach. <br /> <br /> Previously, Portuguese is not in small films - the script is always surface. <br /> But still ... I loved this movie <br /> <br /> Parabens! (Congratulations!)
