Whenever the camera watches every day in the car they will go to the new way of the camera. As a scene, it is a lane residence with a walkway, followed by a divider with several lane highways, double lane along the two lane country road. <br /> I also read other reviews and did not agree that it is a bad image. If you are Paul Riser and his comedy fan then you can enjoy this movie. However, if you find his work / funny, I would recommend that I stay away from this.
