I wanted to see this film, but a tremendous humorous scene closed me after another. The character does not seem to respond to anything. Let's examine this: Heath Ledger one night (he believes through the cemetery) that he attacks the spirits, he leaves them away. Once this tedious past he walks away and meets a friend who sees all. <br /> <br /> "What would you do?" When asked, he "attacked demons, nothing serious", which is a bit more exciting than a flat tire. A monster or something, I stopped caring ques ion. The answer can be hired by the power of their death, and the priest looks obscure, when a man touches himself and is hanged, and they dive into his body and die for the question of the body. <br /> <br /> 0 * from the stars.
