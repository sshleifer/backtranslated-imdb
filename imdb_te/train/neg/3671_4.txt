The dull, predictable and unpleasant story of a person who was contaminated by a chemical ingredient (Weller) that traveled across the country to find his ex-wife and children; Meanwhile, he murders everyone in his way through a touch in his hand. On his dangerous track, the doctor (Hurt) and the young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The film does not have a true heroine, but it's good. The final result is only an image without suspense or cutting moments. Even good cast is completely ruined. I give this one 4 (four).
