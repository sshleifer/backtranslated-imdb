This film will hurt my mind. I looked at household writing emails and answered the phone - I only watched because I felt good as part of "revenge". Needless to say, turns of vengeance and forced stories are not valuable for emails. In fact, I'm not sure what happened at any end. This act is as bad as remasting scenes in the "FBI Files" program - so far, the worst remakes (really only "arrest and trial" may possibly be bad at laws). I do not know whether the leading figure is in Third Eye Blind until I looked up the movie here on IMDb, but why it's clear why he has not done any movies. I hope he is a good singer.
