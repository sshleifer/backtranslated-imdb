<br /> <br /> The story is imaginative - the film crew trying to shoot with the film horror film where murders took place. Three expectations are happening. This is not the whole bomb - cast is good for the best performances of John Ireland, Faith Domargue and John Corridine. It's well made for a low budget movie. Just do not expect any nudity, swearing, blood or gore (the image is very light PG rating). I never bored completely - it's ok looking at a quiet night. I saw it in the video - it's a terrible print - it's impossible to see very dark and some scenes. Still I did not hate it, it was a cool end to me - basically nothing ever happened to you, so it would not be a guard. It is worth watching only if you finish a horror movie.
