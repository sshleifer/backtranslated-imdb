I feel that this film has been missing some of the most important scenes from the beginning. There are errors and plots that are inadvertently stopped when they started. I was disappointed because Wip Goldberg & Danny Glover loved it, along with Danny Glover's respect for his roles, "Grand Canyon" is reliable, for example. I did not finish this film, after it seemed an eternity, but it was just a little over an hour; We had to stop it. There is no comedy, you have nothing to understand or sympathize with the characters, no emotional emotions about the film, and the past clips are poorly edited, confusing and unnecessary. Not a play for a movie & a comedy (I can be a comedy in this situation, but white people are getting out of leak and start acting like full idiots because it makes me laugh) of my $ 1 credit at the video store.
