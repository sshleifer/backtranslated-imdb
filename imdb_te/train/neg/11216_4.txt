Okay cinematic about a couple who are twinned with her twin twins in the back home. <br /> She knows she is looking for her sister and why she knows what happened. <br /> <br /> This is something that works almost the same thing. I can not really put my finger on why I did not work but I've kind of gotten better enough, or at least right little things that it would be better- size would be as close as having twins playing in the past. I think there's a lot of little things that seem to be wrong and that's what's wrong.
