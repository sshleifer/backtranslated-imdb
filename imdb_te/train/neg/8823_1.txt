This is one of the worst B Slashers I have ever seen in my life. <br /> Harry starts with Standing and Philip Standing. Their father's parents were sitting on the stairs looking at the chimney when wearing a Santa suit. He places presents under the tree, eats cookies and milk and pulls the chimney back. Phillip goes to bed but Harry arrives only to bring his father to sex with his mother in the Santa Suite. <br /> <br /> Harry goes up the stairs, bites a snow globe, takes the grass of the glass, and cuts himself. <br /> Then you move on. You will see Harry. He is a lonely man who sleeps in a Santa's suit and sees a small child through binoculars. He has two books. A book for good kids and other for bad kids. He writes everything they do in these books. The guy is a creep. He also works at the Jolly Dream Toy Factory. His brother Philip lives in a family and two children and a good home. <br /> <br /> When Harry realizes that he only cares about his employer's benefits, he goes and collects all the toys. Then, he goes to a church and kills 4 people. Then he goes to another house and presents gifts under the tree. The kids are holding him but they go back to bed. <br /> <br /> Harry goes to bed and kills his father. <br /> When he goes home, some children recognize him and run him. Parents are nervous and they do not get hurt and their children try to come back to them. How do they know that Harry is a killer? Certainly, you do not know who you are supposed to be suspicious. <br /> <br /> Harry presents children's presents and the father pulls a switch blade in an effort to cut him before the child. <br /> When Harry flees, he pursues him to kill the town's light teases. He is not even known as a killer. When Harry arrives at his brother's house, his brother and little talk of him and Philip voices him. He only loses consciousness. Philip lifts Harry back into his van. <br /> When Harry wakes up, he leaves. <br /> I can not believe the end. <br /> Once again, you have to look to believe it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That's right, the man in Santa's suit is a white man. <br /> <br /> They will skip and watch the quiet night Deathly Night and Santa's Slave. You'll get your money's worth seeing those two movies. They are better than this rubbish pile! I'll give this movie a star out of 10 stars. I give stars 0 stars for this movie.
