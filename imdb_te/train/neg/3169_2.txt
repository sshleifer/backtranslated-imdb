This film is one of the worst of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and acting is terrible. Paul Rudd which is of any kind of expertise, and not annoying. I've never seen Despardy Housewives, so Eva Longoria did not know how it was in the show, but she was terrible in the film. She does not know anything about acting. All her character is whine across the film, and she's not a b **** and still can not pull off the entertaining. And the other girl, Lake Bell, exhibits a little emotion and looks like you look at cue cards when she read them. <br /> <br /> For the story, it's cookie cutter. It's amazing from A to B. Can be used as a kite with a ghost. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
