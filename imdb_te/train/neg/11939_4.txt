I said something about this film. I saw it twice. For the first time I was a child and the movie was very fun. I really liked it. <br /> I thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was cool. <br /> I saw again a few days ago. It's terrible. Really. I do not know why I think it's funny first but now I'm not laughing. There is nothing even a little entertaining. It's just dumb. The story is weak. Acting is not unique. The film has great actors but still good acting. <br /> <br /> What is this film racist? Really. Do not get me wrong, I usually do not complain about racism in movies. But I complained about the lack of blacks in movies such as 'Shaolin Temple' or the only black guy in 'The Street Fighter' who was one or how bad guys were. Point. There are people watching racism everywhere. I'm wondering how to respond to the film like 'The Meteor Man'. Why? Why I said it. There are no Asians in this film. There are no white people among good people. In fact there is only one white person in the whole movie and he is the leader of the bad guys. All the good guys are African Americans. I do not care if a good person is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... I can not see white in this movie. This is the only film I have ever seen. It's not just realistic. Japanese people with 'Street Fighter' are the only people in Japan who have a black man. But if there is only one white man in the American movie - the majority of the Americans are white. It's a Japanese film portrayal with white actors and a bad guy is just one Asian film. Not true. <br /> That's true. I am giving the rate of film 4/10. If I can not enjoy a child then it will be 1/10.
