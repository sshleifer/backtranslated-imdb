I could not really sit by watching this movie, suppose it had a "good" message; The problem is that it is made explicitly according to a specific commentary of the book. An opinion, in my opinion, many people mislead. In addition, I am a film maniac and acting in this film is not entirely acceptable. I have always wanted to make a negative score to rate the film. So, if you want to declare continuously to those without power, then get this picture for everything. This commentary is also a warning to people who love or like skiffy because the title fraud many. This is an unfortunate picture, because the primary idea has the possibilities and the opportunities have been abandoned. The only redeeming quality of the film has made it realize that the character in the "Time Machine" probably has shown little moral fury at that odd behavior in his future.
