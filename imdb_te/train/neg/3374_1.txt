This film is considered some classic - I have no idea. It's ridiculous to be ridiculous. The grace to save only in this movie is that you have to distribute the worst kangaroo lines, and do not laugh at them, even if you have nothing. <br /> <br /> These songs are good songs and good choreography, but so what! There are no plots, the scenery is set in the theater without any change and Michael Douglas is always discouraging. My brother once forced me to watch this film because I believe how bad the movie is! <br /> <br /> I usually recommend that I have seen all the movies I read in this movie, but in this case you put every other evil image in the perspective.
