I respect the fact that this is very popular display. However, compared to Robert Altman's intellectual, hilarious, foolish, and sensational 1970s film music, this performance is probably the lowest-mediated ... even if it has not been 11 years old, it's a good thing. This performance is all over the most comprehensive part of my childhood (it runs every night and guess who's watching it and laughing at it), but this is one of the memories I did not miss. Now I see the movie, I give this series a perfect criticism. On its own, it is not bad from "10 to 2". However, there are no characters in this movie. Some of these are technically similar, but they are identical in name. For example, is Alan Aldada like Donald Sutherland? The style of humor like his character and outlook is completely different. New characters are not great; They can only help you miss what they're replacing. It is similar to the new actors (including Jamie Furst). The only thing that actually transmits the series is radar, though (though played by the same actor) is just a parody of the original. What else? Oh, yes. A laugh track (which does not matter whether it is surgical scenes or used), which comes across creepy, as it happens in other settings. As it has been nearly four times longer than the actual Korean war, it attracts audiences in this extreme temporary split that does not work outside the world of cartoons. I never liked this presentation, and I never wanted to.
