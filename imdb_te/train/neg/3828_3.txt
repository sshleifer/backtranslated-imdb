By 1976, the Western depleted genre and the filmmakers were clear. However, instead of protecting the project and save us from seeing it, they went ahead and did it anyway. Since the viewers need an interesting thread to see and see the film, they decide to be as violently and unlikely as possible. Hell, it worked for the wild bunch, so why not work here? However, the Wild Bunch has a tremendous script's profit but the Last Hard Men's script is plain old-fashioned worst. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston and James Coburn are harder to attract them. Related roles. Some of the escaped convicts led by violent exorcism (Coburn) will then play Heston retired advocate. <br /> <br /> When the daughter of Heston (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by looters and sexually degraded, the chase becomes even higher. <br /> This is a bloodthirsty image, top detail. It's really amazingly frustrating because the star sounds like a mouth-watering future. There is no pace or necessity in this film. It takes an eternity to go, but when the action finally arrives it focuses on nastiness. All in all, this might be a worst movie ever made by Heston. I'm sure one of the productions he hated to include in his famous CV.
