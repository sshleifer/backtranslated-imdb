Every picture from thirty to date, but if you look at the pictures of John Ford, you'll see more time than you see others. Grand Hotel is a modern drama. With Ford, there is always the hardest salesman of whose nobles (Abe, the Jards). Always some huge vicious high priority. Always poorly designed, awkward and clear scripts. This is no exception. This is just a sweet device to give a sentiment. <br /> <br /> I do not believe Lincoln will do what Ford will do here, I'm surprised that no states have settled by the complete morons settled here. Ford went to make good movies. It's bad but bad. This is completely false. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda is awkward with a fake nose. And no one from Illinois is 'S,' or 'Shonfef!'
