When I came to the film, I enjoyed a fan of "Jane Eyre". "Finally," I thought, "after the story of the author actually someone makes this book a movie." Wrong !!! If the cast was intended to run the director "Jane" he certainly succeeded. However, he can identify the person who works. Where's the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where is the novel's spooky suspense when laughter suddenly comes to light overnight? Where is the children's lightning shake and dance like his mother? Finally, why was the last plate changed? One of the wonders of the screenwriters actually read this book. No disappointment
