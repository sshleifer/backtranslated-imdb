The film, "Cut," is about some filmmakers related to filmmaking. It's a lot of "scream" molding, in a contradictory, self-suggesting horror film, at least for the irony of it, it's still a bad horror film, just like the one suggested for it. <br /> <br /> But it is not without its charms. Anyway, a charm. Molly Ringwald is awesome, spoiled, whale every minute of working with amateur Australian film crew. I believe that it is breathtaking, as she said that everyone who participated with the "cut" was fond of her work. <br /> <br /> Seriously, she was great for every sene, sulking or snapping pouting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "cut" some smiles, gore some buckets (which is astonishingly intimidating), and ultimately another bad horror movie.
