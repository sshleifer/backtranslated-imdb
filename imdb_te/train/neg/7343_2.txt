Did you ever know about Taiwanese horror movie? Or what the Toyvans film? Perhaps for a reason. <br /> <br /> When I read other people's thoughts, I look forward to some violence. And Gore, but not quite at all. Some blood paking and other lame stuff, you will be disappointed if you wait for graphic gore or any gruesome effects. They clearly do not use eel exploding and other things to their maximum power. <br /> <br /> There is nothing better about this film; Eel is a character that is not entirely black and some OK black magic spells like one. The plot is confusing and boring. The characters are thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror factor did not work for all, the horror thing was an Albino girl (it was not scary). It's the worst Asian horror film ever seen.
