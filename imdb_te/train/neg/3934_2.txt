The film came forward to see and the performance of these great actors. However, I was sad and disappointed in the entire plot of the script and story. David Duchovny, (Dr. Eugene Sands), "Connie & Carla", '04, in the story using his licensing drugs and risks to use drugs. Dr. Sands visited a nightclub and used his medical experience to help the injured customer, and Angelina Jolie, Claire, "Taking Lives", 04, was immediately impressed by Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton, (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsay", '04, Big Shot Gangster and all kinds of money and connections. While Timothy Hutton pretends to be a lot of scenes, he takes his mind out of his mind to avoid killing his gang members. Gary Dordon, (Yates), "CSI-Vegas TV Series" plays a great supporting role and portrays the real COOL Dude, a body guard called Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks gorgeous and sexy with her ruby ​​red lips that attracts a great attention from all men. This movie is not great, but it's not fun.
