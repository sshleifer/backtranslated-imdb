I went to a sneak preview in Austria. So I do not have the idea that I will see. The story is very simple. The film is very long, I believe it can reduce the story to 1/2 without causing any problems. Its kind of image can be seen in a boring night that you want to be bored! Ashton Kutcher is very good. Kevin Costner Okay. The film is about US Coast Guards, how they train, their life style and the issues they are facing. There are not many effects in this film. If you want to see it, you do not have to spend time with your money and movie. When it comes to DVDs it is more effective to see it at home.
