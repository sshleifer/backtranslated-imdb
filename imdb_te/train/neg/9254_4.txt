Renanise, Wow! The intellectual who brought us Hiroshima Moe Amour was a challenge to make French music enthusiastic in the 1930s. Early voice with old, romantic inter-titles is a nice touch. Then the camera door opens (like old hand crankers) in a black & white placard. The camera pulls back (or rather, up), suddenly showing us the surprisingly intelligent colors of an elegant table set for a tea party. It is in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the music starts. There is no connection to the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can not reproach the subtitles) 3 girls are a rather unassuming and unforgettable dude featuring an incredible chorus. These characters repel the door and replace most people who enter into a more forgotten song. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we can hear our first attractive conversation in a 15-minute film. <br /> <br /> Renois time, cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is that you want to clear the skeletons on the screen and clear the storm. <br /> This is not good. Why I said it. There is no acquaintance with any characters. We can not even see their faces half the time (Risnis is very intent on showcasing an expensive scene to take care of the original people before the camera). People stand on a stage like a moth around a lamp, and we can not focus on any person or plot for audiences. You have to take every episode of Brady Bunch and cram into a 2 hour movie. <br /> <br /> I'm camera techniques, lighting and scenery, I agree with the best of all. But is it enough to catch your attention for 2 hours? I'm not. Maybe tomorrow I will try to get to the end. Oh, I'm funny. There are some important things for me. I'm also sure. Skip this.
