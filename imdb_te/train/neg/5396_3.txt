If you're confusing Shakespeare's conversation, I commented that this film should not be seen. Unfortunately, this is true, because all the confusing conversations have this amazing drama, cut off and replaced with songs. I've read this drama and it's a lot of luck for it's recent presentation, which remains one of my favorite Shakespeare comedies, but this film will tell me that I like it. It is not only about women's roles, it's not only for removing the lesser women's contents, but occasionally commenting - it's a little hard to hear the Princess declare; "We are clever girls who make fun of our lovers!", Fun does not happen somewhere. The film was also damaged by the stream and removed many spectacular scenes, as they were later shown in their visuals and in modern vocabulary. In the end, a wonderful game, an odd feeling ruin, and sly cuts. Kenneth, I usually love what you do. What are you thinking?
