Image about surfers without any waves only worse than surfers without any waves. The movie is a big disappointment from the total number of minutes of surfing of footage struggles to reach thrillers who like surfing. <br /> <br /> One piece of life about Beechiv Surfers waiting for this story story. Perfect wave, but for no wave. J.C. (Sean Pertwe) is an elderly super surfer who engages with his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). To be happy with the woman he loves, just three old surfing friends can convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves in Bonnard. The trouble is, there are no waves up to the very end of the movie, so the story dissipates in the inclined legacy of what is happening on the most disconnected beach. <br /> Acting is more moderate. Sean Pertvi has some fun movements, but most of his acting is mundane. Evan McGregor is good for drug dealing, Bunch's most interesting and peculiar character. Perhaps the mysterious appearance of Terry has been transformed by Peter Gun, who transformed his subtle body into a gigantic scene. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy, but she did not have enough meat to play many roles. <br /> <br /> It is not so much for your opinion. I rate it as 3/10. This is a real beach bummer.
