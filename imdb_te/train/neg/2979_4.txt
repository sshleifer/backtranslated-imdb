"Gone With The Wind" is one of the most overrated movies in history. It is a film that loves moms, maternals and closures who go to movies once every five years. A zombie image, it blows. There is a shambling corpse in sight, and it is terrible light in the gore section. "Zombie 3", on the other hand, is more generous than the shambling corpses and its blood-over - so it's better than "Gone With the Wind". This is not even overrated. Many critics do not think this is the worst. It is, however, boring is not the worst. After stealing a terrorist virus, he falls when he is helicopter, and chemicals leak into the ground. The terrorist who exposed the dirt cloth, hid in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a meat-eating zombie. His first victim was a cleaning woman. Once she bitten, Lucy Fucci's hell broke the brand. For Fulsy's film, acting is much worse, the storyline is struggling with plot holes, and the gore is plentiful. The film, directed by Falco and Bruno Matte, explains its schizophrenic nature. It is intensely filmed, not properly edited, and the sound design is flat. However, it protects against the murders and its impulsive velocity. If you have finished one death is definitely worth it. Or "Gant with the Wind", is undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.
