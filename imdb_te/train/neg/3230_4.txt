Devil's experiment - I finished looking at the guinea pig. Although I have this film, a very good FX, good I guess, is not a good image. I honestly say that I enjoyed this movie. In fact, this is a surprising, realistic, twisted 43-minute torture, but I have found it to be very boring (and not as though I believe). Moreover, the scoundrels are very painful, when they talk and try to talk hard at all times, it is more likely to be destroyed (and I will agree there with some people there). I have now seen Guinea pork 1,2,3,5 One of the best guinea pork in my opinion is 2 - meat and blood flowers. I acted out of the great FX, the girl, other than the annoying Phu ** engine prostitutes, accustomed to say more about devil's experimentation, I give them 4 stars in the FX COS account they are awesome.
