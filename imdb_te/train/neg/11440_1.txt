Otherwise I was one of the worst movies I've ever seen - and I always mean it. My wife and I were bored in our minds within 10 minutes. Not to be boring, it's totally unreliable. Do not bathe together with women (non-lesbians) - or they do not kiss "unexpectedly". Brothers and sisters do not live together in their 30s and dance together and walk around in pedestrians in Central Park. Men do not recognize their wife and have never talked to her with a wife before the sister kissing the night before the wedding. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham may be the worst actress in today's movies. She laughs when she is crying and when she's next to her. <br /> <br /> She has a good role in her Boogie Knights - and it does not act. <br /> <br /> I do not have enough pressure on how this film is bad.
