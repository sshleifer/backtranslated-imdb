This is a live video death throat of the Trimester Series, consists of sixty inspired seconds (it will tell you when you look at it) and more than you can shake a stick and filler. The Tremors 4 is clearly depicted in a cripplingly low budget. Mojo has only special effects for only three or four minutes worth of worm-human-violence and desks. The poor, clich√©-spy cast and Hawknard's writing confirmed that the remaining hours and half of the Tremors 4 experience were at least fifteen thousand years long. Only hardcore will be able to sit through the depths of the fans, enjoy this picture very little. If you're not among them, do not panic.
