First, I said that the film is worth more than four stars. This 86-minute film has always appeared for 2 and a half hours for me and I have given four stars so it's not enough to sit down for me. <br /> <br /> A tourist resort in the forest areas of southeast Asia is just open and hiring locals. Trying to change the wildlife around "The Big Alligator River." Mother Nature god Kronana seeking revenge comes in the form of a big crocodile. But the creature and the main characters (photographer and resort staff) are not only concerned but also the locals are rubbing the wrong way. <br /> <br /> The film is a good music adventure and horror story with good music score and direction. But Alligator itself, the main attraction of the film, is clearly fake. Some of the people in the jaws are good but we have everything we need to look at. Some of the underwater distance scenes make it clear that an alligator Sweeney-doll that we really deal with can probably get you at a zoo souvenir shop. <br /> Maybe you are not a non-stop thriller, but a good illustration and a well-produced product. The creature is very fond of movies, which ends with a very high body count. It also has a good forest view. Acting was lower though, but was expecting it to be good, eh? <br /> <br /> It's much better than its recent American counterpart "Primewall" but there is nothing compared to "Jaws". But keep in mind that some points may not be submerged.
