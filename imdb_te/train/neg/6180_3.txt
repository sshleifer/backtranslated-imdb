<br /> Last night I took part in the Premier League. You are not eligible to make movies because you have directed a ton of music videos. The film has rare, worse angles, and temporary shots that create terrible lighting. Editing did not help this confusion. <br /> <br /> In the memory of "Dixie" lately, her mother talks about her hand, but it is not clear what she is talking about. <br /> Plots promised, but the script is packed with thin and Ford truck sized holes. We have never come to understand what drives the drive, and they are really at each other, or how they have resolved. Sixteen years have been wiped out in 4 days. Deep conversations have been hit by stupid clicks. (In fact, the whole town was a big clich√© of southern life.) Toby "had your blood runnin through your veins Gull" half the audience inspired Toby ... and we once treated a fair line, but twice! <br /> <br /> "I'm stupid and stupid" <br /> <br /> Acting does not take into account the destruction of the script to work. Toby is quite a picture of darkness and bruding, but when he smiles and lights he is beautiful. It's a shame he does not have more screen time. Kelly Preston's acting chaps are pretty rusty and it shows. Lindsey Hahn was a talented and she did not see her role as a writer, initially she did not play the role, and I can not blame her father for her. Burt Reynolds and Tes Harper were able to make more of this film but looked more or less lost. <br /> <br /> They lose their roles in the film. If you're a Toby fan, you love songs. But often considered a scene in the film, so they were able to present one of his songs - or artists on his record label. For example, the film's official love song "Crash How Tonight". I think you will play a soft love scene, but do not ... listen about 45 seconds, he's going to a memorial service. As they say, "Well, we've used this song somewhere". <br /> <br /> The movie is a "Broken" song and the best thing from this movie. <br /> In summary ... a good plot is not fully developed and the film is awfully uneven, a vehicle for Toby Keith's music and production placement for Ford Trucks. It breaks out of broken bridges trying to get the power of music going from about people but the story is said poorly because two points lose this overgrown music video. I'd like Tobin and really wanted to be like "Broken Bridges", but he gave up the figures for him to make this film and one of the most famous boots you know where you are.
