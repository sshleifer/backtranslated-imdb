What's wrong with this picture? Many, many things. Editing is very difficult to look good, and the viewer does nothing but confuses him during his / her supply with a powerful headache. The plot is small and clear since the opening of the story (film or movie). The plot only made less than ten minutes, and it was painfully extended until it reached the minimum length for a movie. We know what we do for all of them. Exactly. They are thinner. In the end, the plot is just a piece of paper, you may not even see it, if you do not take care of it, it's hard to see this movie. Acting is not a little impressive. The characters are poorly written and dull and uninteresting. One of the misinterpretations of the film is obviously the ones responsible for the score / soundtrack who do not know what the film is about, or what it thinks (I do not blame him, but it will figure it out). As a result, half of the music in the film is not suitable for the scenes. Moreover, what is with Eliza Dush and all the sexual elements between the main characters? Naturally, this could attract younger men, but it was very cheap. Are there any scenes from the first scene? Which priceless level? At all Both creepy guys do not seem to have anything to do with the image at all, they are just in order to have some chase scenes. I suspect that nobody really enjoyed the movie. Some people are interested in such a shameless and awful Hollywood effort. But I'm turning. I recommend this to younger people who do not mind a bad horror thriller because some people have sexual relationships (although I am the only real killer cut). 1/10
