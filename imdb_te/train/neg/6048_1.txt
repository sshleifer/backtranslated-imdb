Be discouraged as much as possible (I hope you said under IMDb guidelines). French effort attempted to understand at least European influences and attempted to complicate the traditional view of the American police detective, which was discovered by Frederick's difficulties, Americans and general aggregations. The 1960s (relative) massive boom (particularly Nouvelle Bluff) allowed the European filmmaker's influence in Hollywood. This gave new energy and complexity to the weary media, the best of which (e.g., Boney and CLYDE, Early Scorsese), was a new repression for learning. The original connection is part of this move, its difficult distant style and anti-detective person. Both are American values ​​re-opening the right-hand corner of old Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film is filmed in France in the United States of America's most failed American diagnosis. For example, TWO is shot as French police. In French films, when they neglected the greatness of American films, and in a sense, a warning against Gallic speculation. This can be seen in a sample of two images. There are French gangsters who attack New York with the French style experienced by American style thrillers - which lead to the cancellation of a detective's person, and the difficulties of the plot - the body has passed away. <br /> <br /> Two Americans returned to France, with the American thriller values ​​imposed on the local generation - the power of the detective is reaffirmed and traditional clarity has been achieved. <br /> <br /> Doyle's relationship with the French Inspector Bartolmith is more dramatic when he is supposed to be dominated by the story. <br /> <br /> The two follow the original by suppressing its detective hero. In the beginning, Doyle's significance at each turn decreases. Although the connection was over, he was considered a hero. But he is an American in a foreign country, and his inability to control the language or customs means that he does not dominate the plot. He also misinterpreted police signals, killing a person who provided information to a criminal and kill him. <br /> <br /> When Daiyey watches the scenes after being filmed by many charioteers, to see and understand a body, body). In the connection, he prompted action, chasing criminals, forced the plot; <br /> <br /> The loss of this fragmented energy is estimated to lose its gun, and the film is a depressingly familiar ODAPP trajectory. In heroin scenes, he comforted an elderly woman who looked like her son. His anesthetic situation is returning to the stomach, spoiling adult pressures. <br /> <br /> Oedipus was the first detective, and to avoid his fate, Doyle must reject this false mother. Who can melt his unified identity and kill the father (charniar) and thereby take up his accepted male character in society. In the 70s, academic theory has become popular in academics (contrary to a French, inspired by Jacques Lacon), but it is literally rare in the film. <br /> If these facts are all about Doyle's minimization, then there is no style of film. Fredkin has focused on his heroicity and has abandoned his hero by refusing empathy or character motivation. Here, Doyle is a very traditional Hollywood hero. <br /> <br /> Without a long narrow shot, the viewer can familiarize with and understand the traditional instruments - connecting point-to-view scenes, close ups and shots. Fall and rise of Popeye Doyle. It is a simple hackman performance, in which the plot is forbidden. Cold Turkey scenes, therefore, are not disturbing, despite their tediousness. We are allowed to share and not share cold; This is a very uncomfortable experience. The scenes are also very American that lachrymose shot through manly penalties. <br /> <br /> When Jean Pierre tried to convey CONNECTION to imitate the complex thrillers of Melville, both had full opposition. Melville's LE SAMOURAI is a whole, powerful gangster who has started powerful language, and finally breaks his chart. Begins with two separated characters, achieved by incompatibility in the two linguistic languages, which leads to the exterior of the exterior language moving out - the ultimate action sequences do not apply much. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the detective is stable and negligible, but the language is important, but he is able to recover his power (his gun returns, and the emotional burning weakness of the Primal site, the Tower Black that Charnier holds him), the Marsellis arrangement It turns out and happens somewhere, it becomes stand-off mythic. Compare the ends of the two images: one agrees with ambiguity and despair, other accurate accuracy. <br />
