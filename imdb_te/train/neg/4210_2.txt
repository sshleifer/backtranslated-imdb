Richard Tyler is a little boy who is scared of everything. He does not like riding his bike or climbing on his tree, because he knows what kind of accidents he might have. So one day he is walking on his bike and it rains, and he decides to wait in the library until it rains. The whole story takes place there. He has experienced all kinds of staff and in the end he is no longer afraid. But the whole story is unbelievable and better actors like Macaulay Kulkin can not do better than the story.
