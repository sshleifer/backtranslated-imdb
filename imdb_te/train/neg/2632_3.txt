My favorite actors, locations and genres, such as Douglas, Sudhirland, Washington, DC. And it's hard for me to rate a lot of movies with political thrillers, but 'The Sentinel' is really low. As they got a great idea before, the right cast was signed and had some great city shots and then took leave for letting the rest of the staff improvise. I feel like one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I'm still steam more than a decade, and she's just the same, and definitely the only actor in the film to win an acting Oscar for 'LA Confidential', but she's not the only problem. Sutherland, who loves Jack Bauer in '24 ', once again plays Jack. I will lose his old 'A Time to Kill' or 'A Few Good Man' Days. Douglas definitely took a break from acting and made a phone call in this conversation. Plot: Someone, the Secret Service barrister, the president is dead and Douglas (haphazard). Does anyone believe in him? Actually, there's no spoiler here: they come through that subplot half way quickly, it's just before you know it. And why is anyone (s) dead with the president? Should it be revealed in the sequel? Many plot holes, many doors opened and closed and most speculative 'The Sentinel'. If you see only one film per year, you do not know who you are moles, but when you look at some of these films or a 'Law & Order' episode, you're in the first few frames. Is it awful? Not really, cinematography is good, and even if Sutherland is playing Jack back, he still has it.
