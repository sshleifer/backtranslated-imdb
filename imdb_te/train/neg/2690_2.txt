If you spend hours for killing and painting, hey you will be very excited. If you like cheap b-movies like me, it's good for a smile to laugh! Besides, I can not suggest you rent, wait until 4 am on your cable / satellite supplier's free access channel round 4. By the way, the soundtrack band was on the road two years later, and they alerted me that they were just as bad as the two small town reviews I found. Once again, it's nice to see how not to paint a low budget movie if you look at the grass grown up.
