I wanted to know more when I rented this movie. I put my queue on the basis of her strong relationship (IMHO) as Heather Graham and actress. Some parts of the film are lovely, but most of the film is contrived, undeveloped, or just boring or predictable. I do not care how big the twin story is, so many people think it's a pair of ICK factor, it's still a bit, Um, grass. And for Charlie, a zoo, she certainly does not look like signs from other homo sapiens. What about her (who along with her hotness and some common interests) made her the Gray bust? This story may be more interesting with some more depth. If there are great dancers like mamshannah (i agree with her annoying finder reviewer on occasion), dancing in cabbie, and dance sequences (Sam & Gray, if I want to see more of that, the bits we showed are really better than the rest of the picture). May be good.
