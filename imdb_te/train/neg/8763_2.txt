I felt like this was the last monogram product, but it is not true, it does not matter because it does not matter. This is a deadly slow affair featuring John Cordrine to make himself appear as an old scientist who experimented with his young apprentice (Robert Shayne) to kill a dead life. Every time their people are restored, they have a white face like marble when they tie the laboratory table (big deal). After his death, Caradine manages to restore his loyal dog life, and the mat gets an unusual ability to walk through the walls in a ghostlog fashion (who ooooooooohhhhh). <br /> <br /> For an ultra-cheap monogram haste, this fact actually utilizes a more fancy-sculptural lab setup than what is actually assigned. The joky "old" physician Caradine in the film is constantly referring to his "young" assistant Shayne "m'boy", in fact, when Carr√©dine was actually 40 and Shaye was 45!
