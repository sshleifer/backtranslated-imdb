The film is a mix of action and horror with humor and drama, a unique way to induce audiences rather than a particular horror film. Unfortunately the storyline, frustrating storytelling, and contradictory scenes Unfortunately, this film is basically disappointing and rarely a "great monster movie." <br /> <br /> Start with good stuff: comedy, acting and special effects. From Get-Go, the film starts at a faster pace and cheeky. Early scenery - the origin of the monster - campy and quick, pay tribute to the classic 'ecological' disasters that gave birth to so many other demons. The pacing is fast, which allows a welcome break from the long and often pointless dramatic opening scene from other monster flips and jump right into the image action. Within 10 minutes you'll be ready for 'why', 'where,' and 'how' beast and action. <br /> <br /> Another small and well-portrayed sequence is introduced to the characters: the lone son and his innocent little girl, Rati grandfather, and talented sister (aunt) and, of course, the monster. The characters are introduced in the context of each other and their clashes are instantly clear, allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster suddenly appears to be destroyed in the river where they live and walk. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The effects of the organism are both fun and awkward, but it is ridiculous, and at any time in the picture you can see 'strings.' The movement of the monster also moves, linoleum on the audience is a rising and exciting ratwiler on monster barrels, slipping on surfaces, suppressing and eating in its path. Family and tragedy meets the path of the monster It really is a painful moment, and you feel you need a vengeance but begins to break out of the appeal of the film out of appeal. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the dynamite the image quickly loses sight and continuation. Plot-lines were introduced, later subsequently canceled, and the characters changed their position without appearing, and the comedies could dramatically change the dramatic scenes, the barriers appear and randomly disappear. <br /> <br /> For humor, let me say this: I agree that humor is very cultural. I do not know much about Korean humor, so things have gone into translation. However, in the last 5 years (still here) in a college in Japan and an Asian study in Asia, I think there is a better understanding of Asian humor than the average white-guy. I thought many parts of the film were funny, but I was not saying it was not me. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: The smallest daughter lost after the initial attack was the cremation ceremony; Everyone is grieving. Introducing a new character - a brother - and the tension grew more and it becomes clear that the two brothers are different from one another. Both of them started grieving for their loss and who are competing with who they are grieving. The competition, at its core, was funny: the two brothers each other competed for funeral - it shows the primal nature of family love in Asian comedy. This delicate slap-stick comedy family is entertaining and customary mourning is considered to be fun, but there is really nothing in the case of a lost little girl. ************** END SPEEDER **************** <br /> <br /> Then the plot holes come in. There are many points described in this film that are never, or worse, explained, and have been proven to be absurd and nonsense at the end. An obstacle to finding an obstacle is not a good thing for a character, but you'd expect some comment on that nature. When the problems are not 'just', the moments of the anti-climax climbs have become barriers and no one has ever begun the problem. I'm asking you: why are you taking the first place? <br /> <br /> The film has been released due to problems that led to new problems, and suddenly the film's world is filled with unmanned rival forces. The introduction of new and more problems is a time-tested story of tradition. However, if the new arc enters another, you may at least expect the new arc full description. This is not in the picture. <br /> <br /> Many stories, each just 20% explained, and do not get to complete. <br /> Again, this could be very 'cultural'. Perhaps in its Korean story - telling the tradition to keep humor within a tragedy. It's simple to tell stories of children outside of each page, but not one. Maybe it's okay to show a problem to develop the plot, but obviously, remove the problem randomly without any obvious solution or catacis. Or perhaps there are all the features of the sloppy work and the prevailing storytelling in an image that has a better reputation than this meaning.
