By 1973, "Walking Tall" is a real-life drama around Tennessee Sheriff's Buffford Pussar, but this installment is a slow TV-like movie. Bo Swannon plays the lead role in the role of Joe Dan Baker, but he is very soft for the episode; He gets out as a pornographic country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Richard Jake, Luke Ask and Robert Ducue are among the few who do good supporting actors. I definitely give a good actor on its good intentions, but the screenplay is transparent and lazy mass of generic transparencies and the product is cheap. "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" in 1977 and the 1978 television movie "A Real American Hero".
