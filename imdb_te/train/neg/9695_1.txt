Warning! Do not even consider watching this film in any form. It's not worth downloading from the internet too. Every bit of pornography is more substantial than this waste piece of celluloid. It is not known how to do the movie called filmmakers. They could not tell good joke to save their lives. It is an insult to any human being. <br /> Let's assume this is Mr. Mr. Unterwalt ("Jr." is a good sign for his vivid experience and intellectual infant). A slow / painful death and never makes a film. <br /> In fact, there is also a waste of time writing anything about this trash, so I will stop now and watch a good movie.
