Hey Arnold! Slow and slightly boring image. The plot is not very creative. The role of Paul Sorvino (Shenk) buys weakness and low-cost buildings to build a large soul, shopping complex and office buildings. The plot goes to many of the 1960s children's films. That's tasty. Paul Sorvado is not too exciting, so the evil guy is not too scary to come up with him. Gramps is reminded of something about a historical document, and the rest of the part is about the past 36 hours that the document with the help of Arnold and Jamal Helga should be found, whose father is hoping to become a great thanks to Shakes Mall. Children have to move around the town in buses, so the bus is not just silly, but it's written for a very small child. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to the adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster than this movie. Hey Arnold is a good way to keep anyone, including film, about five times more wrist, and sleep kiddies. Hey Arnold is a tough one to stay awake to an imaginative and completely boring finish. This is the same if you want to send your children to a totally dangerous movie. Instead of trying to make a 90-minute film, the producers tried to launch a 30-minute TV cartoon script and expand it for 90 minutes. This mall story is definitely covered in a TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold would be a good writer if a sequel was always there.
