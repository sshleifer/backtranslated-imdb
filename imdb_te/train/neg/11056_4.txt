I was disappointed in this film. I do not know much about the true story, so it's interesting to see how to play in the movie and get a little slice in history. It was a perfect combination of such a powerful true story and great actors. Well, somewhere the screenplay failed them. It is very scattered - this film about his childhood? His love life? His own disability? Ability to talk? His hobby for the disabled? I think there is a way to get all of those stories into a good story, but this is not the movie. I'm looking at the dangers of unforeseen characters because of their disabilities, but because of their personalities. Other small grips: 1. Heavy-hand soundtrack. It's the seventies - we already get it! 2. If he is an outstanding public speaker, why do not we treat more than a snippet here and there - and even then in more montages?
