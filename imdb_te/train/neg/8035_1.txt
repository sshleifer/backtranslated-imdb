This is one of the worst horror films I've seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror movie buff and it's t.v. When looking at the box it says it's R to Gore and some language ... where is the gore? Have you seen a good death scene that really gore? I do not care if there is some brief nudity or some good dialogue. There is not a remotely witty or fun line in this thick film. Horror movies are awesome because sometimes it's stupid, but this is just sad.
