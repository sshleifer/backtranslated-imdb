The first cruel intents, original, is my favorite movie from time to time. It's a perfect piece. So they can no good result on earth. Sarah Mitchell Geller is perfect in the first film. This one, Amy Adams sucks. She is terrible. And did they actually find a chick that looked like Sarah Michelle Geller? At least the same color color !!! I will come. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he is absolutely awful when compared to Ryan Phillippe. Sebastian's first film is deviant, fraudulent, and is much worse than Sebastian in Preabel. And what's up with the story line. <br /> <br /> Sebastian has a bad reputation in his first school, so the film is nothing about him and his dating career, the girls 2 Sebastian New York moves, and suddenly decides to turn it around. In the original, Sarah Michael Giller said, "You ever broke with my beloved first guy, because I was in love with the prequel. <br /> <br /> When he's milking his chick, his father completes <br /> <br /> "I am so engrossed in this film that I am better than this prequel hope .
