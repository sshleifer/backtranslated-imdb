I had to look at this school. <br /> <br /> Talentless actors, talented script, and talented director. <br /> <br /> This film is such a waste of time. Do not look at the movie. No trouble. You will be disappointed. My teacher thought it was good. How wrong she is She had a little sleep. The actors are just bad people. The best actor out there is an old man and does not say much. It has awful stories with awful characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly say it to any point. The script is unemotional and confusing. When I turned my eyebrows, "What?" In this film, there are points. There are also very loose ties and plot holes. It's just horrendous.
