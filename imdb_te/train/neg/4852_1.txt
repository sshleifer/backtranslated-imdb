I saw this film once, and I thought it was okay. Then my friends at work said, "Look again, it's fine." I did. And to my surprise, it is Worse for the second time! The word has a limit, so I'm going to roll the ball. <br /> <br /> All the stupid baths in bomb scenes. Why does someone wate on the ground to wag the trigger ??? - None of the characters here are also remotely liked. <br /> Not for the first time, the last time I checked a car does not explode or fire from gunfire. Small firefighter ... Top 3/10 viewers actually watch the movie ??? - The camera is so shaky, I can just tell you what's going on. <br /> <br /> The opening scene with the robot turned off my stomach and the rest of the film was not much better. <br /> Sniper scene. McManus Brothers (from "The Bondo Saints") put their eyes together and became stupid. For the first time, why did a person shoot his gun? Why did he spend time with cleaning, reloading, targeting bullets, and confusing his surroundings? -Sas types staying back and running back instead of implementing ah ????? Soldiers ... gay ... ??? I do not understand the sounds of homosexuals, but honestly, the scene is very ridiculous. <br /> <br /> For a long time it will be short for its own good. Biglove feels more and more fun and better. She's mistaken - the film is filled with over-the-scenes action scenes to diversify your attention from the lack of central motion. I know Watchmen is over 163 minutes long, but at least that movie is not dragged. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> This image, on the other hand, but do yourself a favor, just skip this, and do not give into the hype.
