I did not see much television and came across this show. Realistic event? I'm not true, it's not true. I am a person, if you have such a nag, if you marry him, it will cause divorce. I think she is a bad example of how I treat a person they love. It's bad with our world, many people in bad relationships do not know what they're selfish and really love someone else. It is not something to be self-sacrificing and merit. What's in private counseling is that it does not feel good. If his personality is true in this program, he will show true true love and care and who he deserves and deserves a good person. Was this for a reality show or ratings? I really want to know. Sincerely, GB
