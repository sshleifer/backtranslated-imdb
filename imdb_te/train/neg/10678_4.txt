This film is good - good cast, evergreen item and explosion opening. It went down from there. Why is the hand painted with the camera? It shakes, judges, part sees the scenes and makes the viewer confusing. In fact a poor choice. If this is not enough, the smallest edition of memory assumes a drugger viewer - it is mandatory for you to have any happiness. And it's all the worst sin. All sorts of incomplete and unsustainable scenes to the airy state, leading to the viewer, they share credits without disclosure - end - payment - what the heck is inspired? How can you expect that you can succeed by doing thrillers without ending? DOH! This film is a great promise and ending doing a face plant in mud. What effort is waste. The writer and the director are very sad.
