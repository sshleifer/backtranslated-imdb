Pamela Springsteen did not drop acting to be a full-time photographer; It was a better idea to have her behind a camera than a front. Although the film is not without its interesting elements (from hell to mullets, etc.), it overcomes the defects. One reason is that Angela, the murderer of the murderer, seems to be at the same age. The old, more bullying camp director will do a lot for the film. And then you have murder scenes. The budget is fairly small enough to run them (the pun is not intended), but it is sure to drown out in the out-of-the-house toilet. But overall, there are a ton of movies out there that are funny to watch / watch an hour and half in your life.
