What we need! Another remake of Vidya Hollywood movie to Eddie Murphy for the second time after Vintage Professor (1996)! This shows why we are running out of a quality film, special ideas in doing ladies and gentlemen! It has some hopes for the likes and happy images of people who speak and speak with humans. Things can get worse, much worse. Bathroom jokes and sexual references instantly kill this "family" funfar. The parents and children also saw the trailer ad on The Family Channel, and then there was absolutely anxiety and disgust at the film theater. It is sad to say that it is a very early pre-millennium period, but enjoy it when enjoying it. All new drops have been made more wrong. Dolittle. It is completely flatless, feeling completely flatless. I also hate the irritating vocal of Chris Rock! We need more talented voice-overs than a group of people who do not want to declare bankruptcy. I gave my local newspaper in 1998 in the top five worst films. Then the original version is not good. Murphy's next project may be Patton if he is not careful!
