Decci is one of those newly produced independent productions, but it lacks all the common errors that sink to such films. It is a perfect story, it has enough acting, photography is very good, both heroic and bad guy both heroic men, and background music is not overdone. This is a DVD new release, so people are watching here to see if it's worth it. This film is not good - if you're a film producer's mother, I do not know where 10 people came from. <br /> <br /> The last film we have seen in the theater is the worst of Order of the Phoenix of Warner's J J Rawlings's most beloved and fantastic book. Think of the PHOENIX (made by Warner) story with PHOENIX with DECOY, no acting is allowed by the director, the photography is terrible, and the wall of sound overlaying musical score is just a confusing. The level is not low because I rated Phoenix a "1". <br /> If you have a chance, give Deco a chance. Remember, this "decade 3 - shootout" or not such nonsense. It's original. If your expectations are not exaggerated by fools "10", you can enjoy its own terms.
