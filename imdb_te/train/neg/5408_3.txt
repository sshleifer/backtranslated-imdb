This review is a lot of spoilers. <br /> Do not read this review. <br /> There is a TV tv problem these days. It was all encouraging and frustrating. `Wow, that's fun, is not it? 'That's not it. And unfortunately it also expanded to children's films. And what is 'flight of reindeer'? <br /> <br /> In a few years, I did not see the 'flight of reindeer', but I would be hazardous at some point, but by that time it was completely incomplete. <br /> <br /> In particular, a lecturer who is given a book for Christmas. Now, the lecturer is a respected scientist with some animal's flying habits. I think bulls. However, by this book, Mr Lecturer / Family Man Reindeer learns to be exactly the same as the bull. Apparently this book wrote a scientist several hundred years ago disappeared from the North Pole. Now, if it was me I would have thrown out the book near the window. A naturally occurring phenomenon with flying bulls, but reindeer flying is an amazing and completely unrealistic feeling. But I do not know Mr. Lecturer, so he decides to go to the North Pole where he wants his wife and boy to go home. In fact, things will be curled up and before he can learn it, a flying reindeer crashes into his personal plane and is alone in the North Pole. <br /> Do you still follow this? <br /> His family, in fact, was destroyed. I will be very much, I mean, what a sucked-tacular Christmas. Elsewhere, Mr Lecturer finds himself in a secret town in the Middle Pals and the North Pole, who lives as a tyrant who only wore red and white. Soon I will try to escape, as I do, he greets everybody there with open hands. Midget monsters this secret civilization, and he greets them with open arms. Oooo-kayyyy. They are the ghosts of Santa Claus who eat this story and spent the year together making dolls that they do not make dolls. And Mr. Lecturer agrees. He also agrees that the Santa Claus actually accepts the scientist or disappeared two hundred years ago. There is only one problem - they do not want him to leave. The world does not know about their secret existence. <br /> <br /> Previously, before they get to know, each street corner has a McDonald's and a Starbucks. The book and assume he was gone to the North Pole. If the boy realized they had gone for a brisk walk, would not they be embarrassed? Before the audience know this, they go back to spend a lot of authentic winter landscapes in Christmas. Meanwhile, Mr Lecturer decides to get sick of all uppity midgets and leave. I can not recall correctly, but I caught him gun and sat down with Santa Claus. A fire fight takes place to escape through Santa's sleigh when the Midgets are attacked. Santa is hot on his heels and with his darkest eyes, Mr. Merritt flies along with his family's plane, looking for him through some incredible co-existence. <br /> In reality, there are some shocking films that have been named after Christmas in a few years, but they will stay away from that festive charm. And it's not quite wrong with that charm that's totally absent from 'flight of reindeer'; There is nothing insulting the intelligence (well, obvious, but it is a child's picture and is away with such things) or anything that is specially offensive, but the problem is not quite right. It just does not fail Krismassi. And for a movie for Christmas, it's a pretty major flaw. But hey, I'm thinking of the heart of the target audience of the reindeer. Why are they <br /> They are mummies' they can not spell on Christmas. <br /> I'll give you ten dollars. If it's a TV-movie, I've included two more stars on it. We know how bad they are.
