Back in 1967, some director about the Galaxy did not know far or near. He is trying to complete a movie with the title THX. This small remanufactured history of a particular gorge. Sorry, it only cuts to protect. It's just an advertising campaign for the director, actors and others. Al. It has a low internal artistic value. This is a brochure. The role of Lea's character, Lia's character, and the character of Erst Dart is very good. Everything else is plain trade. No waste. Even so, it's got the job I expected. The rest of the film is running water to kill the time I expect. Brochure only.
