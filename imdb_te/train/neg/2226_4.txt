DD movies have a plot of horror, damn stupid and thin layers but those days are at least one plot <br /> <br /> The film is not just a comedy, drama, romance everything is mixed <<br /> <br / > Every movie drama will break in the scene. <br /> <br /> The comedy is funny but brown. <br /> <br /> David Dhawan is doing okay and music is okay. <br /> <br /> Govinda is a good part of comedy and drama Karisma. Prem Chopra Titiscast is a hilarious force
