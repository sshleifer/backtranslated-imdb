I did not want to call this film a film - it's a movie that won any awards. Acting as silly scenes is terrible. This is exactly a lot of folks an NRI. But it is actually away from abroad for its overturn and overwhelming sense of "trying" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that many actors with English language have such a difficult task before their camera. Many readers know what I read - all of those token English films, in Hindi and movies, threw into a film in regional films. There are some Indian movies that are totally English - Cyrus is one of the most recent. Even though it is not a great movie, it does not seem to be "good" and good language. <br /> <br /> In 2005, I was disappointed that the N3 award was awarded to P3. These semi-enjoyable parts are Konkana and a slightly impressive background score. Besides, do not waste your time with this movie.
