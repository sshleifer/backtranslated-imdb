Pare is an idiot, but he knows about it and works as a consequence. His life is totally boring and he does not know how to change it. His last friend, Nico, dies. He feels totally empty and he decides to go out drunk. When he returns home, he will fall with a girl who will bring advertisements. Although she neglected him, he fell in love and began to follow her. Well the film is a bit slow to begin with, and a boring result for most people. However, the best part is 5 seconds sex (about 30 different scenes) you can see in the movie, which is probably best for fun, but funny and unexpected scene. No actors or directors It is not good, and the result is a boring picture that brings out some funny results I like Ventura Pons, but it's not one of his best movies (probably his worst!), Based on the facts (idiot, cinematics), it's interesting.
