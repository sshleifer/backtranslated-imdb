At least the third remake of the film, if you look at it, do not be surprised by Daisy Vu's. The change of all the stories they have changed has been changed and contradictory, but the differences are not important. This is not good because it starts with the platform. This will never work. <br /> <br /> This is a unique feature that can be a surprise to anybody who has seen the film before. If the film ends ten minutes ago, it worked very satisfactorily and I thought it was more valuable. But the offense is not paid here because the spoiler and finally the offense. I'm never like a movie from this movie.
