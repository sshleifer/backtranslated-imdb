Did MGM think that it was a good idea to keep Clarke Gabe in the role of a Salvation Army worker? Ironically enough, another beautiful future star, Carrie Grant, also played a Salvation Army personally mistakenly just over two years later when she done herself over. It's easy to see the stupidity of these films, but I still feel that the Salvation Army guys are "hot" and I'm still surprised to see these dashing men and see realistic representations of the parts they played. Long ago, I worked for a sister company of the Salvation Army (Volunteers of America) and I did not see audiences working there (unfortunately for me). Instead, I got a job with the Salvation Army. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </
