I felt very sad, especially I saw great touching and tear-loving movies. But for this one (which surprised me!) And it's really surprising for most people to see this film very much appreciated. <br /> <br /> There are many disturbing facts throughout the movies: 1. Ben-Riden's intention is to protect the lives of 7 lives to free his past despite the guilt, and I'm concerned that the film promotes suicide. <br /> <br /> The two people think this is an adventurous act, while others are like him cowardly I think it's acting, it's a disaster for me. <br /> <br /> Film story is highly-dramatic, but logic is quite simplified. Medically, the blood type should be the organ donor. We learned that the film was over for Emily to be bloody, limiting her chance to get a donor over a short period of time. Nevertheless, Ben was considered to be a rare blood type, which allowed her to be her donor and comfortably, although he was rare in Ben's blood, he was not only his heart but his kidney, but all of the cases are blood-like but the tissue antigen only . <br /> <br /> Why do doctors allow Ben's organs to donate even though Genie Fish is a tragedy? <br /> <br /> I have analyzed the whole story as a hero before. However, some of the undesirable facts mentioned in the hope will help you review your plan to see this film. If you go for the soap-opera image, go for it. But if you go for a clever entertainment and give it a miss!
