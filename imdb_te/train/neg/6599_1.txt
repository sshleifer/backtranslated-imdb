George C. Who is Scott? George C. Scott is renowned actor. The picture that he practically has is that good. <br /> <br /> George did not do anything but irrespective of the film, but he once told the film a tie. <br /> <br /> I do not recall his exact words, but he mainly said that the Great Writing Bad could save, but the great acting did not save the bad writing. This little observation is never much easier than "Laurel & Hardy: All Love Adventures of Love or Mommy". <br /> <br /> The cast of the two main characters is perfectly suited. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gylard Sartain (Hardy) are only parts, but they perform an exceptionally good job following the real deal (habit and all). The film is to be a permanent caveat for their talents. <br /> <br /> Problem # 1: A lot of time and effort went into the plot. <br /> <br /> I do not want to know why mummy wants to kidnap a very pretty British lady. I want to see Stan and Ali (or at least, their stand-ins). <br /> <br /> However, the movie is dedicated to many more funny secondary characters, even though it's all jokes, but still out of reach for most screen time plots. With us ... <br /> ... Problem # 2: Jokes have a lot of what I call "watered" slapstick. <br /> <br /> "What does it mean to be watering" <br /> <br /> In the slapstick, a character in a role for the comic effect will be hurt (All Looney Tunes, 3 stews ... <br /> <br /> In "watered-down" slapstick (as I have defined) <br /> <br /> In the Looney Tunes, Daphne Duck is filmed by Elmer Fudd, whose bills fell and he returned to it <br /> <br /> In this "gem", Olly accidentally falls to some of the people, and keep them in the path of their merry, keep them around, be careful and not slapstick. .. boring ... and this movie is full of jokes.They are the bread and butter in the movie.The authors and directors take these frustrating moments And as they would untaru phanniga. <br /> <br /> Long story short, this film just does not work, because the script and alilanu pincot and Stan's abilities to execute the sartain. Instead, the script invested on platit exposition and slum jokes. <br /> <br /> The film does not provide realistic material to work with primarily two fantastic impersonators. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but a wonderful sleeping aid. <br /> A miss and stick with the real deal (as long as you are outside of "Atol Ke" and "Big Big").
