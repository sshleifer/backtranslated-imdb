Contrary to most commentators, I hate the series too much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ At the end of it, I'm still unable to understand all of the alien attacks (perhaps I realized something, who?), And basically realized that I sat by the 26 episodes of characters self-hate, selfishness and self-pitying. It's actually alien / robot fights and these dark, frustrating shiny-off-of-off sequences are one or more characters just "I hate you / I / it" 10-12 times in a row. /> <br /> I can not really see shinji or aasaka (two main characters) showing the growth or change. (I can not see any of the other characters I have learned or grown for that matter). I told them that they could get rid of them and get bloody life during the first episodes, and the latter was not changed. Shinzi is really helpless, and it makes people angry, and the acea is making such anger-all I wanted to do is put on the TV screen every time I brought it to her. <br /> <br /> "I do not like much, but when I'm suffering from depression, I read that the creator / writer of the series is writing this, and I believe it discourage me to see me, is it the goal of this series? I'm honestly asked, which is the viewer designed to confuse and bother? And a Depression Sorrow <br /> <br /> Finally, since I was really impressed that I would like this section of dead-end plot How many of them look good, and they say that they say.
