: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I am disappointed in the loyalty abiding joy. When I waited so long to see it, I finally got a chance when I was on Thursday night in Hallmark. I love the first three "Love" movies but this is nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole picture is sad and frustrating, leading to many goose, and editing is very poor - from context to most scenes. I also think the baby Kathy's death has taken place immediately and the Clarks appearance in the film does not seem to just fit. None of the actors really wanted to be there - they were not all emotional. <br /> <br /> There is no interaction between Missy and Willy. <br /> <br /> I think the authors of the script have gone through much of the book. Every film that has been created so far further away from Janette Oke's works and falls apart. I mean the movie is not about me and about two boys, or Clark about the sadness of it. <br /> <br /> In the four films so far, I have to be laughing, thinking, joy. That is my favorite. I will follow that book with the next four films, and if I am in the role of Clarks I would expect him to get a bigger part and I hope I'm not so partial. I also hope Scottie and Cookie and Martha still have more but the authors of the script know what will be in the next store.
