<br /> <br /> In this film I stayed in the bar only. No story is too weak and you will pretty much guess at it. The film sinks with the intention of causing migrants and spectacular camera technologies that make it look like a student movie. Did I know that I was already boring? <br /> <br /> Whenever all the characters in the film suddenly die, I do not think little because I have no emotional attachment. About it. This is the first time I went out of a movie during a performance, but I believe it should be good. I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> Film can attack you with naughty kids.
