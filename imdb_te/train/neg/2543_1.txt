Talking about your waste of money .. Michael is just wondering why he does not star in a turkey of a movie .. Michael is a great actor in the movie that especially plays the guy he's cancer dying .. That is amazing. Once he grows up he tapes for his son once he grows up .. Michael is such a talented actor .. so made him this one ??? I have seen and it really is dumb .. I have crappy movies who guess at one time in their career .. especially "squeeze" I do not understand one at all, and I know his best performance "Pacific Heights", his character really creeped out of me .. and I really enjoyed "Multicacy". In a way it is hilarious! And he's just perfect for the role of "Batman" and I kind of liked the "Night Shift" and I love "Johnny Dangerous" too .. most of them end up doing some bad bad movies ..
