It must be renamed "The Shock Film and Non-Horror Snor", which is incorrectly referred to as "The Curious Case of The Unicycle Films." It's a gig, boring story hazing a fraternity, a gag transparent so even through the flounder from the Delta House. Jeff East, actor in the pay-in-stage, can not get what he can get and can be forgiven for taking any work. It can not be said of Charles Martin Smith, who previously played for Cinematic Heavyweights like George Lucas and Sam Peckinpai. Once found on the tape, but thankfully not on the DVD. Such deceptive garbage is not a sunken and somewhere.
