In 1454, in France, the magician Alarik de Mannak (Paul Naschee) was executed by execution of witchcraft, vampire and lycotherapy, guilty of guilt and his mistress Mabille de Longrey (Helga Linee). Even before they die, they will turn to the next generation for their death penalty. In the present days (in the 70s), Hugo di Marnac (Paul Naschie) and Silvia (Betsaye Ruis) and their friends Maurice Roland (Wick Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suraniy) go to a session session, the soul of Alaric de Mornac. They go to Villas de Sade and seek a monastery in the real estate and rural areas of the Hugo family. They discovered the head of the alrique and had them in the devil, Mabille returned to life and gore sacrifices locals. After her father's death, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that she had hidden the thorough's hammer amulet; Together with Maurice, they try to defeat Deminic Alarik de Manac and Mabilles. <br /> <br /> Last weekend I bought a box of horror style with Paul Naschie's five DVDs at US $ 9.98. Although there are no indications, I have decided to take a chance. The first DVD with a non-cut and revised version of "Horror Rises from the Samm" was a garbage B (or C) film, which immediately recalled Ed Wood. The fraudulent narrative is revealed through terrific screenplay, direction, performances, cinematography, makeup, special effects, and edition and nude women. The result is just hilarious and I can reassure Ed Wood's style. My vote three. <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
