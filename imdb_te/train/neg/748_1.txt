I love movies, and I'll give you a chance, no way through any movie. In the end I will see the movie I can not see through all the way. Acting is terribly old and unilaterally, computer geek with less software in his computer basement and CG ... Long Sights ... Walking !!!! And this movie is three hours away! I did not even have 15 minutes until the DVD was forwarded. Scenes with foreigners are very low. Um, instead of naming this "War of the Worlds," gives this "Walking of the Long Distance" name. This cost is 5 million dollars! <br /> <br /> Oh, but in a positive note, a scene where you can see when the aliens are starting to kill people first. <br /> When you become skeletons, they are still 20 seconds later. <br /> <br /> If I'm a fan of boring, the older, action low films, here is one for you DVD collection. But I did not write it for you, I wrote bills on billions of others who would hate this film. <br /> <br /> I know this book but the book is not very long, and I'm the perfect book worm / song / geek / whatever, but why? Just get Steven Spielberg version, it's not all that good, but it is 10 times better than that !! <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
