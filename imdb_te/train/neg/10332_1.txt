Awful, just awful. It proves my theory about "star power". This is the man who directed the Titanaka because this is the same person who directed Schick on a chick with a shelf stick because it is considered a great TV. <br /> Thousands of times are interesting - your TV can be seen with no image or sound. <br /> <br /> PS: My Principle: I rated a very high B / C IMDb.com rating system does not have any negative scores. <br /> <br /> PS: My theory is "star power": more "star power" used in a show, performance is weak. <br /> This is called an indirect relativity: Quality 1 / "Star Power", lower "SP", makes good quality. Another way of saying: "much less." <br /> - Z
