How can you say that the horror movie is terrible? When you can not stop laughing about the course! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's on some random island in the Pacific. It is a mystery, where exactly is going. A black man with a black woman's black men, and a young Frank Zappa drum bang ... Devil is a big black man in the fierce case of Pink eyes. "Publius" is the blood of the "freibist" moments (actually feels funny), and then his partner's head falls to the ground, hanging from a tree in which she looks like a "publito" Pablito "I" shits n 'giggles "and kicks it a bit for the eyes actually moving / But, of course, Unnanduna eyes kadilipoyinappudu "Freak" is gone. <br /> I did not laughed at a loooong time, and I definitely recommend this film on a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you do not have anything ... Beers Grab a Case and start watching this movie, you'll love it! If you're looking for a real horror or gore image, though ... 'do not bother.
