If you decide to do good feedback, you should try to do better than the original. Or at least give it the latest point of view. Now about the 1963 Robert Wise Shirley Jackson's great novel "Hunting of the Hill House" is also worth the price to enter today. Forward forward and back to 1999. Why I left my head shaking and asking, why? Acting is wooden, story unrecognizable, and the whole point is to replace the original cosmic horror location with the production of many special effects computers. I heard this update is bad; But I can not believe that it is bad when considering the source. I made a mistake. On seeing this, she told me how bad my wife was. "Well they've got your money!" She's right, do not let them get yours. If Lousy is not making a return to making it, maybe they stop to come up with a high standard that they do not insult or insult their audience
