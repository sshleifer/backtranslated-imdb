Another big conspiracy that attempts to blame the US government and armed forces (especially the army) for the disaster from the Great Flood. Anyone who has ever worked in the US Army officer can see how much the bogus is. Uniforms, equipment, sets and habits are all wrong. (And in fact, all senior officials are corrupt criminals or total idiots.) Promoting a protest with impartial effort. Several theories presented in the last few years have proven. Each Clichet uses', rumor, and all the Gospel from the Gulf to Urban Legend presented. (True, no one knows exactly why some GW vets are sick and others are healthy like horses.) PS It's not new. The war is not fun and I also know some of the WWII, Korea, and Vietnam nomads are very serious illnesses. (And the government is responsible for taking care of them all.) Such sensational images will solve the problem!
