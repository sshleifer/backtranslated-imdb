I'm really trying to figure out what's the worst thing I've ever seen - a very disturbing problem with this movie is being interviewed by real scientists, but their footage is for many of the BSers populating the film. The BS has a ten thousand thousand to indicate the ratio of interviews - in the end, the interviews "We Are You _think!" <br /> <br /> If you feel open-minded and want to expand your consciousness, open-minded to read some original books about Quantum Theory: "Einstein Universe" , Nigel Calder (a thin volume, not a challenge), "The Cosmic Code", Hein By Zg Pagels. <br /> <br /> What is the best film to question the nature of reality? "Thirteenth Floor", directed by Roland Emmerich, Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mole, Vincent de Onofrio. Smart, sexy, thought-provoking.
