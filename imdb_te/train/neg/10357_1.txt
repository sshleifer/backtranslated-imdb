I did not really like this movie because it did not bring all the messages and ideas that really brought into the novel. We have read the novel in our English class and I absolutely loved it, I'm afraid I can not say it for the film. There are some serious differences between the novel and adopted reforms and it does not credit to the imaginary intellectual called Madleyley L'Engle! This gave me such poor ratings. You are very depressed because if you're big fan of L'Engle's books, do not watch this movie. However, if you're looking at the movie for entertainment (or education is in my case) then it's an alright image!
