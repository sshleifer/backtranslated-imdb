If you want to see a kid, make sure that they do not live anywhere near the cemetery. There is a habit of photographing a kid and most importantly she disappears at night in the grave to see her friends. But our horse heroine did not care for all the icons, with a nurse with her family, a tough dad and a junior brother who was keen on the love of our junior babysitter. More scary than a zombie gang, the tendency of the cast to talk when their lips move, and the words do not match their mouth motion. But the domestic animals are being sacrificed, older women have disappeared, and the orchestra will not be silent in any scene. Oh, and the editor goes on a day by drilling the movie. <br /> If everyone is to live, and AWOL is gone. Yes, I know it's hard to get movies these days, but this sort of starter point is not your CV one you desire. If a trainee is a farm worker who has been accused of chicken abuse. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> In this case, a shell gun and he can carry his arms. But back in a minute .. They were in the car, and they accidentally discovered the noise of repulsive horn so the creatures shuffled off at noise. Where are they safe? Of course not, they can run off this abandoned building somewhere in the middle, so the black can prove a harder what can work the girl as she has a nervous breakdown. <br /> Finally, the film ends. It does not end, it just goes to a grinding halt. As horrific, the main character revolves around his car with fake blood. But, my dear viewer, something terrible happened. You sat one of the most engaging, boring horror films you can ever see, and you will not miss 82 minutes of your life. Just think .. From the years on your death, what you'd trade for an hour and 22 minutes just for a bit of extra time with your family. Sadly, it's too late for me. You should not make the same mistake :( 2/10
