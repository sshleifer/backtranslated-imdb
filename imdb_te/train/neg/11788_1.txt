This is one of the worst movies ever !!!!!!!! It's too bad, I'm laughing through the WHOLE movie! This plot is SO Cheesy; Especially the end. This film turns away from an end-of-the-world-disaster for Save-the-Eels! I mean, Simon! And I swear ... I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for Eels! And there is a terrible kiss in the middle of the two main characters divorced. How imaginable! It's my mother, my sister, and I'm not able to finish it, and when it's over, it's been a year later. The second time we looked at it and we finished this time, and we made comments like MST3K throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Summary: See only if you are a movie star! Make happy comments, look at a sleepover for laughing, and I mean big laughs. Look for mockery too. The film depicting the film: The movie is a very shallow field filled with cheese and soak puppets!
