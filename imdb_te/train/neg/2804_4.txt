I saw the first version of 1973 with Michael Jaeston and Sourza Cusack, which was due to the 1983 follow up such disappointment. I did not get any chemistry between 2 main stars. Many people look and do not do theatrical performance, what's the matter of putting Tim in the role of Rochester? If the casting director actually read the book. Very strange! He's a good actor but Mr. Rochester is not sure he's! And Zelah is just a bit better, strange, a mix matching couple. The supporting cast is good enough for me to comply with it and my ladded scenes are consistent, but nothing is the magic of this novel. It does not ask anyone to see it as a genuine adaptation of the novel. Let down a real!
