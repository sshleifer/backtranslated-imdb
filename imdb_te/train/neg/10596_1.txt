Van Damme. What can i say Bill Goldberg. We'll go. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes of the film I realized I was bad at TBS. But I also think this is bad. This storyline is awful, Van Damme is outdated (finally), but unlike Arnold, his films are also. <br /> Forget this movie. Do not look at it. Ever. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
