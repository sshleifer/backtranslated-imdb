All the bare chest women of the world can not keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful worst. Derisory acting, equally terrible script plus poor CGI FX to match; The film is insulting the Werewolf style. <br /> <br /> If you make this movie even a bad joke, it will be funny. <br /> <br /> One of the people behind the camera is obviously effective but also very lazy to do something good in a quarter. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs and instead look at one of the classic Werewolf movies.
