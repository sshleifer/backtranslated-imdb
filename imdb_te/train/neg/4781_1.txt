This is a poor example of amateur campaign. Authors and producers should study thirty and forty German films. They know how to sell. The Soviet-style clunky leader was well done by the father-figure as God. Disappointed. The loss of faith is not too bad to return in the church during the last second that was "saved" by Hoover / God for Daddy. Unfortunately, it seemed not immediately and dramatically enough dramatic. Some long-haul shots of the angel Hoover in the corner of screen-beaming and shackles-are added too. Hoover is the best, qualified family members and children who "prove" their value. Unfortunately, other poor people are portrayed as good and good - and Hoover-God did not help them. There was a good approach among the souls who would drink the justice of their condition. In the end, he was wounded at the end of the bright and enthusiastic scenes (after the rescue from the Hoover depression). Hoover-God saw how good this family was, not just what it really deserves. Best friend at best.
