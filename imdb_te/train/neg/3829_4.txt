A retired sheriff, who is responsible for killing his wife, leaves his chain-gang and heads and stops the trainer who hangs near Uma. The latest attempt to bring Western style to the 1970s with violence and cruelty is not in the same league as in the latest frail Western countries from the late-60s. It is impossible and square, just like punching-bags and possible rape victims with female characters. When the former sheriff returned to the order, Charlton Heston was one of his lovely, least-inspired shows (he was a good moment, reading a letter and staring for his glasses). James Coburn, like half-mad half race, as well as auto-pilot pretty much, but Coburn has a way to even hoariest conversation and situations into something prickly and unnerving. This is his appearance all the way. **** from * 1/2
