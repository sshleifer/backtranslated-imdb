This is the future adaptation of Jules Verne's "Mysterious Island". Sound editing is very bad. You can hear the conversation on the set and you can hear the voices recorded at the recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. The film will be flattened with capital W, for those living in New Engeland and reading this comment. You will learn to give voice and direction directions to the director. "OK now stand up." For other characters. This guy who spoke to his mind instead of his throat and his blue alien. The alien man talks with a deep voice. You can hear the voice of the actress while he is playing or when he is struggling. For special effects, man! Bret Piper's early work shouted aloud! The creatures are good but the animation jerky. Really jerky. Sort by Carl Zaman Animation in Journey to Start Time (1955). Special effects are hypothetical. Thge music is good. Bottom line, the film makes the EQUINOX or PLANET of Dinosaurs like Ray Harryhausen epic. MYSTERIOUS PLANET Do you know the home and shoes string budget? Must see what filmmakers want.
