I saw the worst films, but this is a real stinger! The plot is inaccurate but it is not the worst. Directing is not close to what you expect from Andy Ching. <br /> <br /> Those who are behind the murder of the president played the role of angie hormone with female reporter dogging. There is no chemistry with refinement, her attitude is flat and wood, and the film is irrelevant as the 5 inch spike heels she wears. <br /> <br /> She is stronger in the "queue" list. <br /> <br /> He has his best performances, but this is far from what we expect from him. <br /> <br /> Poor James Woods and Burt Reynolds. Poor poor poor people.
