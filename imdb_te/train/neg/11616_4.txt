I do not like the movie, Joshua, all. Perhaps I have seen another one, because Opon has seen the film better than 2 days before, but it's really good because this film is not very good. I'm going with the ladder. Sure, an evil children's plot is not exactly original but that does not mean that the film was unsuccessful. It might be breathtaking and fun and chilling but instead it does not get slower building, boring, and really leaves it without thinking anything more than 'not good'. <br /> <br /> At the end, Joshua's impulses were disclosed. I do not give up that but the reality is that despite his disappointment about the 3 / 4th by his mother, Abby, his goals did not really accomplish, all the arrows immediately suggested to her back home. She committed herself to a mental institution because she lost her mind, but her father / husband was accused of having drugs with her medicine, which the body knew she was not mentally ill, but medically carried her away. So .. does not she come home immediately? Did Joshua fail? Will his mother live with him and his sister and his father soon? <br /> At the end of the day, I did not care about the characters. Joshua was not really afraid of the evil demon. The storyline is slowly moving and it is still boring when it is selected. Every time a suspense is flat. I could not believe it all over the whole thing. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> 4/10 Acting Parents Although Mother is good as a Vera Formi, look at Orphan if you watch a movie about a bad child. Now it has created an image that has taken an unnatural concept and a fantastic image.
