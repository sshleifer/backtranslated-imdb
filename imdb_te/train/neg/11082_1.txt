I know a Power Rangers Gimmick and provided 7 year olds but why are they really taking it seriously with this film? If they want to write a story with crayons, at least it will have a sense of pride to be foolish. If you look at it, it's happy. We have a normal family (father is a war veteran who lost his wife and he blames himself), filled with clich√© roles, but the airborne attempts to work harder to fill normalization, but fails with horror acting, but to fill the camera space. <br /> <br /> After the war, unfortunate-villain tried to fight with a knife, <br/ <br /> They gave 1/10 a rating because they tried to deal with this seriously.
