I started looking at the original Batman animated series and as a Batman graphic novel collector. There are some features that can not be altered as a comic book hero as Batman. Creative freedoms are good for all but when you change the character completely, it's too far. I bought one of the "The Batman" seasons that I added a bit of creators' logic for the extra bonus feature to make that presentation worse. In an interview with "Batman," one of the artists or writers (I'm not sure) "We thought we should not criticize Batman, but we were disturbed by villains." Hence, they put a jacket on the unmistakable little boy to attract the attention of the Joker, penguin bolts some anime mockoff, Mr. Freeze a super-powered jewelry thief, poison ivy, a young hippie, and countless other sinful acts by Bob Kane. <br /> <br /> "This is the name of the name of Batman and it is squeezed by my rating of 10 to 2. Warner Bros. ... rethink it!
