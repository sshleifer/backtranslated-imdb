I gave music from Harvey Keitel, the latest from Sex Pistols John Lidon, as a bonus, Enio Morricone. I wanted to make an old school, experimental, Italian cap thriller in America. Instead, I've always earned a Mishmash story, which is clear to me and WTF! There are not too many unanswered questions and there is not enough action. As a result: the potential cult got flushed down the classic toilet. Kaitale and Lidon work well together, so perhaps Quentin Tarantino can get this script back in good script. Oh, and Morricone score: okay, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of hardcore Katie, time is not necessarily, but "must see".
