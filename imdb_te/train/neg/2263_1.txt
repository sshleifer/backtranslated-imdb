Okay, tell me that I do not imagine that the movie film starring Jerry Springer is golden, which is what I wanted to do ... it's not even. It looked like bad home movies. <br /> <br /> When a film decides to go to the "plot" of "the lowest family," a mother named Jerry Farelli Show, with the nakedness of most disappointed people, has a lot of things between the stepfather's wives and stepfather's wives discuss. From there, this film becomes a tremendous experience: white garbage. Redneck sex, intercultural sex, sex sex at Jerry and his wife? (Yuko!) The film encouraged me to come out of the theater and get a second cure. At least it is relatively small. Disgusting and insulting. The African-Americans and the working class must be ruined by America. <br /> My GRADE: F + (daughter is hot)
