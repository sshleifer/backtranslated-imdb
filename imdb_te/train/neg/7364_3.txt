In 1692, ungodly children's lies about the involvement of slaves in Salem and Witchcraft send the whole community into conflict. Costume Drama, starring Cloud Colbert and Fred McMaray, is not a clear description of the unpleasant emotions. Three authors (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimmstead, and Bradley King) worked on the story elements, most notably (especially from 1937), although Arthur Miller's "Crucible" was read, and the play would not survive for a long time. The big problem in the film may be in casting: a bad-matched pair of lovers who hinder through CoBret and Macmourry witch-hunting, MacMurray being too contemporary to these environments. **** from * 1/2
