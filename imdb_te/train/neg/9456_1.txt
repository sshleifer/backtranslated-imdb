<br /> <br /> The sun is not shining, it is very wet to play, so I went to the movies, cold, cold, wet date day. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers has played a cat, his humor is dull and children can not see it <br /> <br /> It's like a big cow's milk, so it's very fun to enjoy, and filmmakers do not know how. <br /> <br /> This image is small. <br /> It is Conrad and Sally, the rule breaks down and the future sheriff begins. When their mother was supposed to work, she came to Ms. Quan's baby. When Ms. Quan is looking for a Taiwanese courtroom, it is La C-SPAN. She soon sleeps, and here comes the cat. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to control the dirt. The kittens came to try to let some have fun. He got Thing 1 and Thing 2, suddenly starts to worst at home. He improves a TV infomercial and accidentally tears his tail. And the cat goes to full Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Perhaps his only funny disguise was a hippie activist. <br /> <br /> The film does not warn us that it is pleasant like milk, or your tail separating. <br /> <small children are outside looking for a family dog, which has a key to a pumpkin breed in her collar. If the crate is not locked up soon, their home will be home to Cat's universe. Here it is a bit more interesting, but it is not enough to save the movie. <br /> Acting is terrible. Mike Meyers brings his brand of disgruntled Austin Powers humor to the cat, telling things like "You Dirty Hi", and he imagines himself as he has imagined himself throughout his life after a walk in the testicles while playing as a pinata. Spencer is great like the Conrad of difficulties, and the Dakota Fenning is beautiful as Sally, however, they are not alone to save this horror aortic relief waiting to kill John Ritter (the risk of an accident). Alec Baldwin's soft and tired Lawrence Quinn attempted to distance himself from children who played Kelly Preston. Sean Hays is Mr. Hamperfloob, the owner of the mother, and the voice of fish. <br /> If I were a parent, I would take my children into a potty sense of humor. Save your $ 7.00 and see another one. Finally Dr. Schss said, <br /> <br /> It is fun to enjoy, but you need to know how. Really, Universal, stop! <br /> <br /> "My car is killing a cat like a mother".
