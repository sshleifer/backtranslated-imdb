I saw this movie in my second year college at the temporary class on the background of Tolkien. <br /> Unfortunately, I sat down close to the screen and my professor was lashing me, laughing to everyone, but they were not persistent. Peter Jackson 'Lord of the Rings' films are indebted to Bakshi. In Jackson's version of The Fellowship of the Ring, for example, Black Riders has an almost complete carbon copy in the film Baks, shot in the scene of the space bar on the bunkers. Based on your agenda, you are called this plan or tribute. <br /> <br /> "I am respected in this film because nothing is going to do to find out what they are. <br /> <br /> In this sense of the image Full train wreck, and many people have died in danger.I've decided to list what I can remember in more or less chronological fashion- because I'm totally alarmed <br /> <br /> With the heavy use of Rhodoscoping, Gandalf is no longer a delicate, intelligent wizard but a wildly prophesied prophet of Doom (whose hat changes color once or twice in the picture <br / <br /> <br /> Sarahman the White is sometimes called Aruman. <br /> <br /> Sam is a terrible place where he is fond of his friendship with Frodo <br /> <br /> * Merry and Pippin are never introduced - they appear only at the scene change with a single sentence. <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pipin and Merry Road Skipping is very hard. One of the hobbies is at least two times bigger from the back of his back - he's never seen before - and they begin early in the typical fantasy beard fashion as they break down in "la-la-la". AWFUL. <br /> * Argon, obviously, is a Native American, wearing a very stereotypical fantasy (no trousers), with a large, square cruise belt buckle. He is undoubtedly the most deadly knife in the whole movie - often gets a volibi swing before he makes his flat flat. <br /> <br /> * Black riders appear to be more leprous than bad ones. They everywhere they go with a pinefood slow pace. <br /> <br /> The scene in front of the Black Riders attempted to overcome Brundon's Ford (in which they were on the other side of the horse at Frodo), and the riders will move their horses in a vague threatening manner and ... You can not. This scene is intended to explain Frodo's illusion confusion, which he surrenders with his injury. <br /> <br /> * Gimly the Dargz Legolas is the length of the Elf. He is a DWARF. There is no need for this. He looks like clay David Gnome. This is a cruel but accurate description. <br /> Borromir seems to have flipped Elmer Fudd's golden Viking armor from Bugs Bunny Opera episode. <br /> * Compared to Tolkien's illustration, the villain and stimulating villain, which induces Bal√≥n in the entire city. It looks like someone wearing pink bedroom sandals, and it's just longer than Gandalf. "Purists" prefer this Balrog, but I'll take Jackson's version any day <br /> War scenes are awkward and awkward. There are not any characters and what kind of weapon they have. <br /> <br /> I do not ask for action-packed scenes in Jackson's film, but they have to fight. <br /> <br /> Tribert looks very small and I am forgiven, all. <br /> <br /> Now for the best parts of the film, good acting is good. It's not bad at the sounds of Aragon, he looks just like the Jolly Green Giant. <br /> * Gouldrielle is somewhat interesting in this role; <br /> <br /> Like Tom Bompad, she is immune to the temptation of the rings of the ring, and her vocal actress is not terrible. <br /> <br /> When my professor pointed out (although I do not believe Jackson is wrong, it is more real to his death in the book) <br /> <br /> "Although not really positive about this film, I can not blame the biker for the bulk of the failures in the film, or I'm told - Tti /> <br /> <br budget, and at the end it /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> ", the size of the Hing. I believe he is happy with the final product. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not always recommend this linguistic follow up of Tolkien's classic trilogy, unless you read books and have your own visibility of characters, places, and events. I'm sure, somewhere, chooses this copy in chaos; If you do, keep the mind open and eat what's good from you.
