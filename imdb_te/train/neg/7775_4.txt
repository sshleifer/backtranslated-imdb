It is not known about this triology but it came on the film last night on Showtime. The film has worked well with a set of design and cinematography, but the screenplay is stable and woody. This acting is very bad - the two ladies are celebrating. If you are supporting actors there is never really any belief. Liberal captain, hot-headed soldier, etc. There is a Bible-hopping rewrite. Based on these errors, I'm not saying that this is a Canadian one. Telefil Canada end credits gave it away. <br /> <br /> I missed something in the beginning but did not explain the opposite to the girls. Here they are besieging a castle in werewolves and wasting brutalizing both young women without any reason for men's time and energy. Focus people. These girls are slightly more likely to be under pressure than your walls than those of lesbians - my suspicion of their interaction with me. You can make them feel good if they can fire a gun and open fire. <br /> <br /> Also, I think these girls are considered to be the main characters with this trilogy. One of them murdered an Indian man at the end of saving one of their lives. I guess she's just a victim who can not say she is responsible for her actions, but she is a murderer who does not deserve her happy ending.
