One of the worst films I've seen so far. Terrible acting, ridiculous 'action' (slow traveling cars), deadly script, worse unsatisfactory ending and inefficient direction make a film's hash. We know that judge Reinhold is a good actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. <br /> <br /> There is no big tension inside the car. If the hopes of those characters make mistakes, for some reason they laugh like Asan Banshes. In addition, the chain of events that these people drive to share the credibility of these cars. Clearly based on real events, though? If so, the truth is true than imagination! After the unfortunate, it was filmed in a useless manner.
