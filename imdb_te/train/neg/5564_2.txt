Perhaps the worst Dolph movie ever. There's nothing you want or expect here. Do not waste your time. Dolphin plays a painful police role without any interests in life. His brother is killed and the dolph tries to figure things out. The character is just plain stupid and aimlessly slipping around. Means.
