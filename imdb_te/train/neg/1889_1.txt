This film is not entertaining but deep in depths of the dark side of human behavior. The worst kind of evils, the offensive sex, greed, and half a dozen stories of intolerance. All the action is played in some hot and sticky days during a heat wave in Vienna and the heat may have some anger and hatred in the picture. Following the scenes of drinking and perversity in the 'slogs' flat close to me, about the most deadly episode in the treatment of a retarded girl by Security Equipment Salesman. You get trapped and I hope this film is scared. I hated it but was forced to see it. Sometimes he is 1/10 for 1/10 of 'pleasant' to 'man'.
