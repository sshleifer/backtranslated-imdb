I really liked it. It is intelligent and always. Strangely though, I looked forward to seeing it really make it back. I'm a little bit against what I normally make back because there are so many of them, but something this is intrigued to me. I enjoyed it first. Cain's clever, as always, and managing to capture the Jude Law is perfect for him. It's very clever how modernization is and it works. What will happen from the last seven minutes really good It goes away from the original, so far is actually intelligent and annoying. At the end of the original is amazing! Very much pressure has increased and it is incredibly intelligent! This? This increases in tension, but in desperation they decided to make the cannons of the cannons homosexual. This happened when they tried hard to be different. And then ... the bang! Law was dead. Roll credits. This film is only worth watch for performances, but last seven minutes really make it drag. What a pity ....
