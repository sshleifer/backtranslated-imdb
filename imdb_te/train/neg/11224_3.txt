... and also, they can also live without seeing. To be honest, the movie is only true for bonding freaks (if it's called a call). <br /> <br /> Betty Page Fans are nothing new (I mean * is not *), or enjoy the warm chassis that they are familiar with, knows or enjoyed. <br /> Unrealistic screenplay, less community theater acting, complete lack of direction, swamp lighting or remaining bargain basement production values. This is perfectly "Hey, kids, let's make a movie!" The lowest order is the film structure. I think I'm grateful to know how to run at least one camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a girl named Betty Page, a confiscated girl, whose only comparison is the dark hair and trademark bangs to the crooked queen, failing to bring anything to the unwilling character to be completely committed and cut. This is obviously a wondrous thing for this filmmaking career, but mainly the delicate repetition B & D set pieces are basically sandwiched between the horror and terrifying fox-biographical scenes, for the wretch excess of the page's fall from the grace of the page (talk). <br /> <br /> There is more information about the life of Page in early and closing credits than the rest of the movie. <br /> Do not be fooled. It is not a worthy companion film for "The Notorious Betty Page". This is not a worthy image. It is a fictitious piece of trade in the attraction of all major pin-ups and without style without class and without the real sense of understanding the role of Bettie Page. What a true Bettie page fan will find it anything but a disappointment, I guarantee. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. Keep in mind that even if you have the freedom, You may not be too valuable, but I am betting that it is valuable enough to forgive you for this matter. And that's what I did, you were alerted.
