Leslie Sands' stilted drama "Deadlock" becomes a poor-choice vehicle after their joint-win with "All About Eve" for Betty Davies and Gary Merrill. After killing her husband, she visits her husband's best friend, when she starts to hunt as her husband at home. From her peak years to Betty's best directors, Irving Rapper, can not be deducted by Davis's curious and ridiculous ingredient until the unfortunate conclusion (thanks to which it all removes all stops). Product and supporting cast is definitely a second-rate; Only for Betty Davis completists. **** from * 1/2
