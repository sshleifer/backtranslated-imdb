I have once turned on a 700 club and only a few advertisements - many Christians in many Christians feel liberal and think of many Christians as a conservative. I voted my mind, not its representative. Or them. - I do not believe that the 700 club believes what people believe, but it refers to many older Christians who grew up in very conservative themes. I misunderstood what most I would say in the other 700 clubs. It moves me to hear the call name namely. I think 700 club clubs really love Jesus but people are trying to vote for traditionally to forgive to show love to some people and to encourage peace of mind like Jesus. Please do not judge Jesus based on innocent people who trust in him and let them be ignorant about us. Why do people understand each other?
