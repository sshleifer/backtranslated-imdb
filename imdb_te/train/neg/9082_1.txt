It's the worst movie ever seen. A couple of my favorite actors were deceived into thinking it could be better because of it. Now I will send Jason Schwartzman in the face to take this role. I was physically ill after seeing this film. I really can not really understand Hollywood. I'm trying to get rid of most people, I'm sure you can jump up and get the best one. In this way you get the worst picture of Ferris Beller. The film's ridiculous attachment of hairstyle and jeans is a vivid portrayal of commercials. I gladly escaped this film and it was watched on TV. This proves that you should not release all expenses in January.
