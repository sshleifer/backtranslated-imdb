The "Fanoses" of 1979 is the most atmospheric, creepy, horror and most original horror film, and one word, cult. The first sequel of 1988 was a witty, witty, action-packed and most entertaining. After the first sequel, creator Don Kaskarelli, the creator of "Fantas", has no new ideas. 1994's "Phantas III - The Lord of the Dead" is not absolutely complete failure, it is also quite entertaining, but there is more realism, and desperate attempts to bring something new, which makes most of the times tiresome, there are frustrations with ancestral comparisons. <br /> <br /> At the very beginning, we will secretly enter the mysterious Sentinel planets (brain-sucking flying silver wells). Early, unnecessary and annoying new characters (Tim, "Home Alone" -The thing is a great kid in shooting, a rocky, a tough and super-cold ninja-swinging black chick). The film also has its features - Reggae Bannister is back with the pony-tail, guitar play. Angus Scramm is still very creepy, but in this film, Tall Man speaks too much and loses his liveliness somewhat. Mike's role was again played by Michael Baldwin (he was replaced by James LeGros in Part 2), in my opinion, there is not much difference. <br /> <br /> "There is an acceptable time-water, but it is definitely frustrating than its predecessor. Fans of the first two "fancies" films can try it out, but I recommend not to increase your expectations.
