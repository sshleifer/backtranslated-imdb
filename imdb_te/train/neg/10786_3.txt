It is beyond me how the film is made with very big stars. It was a horrific clip of the actors, with a horrific acting. It really surprised me that this surprising picture agree with a lot of stars on this list. It's even worse that nearly 100 million people in the States have done here. The picture shows that the big stars can be pulled into the buck, even though it is terrible. I'm sorry for all those involved in this Sukha Fest. Billy Crystal made his best effort with what he gave and the rest of the stars seemed to walk through the motion. Whatever you do, nobody can save it because you should not come for a stunning cast.
