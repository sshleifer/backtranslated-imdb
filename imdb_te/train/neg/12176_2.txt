The actual Trancers is not a great movie by any means. It is very small in the way of massive plot holes and internal logic. However, it provided much better entertainment than the fewer-budget B-movies, and surprisingly witty. Unfortunately, none of these transsters II. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot is tiny enough to look through and the writing is tasteless. People who are behind this movie will know that it will be enough to bring the familiar faces of the first film, and do not bother with anything. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> To save the ancestors of his government was sent to 1985. The sixth year after the trunks' first trunkers events. Jack married Death Lena (Helen Hunt), a woman he met in the first film, and both have been living with Hop Ashby, who had previously been rescued to save Death. Whistler's brother (who was the first to be a bad guy) traveled back to the time to create an army of transsters, and it became known that people were killed by killing people to kill Ashby. <br /> <br /> Jack's Importance Jack has long been sent back to stop his first wife, Whistler's brother, who had long since gone to Jack, and now finds Jack working with her. There are two real problems with this picture. From the methods used in the first film, the method of creating the trunkers in this movie is radically different. <br /> <br /> A lesser example of Soviet revisionism, it always makes it harder for technicians to work. <br /> <br /> Another thing to worry about is that Death, Lena, Alice Stillwell (Jack's first wife) were given a very short screen time. This was a lot more painful because it was more interesting than the original plot of the film. It felt like there was something just thrown to fill the space in the picture. Particularly Alice's character reunites with her husband, and she has learned that she is getting married again, and she has become too shallow or too poorly written. If you are interested in looking at the entire Trampers Series (currently the total of six films total) for watching this movie. Otherwise, if you're a fan of the original Trancers, stay away from this warm sequel.
