This time the hero became the hero from the first film, and at this time uses supercomputer soldiers and excessive camouflage and shoots a computer and is ready to take over the world. I'm a double team, which is no longer reliable in the way Jean-Claude Van Dumme is looking for ways to watch. This, however, never refuses his loyalty. Universal Soldier: The Return Double Team or The Quest is not as disappointing as there is no original and non-starred style and skill. This sequel is designed for the kids who love professional wrestling. When I look back, action sequences are not that exciting and the film is baseless. In other words, another clunker on the assembly line of Van Dumme. <br /> * 4 (Bad)
