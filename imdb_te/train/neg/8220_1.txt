In less than 10 minutes, I ended up being painful. The "horror" film is about a 90-minute stupid work done by the Winnie Bitches group, arguing, crying and crying. <br /> <br /> The storyline of the movies is great, but it does not. A group of five "youth" girls are driving one night at home after joining a crazed female driver who wants to kill them. The picture is two minutes, and the characters have already argued and this will not stop. We are whining, crying, screaming, "acting" and arguing that there is a bunch of all the girls who are 90 minutes apart. Nothing in the conversation is also distant, so you do not really know or enjoy these characters. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrifying and I am surprised that these characters are young people. None of these women found less than 20 years, one of them seemed to be about 30 years old. At least for those of age. All of them have done far outstanding performances, who have been removed from the street or seemed to be the friend of the director with acting abilities. <br /> <br /> She does not show that she is a "actress" who has lost the role of the killer, but the other part of the behavior - a small part of this behavior. whiny, a group of stupid bitches. I can really say about them, and they are not everything. If I have to go into details, the girls are chasing a killer in a scene and their car is being knocked out too. A girl has wounded her and whining about it ... They do not wear four seat-belts ... what do you expect? One of your friends has been attacked by a killer ... all the "convenient" to help you <br /> <br /> Film is completely terrible. I do not care if the film's size is the size of peanuts, filming is terrible and it's like seeing a thief version of a movie. The cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, somewhere in front of a window and the camera was obscure, shaking, shattering, and horrifying against the "actress". It's also grainy, and sometimes you can not hear what roles you are talking about (it's not worth it to hear). <br /> <br /> The killer car in the car is actually car directors in real life though we only heard the accident). Not surprisingly they did not see the car hit! The film is very small, a car is unable to show as little scratched. Oh, you should also mention the soundtrack ... if any. It's awful ... sad one second, then hard rock next. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, Five Across This is just 90 minutes hard and stubbornly stupid girls seem to be a terrific home-movie film shot in the middle of the road for some time. When the script is terrible, the scary / tension / suspense and (no gore for it) will not attend, the acting is terrible, the image quality and the filming terrifies. <br /> This horrible low-budget movie. <br /> <br />
