<br /> <br /> 30%: I agree with the first commentary summary. I will express displeasure. About the characters and the lack of diversity in the range. By the way, I was surprised how woefully real NYC, at best, this film, by displaying a collection of narrow people and conversations, as I come across from Gossip Girl's cast (this is coming from someone who likes gossip). Some minority characters are written in the stories, but they are included in liability, but the gears underneath the picture are obviously "different" but not as little as ever. <br /> <br /> Why 70% of everything comes in short. All letters, white plus few token minorities, single-dimensional, people's feelings are cardboard cutouts. Worse and their mutual conversations I call the audience a "promising" for every vignette: "We get a basic point of view, then some punchline is a brilliant twist but a moment apologizes for saying" sorry, this is a surprise! " Still not interesting, because they are also very deep. <br /> <br /> You wave fashionable stories <br /> <br /> This film is basically trying to say romantic stories, but romance is fantastic, profound , Sometimes complicated, these "romantic" stories have a girl and a kid, while some share the same Words are exchanged, ideas are evaluated by voice over, but only one person is attracted to someone else to communicate only to the audience. <br /> <br /> The meaning of both tension and the two dissenting attempts to reconcile their existence There is no conflict or traffic. The only story about a surface "seduction" is that the guy Guy (Ethan Hawk) gets out of the way he suddenly becomes a hooker. Definitely, his words were interesting when he tried to pick his words and we were happy that we wanted to be if we were beside them, but there was nothing out there that "B" then. So if it is like a postcard, if it is "unravel" with all the other stories, it goes out: then B is the only thing that happens when it occurs in "Samy" in Manhattan. By the way, we only see the Brooklyn Coney Island sketch; <br /> <br /> It's easy to take on sex, gender, sexual orientation, and easy-to-play movies. So. _ New York, I love you, however, its title deserves to be held because of strict observation. We want to see real New York and the real New Yorkers, but instead we have a choice of a population, its characters from OC, and some others that SEEM is in the eye of attention. <br /> <br /> "Latino man with a small white girl in the park, two ladies misinterpreted her man (male nanny) , In fact, when he was the father of the last scene of this episode is unnecessary from a dramatic-structured position (it is very interesting to end when the maternal and boyfriend / close friend is away from his close friend) We are just a little bit from South America, now he's definitely hot, he's getting a kid with a high-class white lady Are good audiences ready? <br /> <br /> If the Mexican construction worker is apparently inconvenient, but in every conceivable setup and plot twist, the situation in the direction of the quo, the security of the queues, these stories are interesting for all, we choose not from the standard and clear general practices Keep the same size of the characters that live in them We have to stress. Is an Asian girl living in Chinatown disoriented to an old white person? How to 'an Asian cougar bout instead of pursuing a white college kid. Again, I'm not saying the whole concept should change. It's all just one. Damn. Story area. So is hackneyed - so they fail to convey anything about why they love a New York, banal outside. <br /> <br /> I am the soundtrack's goodness, the good motion of the film (though anyway, well, Dredge), and many different scenes are a simple feel. The film is just fine sitting, and no one can refuse me to do so. However, when the old opera singer told him (Paraphires), "I love New York: it's from different place," it is the most honorable to ignore. Well, you do not know from watching this one.
