It's very ridiculous. I can not stop looking at it though. This plot standard, acting is terrible (good neighbors and good actors for a lawyer friend). <br /> <br /> The main journalist who plays the role of "Kathi" is just lovely, bad surgery or just bad acting (I have decided both of them). Leave the script to comment on this, it's pretty awful. Pat comments, idiot decisions and neglected stupidity in every part of the film. What's inspired by this way? I do not know. I saw how bad I was. <br /> In fact, the dialogue is not even the "clich√©" - but it is totally inadequate. <br /> <br /> All in all, very bad, cheaper image sets, sets or scenes of the same scenes (one house, one building) Without a structure, such as objects that are likely to fall into action in a bad game, a chase scene in the warehouse or any child in an old school Adice be filmed, poorly shot, sources of cheap, low-action .... and I still wanted to see the end. Go find out.
