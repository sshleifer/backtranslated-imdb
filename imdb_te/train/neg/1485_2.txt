For your own good, it's good to ignore any positive reviews about this movie. This flick sticks. Now, I like low budget (theoretically) low budget horror movies, but with a low cost low-budget image: it's very serious. And, unfortunately, it's not the only problem. <br /> <br /> It is the story of the Bean lineage of the British Ilias murdered in modern times. <br /> <br /> Why is # 1 CD Box Jenna Jameson's biggest name? She is a below average woman who can not work, and she has a small role. Answer: I guess it's a "guest role" for her because she's obviously a porn star (no doubt you read in other reviews). This film is needed, where she needs "name recognition". Her top billing did not suggest her talent, however, the rest of the cast is a reference to UNLANTED. <br /> Can Canada be Ireland? Like Ireland, it does not look remotely. And the house to stay in guests / victims is this great big North American wooden frame Edwardian thing. They should have abandoned the whole bean theme and if you're going to do a film in Ireland, it's better to have more than one character with the Irish voice, as well as develop the story on the NA. There is a really really bad Irish accent.) Now, the director is not too bad, but he is not trying to make the next "Night of the Living Dead", but he is. Very bad. He had some fun. <br /> <br /> Like the innocent gotting scene, the woman was chained to the table, naked and subsequently broken pieces. eviscerated. It's funny, you ask? Well, in the deleted scene version, the mutant killer intestines pull out the mile after mile mile. It's really fun after a little bit later. What self-esteem cannibal feeders, anyway? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? No heck, we eat hams and ribs and drumsticks. Oh well. <br /> <br /> The other two cast members are annoying: Winnie, creepy Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I want to act as STUD. In fact, he has a bigger and losing ball as his name suggests. <br /> <br /> I checked Gillian league on her link in IMDb and found that I had graduated from high school with honors. I can not decide if only two years after graduation, it's very fun or curious to know that you are doing nude soft-core porn videos in a shower with respected student Howard Rosenstein. Wonder how her former colleagues saw this film? If they have, hopefully they will get the message: Fate this Fate! Go to college !!! I have gone, but why have you gone? If you like the gore, you'll get redeemed in this image, but not too much.
