We reached the roof of degradation with this film. Basically, dinosaurs come up in this ship, and some new peculiar fortifications piloted Newyes (which I needed after watching this movie). Apparently, Neweyes listens to the children's wishes everywhere and he decides the dinosaurs should be granted the desire to bring children who have brought modern times everyone can see for the shameless exploitation. Dinosaurs make them correct and eat this thing (many screen riders do not have it). By the way, it's not that weird that the world's desire to bring dinosaurs into modern times, from all the desires of the world? Why children deserve to stop drought? Disease? War? I mean Neweyes does not he have anything good to do with all this power ??? Finally, when the modern day of dinosaurs come to their singing, dancing and destruction (the main thing you see in a bad LSD trip is you playing T-Rex golf and spider man jumping in a balloon?). They end up in the Circus and Newies Brother Screws (???) to sign up on a blank agreement with friends who have a friendship with dinosaurs. Why? Why will children sign an empty contract ??? Screweyes take some of the dinosaurs ... "Brain-Canal" says that he can not let the kids go. Instead of the dinosaurs, the nasty quarrels from Tim to accept and accept his terms. What ?? It's stupid! They abused him, abandoning him with the agreement, and they would eat and drink with the children. I think filmmakers want to show that torture is bad, and I think it's a foolish thing when dinosaurs escapes and catches a little bit of a little and when eating it completely. Oh, it's not violent at all! We do not understand it again, it's not fun, it's Goofy, it's stupid, poorly written and committed to a bigger theme. For the kid's image ... it's bad.
