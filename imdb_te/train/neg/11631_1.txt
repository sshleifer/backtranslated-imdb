Today, I've written this review in anger and hollywood in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has built on one of the darkest days of our country. 911 everything changed. It changed our view of security. It has changed our understanding of the evil of human and humanity. <br /> <br /> However, Hollywood's negligent, blatant ignorance can not be emphasized how desperate, disappointing, and angry I want to gain profitable benefits. From death and destruction. The film and the like may be the subject of controversy between speakers and critics; Mainly resonated by the mainstream press. Hollywood has sunk a new low. The worst of the brutality of the cruelty and the lesser the lower basters than cruel brutality. Everything is behind the Uve Boll. I am very angry at this film. How would they disgrace the memory of the lost families? Are they ridiculed of the lives of brave men and women who risk their lives to save those trapped in the towers of the fortunate day? How would they try to be satisfied and at the same time investing in the 911 World Mourning and Sorrowful National Disaster? How about ... courage ... they? <br /> <br /> I'm telling my heart with the strength of this moral awkwardness: remember. Think back to that day and ask if you are a sad and moral person. Think back to that day, and ask yourself whether this film is insulting and disrespectful for the lost lives of that day. Think back at that day the anger of dear families. Think back on the lives of those two planes lost. <br /> If you have a soul, ask yourself. <br /> Think of it. Remember. Respect the memories of lost lives in 911 by watching this film.
