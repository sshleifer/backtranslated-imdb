The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical part of this film is very good .. It is directed also. The main problem has influenced the film as another local and general clich√©, a lack of influence and a lack of impression. Unlike the little character of the father, Raphael (appearing by Asi Diane), all other actors are unfortunately not their best. The role of the big blind girl played by Talley Sharon is fresh but with no intensity in the main character. Thus, her acting film became a lightweight and low profile. Moments and episodes appear as a real rehearsal. But after all it's a good point to make big improvements in the future.
