Freeway is a madman who shoots people on the freeway while killing a word of spiritual hymn on a car phone. The police believe he is a random killer, but the sunny, elegant heroine has seen the role played by Darlene Fleigel. So the former police played by James Russo, and they will join forces, forces, and entities in search of the villain who made their wives away. Richard Beller starring this movie will have its own moves especially if you like the car chase, but this is not really a good movie, if you're really bored, already hitchhare, joy ride or breakdown, otherwise avoid the freeway.
