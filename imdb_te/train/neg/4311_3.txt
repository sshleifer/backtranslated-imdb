I saw this film when I was full of raging hormones and it was about to look sexy a movie or as always as I saw. It's not a great movie. This is not my opinion. I really do not remember much about it to tell the truth. I only remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in any film has ever made me believe that sexy kathy in this film is unbelievable. I did not see it since I caught the TV in the 70s for the first time and I was disappointed - I do not think I would like to see again - my hormones are not rigged and I have become more frustrated over the years. <br /> Added later: I found it to be dangerous to go home again after watching the film again. Once romance is now very beautiful. The older woman-teenager still works for me, maybe not, probably because it's been a 12-year-old once. That elderly lady is smaller than I am now. Moreover, the passion of the whole thing was not realized at the age of twelve. <br /> <br /> Moral: Sometimes this is not a pre-requisite.
