The film acts as a timely warning to anyone who wants to write and direct their own film. Face it, you can not. So if you hack great holes in your platform, you do not have to tell the Korean myth that you have nothing to say, meaningless transitions, simple, uncomproved dialog and a steam pile of celluloid turd. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie with a garbage popcorn film, really I am; I like our worst movies. But once I was not hell and why, God, why did you come to ask what? <br /> <br /> Finally, I love someone to explain how the LA was Mordor for the final scene.
