The story appears before, but it does it if you figure out to make the right storyboard. It is clear that the director did not spend his work on Storyboards. In addition, the cameraman spent much time on the image of the movie's message. It is ridiculous, but if you look at the movie's website, you can read that the director chooses to make the film with bad camera angles. Because it reminded us about hunting. But I never heard of hunting with poor camera angles ;-) It's okay because it has 1 stars. It is a pity that Ti West does not spend much time reviewing his story. The film is much more important than the film project. Since you have a camera, you need to make the film immediately ... come. Everyone can make a movie, but not good for everyone. So Ti West advised one word: stop and label what you want. Use your time to start filming and filming as long as everyone gets down on the storyboard. You definitely have the ability and desire - so do not abuse your talents.
