Before we broadcast, everyone knows that Ron Moore is not a mini-series Battlestar Galactica. Never mind. It just means that it must stand on its own. It does not rely on Battlestar Galactica. If it's good, it's better on its own greatness, and there's something proud of Ron Moore. If the reports are true, this is what Moore wanted. However, if his short-series rounds, he blamed all the striking actors on screen, not to mention many screen-show crews. <br /> This mini-series is not a remake. I can not rethink it. This is a new product inspired by Bateseller Galactica. It does not take place in the Galaqtika universe in the same space and in the language and technology. It is not known about the thirteenth-class Galactica search. Or it does not rely on legends and mysteries with Galactica. <br /> <br /> Ron Moor's Mini-Series Battlestar is a space-opera, action movie with a festive companion for Galactica. <br /> <br /> "I'm another" Space-opera, Action Flick. Since the plot is gone, his original was original or interesting. I will relay you all the stuff without a spoiler warning. But I will guide you. I'll hit on a very important topic. Are you ready now? Here it is: just look at the trailer. <br /> <br /> Yes, the creations of man revolve around man and seek to destroy the man. (I guess they forgot Azimov's rules, again.) They are like humans, so the whole aliens-the thing between us. At least there is no travel time. Oh, lots of sex and violence scenes and spontaneous actions. When the final result was drawn from Galactica, the ritual approval was much more cold than the dignified one. <br /> <br /> I want to see something else from the first few minutes. I did not care about Moore's roles, because I could not find any of them. This fact came to me when the silans started their attack. Armageddon on a planetary scale, and I do not give a damn. <br /> <br /> When Moore's leaders got into an insurmountable barrier instead of overcoming it, instead of tying the tail, their own baskets were saved. After all, this is the only way to save mankind. They have taken a safe way, not to risk their own lives to save others. <br /> <br /> But ultimately, Ron Moor's mini-series is a movie on the treadmill, which is not constantly running somewhere. And I wanted to be over it. And by the end of time, my life's energy sucks from me. With my own will, I turned to a mindless, soulless zombie, what kind of this mini-series appeal. I was coming back. I wanted to-it's true-I wanted to see the episode in Babylon 5. In fact, two episodes, I'm fine. And happily.
