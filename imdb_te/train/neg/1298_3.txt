Sago Ishihi is a talented filmmaker in the right skills, but Ghozi tells the story of a warrior saint and his only opponent, Jenny Vamsi. Film production is characterized by a minority of low-budget production, including vague fighting sequences and monstrous martes (a kind of dorama that you imported). Sanyasi Benkei tells his spiritual teacher that his duty is to defeat the secret soul that guards the Goja bridge at night, but he does not realize that this decision will bring into squarely with almost every element of society at that time - but it can earn him enlightenment. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in the description of the controversy between the holy and the worldly. There are a few films to replace the voice-making mask with the help of filmmaking and editing. <br /> A disappointment.
