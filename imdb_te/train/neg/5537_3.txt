What? You have fought Scooby-Doo zombies? Well, you may not even know about this tiny film directed by Victor Halperin, who also directed White Zombie four years ago. <br /> No, you do not look for Dorothy Stone to reveal her breasts as you would expect in most zombie movies, and for what would not eat brains. <br /> <br /> You have Dean Jagger (Twelve O 'Clock Hai) and Bela Lugosi's Eyes, but that's about it. Zombies in Cambodia really are!
