Dark REMAINS managed to win 2 awards somehow a low budget American horror film. <br /> <br /> The plot contains 2 different strands. First, the woman committed suicide by cutting her wrist while bathing. Secondly, the daughter of a technical author was cut with her voice. The mourning couple are determined to go to a lonely cabin in the mountains. <br /> <br /> The cabin and surrounding areas are haunted. <br /> <br /> When the film continues, 2 different strands of the story eventually meet the expectations. However, execution is haphazard and conflicts can only be resolved through multiple views. Unfortunately, it is not so much fun to attract many audiences. <br /> <br /> Everything that is wrong with this movie is just wrong! <br /> I thought it was wrong to judge the actors in this product. Because this product is very low. /> <br /> The characters are uninteresting pointed out by other critics on this site. <br /> <br /> The badly scripted script can introduce a number of people without giving them interesting communication, without any possibility of character-driven conditions, without any depth. <br /> In the direction of the uninspired. The inspiration from J-horror films, such as RINGU, GRUDGE and a missed call, is clear. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not pay close attention to J-horror style. Because J-horror is very efficient, it plays out the fear of the unknowns. Tension is created by constant changes between extreme conditions (for example, a ghostly ghost in a CCTV camera) and the reaction of the central character without any warning. These films do not have a cheek element in humor or tongue. Everything is straight and you will not be able to help but it is played without compensation or limits that are convincing and captivated. Horrendous climates create suspense and confirm that Hollywood has psychological influence, much like the "jump fears" used in Hollywood films. <br /> <br /> The directors of Dark REMAINS have made a brave attempt to avoid Hollywood clippings and even successfully avoid using CGI. The tribute of J-Horror is well-intentioned. Unfortunately, due to lack of motivation, the viewer may laugh "without fear" on the laughing screen. The effects of "ghosts" are not too bad for a low budget, but their actions simply reject the logic. <br /> <br /> In this film, I'm scratching my head several times. I could not understand it. <br /> <br /> I mean, I'm in the opposite climax. <br /> What is left? The answer given by a reviewer on a different website is frustrating. Sitting through the image is a function. Thankfully, the pain ends after an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> In this movie, I find only 2 positive things - the lack of scare clowns and the lack of "f-word" normally find each sentence. <br /> When you see movies that are very stable and the vague ultra-low budget about the ghost is "R-Rated "To see the horror movie, see the death of a Ghost Hunter. <br /> It may not be the greatest horror film ever done, but it is definitely better than Dark Remans and there are some real surprises in the store. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone to avoid the fortifications of the plague.
