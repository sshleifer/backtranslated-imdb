This film is terrible. <br /> They did not develop all the characters and the storyline was terrifying. This is a perfect sleeper. The action sequences in this movie are expected to feel its strong points but de-wars will be surprised at that department. <br /> Also, acting is just one step higher than the low budget pornography level. <br /> <br /> "Please do not waste your time and money in D-Wars daringly portraying what you are doing." .
