Accept with other reviewer. This is the worst film, not only for the Western country I saw. Terrible acting, unexpected and curiosity (not entirely inadequate for conversation in 1800), and Oh, did he mention the battery pack that was displayed on the back of the characters? I'm waiting for Boom Mike to come in the middle of a scene. And the end? I can say that the rest of the film is completely different ... completely awful. And yes, it does not have every clich√© of the book from a slow walk down the empty dirt road to the ridiculous "Let's remember" shots when a major character dies. Fortunately I have seen this free TV. Do not waste your time.
