In the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was a hero in the United States. Inevitably, men in his position are only those capitalist film roles. I do not know how Thomas paid for this film, but in Motion Picture I have to pay a large amount of money that I agree to earn a national sense. The film is clearly derived from "Enter the Dragon", which is the most martial arts images. Instead of a true martial art, they have provided an absurd new martial art, a reviewer perfectly described as "a cross between kung fu and break dance". A gymnast (Thomas, of course) has been appointed to protect some from an impossible fortress, and is enough to leave Thomas Assistant bands for each room. Of course, he has a fancy-dance fight, with a conclusion that the main villain fights his way, and of course they are the only surprise for those who have never been a Martial Arts film. While the types of craving are tougher, especially Thomas's mullet haircuts and many co-stars. But Kirst Thomas is the only reason to see the film if he has a revenge on him, who now wants him to step in the set.
