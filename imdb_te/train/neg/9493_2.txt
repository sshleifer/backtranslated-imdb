In this ludicrous film process a nut shell and bores provide us with the standard "hippie mentality" of the 1970s. An attempt to rationalize young, innocent women with aging sexual abuse and wash-ups. The unhealthy young hippie voiced (Ke Lennes) sleeps with a sideways and all sneaky guys, and one day she meets old, hard alcohol and ridiculous hilarious (Holden), and she decides she's in "love" with her. If you think it's the surface, the entire movie will add such scenes. She told her how much she "loves", she met only him, it was thin and really quick. I could not help but smile throughout the movie. This apparently makes her use as a dining ticket but the idea is that we're going to buy what the director is doing. Both a nuisance and a nuisance scene that has sex, I had to accelerate forward because it almost inspired me to vomit. A fine offering of music from the 70s has also spread through the movie. You can do this. Grade D.
