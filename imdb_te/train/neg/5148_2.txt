Beginning with the script that is both clear and recurring, this picture is a terrific mistake. Courtney Cox plays a comic book artist who escapes in a small desert town after being raped twice in a big city. She was immediately beaten by the local (Craig Shepher) who was very ill, and Mickey Rourke appears to be attempting a third rate of simulation. D.B. Sweeney is in the local police, there to protect and serve. Meanwhile, the audience described who the audience is really a good person? The logic leaves the window after the first ten minutes and will never come back, and there are more unanswered questions. If you think you might be saved by the "Blue Desert" fantastic Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. His episode is much less like the whole episode. - MERK
