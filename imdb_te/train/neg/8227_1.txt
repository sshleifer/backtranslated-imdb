I'll keep this fast and sweet. Five girls going home from a football game lead to a small forest road. <br /> They safely come to their destination. <br /> <br /> Well, they do not do that. <br /> <br /> Soon they are being hunted by a trapped chick that faces very serious psychological problems and throws bored for 90 minutes. Their throwing, scratching gave me a headache, and the script writes that there are too many repetitive phrases and the useless silly screams. All in all, one of the worst cheap horror flicks I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
