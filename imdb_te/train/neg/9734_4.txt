A man finds his parents part of a nuclear experiment in the 50s and he now has the power to ... burst into flames! <br /> I'm really great for this film, great Toby Hooper and Wild Card Brad Durrif. Unfortunately this increases the image of the average personal violent-forces. Spontaneous combustion has an interesting place behind it, unfortunately it has lived up to its potential and extends its story. <br /> <br /> This cast is not bad, steals the Darf√© exhibit. <br /> <br /> All around, no classic but either of its kind is not rubbish. <br /> <br />
