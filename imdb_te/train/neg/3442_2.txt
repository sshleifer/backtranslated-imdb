I have rented this movie completely. However, I regretted that the movie started. It seems they used a home video camera to shoot this movie and a little boy seems to let it know. <br /> <br /> "There are some really good ideas but doggie lines and in some cases they have been covered by acting." br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br I am a bit disappointed with the low budget horror movies, but I feel that this is no worse after the 'Terror Thorns', but this reviewed me. <br /> <br / ********* ************************************************** ************************************************** **************
