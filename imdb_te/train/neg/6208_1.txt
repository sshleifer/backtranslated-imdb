There is only one word for this image. Terrible. The director is clearly talented, but his character, like Robert Carmichael, throws it up. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has a probability, but he is unable to use it as a crack. Cray's attention to British youths pulling a little offense and then getting into trouble. Like the British Newspapers, the film portrays young people without aspirations or dignity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am scared by the violence of the crim chosen by the criminals. Audience audience of the world audience. <br /> <br /> He is showing us malice as a pornography wall on a toilet wall. <br /> <br /> In this film, some of the finest actors have small roles. Danny Dyer and Lesley Manville have two small roles. If this acting is not an enthusiasm, young people Joe and Ben are worried. Carmichael is crazy with Daniel Spencer. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, celeb chef Jonathan's attractive wife (Michael Hov); She is confident of how she might be responsible for such an ordeal. The film is not subtle and Monica receives treatment for the most unwanted violence that has been cut by warfare. War films are used to express the idea that young people can not help themselves, and violent actions also take place in "civilized" countries. It is quite obviously a sign of our society where the truth is less and less men's, but by cracking the use of crude and violent images he gets to the level of barbarian people who want to boycott. The female characters in the film do not get any relief. They are a victim's mother in the victims or Manville case. This community is represented as unworkable. <br /> This is the first movie of the cray. I heard what he said in Q and A Sessions in Edinburgh and that he was not without knowledge, he could not just experience and his film expose his innocence. The film will be released later this year, but I hope the company goes to the fall that the public really does not need this kind of confusing material.
