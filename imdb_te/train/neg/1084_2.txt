I rented this DVD for two reasons. Although Robert Altman was hit or missed, the cast of great actors and directors. In this case, it's a big miss. Allman's attempt to create a suspense has fallen on its chest. After seeing Kenneth Brahhag in a good movie like "Dead Again", I do not think he would probably be able to contribute to such a turkey and I hope he did not destroy his reputation. Robert Duvall has repeatedly led Oscar winners one time. It's like eating it in the money slaughtered in the dirty slums. Dougel was once one of the greatest performers, but his best performance was "Tender Mercies", "The Great Santini". This film is really a big waste of time. I give it to 10 to 2.
