I can not get it wrong, it's a horrible, cliche film, but it's the pleasure of Olivia Hassie fans - the silver screen is very polite. A poster has said that she is unpleasant to see - I wonder what his ideal woman looks like - the Paris Hil-Patri? Blockbuster should really establish a sub-style in this type of film as the fatal attraction plot itself becomes a genre. When does the blockbuster follow the section "Adultry"? It is very fitting between drama and action sectors, right? The film revolves around Olivia Hussey, who spent a night spent with an unstable yacht owner who killed his ex-wife. This ne'er-do-well Olivia stalk and so her life continued to make a living-hell. <br /> <br /> I would like Olivia Hussey, but I do not have any sympathy for the roles of movies that I deceive their spouses, so I really do not have to separate Oliveia to be alive. <br /> The outrage: $ $ (torture in the film is degenerate Denise Murray and Anthony John Denison Denison get involved in a fisticuffs that he does not stop seeing Oliver, Murray's wife, because she is very good in bed Olivia also /> Lead: $$ (Olivia is briefly queen of nakedness and has a little bit of her love of love) <br /> <br /> We have this plot in advance William Reyad, man's conversations sophomoric and moronic.This man has no story-telling capabilities and fails to build the belief that the human reaction to the plot is that these people, at the higher levels of society , Speaking like a middle child - With the habit of sleeping during the English class. <br /> Acting: $$$ (actors say that acting is not "fol-in", but blocked by a childhood script of Ryad. He's called "weird" and "silly" on the face, when he still stops, Hussey is still beautiful, best performing, but Denison D Murray is basically just stand there - not redirect out of his character, and Edward asnar, used the term in a wonderful actor, this film being rude).
