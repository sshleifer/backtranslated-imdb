This film is terrible. <br /> <br /> The script is entirely unrealistic and written in the real world, editing and lighting effects are far worse than the first ever projects in the school. : A) know any details about the world of police or secretive activities. B) know any details about filmmaking or appreciation. <br /> <br /> I recommend this picture in average or low-average minds, I feel a dubber if it's enjoyable. If you look at this picture full of mind, I would recommend a very kind of inheriation. <br /> This is the total waste of the value of the low product.
