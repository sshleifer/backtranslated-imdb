Michael Keaton is never really a good actor; In Tim Burton's Batman films, he always falls in the shadow of his great villains. <br /> <br /> Here, he has acted as a living survivor, choosing radio frequencies to look like dead people, trying to live in living relationships ... <br /> <br /> This is a very surprising thriller Every time you are shocked you is shocked. Because there is a lot of vague, extinct and uninteresting ends. So where is WHITE NOISE gets all the bad image made in the first place that makes himself a fool? Where's the shocking excitement? Really bad acting and horror editorial, there is nothing to see this film. Michael Keaton tries to make a thriller back but ends up with no more aim than ever.
