The film starts with a simple funeral ... and it's very hard to emphasize that I'm losing interest in a 5 minute interval and starting to skip the scenes. The film was made to die in a permanent morbid transatlantic journey, and no one could think about death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the darkest kids from Southpark, I get a picture that gets me well into an interesting story within 10 minutes, I sit and see nothing but a 10-minute preparations for a funeral While my grandma has fascinated the funeral in her last years, May be enjoyed.
