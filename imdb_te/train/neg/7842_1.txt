A t.v. Showing - and the whole experience could not believe how terribly awful. In comparison, the original "A Man Called Horse" is spell-binding because it has one's interest. But this piece of nonsense - words fail me. It's bad enough to have a "story" type with all the effects of the bread of the bread, but this error is mixed with the obvious lack of subtitle when called "suex". For goodness, the filmmakers did not recognize enough North American Indians to act as actors and actors and "Indians" instead of the audience they actually used? I also found quite bother looking at cavorting around the countryside at the clear command of the director just standing behind the camera just telling him to run from pointless point to Point B and point to point to all just the footage and minutes of Richard Harris. Strictly terrible in all respects!
