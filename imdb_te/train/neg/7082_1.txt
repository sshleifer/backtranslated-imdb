Okay, I've written a deadly review b / c picture is awful. I make another review (for Derida) to pop up, I decided to check out the old reviews of this awful movie. See all positive reviews. They all say, I say all, come from the contributor and do not rate any other image except this other. Crimminy! And you should wait until the "Rosbudd" [sic] review. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the other pictures robe, oh, shoot !, they happen for both the writers and the director only other movies. Sacred window-wipers Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, If you're the writer and tony, you can not get out of the bad script. No jobs for you! <br /> <br /> The eclectic reviews from time to time for a low rated movie!
