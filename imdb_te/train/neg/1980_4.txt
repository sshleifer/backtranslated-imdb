I saw the video store and want to know when Lisa reyenu, Ernie Hudson me ekee * "Kiss Kiss of Le Kissy" for any * movie. It's almost * guaranteed * Hudson is in the film if it's bad (eg Kongo) (except for Ghostbusters films, deliberately campy and bad). Despite my instincts, and I saw the civil brand, another cinematic "Tour de Force" starring Lisa Reye, I rented it anyway. After all, I neglected my "Hudson nature" in OZ and ended up looking so much quality series so I figured I give this film the opportunity <br /> <br /> If you are the lover of bad movies, this one must see the perfect! This is the most unexpectedly funny movie I've seen during loooong. The plot is very straightforward: Rachel's (Monica Calhoun) sister's brands band (run by Bobby Brown!) And was killed with a number of actions before her, promising her a final time and her sisters to take revenge. To do this, she will reunite her nominal gang of roses (depending on the true story of a female gang) and they go out and take a perfect revenge and walk out, where some subplot or some may be buried about gold. <br /> <br /> One of the best things that I can say about this movie is that what I say is that the stars have made their own riding, they have seen great increases. <br /> <br /> The funniest (ALBUTET unexpectedly funny) scenes? They do not need to sharpen the role of Stacy Dash, or the role of Callin should not be sharpened on her guns (killing Liver Ray's character or Stacey Dash character or Lil "Kim's character convinced Lisa Raye's role to speak in a gang or Asian chick or Macie Gray role," the loan is paid " <br /> With the exception of Calhoun Rachel and Bobby Brown's left-eye, <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he is the first time he is without a sound design (in his defense, difficult to work hard for the hip-hop period), design, script writing or periodic historical research (which makes me feel whitest in the Old West Teens are these clean people?) Seriously My better to do? "The answer, for the first time in a long time, it's clear," Yes! "
