In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed "Flights, Trains and Automobiles", a fun and sharp comedy? The best thing he did was. Ten years he has reduced the recycling back into the 'home alone' plot in this second sequel, connecting with other movies but is equally uninspired and ruthless. Four crooks ?? That's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, to introduce this revolutionary change to the series! ?? Electroded with metal chairs, opening the eyes with the brain and paint with the barbells, hey hah hah haula hay, the new kid is less than calcin. You leave almost all of the key players out of the first two films, you think you will stop Hughes from giving you old routines, but it is not surprising that he has turned out to be 'Home Alone 4'.
