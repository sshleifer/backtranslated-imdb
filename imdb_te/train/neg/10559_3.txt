'I do not understand. There is no sense in this regard! ', Explains the character with a passion at the end of Death Smiles at Murder. I am sitting by the mess that is totally confusing in the film and I know how he feels. The film's director Aristide Masakasei (using his real name for a change of good old Joe D'Amato) is a clumsy combination of supernatural, murder / mystery, and serious garbage rubbish, which likes the likelihood that likes will probably Jess Franco's tremendous efforts are for those who worship the 70s waste, but are struggling to have no unconsciousness A. <br /> <br /> Death smiles can be very confusing at Murder when it becomes very intimate with his cute sister's mourning death (eventually played by Eva Allen, who plays in the strange 'Death Lid a Egg'). , A coach that survived the estate of Walter and Eva van Ravensbrook, was the only survivor of the accident. After she was invited to stay at home and get back to their home, Sturges (Klaus Kinsky in the role of a throwaway) falls in love with Mr. and Mrs. Ravensbrook. <br /> <br /> "So far, it's pretty good", I thought of myself at this time, 'We have all the ingredients of a great rubbish euro horror with hunchbacks, incest, some blood and guts, and inappropriate female nudity'? However, the attempt by the Muscassy to endure is the most silly, utterly annoying and eventual revenge, along with elements such as style murders, ghost dances, and Igor Alan Poe's 'The Black Cat'. It seems to have fans, but the choice is made, I want the director to see most of his career Ntanu. I guess the gross horror of 70s is not my thing, incomprehensible, thick, surreal! 10 in 2.5 (fully cheesy gore and for nekkidness), rounded up to 3 for IMDb.
