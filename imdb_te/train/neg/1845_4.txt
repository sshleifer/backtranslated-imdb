Losing control is another offering in the romantic thriller style, which is considered the pulp fiction of the world. In general, they have a roundabout path with destructive intentions, and are met with tremendous drobing. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kirah Reid) is playing a game of the author's block. Just chance, (or it?) She meets a man (Doug Jeffrey) who is engaged with her who is more dangerous sexual encounters. The man refuses to disclose any information about himself, yet Kim has refused to stop the constant affair. Her agent, Alexa (Annelija Scott), believes that she will do wonders for her book sales. As in most of these films, the storm eventually closes but some things do not add. I have seen this kind of film, there is no change, but I like them. <br /> <br /> The cast's performances vary. Dow Geoffrey You should not cross this picture as a psycho / second. Kira Reed is good but fails to persuade her to be an infected woman. <br /> Finally, note the note about the DVD in the review. Cover and disc state both have R-rated and running time 93 minutes but the run time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is low on sex scenes being cut and why. 4 stars.
