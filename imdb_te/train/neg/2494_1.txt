What a joke. I'm watching it in Channel 1 and I think the paint powder is very entertaining. What happened to Casper van Deen, he wrote in these persecutions. Terrible acting, very boring plot and terrible direction. It's terrible, it's funny. Suppose that it is full of suspense, but it's more comedy. If you want to see horrible acting, funniest script and sub-parate plot, check this movie. If I'm a van, I do not ask my 10% from my agent, but bastard in this process. What a turkey. It's not even fit to be MST 3K !! You will be a good film to cure insomnia. I especially love where the van deen throw overboard and will be back in a few minutes later! I can only make a film written by non-union authors who take advantage of the author's strike. No horrible movie !!!
