No horror movie. I can not get it wrong, Jean Hockmann and Denzel Washington are good actors, but some interesting set pieces, next to the movie, crying, sweating, and usually worrying if anything goes wrong. <br /> <br /> The audience takes still with simple asides to understand what is happening (Denzel Washington is not more than a joke on the scene where he describes radio repair how he should be like a Scotty in the Star Trek) and you <br /> <br /> Real nuclear US Let's hope that the navy is not in the hands of such a script. <br /> <br />
