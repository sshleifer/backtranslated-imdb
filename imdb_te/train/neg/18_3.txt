It is an art film created in 1969 or 1972 (National Film Preservation Foundation 1969 and IMDb 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film refers to this normal time period - some camera-work and pop art stylings at the beginning of the late 1970s. <br /> <br /> Three simple pictures that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These twisted images are accompanied by music and no type of dialogue or plot is perfect. It is almost intended as a show performance art, and like most show art, it is first interesting but quickly becomes tiresome. The movie will appeal to the whole bore and nobody, but to make it more obscure, but perhaps some people have made their family and friends and perhaps some people are very hip and "it" means human beings.
