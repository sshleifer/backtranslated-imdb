Soon you can see the movie even without seeing this movie! This movie is not eligible for the "prequel" tag. Instead it is a simple theme in Hollywood, in the past, the worst prequals and sequels of good movies. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film bounces all the places like the ping pong ball and the character development is not upright. Acting was very bad because I felt bad at seeing some comedy in the film. Pidd Diddy needs to stop blemishing movies with his horrible acting, he actually made me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> The only thing that comes out of this movie is that Jacklin DeSantis looks stunning in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of a big Carlito, I would recommend not seeing it. If you decide to watch it anyway, let's see if the movie is removed from the original.
