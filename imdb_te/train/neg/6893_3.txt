I have many hopes for this film. Theater statement is great and Nick Balthazar is a very interesting man, a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of most Belgian films, but this movie is bad. It is totally unbelievable that 34 actors will suddenly take on the roles of young people. "Language games" are bizarre and above. Nothing about the film looked real to me. <br /> <br /> I feel very disappointed and feel that I have wasted an hour and a half in my life.
