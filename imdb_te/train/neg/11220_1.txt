For a film with much promise, disappointing, sharp plot and acting between horror and unbelievable. This plot has more holes than Swiss cheese and this is a tricky clich√© that I've seen in the movie for a while. In the final scene I had to clear my heart, opening the whole movie is not very painful. I'm numb! From the very first scene - if she tries to frighten her with the death of a sister trying to reach her twin, or to audiences, and to save us from two hours for terrible performance, 'I've seen so far. It is a horror in the true sense of the word.
