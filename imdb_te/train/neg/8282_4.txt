Now you need to know about this film, Jessica Simpson "Bomb" pretty much went straight to the video (limited, weird stage run). Normally, Ms. Simpson Katie is to find her boyfriend in a small town in Oklahoma to find him on the bed with another woman to surprise him. She is alone, but a friend (Rachel league cook, whom we want to see in the movie too), allows her to live. The two ending colleagues (Penelope on Miller and Always Dicky Dick) who use Katie to expel Katie's company (Larry Miller) will end up working. This is definitely a b picture, it does not mean it's deep. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress by any means, but she is pretty cute and really annoying. It is not unpleasant in this movie, but its throw flop. In a guest role, Penny Marshall Fanny (a microscopic book about Milwaukee chucked me), and a funny scene involving Norwegian priests (which did not read much). So, not terrible, but it's easy to skip. Your safe bet is always on television. Again, not good, but it's not a serious disaster.
