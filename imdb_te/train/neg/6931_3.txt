About 1800 A Stupid Rich Guy wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how his famous physician is paying attention to his patients. Despite the negative reaction initially, he was immediately invited in prayer and gave a good doctor tour. And, the doctor shows about him, he talks and talks and talks !!! When he speaks, loonies run amok here and doing nothing particularly productive. There are some actions out there (and it is quite disturbing), which is the dull and cerebral spectrum of the whole thing - which is odd for a horror movie, not life and power. He becomes tiresome, rather than a person who thinks like a chicken and a dress. This tour takes the guest, and it will become even more disturbing until you realize that you are taking prisoners to the hospital and their keypers are being harassed. And yet again, despite this twist, the film is amazingly lifeless in many places - especially when a bizarre ceremony moves or moves very slowly as people just wandering about the set. This film has a real effect when the laborers in a jail cell are hungry. Looking at this theme, it's hard to imagine boring, but this is a cheap exploitation of people! <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting and worthwhile movie, with a similar plot and effective writing, acting and directing. <br /> I thought about it, one of the episodes is the original "Star Trek" TV show! <br /> <br /> "Lord Garth - Master of the Universe" and Kirk and Spock are the prisoner and his cousin's followers. Here and there there are nudity and a rape scene, so warned before - it is not children. Of course, this film is not precious, it's not for anyone! However, the meat is very hard to see because the print is too dark with the version included in "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics".
