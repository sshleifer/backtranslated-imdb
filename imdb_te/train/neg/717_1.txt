It is thought to be a simulation on the LOTR-trio. But this is one of the most awkward films I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad screenplay, bad everything. My personal opinion. I have no doubt that there are people who like this sense of "humor", but there are good parodies in movies from directors such as Mel Brooks or Juker Brothers. I worked in a movie theater and in the DVD shop and the success for the film was similar in both areas: the film won the first two weeks (but not the bigger) in the movies, but the film fell very fast when it came to reviews that it was not very good . The DVD is good for a while but no one ever asks it. In the last ten years, I have seen two worst films Ring Thing and Torque. I have not decided any worse, but I do not need to think a lot about this question because I am very happy with so many good films.
