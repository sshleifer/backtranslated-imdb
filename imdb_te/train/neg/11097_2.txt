It was definitely the sort of Matinee serial on Saturday I loved during World War II. I'm ten years old. And this is designed for serial audiences. Now looking at it, one must bellow at its incompatibility and stupidity. The budget given by shortcuts and repeats should not be next to nothing. Acting? <br /> Pictures of the republic, 1944. These are the lines that are read ... There is no doubt that they are taking advantage of them. <br /> Half stars.
