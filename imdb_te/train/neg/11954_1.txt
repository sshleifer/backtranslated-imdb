This film is terrible. Throughout the whole picture, I puzzled and did not see any point on it. I went to this site and read the review and finally had to understand what it was about. This film is not worth watching. It is not only STUPID but sick and rebellious but absolutely! Please do not look for one of those who love to see bad images. If the film is questioned by the Japanese community and their values ​​and characters, I would not like to visit or troubled this country. This is a completely sick picture !!!!!!!!! I did not enjoy it because there was no sense. That's a list below because my boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if there was a horror. It's total disappointment.
