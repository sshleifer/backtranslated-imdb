Before they were over, I walked out of very few films, but I could not finish this rubbish piece. It is the largest breed attempted to qualify as a legitimate film from "Birth of a Nation". Characters are slightly higher than cardboard cutouts. I do not see how any actor wants to associate their image with their name. Lee must have a good job to put such trash. I know that anyone with me and the brain will have better things. I wish someone would make a film about interracial relationships that deal with realism. There is much depth on this topic, such as the leaning of bitter director like Lee.
