I realized that bringing the novel to the big screen is always problematic. <br /> <br /> I can only tell you about this really horrific adaptation. <br /> <br /> Do you have 'Wise Blood?' This is a wonderful book. Flannery O'Connor wrote about the southern one that nobody is. She is a South, a devotional Catholic, and a wonderful gifted writer. Her dark and deeply disturbing story in her first novel is faith, suspicion and liberation. The characters in the book are worse for those living in the rural south, but I can assure you that such people exist. They only exist, they are people with concerns like families, feelings, and anyone. Flannery's intentions were too often wrong - she did not lag behind these enthusiasts - she saw the beautiful operation known as 'kindness' ... even in the most violent, mournful and commando in situations. Feel free to read 'Wise Blood' and wash with the notion of coming Doom. <br /> <br /> Our long-pending world conclusion is that we have a long time thinking about it. None. It is a farce. A bad farce. The whole picture is satisfied with a hauteur that turns the stomach. Performance is poor, southern tunes are fake and insulting. Film producers do not show any understanding of the idea of ​​religious south Indians. Ms. O'Connor's prose prose has been reduced to the costumes and the cheap, amateur theater. Soundtrack Hassed silliness and 'Clockwork Orange'-style cheeseball electronics mix is ​​not suitable for story or movie. I gave free access to the film and almost went out. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I agree with Ms. O'Connor's religious opinions, and I grew up in the deep south, years ago and my way back to the north and looked back. But the Southern adorable people (like everywhere on Earth), and Cartoon's ridiculous south and their perspectives were carried out at these film borders in hazardous conditions. <br /> <br /> In this film I will tell you about an artist's work - John Huston I do not know, and I am honest and gifted filmmaker, I'm sure his honor place is confirmed. My views are clearly sloppy to read the work of Flannery O'Connor. So I do not say I'm coming from any other perspective. Perhaps it is a stand-alone film that works for cinemafilms. But for Flannery O'Connor fans - and in the self-respecting south and open stripes of all strips I've added - this film will waste time.
