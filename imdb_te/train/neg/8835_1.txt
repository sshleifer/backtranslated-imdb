Before I saw this movie, I will read a review that says this film is probably one of the best movies ever! Tension will rise well by the scene of Hey Heck Scene ... from the annoying characters in this movie. From a little girl trying to speak and bore a little girl, the killer was walking without any notice (Guy at the beach who talked to the little boy!) Things just happened and did not answer in the picture. As I see, the film seemed to be going in one direction, then it does not go anywhere, but in a new direction ... and on it ... <br /> Acting is great, but the writing is terrible. In each scene, in every scene, the unbelievable, unrealistic, and the reactions of fellow cast / extras are fantastic or feasible. There are no resolutions to the development issues throughout the film, which can be confusing and eventually becoming big waste.
