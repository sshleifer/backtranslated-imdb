The super sexy b movie star is another bit part of the future "Goodfellas" star Ray Leota's in this box office bomb. She plays Merion, has only one line of dialog, and a conversation of conversation is actually. She "Joe!" Rye's character is a violation of the poor Pia Jodor with a plastic garden hose sprinkler. This image is very bad, but it turns out to be funny, sometimes happy. The boys at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 love this! See the hysterical scene at the end of the pygmy's nervous breakdown and all the cheesy editing and effects that they show and show how to make Chia's scene look bad. Pia plays the role of Hollywood film writer in this. Pia Jodora as a screen writer? Yes it is true. Pia can not just speak, write only! Pia is completely and totally wrong in this dumb character. But who cares? The real star is hot and fresh glory Anne of her bit as part of this cat's opinion! Glory On Rock!
