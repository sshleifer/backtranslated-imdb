I do not buy kung fu movies for the plot. I'm buying them for fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but my tastes move very slowly. There are about 3 or 4 medieval fighting scenes, only a short time remaining. The last fight was a bit higher, but at that point I was bored and I did not even pay attention.
