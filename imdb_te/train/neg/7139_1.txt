The redline is the fast & furious mocofe, without any exhaling features. It does not require a twisted plots with multiple turns and surprises, but it needs something! This is the equivalent of a romantic movie in which the storyline and dialogue are at the beginning of the 60 seconds and the end of the conversation. It's worse, because you can not get your money worth. Mutablish boring, impossible race sequences, and terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars have earned negative points for acting in the film. Sure, she's hot, but who's frustrated with the woman on the screen? I think the director is sitting with a full cap of dialogue and plot snippets, every time they open up 8 scenes, they switched scenes. Anyone who knows or knows about the races or anyone who is watching this movie has enjoyed the racial sequences.
