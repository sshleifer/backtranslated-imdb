This 80 minutes semi-unexpected boredom. First, I was surprised by how I could produce such a thing. Then, in the 70th minute, I decided that it was just a few minutes, and I'm very proud of watching this movie as a great test for man's tolerance and worst tolerance. Is it worth watching at all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, try it and if you are ever strongly determined, you can finally come to the end ... the film is perfect and all of the characters. All the events in the film can be thought of as before, and they will appear to fill the film reel.
