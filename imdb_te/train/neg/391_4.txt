For the first couple of seasons, I was the most engaging and exciting performance of the apprentice. The combination between reality TV and a 16 week job interview is innovative, and producers of the show are not "there" to be present. <br /> <br /> New season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it is certainly not associated with the business - at all. In the early seasons, they used to focus more on business related tasks - the participants in the current focus competition are expected to do everything to keep the show, lying, trash, talking, backstabbing, etc.). The boardroom is fun to see, but it's fun at the low point - sometimes you wonder if you're recurring of an old Jerry Springer episode. Most of the companies in the program have large performances to pay more for NBC for boring and campaigning. What about half of competitors living in tents in season 6? It does not have a business in plain stupid and real life. <br /> <br /> "Contenders in the early seasons have some integrity and it seems that the contestants will kill their own mother to keep them in the show." Donald Trump The huge Ego of each passes in every season and being honest, I can not see why anyone would want to work for him with a simple feeling. <br /> <br /> Board room <br /> <br /> RIP The Apprentice Please note that NBC, for God, as soon as possible, is too intolerable to see it. Show, but now it's just a big fat joke.
