In my book "Basic Instinct" is a perfect image. It has the finest role of Stone, Douglas and the best part of all supporting actors. It features fantastic photography, music, and novelist noir script. <br /> <br /> This sequel is the exact opposite, it's probably not the worst, bad acting and dull script, totally useless direction, this is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing you have to keep in mind is that the exact reboot copy of the original scene is much less awaiting the next scene. These copies are very bad, they laugh at you and I've laughed too much on my side because it's like watching a shining memorial. This terrible mess is only good creations of Jerry Goldsmith score of BI1. Michael Cotton-Jones and the half-wit responsible for the script also included in the dialogue "No Smoking in the Room" and yes she will send away the Attorney (now an attorney)! <br /> Sorry, I have seen this awful movie I've ever done! This is actually damaging to the original, so it's very bad. Cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure Ms Stone has been able to buy the best surgeon money) can do a good job but is clearly aware that the realization of the original can not restore is the only radiation value. What happens to the film-making of the human body. There must be a law: there is no continuation of the perfect image!
