The film does not try to go into many places, perhaps this should not be done. This was a bizarre, head-to-eye approach given to us in The Cell, although not deep and well-shot. The plot is built just out of the initial campus. Then, as the film takes on its "dramatic" turn, the plot falls apart in what some legs stand in the first place. <br /> The idea is usually a kid (Chris McKenna) needs money. He takes the role of a hitman and killing an urban accountant. He was not paid for his work but he was tortured for several days instead of guessing "intelligent" thinking that he was trying to use a backup file that had leverage for payment. This idiotic move that tries to force him to repay when he is terribly and endlessly tortured. He starts going crazy (some very disturbing scenes). Then, he thinks he is paid for his sins and can start, seeing his wife's wife (Kari Wooher) and wins her love. <br /> <br /> "What is this with Curi Wooher and Horror / Gore type films? <br /> <br /> Granted, I liked her eight-legged freaks and she's okay in "Anaconda", but despite her obvious softness and charm (Wow, she's hot!), she's very well I can work and choose good characters or maybe I'm wrong I'm like a few soft-romance after watching this movie (not okay for the career), but it's a misconception that you're all for the boys, you're going to be "completely monty" in this movie, even though it's rather bizarre and short-lived. -Anization requires you to wonder what really happens during filming <br /> I said good acting. The second destination of its career never seems to have his brother, Alex, Daniel Balwin, do not expect too much from it. This is the image of George Wendt (Norm from Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, veyird science) brought some of the old glory. More than that, Chris McKenna is doing the best part in the main character, Sean Crawley. His short acting experience and his unreliable nature will bring some part of the film as innocent young people. <br /> <br /> If you are bored, if you are tired of the same old parts of "The Hitcat", I would advise you to see this. < <br /> <br /> And Carry, please start playing some good movies!
