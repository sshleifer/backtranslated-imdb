Do you like beautiful girls? Yes I'm also. What's wrong about beautiful girls / women? Nothing is emo, so this movie gives only 2 stars out of 5 stars, but is it a gripping curve and a "utility" of Uto? <br /> <br /> If I want to see beautiful people, I can see MTV or anything. This is a movie, action movie. Does this really require the right to plot? I do not agree 100%, but let's say yes. So what is needed? Part 1 to 20 minutes of footage (I might be a little exaggerated, but it seemed more than 20 minutes ...)! That's not "no". But no one else does not know you do not know what to eat this morning, so let them recall them ... hey maybe two of them recall? Just be sure they will not forget ... until the credits roll, of course !!!! <br /> <br /> About story development about real emotions about "acting" (not true, running and / or fighting for women in action!) Yes action scenes. Action scenes are not bad and I've given the film 2 stars instead of 1! I gave the film a chance, but it's time to waste ... You have good things to see / watch, trust me ...
