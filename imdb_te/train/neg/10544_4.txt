Childhood memory tells you this is a horror movie. This is a touch and should you visit it again. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was scared of a cold villain who played the role of a homeless guy and Jeff Cabrer. <br /> <br /> "First Power" is great. It is full of cap clips and filled with a poorly sized trucks with throws, along with numerous comfortable "twists" that help drive along with the story. Lou Diamond Phillips sends the bodyguard serial killer Kaber to the gas chamber, and he discovers that each one is a mere satan and has the power of the resurrected with the power of each weak person. <br /> Aahah, it's worse. But if you have pleasant memories, they are especially enjoyable. It scared me a kid and the scene was still very good with the homeless man. For any logic here; It is thrown for good measure about each case and you end up with a cross between a Steven Segal Action movie and a demonic movie of a 70s. And do you think who is a good idea to drive Lou Diamond Phillips here on Earth? Needless to say he's not convincing at all but he tries his best and I've never had a problem with the guy who has so many reviewers here. Tracey Griffith Manvik, so little. But the Kabber killer is pretty good; <br /> <br /> "The First Power" is a doctor's command after a hard day's work and requires "brain switch-off". Beer improves the viewing experience and will definitely load the time when I give the film a spin. All in all; A good image but somewhat guilty pleasure for the nostalgic fans who are easily afraid of children. "Look around, friend"!
