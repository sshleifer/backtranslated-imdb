For the first time, the film has won "Best Picture" at the "World Fest" Film Festival in Houston, Texas. <br /> <br /> I would not call the worst movie ever before but it certainly is not quite as horrible as Sucks and other Aussie B grader "Body Melt", but at least the film does not appear to be shot in the 8th video. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My opinion was made by movie producers, many troma movies and really bad B grade gore images <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I loved low quality pictures, Some roles, something more likely to sell them in the states or something. Even really frustrating ending, the showdown was way more exciting, and some good fight scenes. Overall, you can see that filmmakers will try to copy the "Bad Taste" of the car eruption, rocket launcher, and an endless amount of people, but this is the ultimate comedy or bad <br /> <br /> If you do not really want to watch bad gore films, If you're interested in making budget films, look at it or stay away.
