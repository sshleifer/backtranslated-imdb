Looking at the sophisticated beautiful women around, the cops and the thieves play one of the most delightful guilty pleasures that allow me to enjoy the medium film. <br /> <br /> Although Carol Street Street is not completely waste of time, the story was created and the screenplay was uninspired and somewhat annoying. <br /> <br /> Without choosing Kelly's choice, Hitchcock has a number of formulas for the films starring McGill's character. She dressed like Grace Kelly, and she was not far from the distance. No one can. But she does not convince her character. As she is introduced to her audience, she must be politically motivated and with a purpose in life. The timeline, the true events and the specific problem that is clearly defined after all the movies. But the story is unbelievable coincidences, a high speculation and a set of two-dimensional characters that decrease in the first minutes into a sorry run-of-mill crime story. Actors' performances are good, such as photography and set design, because it is more unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Stop breathing at Central Station, New York. It starts in the underground section, then moves up to the roof. The film was praised for the good use of architecture.
