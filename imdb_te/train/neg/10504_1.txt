I could not see it for more than 14 minutes. It's really a great mix of bad acting and really bad direction. The shots used are frustrating, which break all the 180 degrees angle all the time. My head hurts to see the load "what you know". Dirt in the "Mystery machine" window can see light from lighting on windows ... annoying. What else is it ... it's very bad all the time making it just want you to scream at the lady that you direct there. I have directed small films but I'm pretty sure I'm better than a movie direction .... The story is unbelievable, the first of a long French kiss scene is pretty awful. So pretty much, try to avoid these really bad movies at all costs, for which you can save 5 bucks or save, and 1h30 hour of your life will never return you ...
