Wrong ... this picture sucks. <br /> I'm reading some other reviews. <br /> <br /> There are many who think Woody Allen has written or the stars are good. <br /> <br /> I saw all his movies. But, they just suck. Poorly written trash. The characters are very stereotypical (not stupid). The plot ... I feel suspicious. That's not sure. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Woody Allen, let's look at this movie. If you are under 50, do not panic. (If you're a fan of Woody Allen, you're under 50 ... well, you're different and I do not know what to say.)
