I like this Western style, a fan of this story and fans of "Buffalo Bill," "Wild Bill Hickok," and "Commitious Jane"! Join Gary Cooper as the lead actor, and it's a great alert. <br /> <br /> <br /> I found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into the boredom of death. Jean Arthur's role is somewhat offensive and James Ellison did not act or act like "Buffalo Bill". Cooper was not very good, but it was very wooden sound. It was many years before he hit his lead as an actor. <br /> <br /> In short, pass the pass and see another soil because M is much better than this.
