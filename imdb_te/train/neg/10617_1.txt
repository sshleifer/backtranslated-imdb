She was inspired by a very good "Orlando" fan, where Potter gave her a vehicle the worst: she wrote, directs, stars, and actually co-wrote music, including a McQueen love song. The film compares a high school or college project to a young man who has considered her intimate love and dramatic protests pleasant to her. But Potter's role is that the object of her sexual assaults is inconceivable, and the overall picture is a disturbing performance of dancing that plays the role of Tango. Although she did not cast her, it may have worked. She can not act or play her or not. Majestic, high-prestigious, cynical, and silly.
