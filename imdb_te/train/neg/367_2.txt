A young child comes into the money and begins to live immediately. Unfortunately, its money is really bad. He wants to return his loot. When he finds the bucks, he tries to get it back. He loses this little boy who is fortunate enough to keep him from falling into the evil man's hands. Sounds familiar, I'll bet. Very speculative, not all that interesting. A bit different, ok guys thinking something?
