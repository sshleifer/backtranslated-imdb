I do not usually take time to make comments on some people reading, I see some movies. However, in this case, I feel that I should warn all those who are considered to waste time on it. I saw just five minutes ago. It's quite simple, one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. Performance is terrible, untold, and productive values ​​The poverty level is fine. I might be great even with a low budget movie, but this is not. The only thing that can save the movie for any horror fan purposes - gore and reducing on the screen too! This is three times the grand total off-screen that occurs. This will be effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens - especially the final scene - not enough. The film is very small, so much conversation is heavy and it is almost impossible to see the consequences. What happens Three teenage girls are going through a secluded place where they have been kidnapped and killed more than 20 in the past, in order to keep them in the room for another room. Their car is, of course, broken, and they take an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people - whom is a mental killer. Three finally killed, by one, on one screen, one after murder, seems like an eternity of slow paced nonsense. As I mentioned, only merely watching is murder. Please do not buy or rent for it, do not laugh through the misleading box art and image description. Save your money and your time.
