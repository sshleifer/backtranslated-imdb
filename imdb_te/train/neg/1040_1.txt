I can not believe that the film has been rated above 6! <br /> <br /> It's definitely a watchful and unbelievably boring in one of the worst films I've seen in the long run. <br /> <br /> In the non-budgetary manner, most of the Star Wars Episodes I and II are looking at you all the creative train ruins. </ p> <br /> This film should not exceed all costs. <br /> <br /> Dummy-intellectuals are only one of those "festival films" because they feel that such people are "different", so it's good. <br /> <br /> Film production is not very different ", it just becomes bad.
