In fact the possibility of a waste to make interesting film about the complex topic. There is very little exploration of what it really feels like a (or gay) man working in a gay sex environment. This is not a romance because the dancers are not talking about their art. They can not be a prostitute for auction, but in reality they show sex workers fantasies and sell private sessions longer than dancing. From the movie they get the impression that women will go to homework clubs and end up hiring "dancers" for private sessions. The club's shots also play women in front of the stage women and "dancers". It's not just the reality of these clubs. It is very difficult to make a living by making private dances straight for women and couples. So what do they really feel about their gay fans and clients? We learn a lot less. Instead we get filler. A homosexual activist who directly adds nothing to study dancers. <br /> <br /> The Mexican City pictures are simple. <br /> <br /> It's a completely simplistic picture of the only boys who want to see some pictures of boys' dance. The rest of the movie is insulting gay men.
