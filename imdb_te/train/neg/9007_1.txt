This movie is some of the worst trash I have ever seen. When I saw this movie, I literally got a sharp pain on my head. CGI is awful, and the story is just a waste of ink. Unlike his own helicopter can not function properly, Dean Cain's character is Mr. Super-imaginative-not what I can do. The biggest problem is the split screen camera work. I felt like I was watching Brady Bunch or something, only it was not the different people in the boxes, just the close things and different views of the same thing. I can only recognize that the actors really need money, because the film depicted in this movie is not valuable.
