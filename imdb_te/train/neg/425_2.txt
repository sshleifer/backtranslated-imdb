<br /> <br /> This Disney documentary is not just a rebuilt Planet Earth Lite, but I'm angry about writing my first review. I have now learned that it has been propagated by "people who brought Planet Earth" but I do not know that they are apparently used to make clear cuts, such as the structured documentary short-range. On DVD I paid $ 8.75 to see what I already own. <br /> <br /> But there is disrespect to Disney, which warns that nothing is happening here. (I believe in James Earl Jones Voice Over and Second Second Sail Fish). The biggest crime is that, if Planet Earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear, Disney has taken the story and turned it into a family friendly trip, proving that this planet and the catalyst for environmental change can be catalyzed. After the death of the male polar bear, they raise his children significantly after a year, and some garbage scattered about how they are ready to continue his memory and the land is truly a beautiful place after all. Even if our father does not cooperate with us, this is because the future generations do not get into trouble. <br /> <br /> I have already seen Planet Earth. I was ashamed and cheated in my life.
