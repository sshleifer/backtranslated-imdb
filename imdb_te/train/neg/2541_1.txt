I never saw the original movie in the series ... I hope that these two terrible sequels were justified if it was a better movie than a sequel in the 1980s. The film has now made good progress when it was announced that one of the old old independent stations to show up on one of the past. Anything looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. But it is a film that looks dark on Walt Disney films. Actually, the film is mildly fluffy, with almost no bogey creature. The only true view is near the end when you see its shape during a very small storm, it is essentially a child other than there is no sign of creature which is really frustrating. The story is basically old nasty hunters must kill after anything that they see and after the boggle creature and after the kids end up with it just a few random eyelashes guy in the woods who likes to pull random boats through the water. I really do not want to see the movie, but that character was also created by a bad bungee for 80 years, but he is also very good in the 70s "The Town of the Dried Sundown".
