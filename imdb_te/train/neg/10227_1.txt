It is a well-known story about a man who marries to escape from the noise of Hangman, and then "deserves" his reluctant bride. It deals with sexist and racist at the same time. For instance, we have never been able to find out why a woman who won the honor of an Indian warrior can not fully accomplish herself to fight against her former husband. Or when all of its band members are taking care of things that are happening on their own, it is a source of excitement about why the "real man" is in the saddle. <br /> <br /> She has a stupid scene in her horse race and he really holds a whip - for the second time - she wears her horse. Keep in mind that for the first time he loses one eye, it's very hard to slap! Then, he succeeded in his fight against his Indian bodyguards, where he fell to Pulp for the first two quarters. It's some second wind. Later, he successfully negotiated with some bloodthirsty Indians (all of them in the film) and now she is "Squash" after they refused her. Keep in mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and has been negotiating with them for years. And the way he refuses his attempts to keep him interested and protect her without catching him - yes, that's right. <br /> Finally, the leaders are not convinced of their roles. Madison is just a jerk that gets miserably lucky. Fleming wraps her hair and sticks very tightly, but does not fully believe in a fiery male cat. Madison is connected to the runaway horse and pulled onto a hill before the end of the film. Madison is very imaginative as Fleming, and there are many obstacles that make you feel as if you see women as anything but blow-up dolls. You see them as dolls, you have the total lack of suspense. <br /> The whole waste of time. Even the view of the scenery is very dull. Give this a big miss.
