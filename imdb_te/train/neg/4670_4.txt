This adaptation is based on the novel * The Heires *, 1949 by Henry James. * Heyres, starring Olivia de Havilland, James is a well-respected writer, despite James's original storyline than this new remake of James's original title. The story of an awkward, yet loving daughter (lye), devoted to her father (Finney) after her mother died during childbirth. The proud father has no regard for his daughter, and thinks that she, as well as all women, are usually recognized. If a young man (Chaplin) wants to have a good family and a little luck, the father is naturally suspicious, but as his daughter is unable to show interest to anyone, the young man is a lucky hunter and she is forbidden to see him. Lee is a controversial actress Do you love her or hate her too much? And she always has her unique vacuity and her style, because she is acting with grid teeth. She's not bad in this, and she maintains her character relatively subtly ?? It is an awkward character for any actress to catch the audience through her shoulders and move her until she comes to her feelings. Although the character is very sympathetic, she does not particularly like it. The most beautiful and bizarre attractive Ben Chaplin (which appeared in the earlier * The Truth About Kates and Dogs *) plays a role in the absolute amount of inevitably guessing the audience after her fortune or in love with her. The film's level has increased significantly since Maggie Smith compared one of the finest actresses alive and the role of a well-known aunt. Finney threatens her disobedience with leaving her daughter, but it is amazing that the daughter loves to risk a loved one. But is she unlikely she wants her without her luck? * Washington Square * The only example that differs from Heres *. Another instance is the ability to stick with it. It is a beautiful picture that is too tedious, like a tiny peg, a very short story of a film.
