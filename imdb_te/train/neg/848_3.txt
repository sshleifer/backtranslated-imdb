Well, if you're looking for another basketball diary, it's a completely wrong image. <br /> <br /> I am surrounded by two brothers. Max, young, has a major cocaine addiction. Adam, big, a doctor. The film actually wants drugs to show the potential fierce fraud. This is not, however. This shows how the cocaine present situation is fun. Most of the film is Max and his unplanned routes. Eventually, Adam can not continue to stress and use it as well (apartheid drugs). <br /> <br /> The film is not nearly as climax. <br /> <br /> Cocaine really does what you do, has boring and low-budget scenes and big brother Adam's performance is terrible. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this film has been managed. To pass and receive awards, it is not a heart-venture. If you like a clear and true story film in the deepest world of drugs - if you do not buy 'Basketball Diaries'. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this picture, but if you want to enjoy it. Try it for yourself and see ...
