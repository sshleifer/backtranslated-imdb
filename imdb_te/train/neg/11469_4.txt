ORCA is not exactly bad, but it's not really Richard Harris's finest bell. A confused, a fisherman like Ahab, gets into the game of a retaliatory killer whale after killing Harris Wool's "wife" and unborn child. Charlotte plays a whale expert who is associated with Rampling Harris. She yells about how important she is to leave nature alone. He does not listen and end up in the Arctic who is struggling with a brutal whale reprisal of something. The whale's eye does not have any special effects except for what appears to be a round mirror --- Harris reflects the eye, and the audience understands who he is to the audience. Bow Derek, with Harris' crew, had a very unpleasant run, with Orca and most notably Robert Carridon, including Wilson Sampson and Keenan Wynne, having had a very unpleasant run.
