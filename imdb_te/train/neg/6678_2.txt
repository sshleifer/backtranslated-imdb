It is a copy of Romance in 1948 Doris de Classic, High Seas. </ P> <br /> The storyline is more or less, but it's contemporary. Govinda plays a sharp, intelligent man who replaces the husband. When the queen plays his wife's college friend, she does the same help. They try to capture each other, but the original husband and wife try to travel each other in Bombay. <br /> <br /> On this tour, Govinda Sunjeev's wife and intelligence had misled another girl, ravishing queen. <br /> <br /> Lever's father and son play a double role in the divorce proceedings, particularly the lawyers. <br /> This is a very small way to copy original classics, and the songs are very scary. Comedy slap-stick and do not laugh too much.
