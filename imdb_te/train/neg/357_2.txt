<br /> <br /> A strange cast, but this is a full-fledged cast by San Karen as Harvard Law Professor, Kate Kapusa (she still works?) With her wife (a slightly different age) and Laurence Fishburn racist Southern Cop (!) And Ed Harris Plays serious feelings with movie viewers ** (I do not want to see this film anytime seriously because of watching or watching the movie because of spoilers) I thought I would roll my eyes repeatedly in the liberal generalizations: cops are all fun and black with no evidence of the frame. Canary is a Harvard Law expert, who is a coach, witnesses and a lawyer who has raped him (he is a minor girl raped and murder suspect). Speaks about the injustices against the blacks and the untimely death penalty. <br /> <br /> By the small town officials and good IL 'boys club Canary Stonewald (the beginning ...) but finds it through the good IL' boys' club. In the case against Blair, the assassin accused of being executed now is all fictional. <br /> <br /> He was hit by a black cop (!) who played Russian roulette in order to admit him. Canary finds Hannibal's murder of Hannibal Letters-Ed Ed Harris, who killed Harris's murder, and assassinated him, and some teetels with some hysterical Honeybell Letter. <br /> <br /> "Blair is a psychotic psycho and it turns out that he's used as a" white guilt "to add Canary. <br /> <br /> For some of Blair Harris Instead of murders, he gave a story to Ed Harris. <br /> <br /> Blair again thanks to Canary's deceptive PC principles! <br /> <br /> "The whole system is corrupt and inefficient, cops They are harassed and Abu Ghavibe type victims, but criminals are really deserving of psychology and fishery. <br /> Every level of discouragement! The system is thoroughly decomposed and the types of PC white guilt who challenge it are seriously deluded. <br /> Two thumbs down. Canary certainly had to make a mortgage payment or something.
