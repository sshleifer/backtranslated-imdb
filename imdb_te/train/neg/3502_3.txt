Sarah Silverman is really a "flavor of the month" comic. Is she really worth all the hype? Yes and no. She is sometimes funny, sometimes so ridiculous (her standup routine is actually quite interesting, but not always funny). Other times, you're still feeling cheated by the media for overhyping another actor. She is one of those really beautiful comedians that pass men, especially saying they have dug intelligence and intellect. If you close them, most men agree that they want to sleep with her, so they will see her. Margaret Cho and Janeine Garofalo remind me of where many men have moved, although none of them are really "hot" in popularity. <br /> <br /> Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least pigs), so she must be hot at the age of 60, so her fans (especially men) are happy. <br /> <br /> For this show, she is like a comedy. This is fun when it's working. When it does not, it is completely bloated and is very, very boring. Here is the best of the Aids episode. It is consistently funny, and there are some really good irony in it. Brian Poshn's role is in an episode of an unhealthy encounter with the tab and is happy to see him in the tab T-shirt. But they really do not go anywhere, eventually giving it a welcome. Sarah's role in the series, Gay Couple (Brian Poshnen and some others) seems to have hit and really never will be for the entire show, and supporters (see Sarah's real life sister Laura, a thing like her) are OK. When jokes hit, they're brilliant. When they do not, they're awful, and I'm really awful. Today, there is also an invasion of Caprophilia (aka Pope Jokes), which appears to have replaced the original intelligence and intelligence in comedy. So how do you view this presentation? If you crush Sarah, go for it. You look at her and pretend she is yours. For her performance, it is from good to perfect zero.
