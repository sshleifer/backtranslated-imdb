Stephen King is generally known to be morbid, which is good, but this story is very soft. Some movies, in the end you feel sad for the characters or the conditions they are put through ... here you just feel depressed. The film was first stirred the family, and family living, creepy old Fred Gwyn smasanavatini pet greeting and warn them, but the plot will lead to nowhere. Louis <br /> <br /> (Dale midkoph), his wife, and his wife, Rachel (Denise Crosby), with their children, Ellie and Gage, and the cat will go to a new home in Maine. Lynch farmer neighbor Judd (Fred Guinea) warned about the local pet burial and how it was cursed. Lewis did not consider anything in this regard until the family cat died. He buried him in a cursed cemetery, and it will come back to life, constantly wanting to leave it constantly and alone at the family. One day, the baby was shot and killed by a truck gauge road rushing and Lewis know he smasanavatilo patipedatadani him. <br /> When Gauge comes back to life, he wants to change and kill. <br /> <br /> I have blamed directors and writers for not translating Stephen King's many films. In this case, Mr. King is screenwriter, but I'm going to blame him for his awful story. In the end it is understandable, and unfunny, though, is ridiculous in the premise. ఒక చిన్న పిల్లవాడు మరణం నుండి తిరిగి వచ్చి, ఒక చిన్న చర్మం లాగా కనిపించే వ్యక్తులతో చంపడానికి, మరియు దానికే కాకుండా, వారి శరీరాలను ఎత్తివేసేందుకు మరియు ఒక సందర్భంలో, నేల నుండి అటకపైకి తీసుకువెళ్లాడు! ) I know this is not actually set but seriously, how can stupid get this? Louis, Louis, who was killed in the death scene, it was a surprise to kill the cat had to be investigated, because the cat does not deserve it. All that it did was to think about it and to kill it. The scene that he sends his own infant son is almost impossible. Persever is not sad, but the whole situation is just awful to think. After killing the gaze instability before dying before death ... Why do the baby end up with death? But ... even worse, killing them in the cemetery, someone Louis smasanavatini (giving him) what he wanted .... Lucia campivesina the end of the original film? Why did Mr. King write this terrible story and why was it made into a movie? <br /> <br /> My rating: * Out of ****. 90 minutes. R. for violence
