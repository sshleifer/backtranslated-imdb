After watching some of the HBO's greatest items - Brothers of Brothers, Rome, etc. - I must have very high expectations before looking at the first episode of "True Blood". Jeez. Often the script appeared to be an eight year old, and some episodes are just a frightening film (I'll come to the scene where she saves the bill. She throws a chain at her guy and it's around her neck and it kills him wonderfully if you want me to be pretty embarrassed or A few moments before the scene, the couple went with the bill <br /> <br /> I think the show's idea is interesting, mysterious, witty, vampires human in our modern society. But honestly I do not really want to do more of this than a little soap performance, the average teen girl watches all the time but no one is about to Tincukuntaru ... Unfortunately, very little of it is the script, one of the best and most uhatmakamainadii vrayabadutundiidi nissaramainadi joke or something similar. <br /> <br /> If you want my opinion, the actors truly astounding performance. If they're kind of a kind, low-budget family TV show (well what may be, which if you remove the part of the family), the appearance will seem quite lighter. I am in the role of the only actor, Stephen Moyer Bill, who has some degree of eagerness to write poorly written, very short answers to "what are you?" "Can I call for a while?" He did good to bring some bloodthirsty part of a bloodthirsty part to someone else, in fact, to have a bloodthirsty character. Anna Paquin is okay, but more. But the guy, though, play with her brother, Geez, he is terrible. The scene where he was imprisoned was just a shame to modern televisions. Acting is good, the construction site is a duplicate of the bone, and the two other guys "Why is he imprisoned? Uh .. I will make silence ..." It was very difficult. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "We do not know what the people think, but they are just wrong, <br /> <br /> In the long run, she has touched the right frequency level and wants to hear everything they think, that is, unnecessarily haphazard. <br /> And finally, sex scenes <br /> <br /> I do not think I'm in that way, but I'm not sure if it's the bad thing, but I'm so disappointed that these comments did not come. It's not a good performance.
