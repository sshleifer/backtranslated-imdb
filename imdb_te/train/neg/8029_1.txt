A friend decided to give me this purchase (very cheap) and birthday. I thought I'd never seen it was the reason I found the curiosity of a joke and DVD, but then my friends and I really got bored and watched. From beginning to end! I know it's very good but it's really a masterpiece. It's hard to explain. You have to see it, there is a real lesson about what people can do when they believe that they are creativity and intelligent and can not really exist. "Acting" sous-terrain (you can really see a "famous woman" laugh in some cases laugh, she is definitely the worst). The "story" is composed of smoothie and really sucks everything in this film. Please pay special attention to "Sheriff". The person is an adult and does not need to take part in it. He is very bad. It has some happy moments. Check it out, haha
