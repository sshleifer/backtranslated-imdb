<br /> I do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not like this movie. Proposed themes: In the end we die, how should we live life? On the "light" path like Tomas; On the "massive" path like Terreza; Or do we want to know not to face questions like Sabina? How important is reliability in the relationship? How much does the career of our loved ones get torn? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I do not read Kubera 's novel, but when I refuse the film I will definitely do: <br /> <br /> The story follows this movie adaptation (which is my guess) or if it is discouraged from the beginning I need to understand what to understand. <br /> <br /> I am confused with positive comments that I have defined the film. Why do not I see the reasons. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are throwing on you and it is difficult to understand what drives them to their choices. <br /> <br /> The "secondary" characters are just to fill spaces but they can not add anything to the story and you wonder when they really need it. How Tomas betrayed him is nothing good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. He is not human, in some sense. <br /> If his self-confidence fails, he learns that he relies on others and mentally associates with anyone, and I can not find a credible explanation. <br /> <br /> 4) The artist like Sabina is much less likely to want. Her lifestyle in a Communist country in 1968. On top of that, the three main characters are all very successful on their Sundays, which sounds strange to me. A) How can Teresa become a good photographer? <br /> <br /> 5) Fake notes of English speaking English are ridiculous. I'm not even tongue. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments praised Prague as being beautifully given: I have been filmed by a lot of film, so it is not difficult to give the film the concept of Eastern Europe, and it's not difficult to make it look good when given Prague's inner beauty. <br /> 7) I was sort of trivial to the end. Finally, Tereza and Tomas, who are happy in the rural areas, stay away from the temptations of "metropolitanity", their fellow citizens from social struggles, dying from their careers and die in a car accident. But after learning that they are happy they die. What is that? If they die unhappily, will the movie message be different? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> 8) The film is unclear in the film and the only way the character is directed. You'll see them for about three hours, but in the end you get nothing. <br /> <br />) Stop the "restaurant" scene (some comments are very much appreciated). Why did Sabina get such a strong response? Why does Franz agree with her? I did not really see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has got a very bad nature and very strong personality. That's it. <br /> <br /> After these negative comments, there are two scenes that I liked most (hence I gave them both). <br /> <br /> "The Russians Prague, the world of what is happening in Prague, <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a small possibility of deliberately "designing" as the "Tomas Types" go. If this is the case (i g Tiga doubted, though), and then modify my opinion dramatically.
