My husband and I are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same town screenwriter of this movie. We were very worried that the film was filmed by the JCC for its Jewish Film Festival due to the way Martin was portrayed by a mental disability character. When it came out we went to see the movie in the local theater. We demand that money be withdrawn. <br /> <br /> We do not want to see Frankie - mental impairment and possibly autistic teenager - as part of a joke <br /> <br /> "Frankly, nothing is to suggest Frankie's role than saying" Hey, mentally ill is fun ". Challenges like Frankie are a serious thing. <br /> <br /> The protagonist needs to explain himself. Did she know families with disabled children? Will she see families with disabled children after a week at the JCC pool?
