<br /> <br /> I think it's one of the worst films I have ever seen in a long time. <br /> Trying to get 'same characters' with different people * is a bad idea. If they do not miss Sarah Michelle and Ryan P., they have to cut their losses and heck it up. Instead, what they do is terrible new actors. <br /> I thought I was in this high school (bad) college. Is this their first film? It certainly looked. <br /> <br /> The film is actually a parallel to some kind of conversation. I've been looking for the first time and first popped up in # 2. I'm excited to see the second one and I have been a bad show for a while. I've never been to ever * ever shut down * Ever, but it went exactly 30-40 minutes later.
