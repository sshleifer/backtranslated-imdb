Wow, my first review of this film was negative as it was a mistake. I will try this one downstream. That's true !!! Nobody wants to see Chuck Norris's film, where he is not the main character. At the end there is a good fighting scene, but the rest of the film is stunk. I thought the old chuck was not the best one. Do he expect junk out of this way and expect him to take him through the whole picture of his fame? Chuck is a fantastic martial artist, and as we have seen from Walker, Texas Ranger, a good actor, but the trick does not include these features in his films, and this is not. We are very disappointed to Norris fans. Chuck, be in the lead role of your films, because it does not work for you ... Gary
