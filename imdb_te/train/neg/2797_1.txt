I'm a great fan of horror style! I love all kinds of horror / slasher / gore flicks. Some of my favorites are really "good" bad horror flicks. But there is no guarantee that these movies will see it! <br /> <br /> "The act is awful." FX is not even worth discussing. "Set" a perfect joke !! <br /> <br /> I feel like there are some probabilities in the pair of actors in this movie, but this vehicle has not left them to work !!! <br /> "And I feel stealing !! It's good that you cut your cat at the time you're looking at it.
