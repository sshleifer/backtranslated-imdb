It's a poor picture, but I should give this one a lead actress ... Francis Forbes. She was at least acting and I personally thought of her as beautiful. Very bad she looks like an other movie in the database only. In addition, the film is filled with ludicrous gore and fake death scenes. People are washed away and they are smashed like blood 2 gallons! But, if you like to watch poor horror movies, I highly recommend this.
