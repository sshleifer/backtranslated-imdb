Hip. Romantic. She is so sexy ... whatever. It is "The Terminator" with Werewolves. <br /> Severely. The police saves the girl (servant!) From the big monster and refers to her as his 'rescuer'. The main actor Ryan Alosio makes a good job of Kyle Reis Emulate ... a police premise is a massacre ... bad guy has muscles of red eyes ... and it also has the dialogue along lines "It's yourself, he can never stop. The script is for the first time from the screenwriter, thanks to God, from which nothing has been sold and all the notoriously bad <br /> <br /> Film strip bar (always a good sign), and a simple-looking biker guy followed three explosions, three cops for obvious three reasons: one of them was black, and (shock horror!) <br /> <br /> If the movie goes to the next hour or so, then a slightly better action sequence Quite a little with the queens, what can they do with a director who is ready to settle down for a bad script and lesser.If they do not have anything else to learn how to work in Alicio, it shows the talent, along with the supporting cast. In his human form Dark Wall played with Kane Hodder - famous for many of Jason Voire's films in 'The Friday The 13'. <br /> <br /> It is famous for groups of horny teens boys, for a lesbian roof scene between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams. Former 'Power Rangers' twice in a great tradition of actresses. And the editor is unnervingly obvious that WAY in that scene spends a lot of time ... Whatever, the main renewal feature is rather good for physical werewolf effects, and the wolf design is not bad at all. But CGI is bad. Just plain bad. If you can not reach a certain level of realism, I will seriously understand why - why are you struggling? Just throw a little extra money in make-up! From the terrible script, this movie has moments of it, most of which are unexpectedly funny. It's fine to laugh if you're not good, but it does not cost money on it. Please.
