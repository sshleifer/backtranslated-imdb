<br /> <br /> Screenplay - In particular, Voice Over Kim Basinger: Movies are not books; * Show action instead of voice * to let us know what's going on. Occasionally I found a movie with a voice on those pictures, but the lazy way of writing the script here seems more. <br /> <br /> I felt like no emotion in relation between Jesse and Brother Thomas and Alex Carter's performance was very bad. It is a major failure for me to define Jessie and Thomas's characters - there is no connection between them, she's just a stud and it's something that's sexually abusive for him. If this was done correctly, the relationship between them gave more context to the story. <br /> <br /> With the book (3), I learned about Jesse's medieval life crisis. In this movie, it looks just plain boring. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I did not think the movie was too bad to stop the TV. . . That idea did not happen to me.
