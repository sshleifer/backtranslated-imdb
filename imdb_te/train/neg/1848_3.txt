There are bad movies, then they have movies that are SO bad, almost want to become art. It is one of these films. My partner and I still have both kind of shell's shock, you know, watching off and drooling into space! The people you participate (I hope they will change their names to protect themselves) have an explosion, and they certainly will not be ashamed. I'm giving ten people to ten people with gracious smile and really bad gore effects. I can not say laughing too long in the movie, so I can say it's a good time. Beware of the viewer, there's nothing to say, it's a good movie because it's not. I can say in my defense, it's impossible to make a film with such a great title!
