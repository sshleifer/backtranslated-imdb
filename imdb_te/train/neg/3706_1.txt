I have to watch some great white guy who starred as the whole joke of the movie Chris Rock, and then see Chris Rock react to people's responses. Instead you see Chris Rock himself and people are not aware of him. They can have 2 scenes in the entire movie they use for their gimmick. This should have been very good.
