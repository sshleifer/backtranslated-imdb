The story of Edison is good, but one actor completely ruins the whole movie. Justin Timberlake destroyed this film with every line of the film. One of the worst actors I've seen so far is F.R.A.T. Team. <br /> Whether it's an emotional scene, a scene scenario, or a silent scene, Justin Timberlake was able to destroy it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Even if you do not have any good, you have done a wonderful job for people to think that you can really sing.
