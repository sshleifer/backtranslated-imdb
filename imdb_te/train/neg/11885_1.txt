I make impartiality to some of the legendary filmmakers who are known for his nerve New Yorker person because it is just insulting to such a director, to draw comparisons with the obviously unclear Josh Kornbloth. I do not refer to spot-on sarcastic 'office space' in the same breath in this celluloid disaster. But do I compare it to your own surgery time? It's painful to see and it's amazing that you know what surgeries are really doing. The Haiku Tunnel is the type of image you wish to like pulling the plug into the initial stages of the product. This is cruel to live and, as a result, the audience is suffering from the whole world. <br /> <br /> The movie mantle ?? If it is actually one ?? Not worth discussing, but for caution I will. Josh Kornbloth, a temporary worker with a strong commitment-fear, is given a permanent job. His main task is to mail 17 high priority letters for his employer. But ludicrously, he was unable to do this simple job. My response? Big deal! Is not it a story ?? It's the best-ending idea - if it has adopted any self-respecting filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The famous actor ?? If you called him? A man's clumsy buffoon, chubby features, a motionless, anonymous line, and a series of facial expressions, which terribly confuse. O Where did the director find this schmuck? What are you saying ??? Is he a director? Oh, my fault. Your own difficulty of playing a screen is one thing you can play, but I suspect that Mr Cornblob is not convincing as a human being, let an actor know. The rest assured, that no aimless character is not killed, but before I've never riled by the presence on an actor screen! My camera monologues were totally disappointing between the scenes. If an observer wants to spy on the move to understand this move, Kornblab describes us more actions (the first rule of filmmaker: "Do not Tell Demonstrate"). Who does he think of this person? He has no charm, no charm, and his Hawaiian shirt does not have the sense of judgment and style. <br /> <br /> Supporting actors did nothing to reduce the boredom I felt, but an exception. Patricia Schenlan appears to be a very funny role as Helen's former secretary, who drives mad by her old owner, having a flashlight under her face, and she hurts phone calls from the basement. This made me very curious, but the moment was quickly closed and I returned to check my watch for the rest of it. <br /> <br /> The title of the film is also inappropriate. The Hika Tunnel's oldest story is not related to Japanese poetry. Do not be fooled into thinking that it's an imposing sounding title or the fact that it played only a few cinemas and did not actually make money at the box office? <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
