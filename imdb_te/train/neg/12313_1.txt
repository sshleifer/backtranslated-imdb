This is not the worst movie ever made by Steve Martin or, but definitely from his best. Obviously, he made this garbage for pay check. Such a wreck does nothing to raise his fame as a funny man. As he realized, when people go to watch Steve Martin's film, they are likely to be entertained by those who are not bored with tears. He was sad to see him dan EyeCoyd and Phil Hartman. I do not understand why talented people can not hold the fact that people want to see them in lousy movies. If you want to call a comedy, it must be funny. It's not. It is insulting in the US military to be involved with these pubs. The finished metal jacket has smiled more than this painful excuse for a "service comedy". Sure, Phil Silvers moves in his grave.
