As you all know, the JIGSAW did not go to Blockbuster for a full member's own member, Devin Hamilton. Devin is one that sells all video chains. He recently released a film BLEED, which he sold at Blockbuster at the same time, JIGSAW. He convinced the blockbuster buyer to not take any jazz, and the blade number doubled. As a result the jigSAW appears to be a flop, and the blade is a hit. That's the main issue that ever bleed is one of the worst films, and as we all know, the jigsaw is, well, gold. I want you to go to the BLEED page on the Internet and vote for your movie that Jues Man has fought for, and your talent. Similarly, you should go to the JIGSAW page and vote for it (if you do not already). We need to get at least a 8 or 8.5 gin, and surround a 2 (by putting the internet on the 100 worst image list). <br /> <br /> Try to persuade friends and family to do the same
