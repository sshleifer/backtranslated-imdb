There is some truth to this movie. I recall the story that I discovered a body of 4 fishermen from 15 to 20 years ago and did not report it until their tour was complete. I also remember that I could interfere with the body (or some charge). I'm not sure if it's in Australia. Viewers outside Australia feel that we will live in a country full of relatives and serial killers. Wolf Creek and the film encourage this understanding. This film reminded me of a simple plan. But it is one of the best Australian films ever, and I can not say what I have said generously. Keep it this way and do not hurt me again.
