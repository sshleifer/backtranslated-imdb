I see the film that Amber Benson Rocks and Nick Stall are pretty cool - any movie that shows both my favorite and respectable actors is not bad. And in that sense, I was right - considering the dialogue making cringe they gave, both of them work reasonably well. It's not perfect to stop the movie when dying, but you can do it as much as I can through a 75 minute minute picture (and the main sign of an awful movie: in 40 minutes you can find out where to start problems in "Tab" The conversation, as it is said, is terrible; wooden and totally unnatural .Jones Jones's performance is unbelievable (And literally, not one of the big 'twists in the film' that anyone is surprised to be a pediatrician) is not understood. <br /> < <br /> <br /> The three images of the film are very low, with very little success and awkward tracking Atlu, which is awarded for the fact that Amber Benson, and the last one of the jokes that made me a little bit to strike the ground is thrown in. At any time, at any time, for any paristhitulalonaina I would not recommend this movie. Avoid at all costs.
