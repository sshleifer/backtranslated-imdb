It's the worst picture I've ever seen. Michael Wurtan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks absolutely awful by the whole movie, the hair is very bad! They speak singular voices and there is NOU chemistry. The cover of the DVD does not even come close to what the image actually remotely. Really, really boring. It's very painful to see that because I went ahead with some of it. Would you like to know what I think is really good for anyone on earth? hhaha is literally just like talk and "yeah" and what kind of hobbies do you ever have. I can not tell you that they are in love. We're sorry, but this is not a tragedy for a movie I've seen.
