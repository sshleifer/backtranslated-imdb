I was so bad at Dark Angel. The film's "tribute" to the pin-up will always appreciate the movie - although there is little "content" that the film does not really mean. I can not really see what the movie's inspiration or "point" - the narrative has very little life information given in the article - so do not know too much about the beetle they do not know too much after watching DARK ANGEL either <br /> <br /> This film is basically a slave In the past few years, in the modeling model, The whole film consists of Betty's "renowned" photo-shoots and "repeats" of traps. These reconstructions literally take up to 75% of the run-time of the films and do not give Betti a sense of perception. The film succeeded in its short-term statutory acting, and left the "business" and made the next decision to become a religious one, but the long and drawn re-reconfiguration scenes are all but Dark Dale is not a horrible film - it's just not a substance. The other actress who plays Betty is really similar to her in the films that are far away - that is the closure. Another thing that makes me bored is that although Bettie has made several fraudulent modeling shoots - a small piece of a zoo at the end of nudity in the film. This film is obviously a very low-budget, but it can be set in its limits and makes up for dressing - so I do not have any shouts from me. Acting is pretty woody and unmemorable from everyone else. In fact, the most memorable thing about the whole film is that the actor, who played the real name of Irving Clown, is the duck flywaveter. Check out any joke - cast list. I can not say that I highly recommend this one unless you own the real Bettiefile completist and anything related to her. And if you turn off that bad - then you need to seek treatment anyway ... 4/10
