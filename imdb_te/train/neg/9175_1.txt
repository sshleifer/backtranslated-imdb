About the worst picture I have ever seen. The film compares the quality of movies like "Thi" & "Cabin Fever", but they also have actors, one of which is low. The "eye candy" of the film saw 50 people with a bad face lift. (Quality is just one example). If possible, I rated this movie negatively. Ladies have to tell you that I'm not bad to look at men, but either too. If you plan to watch this movie, I will recommend your money.
