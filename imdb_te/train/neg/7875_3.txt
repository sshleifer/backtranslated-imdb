Les Wisconsin, the first film about medieval time passenger is actually funny. I liked Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. <br /> <br /> Now this sequel has the same characters, the same actors and the same novels. Time travel. The stories are now changing slightly because the characters currently have experienced time travelers. So they jump up in history, in advance of the movie you actually get the Observer without any attention. <br /> <br /> Duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep the whole thing together with his character, but his character is emptied so he can not do much to save the film. <br /> Now the Duke's addict / assistant, he really has all the attention. The film is just about him and his clumsy / annoying / stupid or what he is supposed to be. The fact; This character tries to produce a smile from the audience, but he is unsuccessful. <br /> If someone tells you that you really are a bad joke, you already know, but until the end of the joke, adding details, he emphasizes that you take your worries a little longer. You liked Les Visitors, do not spoil the flavor in your mouth with the sequel. If you do not like les vacators, you can not see the sequel. If you liked this sequel ... well, I suppose you still have to watch a lot of movies.
