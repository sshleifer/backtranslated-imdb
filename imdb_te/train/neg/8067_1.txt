First of all let it be that my boring movies should be on top of my list. Nothing, and nothing in this movie is thrilling even remotely. It is very confusing and as far as you want to end it! I want some people to "think" through the whole movie, and I tell you ... "You have more energy" !! On the other hand I was entertained. This brings me back to this stinker, not entertainment. This film is stupid and waste of time is complete. Many agree here too. This does not feel too much, and by the time you have a scene that you found around another lame scene and .... I guess I guess I guess it's well predicted. Avoid, this one sucks ... bad !!
