The film gave me a 2 star rating, because I personally appeared in the film in 42 and 43 minutes ... The Road Side Bar scene in Russia. In this scene the director gave me the immortal line - "50 dollars .. you are a drink and talk", but I thought I could talk with my Polish colleague more convincing Russian voice than I thought, so I refused to take it. It was my first film experience that I was in a little breath ... and who knows ... these lines are "I'll be back" and "Many Frankie My dear, I Do not Give a Damon". If I speak a line my name is Riszard Aluminum's Riszard appears as 'Heavy 1' instead of Janikovsky. <br /> <br /> "South Wales Hot Spot Barry Island, tell me what no original storyline is." Caterers and Wardrobe The lady all interacted with it seemed to have a lot of swearing and nudity ... I could have been worse if movies like naked in this terrible things could be worse .... <br> <br /> And yet ... the positive side .... I've chatting to Rice Ifans during a break. "Nut Wing Hill "is still not released, but he is not known. .......
