I really do not like this movie ... mainly because of the main characters! They are both immature, selfish, and self-centered people. They hurt everyone else around playing their crazy game. Visual effects are good but they are good if you do not have any characters or a hero you're interested in. Are these two mental people happy when they finally finish their mutual love? <br /> <br /> When I saw the film, I thought "I was # 1 smash from France?" <br /> <br /> * For the conclusion: RIDDANCE good! Both of them are eligible! <br /> <br />
