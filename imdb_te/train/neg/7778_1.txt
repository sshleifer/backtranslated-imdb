It's a cheeky, stupid, most retarded monster at all times. It's a complete joke that has been extended to theaters. This is sort of like looking at the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This film deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten. John Caradine, you are shameful. People involved in this Marconi pile of garbage should be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I'm giving them a lot of credit. I'm sure they are lobotomized before filming. How else is it describes thorough and pure stupidity that contains this bucket of garbage. Do not waste your life a minute. Do not waste time to send a review.
