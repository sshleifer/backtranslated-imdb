I liked the Batman Tv series and this is really awaited. <br /> <br /> They tried to get the Batmobile back to the story of Adam West and Bat Ward. They have been 35 years since they appeared at Batman or Robin, but they wore clothing suits and struggled with 'badges'. I would rather comment on the X-Stars. <br /> <br /> For a film of flashbacks, I think it's too short and will go a long way. It's just a quick overview in my opinion. I want more background. They showed penguin and jokers for one minute to tell the same thing I had known earlier. The Joker has a mustache in his makeup and although he hated it and smoked, the penguin came to smoke. <br /> I love to read that book. I know that it's too much to show. Why is 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman or 3 Mr. Freeze. Commissonor Gordon, Chief Ohara, Alfred, Mr. Freeze, King Tut, etc. are on the list. <br /> I also say I'm like this. <br /> <br /> Very frustrating. And really corn.
