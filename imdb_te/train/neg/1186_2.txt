The Valerian Borovakics La Betti (1975) was evident in various ways: some feared, some feared, and others praised courage. <br /> <br /> Why are you totally controversial, frustrated, and asking for an intellectual journey to move in orbit on an important topic of involuntary and inconsistent imagery? <br /> What is this movie actually? Does sexuality increase in woman? I have seen great images on this subject, but this is not one of them. Trying to figure out the growing sexuality in at least one of the girls who try to identify himself as a storytelling with animals (naked). There are no characters, no role is studied. A woman who has sex with a black buttar (who is also classified as a beast?) Has a very strong attitude towards sexuality, so where is this stability? Is it a film about religion? Yes, we need a little more theiccic material than a priest without function, character and attraction, but with the desire to put two young children away. <br /> Is it about goodwill? Realistic testing requires realistic characters, especially for the film's transformation to prohibit any realistic test of animals. There is no real fatality here. Some epic beast and two priests speaking each other about the sinful sin. Enough for college article on the topic? <br /> What about sex? About anything? I do not know. I've shot a shotgun and the film does not make a movie. Dealing with the subject must be more than just displaying its own communities with the theme. <br /> <br /> So look across the controversy. Do not be afraid by bestiality, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and stuff. I'm not. The director's cerebral handmade experiment with a hypnotic slow-paced look around the bush in a hypnotic slow manner is a look of what you see, and it's poorly edited, poorly edited, poorly behaved, really poorly written (okay, some pictures are very good, and the main character is a good looking girl) Make the story brilliant. It's not. It makes it boring.
