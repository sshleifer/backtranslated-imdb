I'm my father of Anthony Park, Glen Park. At first I would say that the story behind the film and the creation of Amber alert system is good. However, the film is also poorly produced and the acting is terrible. The main problem with the film is with Nikhol Timmons and Father Glenn Park in the second film. The events around that part of the story are not entirely correct. My father suffered from mental disorders at the time and succeeded Nichich with no intention of harming her. He loved her as a daughter and thought she was coming from her mother who was less concerned for her by the age of 3, by protecting her from harm or negligence coming from her father, and she mocked her mother. This film is depicted as going to harm my father in shape or form. The funny thing is that Nichol has spent many nights at my father's, but when Sharon works or does her work. The reason is that his father was actually violent because he had items to be considered weapons on his truck. My father is a landscaper. What they think is a weapon is the gardening tools that he puts in his truck at all times. My recommendation is that this movie will be made with salt grains, although it is a good story and true events, but the details of the film (at least Nicholtmans - part of Glen Park) is not very wrong and the director fails to tell the story of the story. The funny thing is that if the director interviewed Sherron friends, they learned exactly what they had posted here.
