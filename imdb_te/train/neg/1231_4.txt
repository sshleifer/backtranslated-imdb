Della Mears (Kim Basinger) is a high-profile housewife living with her twin boys and her abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Shepher) in a private home in the suburb. Della neglected her home and her appearance, embarrassed Kenneth and attracted the attention of the twins. On Christmas Eve, she went into the local mall at night to buy wrapping paper for gifts, and she could not find any parking space available. When she saw an old car parked in two places, she sent a message to the owner of the so-called "selfish gear". When the mall ends, the della car catches the old car driver and threatened by her four punks ?? Chaki (Lucas Haas), Afro-American Hui (Jamie Star), Chinese-American Wing (Leonard Wu) and Latin Tomas (Louis Chavez). When the security guard of the mall saves her, he is shot dead by Chuckie's head, and Della attempts to escape his car from criminals. But the gang chased a forest near her forest. <br /> <br /> A few days ago, I saw the trailer of "She's Was Out" and I was eager to see the DVD. . Unfortunately the trailer is better than this movie, and I'm totally disappointed with this dull and undisturbed Collections Collection. Della Myers is an unprotected and negligent housewife and unhappy as a wife; Motherhood is her only interest in the concept of her family. She is driven by four ordinary criminals, but beat them with a toolbar that appears as Batman's purpose belt. Thus, the plot is very absurd. A gang of criminals is a favorite clip of American films, politically correct with the American Lord alongside Afro-American, Chinese-American and an American Lord. Kim Basinger has good performances, but their children are too young for a fifty-five year old woman. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Encanto How Eta Four" ("Want To Be Out Of It")
