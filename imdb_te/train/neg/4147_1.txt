I'm keen on ruthless films, my cheesy and right ridiculous game. So suppose my soul I went to the local rental shop, and found Vampires vs. Zombies. <br /> You know that this name is just too entertaining, no one in the world can remove them, it's just bad. <br /> And boy, it's bad. After watching this horror-icic movie, I literally, is speechless. My friend and my friend sat outside without talking to each other for several minutes, after seeing this film, there are two thoughts about the future of our lives. I broke openly silent silence and said, "... what is dude?" Yes, I'm an exciting person. <br /> <br /> 'Quick' Street Review 'The Plot' here; "WTF" mode has always been, there's always, no one. Letters; Not developed, can not forget. Music; Worse than romance. Vampires; Waters vampires Zombies; Their zombies <br /> <br /> Finally; Everyone wants to see this movie, I want to see honestly and painful. Do yourself a favor, watch it and get depression.
