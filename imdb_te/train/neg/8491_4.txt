Although some rarely touched as "virtual sets" in the background of Ada Lovelace and Victorian interior actress in her circle, the film is small and ultimately disappointing. The newly arrived Francesca Farideni seems to be skilled, but wasted as Emmy, in the middle of the film Lady Ada is more than monitored than a self-explanation. When Lady Ada (Tilda Swindon) appears, 'sister' is cheating; In her facial expression, the camera makes her look more opaque or memorable, which makes it possible for her to show Emmy's "fictional" rendering dramatically. <br /> <br /> Ada Lovelace's simple life history is worthwhile, but this film unfortunately makes a hash for both Lady Ada's life, and the modern computer scientist (and her widely-drawn, Dalit boyfriend).
