Where are you Michael Cain when you need him? I've seen a lot of MST3K's many seasons, but this rare front is one of the worst films made for the 1st season (episdoe K-20) easy. Three "stars", Lee Majors, Chris Makepace and Burgess Meredith, are always struggling through the worst batch of cinematography, a secret dick genre composed by Exxon and GM attorneys must deliver lines that must be delivered to transport and energy efficiency research. It seems to have been shot in the whole dark in Super 8. Logan Run Look Makes With Cinemas Sistine Chapel Shakespeare. I can not imagine watching Crow and Servo's commentary because it is incomplete with it. What exactly needs in Hollywood is the 401K is the sort of which prevents the need to take bad movies like this to pay for their health care. Finally, I look forward to seeing a Charlton Heston guest who will deliver his "cold dead hands" speech, with the theme "right to make it contaminant and drive". Lee, I forgot it in 1989, but 1981?
