First of all, I was definitely excited when I saw the teaser trailer for Wendy Wu. Brenda Song, one of the hottest men in Disney Channel, is doing martial arts and I am fine with that movie. This action was not properly built, the film was not real to anyone, fighting was unrealistic and it was accompanied by a story. If you really think about it, it's a vanabe buby the Vampire Slayer, the daughter of the other warriors, wants her to abandon her call and want to become the queen of the house, fight against some ancient evils. The idea is just not original, the film is waste of time.
