I have 2 home entertainment stores and I have seen very bad movies in my time, but it's very bad, here it insures me to register and comment on it. How bad is it? <br /> <br /> Say hello to Oscar for his performance in Sofia Coppola's Guadafar III. When compared to Gaia Kalagandde in this movie <br /> <br /> It is robotic and uninteresting. A month before her arrival at the Rubber House, her boyfriend gave her just. Once there, she realizes that she has cheated her throughout her relationship, but no one of her has registered with her. One day, she has a relationship with Leslie (Dafoe) the guardian of the house. <br /> <br /> Although she married Duffy, her scenes with him are cold and ineffective. <br /> If there is a plot, I miss it. Willem Daphou can not save the film from the awesome cinematic train wreck.
