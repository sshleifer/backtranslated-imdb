<br /> I did not find any jokes <br /> <br /> Many of the scenes were pulled (Tilt and Zoom were less than 5 minutes a minute) And director. <br /> <br /> I laughed 2-3 times in the entire film. <br /> <br /> Acting is not that bad too. <br /> <br /> I have suggested that you should not suffer from this film unless you are a huge DND fan and it is also clear to be clear.
