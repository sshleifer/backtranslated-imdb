I enjoy a good, slow-moving play. Christmas in August, Chunging Express, Virgin Stripped Bear by Her Bachelors, The Way Home, Springtime in a Small Town, Hana By, Eat Drink Man Woman, Dolls, In the Mood for Love, and Spring Summer Fall Winter Spring ?? Just to name a few. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is a subset of the films in the theatrical scene, which does not like when trying to repel the coats of good films. Are these all called INN movies? "Incomprehensible artistic nonsense." Sai Ming-Liang is the king of this subgenre, and Vive L'Amour is his "masterpiece." In fact, it is the creme de la creme of the worst-faced garbage in the pursuit of "art". People, in their apartments, drink water, pay phones, vacate pay phones, posters, important documents, go to the bathroom, eat, make flowers, slap on sex and mosquitoes, I'm joking when I say, the perfect compilation of the whole film, which is the philosopher for the meaningless art house trash postarchaild. No plot, storyline, interesting or notable events, emotion, meaningful conversation, and most importantly? <br /> <br /> Do you have two people "hitting" on a couch for a person under a very soft scenery? It is also completely tasteless and contradictory that is trivial. The role of characters on the bed does not exist practically. Sai did not intend to communicate to the viewer of these individuals rather than the obvious fact that they definitely want to "bang". The guy under the bed is just a dimensional and uninteresting. He prefers to drink water, making watermelons and stroke. This is the idea of ​​"development of character". <br /> <br /> The real contribution of Sai in Viv L'Amour is perhaps the worst scene in art-house film history. He first shows the main actress walks all the way from one end of a park to 285 consecutive seconds, only then to show her cry frantly ?? For absolutely no reason ?? Another 356 seconds. The film ends suddenly. No point. No entertainment. Only a clean, concentrated torturer made a viewer. <br /> <br /> "The underlying background of loneliness is very difficult to bore the real feel of the film, Kyoshi Kurosawa gives me a very good overview of loneliness in Cairo and what is it expected? It's really interesting! This film was slowly molasses in January, but solved a lonely concept than the complete waste of what Vive L'Amour calls <br /> <br /> Cairo fans are grateful to Sai Ming-Liang because of the film-making film B-Grade, Television Art house snobs are now officially lost to their pedestrians for self-righteousness.The quality level of your precious genre is now Darkness How do you love them apples?
