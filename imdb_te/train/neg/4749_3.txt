The film was very short written and directed and I was sleeping 30 minutes through the film. Although the jokes in the film are corny and the plot is interesting on some aspects, it is very far away and at some points-ridiculous. If you are aged 11 or older, you will be discarded and disappointed in the movie, but if you are 10 or younger, the movie will capture your attention and be surprised by all the adventures (I can not do it properly) and wish you some warriors. The cast is not good at the film, and the music is very disappointing because they are trying to increase the pressure, but it is not fit. Actors in the film (1, 2 are terrifying) 1. Scale 4. Brenda Song has a skill in comedy, but with this kind of film, her acting in some serious scenes is ridiculous. If she did some of her "fighting", I started laughing. I think she is very stupid, the guy becomes possesing, and how the silver's (Brenda Song) teachers have teachers in the school have her teachers at school, for example, she is directed to the worst thing about the film, for example, her enemy evil villain, her voice becomes dark and bad It's pretty ridiculous. So it's all sensitive, disappointing picture, but you're 10 or younger.
