As a gamer, I can not say I like this movie. True, I hate it right down. <br /> <br /> "I have a lot of reasons. <br /> <br /> 1. The characters are unrealistic and I think all the different walks of life The players did not know any of the characters in the film, and the producers of this film took the most vulnerable aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them to 5 people. <br /> <br /> The style does not work, and the mockumentary style fits ill for the subject of the movie.The actual documentary on the gamers actually works better. <br /> <br /> It's very good (keep it together smoothly) <br /> <br /> Conversation is weak and weird, it seems that there is no real world context. <br /> <br <br> /> <br /> "Do not joke. Self-depressing humor is one of my group and many other troubles I've encountered, such as less self-restraint and more toilet comedy. Similarly, the gamer is not full of jokes and events, a toilet comedy in a large part of humor. <br /> <br /> Many gamers listen and boycott those who do such jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is this mainly: accuracy. I'm not the rules, instead of dynamics. Certainly, the film is also comparable to low-budget films to The Gamers and the Comers: Dornness Rising, both of which are the original players as the original player. Gamers: Movie, where you can say something like Gamers, offers you the situation where you can beat crazy versus players: "Huh, I know a guy like that ... Yep, that's exactly like Gary."
