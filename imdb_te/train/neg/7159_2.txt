<br /> <br /> I have never seen a horror film as "The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre", but I thought it would compete with it. <br /> <br /> I was watching a movie that was not a sleeping man but after 15 days I started doing trance. I woke up, and it started looking agian. Why am I worthy? <br /> <br /> The film is tortured for everything, so I have to go ahead to finish watching. <br /> <br /> I do not think any of my favorite actors (I think he is an assistant to the director of the director, or he is really in the work to make money in the film because he will kill him. What about the movie? It's not horrific, stupid plot, the characters are very horrible (but I played the role played by Jared Harris), the effects are very weak <br /> <br /> Anyhow, when I look into the video cover, I'm disappointed when this movie "Stephen King", I never present this rubbish (I rented it in Argentina) I did not recommend it for over a million years. <br /> <br /> I rated the film as 10 out of 2 . (Reporter of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, "the review of the movies will be much worse, not why it deserves 10 out of 1)
