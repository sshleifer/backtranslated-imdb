Weak plots, imaginable violence, semi interesting characters. The writer (also one of the stars?) Made his own screw-ups "fantasy" of fantasy and drug trafficking and "murder". From the speculative rap and home soundtrack, the family clashes, it's played low, stereotypical, and ultimately terribly boring. The front title was also held - IMDb listed the FIVE movies of the same name released in 2007-2008 !! <br /> <br /> Note: I have seen in Showtime, which listed the summary in one of the other movies. I did not secretly cover halfway before I realized it. Even if it's another stereotype, it's interesting.
