I have to add a disagreement here. Wong Kar-wai or How-Hosso-Hsien-I would like to read different reviews of this film. That is one of the famous floats of Mandarin Goodies, our way is coming in recent years. Unfortunately this is not very accurate. The film plays an unmistakable school graduate attempt to imitate these masters. All the pieces are - beautiful background, obscure minimalist speech, slow-motivating camera, and leads the male, especially, who spend time on the fair walk around sitting around the pastime. Sounds good but unfortunately nothing is equal. Leads to conversation. Acting is not usually possible to lift the letters above the type; The married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving. Unfortunately, the median character acting is combined with a traditional "Chekovian" (ie, very predictive) plot, the results are very tedious and the worst painful. For example, I could not help to see the "Blue Danube" river scene, for example, when walking on style parody (the "springtime" sky on the river provided the black comedy of humor ...) by Mark Lie Ping depicting it. While the setting is sleek, the sweat camera tries to reflect the mood of "Shanghai Flowers", which is not visually in the same league. An hour later, I suddenly remembered that I was going to meet my flatmate for dinner and (I went out and remembered the last movie). Guessing from reviews I may have left the end of the positive backstage but I do not care at that moment. If you want to see similar lines with real talent, the two directors mentioned above, for example "Love for Mood" or "Shanghai Flowers", I would recommend both the talented Mr. Ping (former Chris Doyle), and both have enough to influence these failed simulations Feature films. It often does not mean Mr Holborn will lead me astray, and maybe you'd rather listen to him, but do not say you have not warned. <br /> <br />
