Shock still watching the video store is how Steve Siegel with his track record of Bad Action Movies can still hit the shelves in less than 3 years. The 3rd lowest Attrak power is the first promise of the science fiction genre for our long seagull. The pictures of the bad movies of the movie have been beaten before my eyes. But they are not a bit of entertainment without entertainment, they are not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The last time we saw him in Seagal is the Troy-non-pleasant Shadow Man. Even though the Attack Force is his worst movie, it should not be argued for Kill, Ticker or Black Don Folks. Here is the septic tank at the bottom. <br /> <br /> Anyone who claims that Steven Siegel is back in the form of a Taste would have to write a 100 page article. <br /> <br /> Seagal is another agent / I am again a very bad-donkey. I do not think Lassen wants a vengeance for killing his team. <br /> <br /> The whole product, directed by dealers, is very small. Is this film filmed in the dark? This is a low-flown film after hauling. <br /> <br /> This action is terrible and very bad. <br /> <br /> Stunt Double as Stuen Siegel and throw in Stunt Double after dubious terrible dubbing: The producers also decided how to hype more fans. <br /> <br /> The stywy is no longer a Fortress in Harvest, but it should be better than the attack force. -Predding tampering is not more coherent and Seagal looks worse. I'm Michael Kishchech and the author Joe Hall <br /> Now it will leave Seagal in an impossible position to come up with some of the hassle of this confusion. We really want to do another movie for him as the bad attack force turned out?
