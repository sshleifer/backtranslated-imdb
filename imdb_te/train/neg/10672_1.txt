It does not have all the clippings and ingredients of this kind of movies. The storyline did not go anywhere and I thought it was sucking to see that movie at the end. Product is good; However, the script and acting are B-movie quality. Since the cast was poor, good actors joined the troubled actors. The good actors did not own their own and they lifted the others. <br /> <br /> The film is not worth the words, but I have said more to satisfy the minimum requirement of the ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. <br /> If you are looking for mental entertainment, I still do not recommend this movie.
