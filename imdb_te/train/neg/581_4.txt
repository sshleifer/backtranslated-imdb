Before I was gone, I would accept the big Bon Jovi fan. In fact the first place DVD case was what drew me. I'm probably such a big horror fan and the first vampires enjoyed the title. <br /> This half is not good. Zone also saved me this film. My main problem is not just scary. The character of Joan was not printed by Derek Bliss and none of the other characters were printed and you could not find the least annoying Vampire / Drug addicted woman. The female vampire is not scary or sexy. Instead she appears an anorexic 14-year-old girl, then she is desperate for blood. Another big problem is that everything is "very bright". There is no feeling of atmosphere or fear. The first vampires I set in New Mexico were not exactly the darkest darkest moon in the moon, but it was still dark and precedent when still needed. <br /> <br /> This story is predominantly advance. The Vampire Berger's cross should be able to walk during the daytime. But the story has less cool bits at this time. There is no wow factor that realizes that the original vampire - owner of the owner as in the first film. You really do not care who or what this is one. There is no army of masters. <br /> <br /> "There is a lack of fear, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting story, a person personally out of me.
