Avoid USA Version. It's the worst dubbing you've ever heard of attached US footage and New York enthusiasts. Dubbing Mystery Science Theater 3000 is very bad. I think the black guy from Bronx is Chiba's voice. I could not see the whole movie. This American version is looking at Chiba's other great ones like The Street Fighter or Karate Warriors.
