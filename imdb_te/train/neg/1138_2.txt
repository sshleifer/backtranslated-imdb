This is complete disappointment. Acting is not bad, but this product is very bad, I felt at times when I needed to stop it, but I did sin and bother through the whole poor movie. Never mind. You o.k. With cheesy moral stitches and Whitman does not mind watching a movie that is incorrectly ensured. If you want a cheesy fable story.
