<br /> <br /> I have further reduced the number of video nostrils, and this rubbish pile in the "renting" list on the list when you see it available. <br /> <br /> <br /> The premise is a fashion model or kidnapped and taken into the forest to be delivered for a ransom by a colorful band of idiots. Some goofy has rented her back and when he comes back with the girl and the whole money, he gets an important cut, earned money to use as a bargaining chip. He brought with him a helicopter and a pilot and, Wow, that pilot was one of the worst actors ever! Granted, they are absolutely afraid and dubbing will make you cry in blood. After being stolen into the wilderness, we find that a nearby cannibalistic man finds that God is the God of the Lord, destroying and devouring animals such as human king King Kong. Now, some of this fellow's just bad makeup, just ping pong is naked guy for the balls and it is pretty much the same. <br /> <br /> Oh, do not forget about the almost continuous nudity? The main reason for the film banning is, in a second language, in a second language, God will attack a girl and remove her thumbs, but it is not a redemption factor for Gore fans. Also, Jess Franco shows up the normal T and A and the prolonged close ups of female genitalia, and, sadly, the male as well. So, if you want to be "fair" in terms of exploitation, you've got it. <br /> I can not recommend this trash to anyone. It's not a bad movie. If you're doing your way through the list, it's probably the last thing that a video Nasty fan can watch, which is just the worst thing worse. If you see it for the first time, this is not true, you can assume that it is the norm for the list.
