I've reviewed the film in about two years, but my opinion is that it's low. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] <br /> <br /> In the sequel, our story begins with a slightly older old Ariel and her daughter, Melody. My first big problem is that Eric and the rest of the staff sang. Yes, I understand that Disney Sing and dance numbers are bigger, but really, that's what Eric has done to my favorite prince. He is a real gentleman who knows how to calm, collect, and have fun. And he said. NOT. <br /> <br /> Then the villain is there. Or, how can we forget our sprays that run on the screen of the urses, fearing Ariel and the audience around the world? Unfortunately, she did not send that gene to her unmistakable sister Morgana. No mention of the first film Morgana; She came out somewhere, trying to steal her baby. Oh, how beautiful. The little sister is confused and decided to abduct a child of a month old instead of going after the trichulum. <br /> <br /> "My sister, these same followers (as well as I was watching this movie at the age of three did not intimidate my loneliness, <br /> <br /> King Triton did not have the honor that he earned from me in his debut film, and could not get it I started in Scattile, Sebastian and Floreder. It's almost like a ruthless but loving father in the ram, and in the second, he lost his will in the hearts of his people.If each comic relief, each of his 'Dingle-Hopper' (yes, I agree, Dupall-Hopper has made a call.) In the film, Stuart has forgotten all. Some added. He did not have the others, with a taste of the rich, and in the sequel, they are all but completely removed from him. Sebastian before, but already bhayapedutunnanu earlier. Disney, do not do so. Do not try to mess with our favorite crab. Or our favorite little fat fish, becomes a father and has a group of very annoying kids. He is fat, and he is bland, and he looks like he's going to no second flat flat line. <br /> <br /> Do not need water horse and penguin, and after a while, you start with the start again. <br /> One of these days, Disney, I am kicking from my life. <br /> If you do not love me are your real ones.
