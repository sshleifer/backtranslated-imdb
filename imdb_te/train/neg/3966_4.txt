Granted, I'm not my partner's connoisseur de-horror, but well put together, the clever flick time value. <br /> <br /> - Dialog is often a weak and reliable instance of a given nature <br /> <br /> - An unreliable acting. <br /> <br /> The authors hold the bits selected from the half a dozen major films, throwing them into the kettle, almost fit and give us the poor results. /> <br /> Long and short, but definitely terrible, it's certainly not worth absorbing one of my NetFlix rentals.
