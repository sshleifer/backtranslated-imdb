Here's how you do: Believe in God and repent for your sins. Then things should turn around the next day or so. <br /> <br /> For the last fifteen minutes, the film plays as a bad recap of just drunk's bad life. His mother will die. His cleric is a b_tch. His father dies. He is drinking. He is married. He has children. He will drink some more. His wife gets mad. He disappoints his children. The wife threatens to leave. He calls the late night b / c he wants to kill himself. <br /> After the recapitulation, if we get "backward", there will be a message like "Like". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Madison falls to his knees and begs the forgiveness of Christ. Once, he walked outside and said he was looking at the world in a different way. He found God with his wife and said that she was good. The flip scene is four months old and the wife is tired of going to church. Madsen walks through the bar and makes the film a culmination of how happy he is and without Christ and alcohol. The final moment? He gives the bar a slight dismissal (ie pan house) and gives the Miami-Vice, post-school special acknowledged distance in the air as the camera freeze frames. See why I repeat the phrase? <br /> <br /> "The film is good and the product values ​​of the B-Grade 80 do not help much, and the script can easily be a" touched by an angel "component, which is broken in 30 minutes plus commercials Acting is not wood and reliable, and I'm a big fan of it and the only reason I sit by this is that Madison makes it clear that this is his first acting job I did not know the camera from his elbow, and in 45 minutes I started to be discouraged, and this thing was like homework, and I said it was halfway, I saw half, it's fine, but not if I sit through cheerleader nijazz, I sit all over this <br /> <br /> This is the only reason why I do not give 1 point. Two points: 1) I love Madsen Nanu. I did not understand it. But in the early title "Michael Madsen introduced the" greatest ever seen. Look at me. 2) dialogue, which is very bad for some of the classics. I have a few million at the end of the stick, so you can also enjoy them. <br /> It's about it. To close it, this thing should be cereal with the rest of the trash. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also Tilt, Executive Target, My Boss Dancing, etc.). Now I've seen Reservoir Dogs and Madsen will cop the violence to honor him. <br /> <br /> "Madness's first taste is alcohol!" Everything is so beautiful! "- Maddon after confessing to God Walking outside <br /> <br /> "I'm going to downtown later, pick a Bible and I'm pretty much a haircut" - Maddon in the dinner table
