If I read Pat Barker's 'Union Street' before I saw the film, I liked it. Unfortunately this is not the case. This is actually my kind of film, which is very well done, and in no way do I say it, but as a follow-up, it fails in every aspect. <br /> <br /> The disruptive novel about reality is a living in a North England working class area, holding my heart and leaving weeks after my completion. When I read about the women of Union Street, I stood by tears, boredom, boredom, anger, sympathy and sorrow. Excellent. At times I can not read a novel that I like, but I've put the novel down. <br /> <br /> In this film you will be disappointed. Oh dear. Hollywood took the truth and originality of Barker and showed a layer of sweet icing sugar on top of it. A beautiful picture, an inspiring soundtrack, wonderful performances, hope and romance story ... yes. <br /> <br /> The women and their stories of Union Street froze in the role of Fonda, but most of their stories have been ignored, despite their stories. I agree that some of the Barker stories are sensitive issues and are very scary for collective viewing, and the image with 7 prominent leaders is not practical, but content is not my main issue. The essence of the novel and the true gut is lost - dark and rain, broken windows with a cardboard and a diagram of poverty is replaced by sunshine, beautiful houses, and shiny Williams score. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the image for its positiveness and hopeful in the background of 'reality', I do not hesitate to read the book without you preparing yourself for something like 'Schindler's List' ... but without happy ending.
