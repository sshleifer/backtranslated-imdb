Catherine Bigelow and Mark Boyle are already making a sequel to a young US corporal in Afghanistan. He is a well-deserved surgeon, and worked on the injured NATO soldiers and surrounded Kabul. In a typical difficult task, he usually shoots a sniper rifle and Osama bin Laden from 3000 yards away. Eventually he is promoting Sergeant, but he is unable to decide between the sniper and the surgeon's career, so he leaves the Army. One year later, he was frustrated with civil life, he was caught in the navy and the last scene shows him wearing a white uniform.
