The final justice is the great Joe Don Baker shoots people running around Texas, shooting people. Then he is away from Malta, where he burns more people. He was locked up many times to shoot people. Then he gets into a gun with the evil guy, who dressed as a monk. There was a boat hunting, and Joe Dawn again winds in jail. Finally, Joe Don, killing a bad guy with the help of Eileen from "Seinfeld", will bomb a boat or two, and someone will be burned with fire. All this and an impressive theme song, just like Michelle!
