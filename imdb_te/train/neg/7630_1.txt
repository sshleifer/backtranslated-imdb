A boring image about the boring town in 50s. How can anyone feel a classic? The producer brought his girlfriend to the Cybill Shepard into several films on his acting ability. I will give an insight to the film as to how bad the future films of Peter Bogdanovich are. Cybele Shepard took on Dave after starring in several films produced by Peter Bogdonovich. Her career began to come back to "moon lighting". I thought it was a poor character of acting "graduate". I noticed that I did not show this movie in the US. At midnight morning I saw only Europe.
