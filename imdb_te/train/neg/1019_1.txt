Honestly, I have heard that many people are disgraceful before seeing this film. Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spaceyy have played the roles in this movie and I do not believe it's watching my own. Apparently they are right. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed because I did not expect much from Justin because he was not really in the movie / theater. Business. But Morgan and Kevin? I can not stop asking why heck has agreed to take part in Edison. To be honest, their characters are stupid. <br /> <br /> If the players are out, I must give more attention to the story. This is actually a story source, but guys ... trust me ... This is not a movie that wants to give credit to your story. Imagine, a smart-donor journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learned to become a true journalist from his employer (Morgan Freeman). It is supported by an agent who is still in the heart of justice (LL Cool J) and an excellent investigator (Kevin Spacey). In the end, they ended the system with happy ending. <br /> <br /> Geez, I can not continue with this. Just remembering the movie is already sick of me. My advice guys do not see this! Please save your money and time for another money.
