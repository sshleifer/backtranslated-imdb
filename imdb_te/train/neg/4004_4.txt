In a huge fan or cracker series, I'm waiting for the next extra 7 years. <br /> <br /> Fitzgerald returns to Manchester after seven years of marriage for his daughters and is a soldier involved in the murder trial. <br /> <br /> I do not like this episode about how to create a fitness killer. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in flash from Northern Ireland, which are well shot.
