<br /> <br /> I do not know whether I can laugh or cry out on the wrongdoing of Canadian history or especially the sins of Mounted Police in Yekun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will go to Pearlton, born in Dalson City Yukon and historian, Klondike Gold Rush, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, author of the definitive history of 1896-1899 to express my enthusiasm in this silly film: /> <br /> The American idea of ​​a border that has been suppressed by six armed gunmen continues in The Far Country, At the American West - another story about a cowboy from Wyoming - beef cattle into the country again. What is the main feeling that the nightmare of the movie geographical limitations, but the real unplugged plot turns? During the golden rush, there was only one mounting policeman in Canadian Yucatan and he could not deal with an illegal act. <br /> When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yacon border with their cattle, the rituals are empty. <br /> <br /> "Where's the constable? Brinnen asks. <br />" The river. "Somebody has replies, he has a tough job, he is a constable and he guards a few ten or twenty thousand square miles, sometimes he does not come home for two or three months." <br /> <br /> <br /> Historic truth is the closest thing to the police state that the UK North American country has seen so far during the golden rush. Before the Klondike strike, most of the northwest mount was in the police territory. They control every way in Yukon and they are no nonsense. They have often collected customs duties on the slopes of new arrivals, have vague rules about river guiding and if people do not have enough supply, or if they look just as bad, people will return. In the true Canadian manner they are moral rules for society. Lord's Day law was observed in Dawson; It is a punishable offense by fine fine cut your timber on Sunday; <br /> <br /> "You can not imagine a pistol, a vicious male man from Tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip by a young constable , He sent him out of a saloon for a very noisy offense, and the evil one left him as a lamb, but the police took him to the gun American said, "No one has taken a gun from me yet." "Well, I'm taking it," the constable was less and more resistant. <br /> <br /> In 1898, the stampede elder There were many revolvers in Daven, where year by year, there was less auction of dollars, such as Dollar. Ivramaina crime are not just a murder in Dawson. Sophie Smith, a lawless city of Denver run nammakasthudice skagveto the American side, by contrast, was remarkable. But Burr Country dassan without any law is seen as a community, it is the role of Smith sape from skagve ?? Is he called Gannon in the film ?? Easy to control. (In real life, a man of Smith who tried to cross the border captured his equipment and fired again through a mountain police sergeant). <br /> "I'm in the law, I'm reflecting the law in the Yukon landscape." Fifty thousand square miles. <br /> <br /> "It's a forest that you did not want to go to thousands, but now you're here, we will save you. <br /> <br />" There will be a post. <br /> What happens now between May and May? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you go to the mosque, With a full-fledged urban group living under British jurisdiction, has been accepted, and naturally, they want to make Jimmy Stewart Marshall-a clear part, but Stewart Lonar He will be playing after a number one and another person has been elected for the shot and he will do the others, shot dead and Walter Brennan gets shot.Stwart finally reluctantly ending all the shootings in his shooting, he pins on the tin star and he and the bully , Gannon, blew each other in the inevitable western climax Estadu. <br /> <br /> who have passed the Canadian north, the story sends trust rational. <br /> <br /> Hollywood's Canada Excerpt from Pierre Berton, 1975.
