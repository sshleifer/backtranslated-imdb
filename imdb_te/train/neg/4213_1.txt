Wow, I'm a huge Henry VIII / Tuder Age fan and well ... It's interesting. I only saw Catherine of Aragon. And wow ... just wow. I have seen bad acting before, but it has reached new heights. Actress Emma who played the role of Catherine .. She has wails and chatter and I have to admit several times rewinded ... many, many times ... funny, funny stuff. Anne Boleyn (I have a little invasion with Anne Boleyn, a woman she really reads, reads on her, even though it is valuable, has shown her the only person who has shown her talent.) Also, I have read a lot about Tudor time and I think the characters are not very acurately All are very stereotypical. If you are ready to watch the most important time, watch this movie and the important lives of the participants become a laughing stock.
