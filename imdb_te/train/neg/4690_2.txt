This British film is really awful, and Glenn Ford hardly believes it, if he sleepwalks through it pretty much. The idea of ​​a bomb in the train is good ... but the train is largely stopped for the movie! No action, no movement, just a static train. The area where the train is parked is empty, so this is no accident. In fact the film can be used to show how the film should not be a suspense film. The real suspense audience does not know the audience, the fact that the audience does not know. SPOILER: The train actually has two bombs, but we believe that there is only one. After the first bomb stabilized, the film seems to have no reason to see it anymore. But at the last minute, the villain, there is no clear motivation for his actions, reveals that there are two. We do not even have a classic "typing bomb" tension sequence when we get out of the bombs. Glenn Ford's French wife spends 10 minutes or more for leaving him, and then wondering where he is. She has such an annoying role that she does not care whether she has reconciled with her, so she has no such emotional feelings. Most of the other characters are very low in personality, and none have any problems or problems. It's only 72 minutes, but it's a long time, because it's tedious and dull. Do not waste your time.
