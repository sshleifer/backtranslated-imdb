The film is flawless on many borders. Like most people before it, it portrays Alamo's myths much more than history. The amount of giving a stamp of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have worked on the production of Hollywood Squares, is poor. This is a great mistake for me - I know the true Alamo leaders are the elderly collective of TV actors who choose to portray the age and the general personalities and never let any hint of credibility. <br /> <br /> In Texas, I grew up with myths. I learned more about history later. I received from a perspective product (I like historical accuracy), but I did not give it a chance to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The versions of John Wayne's or FÃ¨s Parker have more life than this stylish mess. <br /> <br /> Very frustrating - avoid it.
