If you want to know Wendigo's true story, I suggest you pick up a copy of the original story of Algarson Blackwell. <br /> <br /> "When I read this book I loved it" (EM) Freeman's "camfire chillers") come out of a film based on this. I was so disappointed that I finally saw it. Another thing is that most PC (throughout the politically correct) film is across the film. <br /> <br /> There is no PC when the book is written. <br /> My advice will not waste your time or money! You can see it on the video store shelf.
