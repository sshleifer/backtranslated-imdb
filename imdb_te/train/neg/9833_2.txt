False accusations, such as John Wayne (John Scott) and Eddie Chandler (like Kansas Charlie), have made a mark of rumor to become "alias smith and jones". Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones". Mr. Chandler is considered "Reve Smith", but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith". Anytime Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris, or Ben Murphy are entertaining; Nevertheless, Wayne could have succeeded more than any of them, career-wise. Pretty blonde Mary Cornman (Anne), she grew up in "Our Gang", a lovely interest for Wayne. She and Chandler Wayne have beautiful scenes. If you're not a fan of low-budget John Wayne movies in the 1930s, the film does not make you one.
