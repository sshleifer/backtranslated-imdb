Carl Monson is a Grade-Z Horror filmmaker in the most popular directors with low-budget ghostly turbulence. His films are filled with useless gore, laughable acting, boring sub-plot and unhealthy conversations. In the movie, people have made murders in the family dump. Unfortunately, this film is almost bloodless. You can not really see murders except shadows and some blood splatters. This pace is frustrating and unlike the plot. But the absence of gore and disability was disappointing me. Monson's film is not mistaken for Adi Milligan's equivalent weak "legacy of blood".
