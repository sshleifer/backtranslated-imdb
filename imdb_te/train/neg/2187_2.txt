I bought this movie on DVD to get a piece of mystery science theater 3000. Michael, Crow, and Tom Servers are visually appealing because this is not the film itself. Despite a plot, one can follow a story, and some actors can work, nothing else. The film was very boring, and I firmly confirmed that I did not see Tom, Crow and Mike again. As mentioned above, it is better than the one shot in the previous MST3K episode; But that's fine.
