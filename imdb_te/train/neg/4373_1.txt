I guess I am only responsible for the big fits of "Virgin Entrees of the Virgin". When you see a jousy and proudly promoted title in the movie and the first impression of the film, you should not already imagine the title of the movie when you get an extra verification when you have produced it in the 80s from Japan. There are a number of unhealthy filmmakers in Japan, but the Kajov Koizi completely destroys them and the trio triumphs him over and overcomes the aggressive sex and the brutality of young girls. Did not even try to tell a story, "Virgin Entrails" is just unreleased for the UN-inspired semi-pornographic sex and the fiercest 80's horror's most undemanding fan, who is really poor gore-influences. A group of photographers and their fashion models are obscured by the slums of slum dwellers with a slum girl. She also dumped her for a minute after the climax (special) and she begged her to stay with her while she had to share with other women. I can not get it. Is this a common male fantasy? Because it's really cliche and false. However, some are some horned photographers and diplomatic models. They are amazed by the fog in their way home, where the group is surrounded by themselves in an abandoned country where they have a more intimidating gender and eventually suffer from a ridiculous sexual-ghastly murder. Acting performances are enthusiastic, dialogues Inennes and Adiga and Komiz's directing are weak and uninspired. I can tolerate everything, including feminine-negative pornography, but I have come close to turning this film into an average-excited wrestling scene without any mention. One of the males hurts hits, kicks and throws up, and she literally cries with her drawee pad and grief. This sequence, in my humble opinion, is the absolute low point of the Asian Exploitation Cinema. One to avoid and perhaps to boycott.
