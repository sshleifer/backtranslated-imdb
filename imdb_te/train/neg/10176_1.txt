Songs: Scott Bacula, Eric Brocktaker, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Doggate, John Warren Written and directed by 100 Minutes PG-13 (by Blake French: <br /> <br /> The scene in the new John Warren comedy "Major League: Minors Back", a angry coach throws a baseball in the wall behind him, hit the cement and hit him <br /> <br /> The film is structurally weak, qualitative, unpredictable, and badly written, just as silly Not only the critics but also the audience who hates everything they get. It is not known, but it is not known. <br /> How do we make the same movie about sports? In the last years "Air Bud: Golden Receiver" adharitadi. "Major League Back to the Miners" is a very bad thing to watch a perfect family on Sunday afternoon. This is a very big kid for adults. So who is this movie? Teenagers? The elderly? <br /> <br /> Those who are too frustrated for entertainment are hired to rent this kind. <br /> <br /> Many similar ones are similar to others, one of the key things to do: winning teamwork. Yes it is, and to prove any great moral try. Very bad we have already seen and have their little cheerleaders such a little talent and intelligence in men in a ballerina outfit that is over and over. The silly commentators "kill a leiser" with their own "buddy comedy routine", "" These kids end up with an hourly glass, "" they may have lost something - it's his mind, "" someone needs a nap, "and" Always look the sun as beautiful as that game. "The name has a lesser significance for each other as we always know by letters. <br /> <br /> "Hoogly League Minor to Back" is very bad; This puts off its right end in a good ending order. Good baseball team is coming back, they win and - the power goes out. I think the worst piece comes to this conclusion, but in fact, the final end of the scene is to add only a few minutes to the running time. It is not funny which will be a series of unrelated sketches that the film primarily throw most jed jokes. The player who speaks with a coach and another player once again has a humorous line. The coach's answer is: "Very old, very slow, and very fat." Player response is dying. But that scenario does not make you absolutely sure that the movie is not worth it, and you definitely do not have a percentage value in your money. <br /> <br /> Another horrible entry in the film, another one that is sad with its own script, has failed earlier, another is well known, which is again Deiva Wu. <br /> <br />
