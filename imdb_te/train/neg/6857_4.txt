This "screw comedy" looks very forceful. In fact, the actors are trying hard to make the script unreleased. And, as a result, this does not really go anywhere. The idea of ​​a woman who looks pregnant after a hasty divorce is not just funny. And then, when Cooper walked out of the baby, he did not want to be adopted, it was terribly inappropriate, and it was hard to turn it into comedy. It is a disgrace because the actors have more power than the script, and I'm frustrated at the whole chaos. I thought Cooper made a lot of good comedy.
