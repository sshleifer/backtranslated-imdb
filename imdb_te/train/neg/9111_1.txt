Cruel Intentions 2 Bloody horror, I mean Uber-bad. <br /> <br /> The plot of Cruel Intentions 2 is very similar to the first movie. Sebastian (Robin Dunne), was forced out of a private school and forced to move to New York. Where he decides to make a fresh start and make a life a normal life and settle down. Unfortunately, he has to deal with his stepfather Catherine (Amy Adams). Sebastian fell in love with Daniel (Sarah Thompson), the innocent daughter of the headmaster of the school. Catherine Sebastian wants to sleep with a whole school described as a 'prostitute-house'. Caryn also wants to take revenge with Cherie (Karey Lin Pratt), who insulted her during the school assembly. <br /> <br /> Cruel Intentions 2 has been canceled on a TV-show mainly converted to a prequel. There are too many problems with the picture. It is poorly written, unfunny, and badly acted. Fortunately for this Amy Adams, this performance has never been released because she is now a very big actress. Cruel Intentions have a sense of realism and can be set in a real world, Crotal Intentions are set in 2 sitcom grounds and Amazon.co.uk 'Rail version by the Sea by the Bell'. In the first film there are some dark themes that use sex and drug abuse, but try to make it funny in Cruel Intentions 2, and Catherine should not have a relationship with a teacher. Other ideas will not work as a secret society to meet all the prominent children of the fall of other students. This film led to a sexual sexual problem at the age of 15/16 years. I have a sexual relationship with young people, and sometimes too, but very serious when completed in film or television. There is a well-known concept when Danley encourages Chen to mimic the sex behind a horse that has an emotion (about 14/15 in the film). The concept of changing a girl around 14/15 to a baby is very bad with me and is not related to comedy. <br /> <br /> If jokes are flat in this movie, if it is a verbal gag, she 'loses everything she moistens when you look.' Sebastian Catherine first goes into the mud. In this movie I do not have time to go, but I have to say I should avoid it. See Cruel Intentions, not classic, still a good picture and aspect. <br /> <br /> The film is just a misguided wet dream, one of the school-children.
