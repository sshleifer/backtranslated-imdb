This is imaginable because I personally hated this picture, the characters were stereotypical and the whole idea was demolished of "cutting edge", and "cadet kelly". <br /> <br /> The main character is a smile girl who has taken her into the area where she does not belong. The whole space hates her, and there is a good guy to make things worse, she does not like her (well Dahon Dham does not stand school). Amazingly she finds a way to fit in and everyone like her plus, she gets the guy who comes head over heels in love with her. She comes with a choice, where the figure must choose between skating and hockey. She chooses the hockey, then goes to the figure skating nationals and participates in the Olympic team. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is very quick and predictable. You know what happened before you saw it. It's terrible, I was almost amazed, I ended watching that time, and I had the desire to burn me to look at the terrible headache and such trash. Except you are more than ten, or do not really see this as the worst sudoku movies.
