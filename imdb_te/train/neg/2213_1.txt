Wherever prehistoric monsters are hidden, where do the evil doers conduct their experiments, the madmen hold the ultimate karate championship and the uber-rich hunting for the sport? I do not know there are many unconventional islands, but if you take the number of movies that you use as one of these mysterious islands, you have to think that there are at least 50 of these absorbers. It always winds feel damn comfortable and deduct points from any movie I will soon use this hooked device. Hummerhead is a story of a mad scientist who experimented on one of these untouchable islands, so the film was made much before it was already started. <br /> <br /> The island is based on Dr. Morio, but recently acquired by Jeffrey Combs himself as a re-animator. Old Jeffrey cutting edge is doing a stem cell research, leading to working with sharks while looking for treatment for cancer. Since it's almost the same basic setup as the Smart Shark comfort in the Deep Blue Sea, do not mention the host of other neo-movie movies. So clearly, Jeffrey's son died of cancer, and our mad doctor began experimenting with his offspring. <br /> <br /> He changed his son into a shark. <br /> <br /> William Forsy led Thomas to a team of unknown actresses on the island to examine the doctor's experiments. If someone gives him a saddle cap, William Gilligan is a ringer for Skipper from the Island. In a typical Bond villain fashion, the doctor decides that all these intruders will do good for his son. Implications, buddies ... chame as shame food. So enter the shark-boy that starts skipping skipper and his crew on the island. When they accompany a man in a rubber shark-man suit, they make half-hearted efforts to escape and repel them again and again. <br /> <br /> You do not miss a single point on one of those dastardly deserted islands. It's funny funny, this is Hammer Head, I think it's an old joke. Why do not you hit yourself head with a hammer? Because if you stop it is very good. How beautiful this picture is. It's only good when looking at it because it's just watching.
