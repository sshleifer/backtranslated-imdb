<br /> Before that attempt, you will need solid movie fundamentals. This is a good sound, editing, set design, etc. <br /> <br /> Allows you to talk about the sound of the film. Completely outrageous. <br /> <br /> We never worry about a low budget and a soundtrack ever before talk about the film made in Chile. Is always there. Anywhere. <br /> <br /> The sound in the film is bad. Exclusively across the foley space and irrelevant, the climate is equally terrible. I had at least four loud clicks in the film, which resulted in poor sound editing. Sound inside the cars is awful, the end of the car doors is sound awful. The sound of the lady singing is wrong. foley either overboard, or just the sound guy just got bored and did not like it offered. Gaps are wrong. Everything about it is wrong. <br /> Furthermore, the limits of creativity will not get in the way, but at the same time the film tries to be brave. For example the aquarium sound is used in the street scene. We hear the sound when we can not do it. Sound edits are in front of visual cuts. <br /> <br /> Editing wise we have scenes using massive jump cuts, we have to tinkering around with time line etc etc, yawning. <br /> <br /> The whole mix is ​​the worst, sound trash. Therefore, the image is rubbish. How is an image with a lot of fundamental errors for awards and high praise? New wave of Chile's cinema? Chile's best creative output? <br /> <br /> Chile's choice and better talent may cause this film to escape. Similarly, the film received a lot of undesirable accolades, so the "world-cinema" enthusiasts received the same reasons. They probably rejoice in trashiness in it. <br /> <br /> The film is even worse. It never deserves all mouth and no trousers and a 6.8 rating. Tarantino's product quality, the new wave of inspiring romance!
