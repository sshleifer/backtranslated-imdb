We can not believe how bad it was for the first time because we saw it twice in the theater. Maybe we'll miss something ... No, what's missing is not at the beginning of the prep. I went back to Robin's novel to see if I really could find this problem, and I realized that it was funny and enthusiastic in the day that I am now very incomplete and cumbersome junk. <Br / So, the initial issue with this film decided to do everything, and the remaining rail risk progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessing. Some beautiful outdoor photography will be steambed by a random camera placement on the inner shots. All actors are at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson appears to be a mortified mortified - with Rain Phoenix, giving the impression that she does not know how terrible she really is. The dialogue is one, long, continually horrified. There are no scenes from the second to both the scenes and the relationships between them. <br /> Furthermore, believing that the film is saying something deep, it is broken down. <br /> <br /> This is also very funny as funny; It's just harassing. Gus Van Zent has done other great films, I encourage you to see and I'm enjoying it from this mess (and learned from).
