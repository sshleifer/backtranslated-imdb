I have read the book a long time ago and do not remember specifically the plot but remember that I enjoyed it. It's a good idea because I'm home sick on bed and hey !! <br /> <br /> The film is filled with G B actresses and actresses. <br /> <br /> The female cast comes out of Desperate Housewives. I have never seen the show but there are a lot of our campaigns for the show and I will get a summary. Is nothing original then? <br /> <br /> Looking at the female cast, acting is very beautiful but girls should have husbands. <br /> A woman struggling with a woman in a scene, for her life, and what does she do ??? Kicks him in the testicles. What else? <br /> <br /> All women have love but let me tell the girls ... It's not always easy to see. <br /> It's not all bad. I have done a time or two in the cold, so I have to credit with that person.
