There are no spoilers but I have been a fan since the start of Dead Waking, but in the last series, only 3 people have arrived. The stories do not have any similarity to the original idea of ​​the stories. I found this 3 ridiculously ridping jaw in the last series. As a BBC license payer, I have complained to the BBC that I was disappointed. I was surprised that the talented actors of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone did not condemn the story. These actors have been with these characters for 8 Seasons, which have lost all directions. It's a good job that may be the start of a team investigating the death of the late Christmas series or the next series! <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
