Whoo-boy, obviously one of the worst flicks I've seen all summer. <br /> <br /> The science fiction is in science fiction, but the man does not speak to the racer thin plot and the two dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> The characters are stereotypical, plot and arrangement unreliable, less intimidating vampires, more funny-looking, gore unnecessary, special effects down-right are terrible, and end? Suddenly the donkey girl begins to be homosexual and begins to make a woman, and it's not really all that it feels like for three seconds, it's just unimaginable at the end. Are you "what is hell?" Then "man, it's hot." If it never appears again, then God will not see and see.
