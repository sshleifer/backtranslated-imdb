Think of the No-Budget Version of China Syndrome Directed by a film student who worships John Wu and get 'Power Play'. The idea was good, but the execution, acting and dialogue were completely murdered, not to mention ridiculous sums, such as the violence and disaster scenes used to replace the material and the lack of improved parts of the film. It is a journalist story that investigates the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group. It broke into the offices of a power plant suspected of hunting the earthquake and then secretly escaped. The Cavalier reporter goes on, rather than what is the most brutal group of company executives, and the determination of plant deficiencies chases along with the town to "clean up" what can happen to witnesses (which he speaks to). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are no urgent feelings, because the idiot dialogue and the characters that accompany the terrible acting are very appealing. Needless to say, it will have to pay a fraudulent amount of eye-catching audiences, a mounting body count and harmful shoot-mumps plus earthquake disaster scenes for its program style appeal. Everything was focused on apologizing for the aptitude of the story and the more interesting sequences. It was more attention to film directors thriller, and showed more attention to developing the story of corruption in this story. Creepy villains, the innocent reporter, and the wrong-doing reporter tried to warn. This is the principle, but at least fun.
