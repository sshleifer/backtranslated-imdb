Four years after I moved from San Francisco to New York, I saw Chan missing when it came for the first time. Perhaps it's a few years away, but the movie seems to be much better than what I've ever seen (and still does) the essence of the city and its people. It is a special society - Chinese - but it is good because many settings of the city's spirit come on all faces of faces and perhaps letters. <br /> <br /> Tourists are not San Francisco. The settings are humble and daily: a taxi cab, a Chinese restaurant kitchen, a series of houses in Richmond, small Chinatown apartments and small business offices, poles, and a Philippine big center. Now, during Silicon Gulch's urban redevelopment era, the city is seen and unexpected for the people living there. Dirty Harry (also in San Francisco film on its own), unlike Dirt Harry, is shot at street level: We come to understand the opinions of characters in their surroundings, some of their surroundings are fancy rein & W did not star in the movie because he could not do that, but the film's strongest view One of the yama elements is the natural light he achieves. One of the most intimate relationships with Sunshine's frequent, pervasive quality of San Francisco: Reducing buildings, hills, and other places, making fun of people you pass, revealing everything is more personal in the streets and you are closer to you than in another place. <br /> <br /> Wong's photography is complete in this way, and also helps the story at points. <br /> <br /> Wong I think the speech and conversational style of Chinese and other San Francisco is much better than anyone. If it's a real San Francisco thing like "slang", it's what you hear from a bald taxi medalian broker (I think) that looks like a phone in a scene (listen to the way he calls the other person on the other hand <br /> <br /> The story is sharp and Despite some minor mistakes, it's pretty much about the wishes of people like the hearts of people living in the old colonial communities <br /> <br /> It is not enough to say that the two cab drivers search for Chan has become an exploration of what is more personal - it's all sensitive, <br /> <br /> Chan is only missing Miss Chinatown Trioq Sequence of Man The Goofy Newlywed song about San Francisco and all its silly variation from the 1930s (I guess) an American satire, yes, but something completely off the mark.
