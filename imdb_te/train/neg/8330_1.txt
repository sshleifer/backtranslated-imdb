I saw "sineer" on DVD. When I look at it, "It's a romantic movie that is not romantic." I also thought, "Somebody has the same real problems that this has written." Then director / writer Carlson explained his process as a special feature. <br /> <br /> The emphasis of the film is on two alcohol losses. These are marginally attractive. There is pre and full nudity. <br /> <br /> The most striking factor of the film is that the victims of homosexuality and the victim of the next victim are trying to get the exact revenge from his misfortunes, losing both drunk. <br /> This topic is absurd and bad from technology, but acting is scary. <br /> Then is the Boxer-Stalker theme. This is not true, it's just not absurd. The hunky boxer was somewhat afflicted with the continuous attention of Momma Was Boy, a knife who works at the parking lot in his gym. This is in LA, you mind. <br /> <br /> The boxer is excited about the practice of being in front of him, in front of him, in an incognito home. <br /> I mean, that suddenly attracted the attention of a performer? It just does not make sense. And, I'm scared, some mental-dynamics actually make sense, if you take the time to read about them. However, bad scripts rarely mean everyone. </ P> <br /> Director / writer seems to suggest a significant minority in the sex scope of the film. Well, he thinks, I think. Since the minority is very ineffective, we never know, because it's rarely a vague gay film festival or DVD shop that can not reach only two places where they find this turkey. Thank you very much for this.
