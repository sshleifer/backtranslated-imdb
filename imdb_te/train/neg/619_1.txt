Wow this is all I can say if your reading is watched or thinking about it. <br /> <br /> I've worked so hard on most parts of the film. I cant believe they are superimposed to school sign! I laugh again and again and again. If we can make such a film, it gives us all the hopes to make our own films. Even the dress is bad. It looked like I had a good job making my 7 year old cousin. Heck I bet he might have written and played well. I know I have to see the second part, so I can see that the first one is so bad. Not a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a better job is done. Hopefully another killer scarecrow image is just like this, just comes out.
