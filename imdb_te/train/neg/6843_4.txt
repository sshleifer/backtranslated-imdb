A very simplistic exploitative film in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The main actress Stacy Walker is well-known actors and amazingly appealing. She has a stench with Renee Zellweger as bad hair. This chick made only two of these films, and then moved back to Texas. The music is terrible. Sam Melville (from the Rooney Television program) played one of her friends with a different name. <br /> <br /> The best song in the film from Tony - "Do you put me on the toy? The chicks put me on". Good B / W cinematography from Lasco Kovacs (Easy RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good places (cold swimming pool, also used in DEFILERS). Strange end but not enough. A 4 out 10. Best Performance Stacey Walker.
