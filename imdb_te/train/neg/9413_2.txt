I totally disagree with other viewers in this wretched film. The great talent of Carmen Miranda is because I did not rate it for awfully 1. She is the best parents of early parents due to gifted songs and dance. <br /> The problem is with the rest of the images. Alice Faye gets a lot of space. With Don Amachey's great singing voice but wretched writing, he comes out of the grim applause. <br /> <br /> Amesh is a song in this song and a dance man and a baron <br /> <br /> By playing the song and the dancer, Some silly nonsense about Baron will allow him to play two parts because he clears and removes the business. <br /> <br /> Sakal has given little to do here and has given him the opportunity to shine his comic gifts. J. Carroll is uncomfortable in his role for Nash. <br /> <br /> It is the film's chic chika boom bomb.
