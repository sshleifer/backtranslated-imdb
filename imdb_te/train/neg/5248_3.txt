"Die Caesar" is one of the best action films in Germany. As I saw last night and I was deeply disappointed, I must admit. <br /> <br /> If Germany's action movie is a fun and challenging "last hope", there is not much left on the left. <br /> <br /> "Die Die Caesar" seeks sexy, daring and furious, but it is nothing of that kind. Characters are wood and mold and action against their nature (which does not quite happen) when they do something unexpected. It makes it harder - almost impossible for me - even if they follow or even locate them. <br /> <br /> Many people think this film is a very bad act. I do not have a role to believe. Maybe the top officer in the SWAT unit - but it's about it. They looked like special units like Elite Caps or tried to work - I do not believe them. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. But I think it's bad. You do not know all the bad guy - for example. And why Karl Simon (good guy) asks his dead opponent after a "dark" appearance? "Why? ... for what?" <br /> <br /> I hope hopefully, Germany can do better with Action Movies.
