Cary Grant's fiercest fanatic, I look at this movie and get frustrated with it, AMC announced it's comedy. I was disappointed with a movie! The general attraction of Carrie and AWOL from this whole movie of effortless comedy; He was strained, frustrated, and not himself. The Mississippi character is one of the most terrified stereotypes that I have ever seen - telling him that his slang has been derived from the part of Mississippi (and misinterpreted, he always claims to have said), and when he offers a line, it is one of many other cast members than any other cast member. Mississippi has attempted to paint herself as a country-pumpkin goofer, but eventually, he's only going to remove it from a weak platform. Mansfield looks more like a porn movie than Hollywood sex kitten, and she does not know herself in Hollywood for the performance of her performance, which she fears at the beginning of the film. Ray Walston's role is sugar and eventually contrived. The smallest holiday I saw for four men on the shore. I have seen this nightmare at the very end, and I can tell you that I can not spoil anyone for it, and it is very absurd to see you anytime. The film seeks to understand the credit for patriotism and fighting people, but the film loses its entirety due to its weak plot and weak cast. Sorry, cary!
