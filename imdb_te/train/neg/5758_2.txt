You can say that the actors are going to be cinematic, but this clearly proves that the statement was wrong. Most of the characters in the film are not. They play part of the cardboard cut-outs and about moving about the unpredictable and uninteresting ways. The story is very simple. <br /> <br /> Whenever I can read this film, I have to hold back. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I tell you that 70% of the film is ready for cooking, eating or eating. Most publicly, I think Jack did not spend my time watching. Personally, I could not do footwear and jokes, it was the first half of the film pepper. <br /> <br /> This film is not really valuable outside of my own personal dementia. Countless scenes and camera shots seemed to be pulling. If something happens, the reactions of the characters are vague and dry. <br /> Do not look good at it.
