Designed to hurt any self-respecting intellectual person (or happy). I know that if the director's intention does not like the title character, it is correct, the criticism of America's pro-Marxist 60s movement, notably Hollywood director. 70 is not a filmmaker. There is a very intricate dialogue here, sometimes I'm surprised when I'm not really watching comedy. Do not you think this is a satiric mistake? How easy is that picture. Spasec is in the role of left-wing films, which leads to a clear and inescapable conclusion that Red Hawk is one of Hollywood's simpler morons. But, I mean, are not they all? Nice boobs, but s ** t brains.
