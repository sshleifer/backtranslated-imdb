I saw an episode of this show and I could not even come to the end of the program. Every minute I saw this program my I.Q essentially dropped 10 points. This is basically a children's program but with swearing. She laughs at other people as a catch-up and insult. Anyway the story monkey and the fact that this script for this program must be taken at the gun point of the people and this choice, but this must be written in the retrieved, depressed, horrific-acting program filmed option. Sarah Silverman should use the small money made from this program and get some fierce acting lessons.
