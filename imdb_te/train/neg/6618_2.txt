Total performance: - Finally awaits AAG screens. Unfortunately, it is not possible to set a progressive fire in the audience. The first thing to talk about the movie is the idea of ​​remaking the powerful shameless. And Varma made a good choice to change the overall background of the movie. If you repeat the same ragged background, people say that there is nothing new in this matter. Different background is grateful but not as valuable as he has provided. With SIVA in Telugu, he has been using the same lighting and background type since the beginning of his career. I do not feel strongly about this guy vibration lighting or he may have other lighting technique than the Gordon Visi God. It's all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why some body uses Dutch angles and extreme closeup shots !!!!!!! The shot department is sluggish. The characters do not have an emotion, the performances are not for their recollection, storytelling is worse, the background is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Baba: - Amitabh Bachchan has given priority to his job. VARMA has produced great villains like Bourmatre, Bhavatur Das, Mallik Bhai, but this time he failed to play the best roles of all time of Hindi cinema. Gabbar with Babben does not match. Baboon is more than a villain and he is in the soft corner of his brother (which is a gift in the film). Amitabh's performance is not his mark. His performance is also curious. The scar on his nose, the black and white cinema refers to the forgotten villains. They did not succeed at any time in Baban. <br /> <br /> Narasimha: The first great thing about this character is that you can not keep audiences in suspense about his hands. If Verma does it, it teaches ABCD to a Bachelor Degree holder. Itz is good he started the secret opening. But the flashback is curious. <br /> <br /> Durga: - The only character in the game. <br /> <br /> Haru, Raj, Ghungroo: - No body will suffer or at least consider this role. The complete failure of the film starts when the director does not work in a close friendship between our heroes. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma: - His quality deteriorates and decreases. AAG is considered to be a C grade grade entirely. Shale is a vengeful catastrophe and entertainment that brings a lot of compliments through fire, town problem, true friendship and Dharmendra. The AAG emotion was never loaded with its characters. It is very weak that the heroes do not sympathize with the audience. <br /> <br /> Do not compare AAG with Sholay, you still do not like it. <br /> <br /> You will see this movie. You will be burned alive in Ramgopal Varma Kiya aug
