Comet's Night begins with the world, which will pass a 65-plus plus-year comet one day in a lifetime. Reggae Belmont (Catherine Mary Stewart) decides to spend her booth with film projectionist Larry Dupree (Michael Bowen) ... they will be awake next morning and Larry attempts to kill him, a zombie murder, the same zombie regina attacks But next she learns that almost everyone on the planet has turned red dirt Manages to escape. Almost everyone can survive because of some amazing coincidence that only one other person visits her sister Samantha (Kelly Maroney), where they desperately meet for more survivors & meet with long distance trucker called Hector Gomez (Robert Beltron). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a nasty bunch of scientists need human blood to develop a serum to protect themselves from switching into the dust, and they willingly wait for donors. <br /> <br /> I wrote & written by Tham Eberbard I thought it was a pretty worst view of the comet's night, and I thought it was a boring rubbish ever lived up to it's potential because I'm total surprise of positive comments on IMDb. The script starts off 100 miles an hour with the whole population of the Earth and a zombie attack wipe off but it certainly goes somewhere & then eventually slim the scientists at the end of the film is the slim story of which is the slim story of the evil running. If these scientists wanted blood, killing three or four gangs and killing them and killing them when two sisters gave more blood for their experiments seemed to be a completely bizarre & almost suicide thing. If they want blood to develop a remedy, do not make sense if you die and you have to use human blood, have five or six donors have blood or just two? It is not true that I have two sisters living independently of each other, what is it inequality? When Hector first met a female scientist, where was she or Samantha where or where the underground facility was, where did Hector learn these things before her suicide? <br /> <br /> The comet night comes to me nothing more than an overrated boring piece after I heard a very good things about it, becoming a snails pace slowly after the first twenty odd minutes and become too boring & lame to see <br /> <br /> Director Eberhard is a good I liked the look of the film with red tiling sky and he was alone Made a really cool atmosphere. Unfortunately there are many shots of empty streets, the empty streets of the steady mantage, the deserted roads & abandoned buildings and this is very repetitive & dull. Exactly we are not about it, so cars do not need to move down our throat by continuing to show highways with the wind. The zombies are completely wasted, there are two zombie attacks in the whole movie & two individual zombies while there are two of the most effective nightmare scenes. Many good films with the end of the World shopping sphere in the high mall from Damage of the Dead (1978) pays you a need for Comet Night, or Riffs-Off. Forget about any blood or gore. <br /> <br /> Comet's technically good night is great, special effects are adequate & productive staff are very good at closing the streets. <br /> <br /> The Night of the Comet is a big disappointment for me, and I am very much hopeful. Perhaps the worst motion in the film is that Perzonanliy is not as intuitive, boring, recognizable and sisters' characters just wanna have to go bad shopping for the movie. Really bad & why can not I get a lot of people like this, I will abuse I'm sure I'll give you the abuse I'm going to let go!
