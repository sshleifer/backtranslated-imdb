This film is disappointing. It's incomplete and dull. While Alec Baldwin tried to portray himself as a perfect fair and just a prosecutor (not to mention executive producer), the film did not show any defense lawyers or challenged the audience, but no one wanted to save Nazi's perspective, but it's of Nuremberg Trials Point! Four hours are just laughing on the Nazis .... Simone! <br /> <br /> When the film ended, Tinti showed a 1959 film in Tr√ºhl in Nuremberg. . This image is FAR superior.
