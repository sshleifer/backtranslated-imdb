The search for Hollywood, Hype, Glamor and Gains is not so much spiritual, so the experimental efforts of spiritual life are thinner and often stupid (it is better to go the distance - to look at the depictions of spirituality for Bresson, Dreier, Rosellini and Bergman). "Strange Cargo" is no exception. There are many ideas that are trying to communicate with this odd hybrid of adventure film, love story and religious story. A character of the providence and salvation of Verne (Clarke Gabe is his most sweet guy and self-relation) and Julie (Jon Crawford, Tuff Dummies) is ridiculous at best to work to match. Is not it the Patron Saint of the Star System in the fight before sending more punitive servers in M-G-M? But. . Here are good support demonstrations, and visually arrests moments: shadow prison barracks; A boat that escapes in the moonlight, or against the shape of a painting cloud; Julie runs along the beach with wind whipping; Bargains for Verne liberty as the July and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) building the storm; The exceptional gay camel romance between the two prisoners. . For all, Paul Huscas's honorable and distinguished performance is that hesitant is a killer who can congratulate Campbell's virtues, even though he is revolving around him. In the film's most arrested moment, Hessler left Cambray, outside of the cabin. We hear the wind through the jungle, see the shadows on his face, a moment of fear and self-doubt. Then he goes to night. In this moment, the heller achieves opacity, depth and stability, which can not achieve any of the other roles. Is the film secret that its deepest sympathies are associated with Hassler?
