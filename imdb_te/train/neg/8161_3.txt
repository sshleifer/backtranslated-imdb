<br /> <br /> Mary Lou was a self-confidence to revenge for her return to her burning doom in 1957. <br /> <br /> The film is primarily made in 1986. <br /> <br /> However, Mary Lew's soul does bad things for people and tries to take the body of a person. <br /> <br /> However, the film depends on a bunch of boring and baseless characters. This is not really a sequel, but the only name is the name of the high school. It's average. The horror film falling back, gore, meaning nudity, falling against the Catholic Church. Basic features, boring movie. <br /> Acting is enough to give 10 to 3 acting. You can waste your time on a different thing.
