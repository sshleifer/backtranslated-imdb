This is one of the worst films of OMG, I have seen so much as a Film Film Student. I do not know why Angelina Jolie is in the film. Does she need bad money? I love AJ and I've just seen it all. It's so bad! Bad bad is not even bad. It has 1 or 2 funny little moments but all in all 101 minutes of bad waste. I cant see because AJ is not even better. If you're expecting Romeo and Juliet's returns, the plot can be predicted. All round is frustrating. Maybe your 12 may not be this good movie otherwise I do not really recommend it.
