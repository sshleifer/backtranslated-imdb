True, it sounds like a good idea. John Clees in Steve Martin, Goldie Han and Neil Simon comedy. Where can you go wrong? <br /> The truth is, Martin, the leader, the wrong cast. He does not make a great slapstick from the movies like "The Jerk", but instead plays a role in the dysfunctional role. HOW, it's terrible, with no one to play off. <br /> <br /> It is pretty stupid to be the top spot. I can not say how I changed it, but the characters seem to have a slightly different feeling. By New York they are wrong, do not do anything correctly, and without dissatisfaction, there is nothing funny. <br /> <br /> People who live in New York are not very bright, it's totally unbelievable to give a message recurring throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In the summation, instead of seeing this, go to the original "Ad Couple" rent again.
