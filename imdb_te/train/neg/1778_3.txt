I have nothing against intimidating, but this Stephen King-Definid's nonsense is very fresh, very bright and modern. Plot about a new young boy in a small town, a "sleepwalker" who begs for a more vigorous and vague treatment - a cross between a vampire and a wolf - and the feeds on a woman's virgin's blood. This thriller gives an irreplaceably colorful look and feel, rarely any atmosphere. The kids are pretty imaginative and powerful, but the Big Plus Alice Croide is the boy's boy; Cripps from "Ghost Story" did not come out of the fill-women's mold, and it was a huge loss that was not used more for her. Her performance was creepy and intense, and suggested that "Sleepwalkers" would be a different sight and a better direction in the rough direction. It is over-the-top and commercially driven by an unparalleled tone that extends from thriller to comedy to drama. Stephen King as Real-Life Directors John Landis and Tob Hooper played a guest role. **** from * 1/2
