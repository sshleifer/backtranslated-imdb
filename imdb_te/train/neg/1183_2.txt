This, and immortal teals, both leave a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that borovik is bored by sex, and these two films are warning stories about what is happening if you have sex. As a film, it did not do well - acting is some really painful (like the "American" woman with French accent). The sudden flip-flops of the agitated girl (when it might have been different) about marriage, and that the young man's secretive fiance was not meaningless - did not explain at all. I did not like that the daughter's relationship with the black man is indicated as a reference to the perversion or bestiality of his family. If you want the central idea, this "sexy beast", lives in the woods, was a foundation for an eccentric but fun story, but instead a nasty, negative, moral game.
