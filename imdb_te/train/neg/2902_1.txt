Spoiler: A group of passive-aggressive people who have a family reunion. People do not always tell the script and do things, at least somebody is polite. Hero falls to the woman who sees herself as a soul mate in a bookstore on the hero reunion day, where she appears as her brother's friend at the reunion. He tries to give up his brother's suit, but she is clearly in love with her knowing the hero, by mercilessly wearing a sexy outfit, acting like a story, stretching her all over the brother. At one time, she really bathed with him. He tries to build his eyes. His heart is breaking. <br /> <br /> She suddenly does not want her brother and thinks it is funny until she has to leave the reunion. <br /> <br /> This film really drags. The spectators went through long distances. Writing is anonymous and unbelievable. We walked almost out, but we thought about the things that matter. All lovely reviews should be written by paid shills, to dupe poor suckers like me into seeing the worst like this. Comparing to Little Miss Sunshine? Jeez. What a disadvantage they have to do with opening up this evil, writers, actors, producers and theaters!
