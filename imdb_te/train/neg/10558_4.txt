I do not know why it has fans and I do not know why I score. This is unfair. Many of Gilsco's refusal is to be banned, roll the picture and hold with it, it will be very happy and some of the poor police officers will eventually explain what we've seen. But it is very small and there is nothing to do with anything and to hear a recurring soundtrack through Italian standards. A Gillo, a mish mash full of horror ideas that showcase Klinsky. I turned off Mr de Amato to work out a day and he was getting full of others, as he turned up. Ewa is of course pretty but it is not enough, and in the end we've lost a lot of interest with this sensible and majestic couple, in all the places we've seen so much of her popping. Maybe I'm not in the right mood!
