This is one of the worst fillers I've ever seen and I've seen some of them. It is slow, boring, irrelevant - the plot is not even consistent within its own normal reading. Actors do not work. I can not blame them - they have nothing to do with the bad goings in SummersIsle all that they can do is give a script to the trudge with pain behind their eyes. <br /> The truth is that the rings are not a moment in this film - an instant where one honest line or one is moved. Nicolas Cage's character was badly damaged, and he had no compassion for him all his troubles. There is no doubt that I'm looking for a painful man there but Nicholas Cage is fully aware that his entire career is in the worst movie.
