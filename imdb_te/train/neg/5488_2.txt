Why are the Colin Firth on earth in this nonsense movie? <br /> <br /> This is a picture of grief, sorrow, exotic places ?, ghosts, and the desire to become a vehicle for Mr Darcy. <br /> <br /> There is some sort of opinion that Italy should be good and give something to the Italian language. On the busy highway, there are nonsense episodes in busy churches - but it is not clear that nobody else, or anyone should care. /> <br /> There is also a yong woman in the picture. It is not clear what the job is, but she seemed to be the only one to do with the vapid, inappropriate and moudlin comments. <br /> <br /> The pretty terrible mess of everything. I gave it totally 1 because it does not have the charm of the entirely deadly movie.
