The first Azumi film does not deny commercial production; It is a popular manga's adaptation and starring young, attractive actors and is certainly not in the budget department. <br /> <br /> "Azimi 2" is not about how amazingly the original is. The first thing to set the ringing of the opening hours is the lack of excellent Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm. With him, he did not take his own visual skill and kinetics, but the original style, beauty and especially its heart. While the first "Hitlist" plot has a plot, the story contains a cork screw mess, many times slippery characters are cut off behind each other and can often cause sympathy or sadness. Effective influence among the main characters; Azumi and her colleagues often fall into the group of strappy youth who are arguing in the forest. Spelling does not exist; Seeing anyone who actually lives and who dies, I was amazed. The same applies to villains here. The ultimate battle - in fact all battles - are totally without any tension. They are poorly choreographed and dysfunctional - in some and more - in the absence of their own perfect meaning. The villains are trying hard to be camping, and if they all combine, they will not come in the mile of the country of Pete Barnsian's death in Odgiri. <br /> <br /> Major spoiler at the end of paragraph! <br /> <br /> She told herself that she was fine, and she kept her hair in good condition between her films. Azumi is now full of murderer, she can slap on the move slowly; Unfortunately, now the character is instilled with a sort of man with the non-styled mymarinas, the Uto's model has become more inappropriate. I know that I want to be this film, but with the inability of everybody in this movie, the stupidity of the plot and the general impediment in the movie generally means that it is hardly impossible to back up his character. Kuriyama's performance improved about "Remember me from Kill Bill" about the less chowi; <br /> <br /> Overall, this is just a big disappointment. Any greatness has improved ten times in the first film. A lazy, unsatisfactory - and generally obvious boring - mess.
