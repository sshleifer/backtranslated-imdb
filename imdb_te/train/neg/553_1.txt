After waiting for the hopeful end, I said I did not join the whole series in the first place. The last episode has everything against the previous seven years. It has destroyed everything. The journey is 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the power to reduce it ... let alone say only seven years. Why seven? Why not? Or nothing? Why avoid the whole adventure? All of the Groom's deaths are on the go. Why does she want to save nine to seven? Do not count others or what The most ridiculous piece is when the crew says that going home is not really the most important thing for them. In fact, "travel more important than destination". Unbelievable. In the final scene, other Federation ships encircle and land is in sight. <br /> <br /> <br /> "
