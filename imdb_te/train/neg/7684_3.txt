The movie goes to prove that every film made in Hollywood's glory days is worthless. It probably will not be able to overcome a script written by a chimp because you've got a wonderful ensemble cast! Think about it - Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacal, Charles Boyer, Gloria Graham, Lillian Gish and Paul Stewart in the film, and it's still a bad movie! The basic premise of the film is not bad - a private mental hospital where staff screws more than the patients! Also, there is a lot of promise that subplot (Widmark and Graham) involving overworked husband and wife. However, the script has acted with all maneuverability and eccentricity of the drunken buffalo - again and again with scenes in the film surreptitious and lagging. In fact, it's like a very bad episode of "General Hospital". Smoother, this is not a movie !! Actually, this is not a movie !! <br /> <br /> The film has a very awkward script, but I also blame the producers for misinterpreting and misusing the leading actors. For example, Paul Stewart may not be the surname but the character is an exceptional talent - especially when playing gangsters in film noir films. Stewart is also a very nondescript psychiatrist with some dirty European voice - it has worked well outside of his acting sequence and his character is not fully developed and does not work due to one-dimensional. In addition, Charles Boyer was not hopelessly misleading and did not complete. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very horror movie. It's kind of a train wreck of the way to see it but it's not very beautiful. <br /> <br /> PS - In the life of imitating life, Oscar Levine was one of the patients. . In real life, intelligent levant spent most of his mental institutions and his life.
