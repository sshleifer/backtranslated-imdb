This movie is just bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now I'm out of the way, I feel good. This film is finally weak from the beginning. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddie is very bad in his cartoon character. Thanks to God for killing him. Want to see Rojanne and Tom Arnold Kamos? <br /> <br /> The good thing in this movie is that we are a few backstreets for Freddie. We see that he once had a family, and let's see his abusive, alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). Here are some fine actors (Lisa Jane and Yepte Cato), and they are their best, but the final result is just too bad. The clock I have spent on this movie and half and half I can not get back halfway.
