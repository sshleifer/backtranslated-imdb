Going into the film, you have six lab technicians in the sealed lab with this disappeared maniac. So you're immediately guess who lives and who will die. <br /> You are expecting the existence of this existence, so there is no point for plot turns. <br /> If you're not sure whether this is a B-movie or an image, it's done in a laboratory with an experimental story, a piece of William DeWen: an immediate B-Movie title. <br /> <br /> The film is guaranteed at the beginning. At the laboratory we introduce invisible gorilla who is becoming increasingly violent. Oh, early. The best picture in the whole movie when the grouping of the laboratory looks again. Great special effects. That's the same thing as when they were bacon invisible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have a bare breast couple, really slum dirty joke, you do not have to give a Ray rating. <br /> <br /> Like mock gamer in the Sue freezer for a thriller, 'VAA?' Okay, that's a surprise. When the coin (bacon) returns the last time in the elevator shaft. It's surprising, because you're talking on TV, 'Noooo! You have already died! End the picture! 'Speaking at TV, I've done it last 25 minutes or earlier. 'Put your f # @% inch goggles!' Instead of looking at their infrared gloves, they try every other tricks in the book (Fire Exciers, Sprinkler Systems ...). <br /> The story is ultimately lost in the end. But special effects are good. The only reason I would give a 2/10.
