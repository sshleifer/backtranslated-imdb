What can i say I want to write "spoiler warning" and then use "FIL" in the picture F-word too - every two sentences. I do not like this movie - very sexual abuse, sideways and fraud. And that catch-up is in the window completely. I gave the film "3" and the two points are for the Sexy Movements of Mira Sorvino in the dance floor.
