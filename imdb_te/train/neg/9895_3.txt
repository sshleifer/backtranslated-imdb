If the book is loyal in the book, we can assume that history is not only known to the author. Marc Anthony was shot dead in the battle as it was shot. He died of a cowardly death after he committed suicide and he asked his slave to do for him. The slave chose to kill himself. The true story Marc Anthony decided to be ashamed by the great valor of the slave and copy him. But death was also a drunken failure of Mark Anthony and failed at his own suicide attempt. He cried for Cleopatra and she was bleeding. Marc Anthony died shortly after she threw her trash on the rope. You do not want history to watch this movie. If you like romantic fantasy, then you enjoy!
