Melissa Sezmiller, Wes Bentley, Elijah Dushke and Casey Ablek are playing younger students in Middleton's College in Middleton Town. Four young men form two love triangles. They argue in the mountain highway that hangs over and overnight at an alternate full moon. They do not look exactly and they careen into another car and one or more of them have been killed. The ghostly nightmare begins ... Pretty lousy and politically correct horror movie without gore and nudity. It definitely affects the "Carnival of Souls" .The film is good, unfortunately there is zero suspense. Another instantly unforgettable TV-boper trash from 10.
