Before all; Trying to explain history from the positions of guns, germs and steel is very stupid. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The reason for Western success is mere good luck, the benefits of pets and animals. As we know, all the benefits and bonuses around the world are not useless if not done properly. Japan has no natural resources, but Japan is one of the top global economies to have the same situation in Singapore, but in Niger, there are fewer wins in the country with great oil resources. Both of these countries have access to Western technology and innovations, but why such a gap? <br /> <br /> Getting to know the end of the image of the diamond is important for understanding guns, germs and steel reasons. Perhaps the main factor in the world is geography, but does people have the ability to understand and use? Mental ability to understand. Geography is the only one in this case.
