We all know when we have a bad day at office, right? Well, this Neil Simon comedy looks like you're trying to come to office when it's all bad. Sometimes, it's not worth going on, what do I mean? Sleeve Martin is not a lousy, and sometimes, it's not worth doing when it's already going, with Jack Lemon and Sandy Dennis in the 1970s ... a comedian or wrong to the role of the comedian, emphasizes the advertising executive; On the contrary, two counts. And, Goldie Hone is not equally useless; Since she saw her work in the 1960s for the first time in TV's Rowan and Martins Laugh-In, it's great, but not great. <br /> <br /> The problem with this picture is that it is impossible to find a couple: it really is about New York and why everybody must live their lives away in marriage happiness and come to New York to love ?? Like? In the great city of the world. <br /> <br /> Look, the 1970s movie is still a fantastic joke, where you go somewhere, conditions and vision gags you can imagine what happens to you in a strange atmosphere. This 1999 version is unfortunately going into the audience especially unsatisfactory tangents these days, expecting it or wanting to see the extra. For example, there is no content with the star's appeal of major players, a guest role (most of all) we know most from Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of New York. What? Was the then President Giulia Bucking? Worse ?? <br /> <br /> And do we have John Clees cleansing his role as basil falti? But at this time, even a prancing cross-dresser ?? Once again, she is inspiring to Rich Customers, making herself a guest of the hotel employees and is generally seen as the idiot in this role. And, in the process, doing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers, undoubtedly the best British comedy series, bar none none <br /> Why did this 1999 film take place? In the 1970s, New York was a dying city, in many respects. It literally went bankrupt. As you did in 1970, this is the city you've seen: terrible, dark, moody, undisturbed and abusive, and finally the Big Smoke in their new life (finally, contaminated and in all). <br /> <br /> As of 1999, things get better: Glitz has come back, New York has grown up, and you have a great upset in the Big Apple, the couple looking at that Max in the end and in the pursuit of American freedom, freedom and happiness in life. Hence, the film is really ridiculous, but the producers are not the ones that have expected. In the comedy, like Steve Martin and Goldie Han, this movie is a mockery of the great story with the great Jack Lemmon. If you see the next one, obviously not having trouble with this problem.
