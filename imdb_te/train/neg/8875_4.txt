If it's a "favorite" movie of others, they need some serious help. There is nothing funny or brilliant about this trash. <br /> <br /> I do not see the original image as a remake of this (some 1950s film), but this is better than the new bannersordarisation. <br /> <br /> The army is an element of the army for a major army, and winds that teach children to the ROTC school. Unfortunately, the principal Damon Weines ... so the kids are in the world for the annoying, humorous inequality. Can this losing player play in shape? Can they be some more people? Motion picture bombs, like most Vaynes films, have only a few alcohol moments. One minute on William Hickey's screen is very small. This lovely old man (known to him as a "Cry from the Crypt" actor best known to you by Uncle Louise from "The Christmas Order") he is on the screen every moment, which is not quite here. <br /> <br /> Bam Boom appears as a biker in a busy, perfectly suited for him. I do not care for Bam Bam, but I continue the role of "biker" until he is taken for a military film. <br /> <br /> After all, for the attractive teacher Major Pane, he is poorly employed, there is no social skills and it is impossible to change the person you want to spend time with. She must be very stupid or very upset. <br /> <br /> In this movie, "Movements (including a very good" robot "), and 2 live crews <br /> <br /> If you want to see a loser a loser with an image, help losing children become heroes, rent or buy "Goes to Ernest Camp." At least he's a lovable loser, and actually funny If Major Pane fights with a badger I'm good He did, but he did not forget Payne, forget the wines ... you can do it very well.
