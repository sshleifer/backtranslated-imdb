"Igor and the Lonetics" is a totally useless and inhumane attempt in a silly-hippie-fiction-killing-spree horror film. Almost twenty years later, Charles Manson is still unpredictable but encourages inefficient worst-filmmakers. It is a very boring and completely unadulterated padding footage to accompany nonsense plot, in other words, a typical Troma product. Is there a bit of random gore and inappropriate dance at the show? Is not it bad? But it is very disappointing and ugly, it's frustrating to see. "Igor and Lunatics" is also disappointing as seeing even a lot of footage using a lot of footage, so killing as a circle example. The involuntary plot seeks to tell the story of hippie cult by drug addict and Charlie Manson Vanneba Paul. One of Paul's lowly siblings is obsessed with biblical stories and drug orgies entitled Igor, and periodically total worship leads to more ruthless insanity. Just describe how little crazy Igor means by: he tears the tears of heart straight into a really sexy black hicker girl! There are an unpleasant synthesizer soundtrack and some really embarrassing duplicate-artistic camera tricks, such as slower film and sensational sequences. The worst will be more or less valuable, and the poor girl can be a sequence when half a cut with a machete. For special reasons, the camera has a bladder's shot in the stomach with a bleeding fifteen seconds.
