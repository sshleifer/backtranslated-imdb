As noted, this formula has been filmed several times, recently with "You've Got Mail", Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pat" Ryan. In many versions, this is my favorite. I think the problem studio is on the coast of the Stars Charisma, which does not quite cut it here. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between the two leads never come to a fixture in this film. There are no real sparks. The old donuts of Van Johnson and Judy Garland's day, pleasant but blonde reminded me. And follow only the rest of the cinema when the leads are boring. Judy is particularly disappointing. She's not in the neck! I do not know if she has no pain or something is wrong but she looks like a turtle trying to pull its head in its shell, all hunched and everything. I can not figure out how hot the van Johnson is. I would have made a bee line for that beautiful violin player. And Van is not great either. I have always thought of him as a regular Hollywood celebrity and he does nothing to dispel the film. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of stars or prefer this movie at the beginning of the 1900s. But there are so many fun romantic comedies, and they provide fresh water over a long stale candy.
