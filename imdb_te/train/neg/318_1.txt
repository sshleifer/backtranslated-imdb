When I was new in college, I stole this movie. I tried three times to see it, and I wanted to see the two friends. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I never heard of this film, but it's funny since he's been so fun." Wrong! I can not see this pile of rubbish after a dream bout match / humiliating battle, where a person with a good ginger causes your opponent's physical pain. You might think that harmful comedy is harmful, but after watching this you will know its true. This movie is not worth the price I paid for. I saw Steven Segel's ton of films, and I also saw crossroads twice ... but I could not see it yet.
