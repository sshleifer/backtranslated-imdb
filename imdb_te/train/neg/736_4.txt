Twenty years ago, a five-year-old boy, Michael Hawthorne, committed suicide after killing an ax in his father's death on the road to his father's death. At present, Michael (Gordon Currie) and his friends Peg (Stacy Grant) and his friends Chris (Mike Einhue), Jennifer (Emmanuel Vagier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendan Beaser), Mitch Maldives Philip Rice) and Trish (Rachel Heyard) to live with his grandfather with his grandfather for Halloween in the country. He exhibits an old Indian festoon, using his carved wooden dummy morty (Jon Fed√©lie), with his grandiose internal fear and his Indian friend Crow (Byron's chief moon), removing his fears. <br /> <br /> Michael's greatest fear is to become a serial killer as his father, but if something goes wrong Morty kills his father and kills his friends. <br /> <br /> <br /> "Fear: Resurrection" is a despair and nonsense slash in which each friend uses an interesting concept of removing great intermittent fear before it grows, but in full screenplay of the clicks full of clues. There are some exaggeration presentations, for example Ms. Betsy Palmer; Others are very weak, but generally acting is good. Why is unexpected explanation for survival? Furthermore, even if surrounded by close friends, the group experiences pain or suffering if each of them dies. They could build a good dramatic situation at less than fifty minutes. In the end, his father was interested in the fact that Michael might not have observed this story. I do not know the previous reference to the DVD released on Brazil in 87 minutes. Special effects are very reasonable for a B-image. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma noot de Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Night of Halloween")
