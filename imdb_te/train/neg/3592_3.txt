For a fan series, I accept the Hidden Frontier is not all bad. But, reviewing this series should not be based on whether the fan is a series. It is good to show himself initiative. Also creativity. I am people with normal jobs and a great enthusiastic heart for Star Trek. But, doing this work. These resources are looming. Take this time, and still take all the errors. <br /> First of all acting, and the lines are awful. For the most part. Dialogues are not in the Star Trek, but are in the 70s military show. Captain (Mr. Schickette) is always trying to stimulate laughter. And most characters are just studying their lines. The directors actually need to know the term "retake" in the dictionary itself. But I also intended to make a series of "Two Takes Frakes" directed by TNG episodes and movies, and I could not help, and most of the actors felt that they were typical Trekes. <br /> <br /> The quality of my big anxiety and releases about the whole project. When they first had a lot of time, and decided to spend the resources in this sequence - why not get good quality? Using the quick time format, the talent with less low resolution ceases. "Higres" components are considered to be poor quality compared to standard quality ranges. Using the Xvid codec, the larger resolution and file size improved the better experience. If the band is in trouble with problems, it will solve a torrent tracker. <br /> <br /> The team decides to brush the series, perhaps it is released on DVD and deserves.
