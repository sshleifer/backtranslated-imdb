Trailers for this film are better than this film. No talent and money is waste. I was not at least $ 9 because I was waiting for this film to come on DVD. This film will completely lose the mark. What a great image for all the actors turned out to be a B-movie. The film was very slow and I thought I was going somewhere, it almost did, but it did not. At this day and age, the film requires unexpected plot twists and turns and nothing is provided. The whole thing about how everyone doubts is the way it was directed, the lighting, the distribution of the lines, the writing or the thing, but nothing came of it. A lot of hype for nothing. I was very disappointed in the film, and not everybody to see it. Cheesy saxophone music worse. Moreover, the rest of the film did nothing. No disappointment.
