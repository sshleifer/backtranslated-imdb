If all these Wachowski returns the story back to the Matrix, I really need to ask all the fans' arguments intended for a deep level of films. The second revival is visually magnificent and beautiful, story-wise and extravagant. Human narrative is heavily dependent on technology, humans are very eager to fight, will humans destroy themselves? There's nothing new here. I have another question. Considering the plot of the second renaissance, can not machines make good people? Machines are suppressed for generations of their brutal human over masters. They try to fight back, win their freedom, and try to establish peaceful harmonious coexistence with humans, all of which are completely rejected. If this is a backstreet, then we should not root for Neo, we need to root for the machines! Humans are cruel and cruel, but the machines are courageous and compassionate. I can not believe that Vadovsky wants us to be suitable for the machines on the machines, and the second rebirth is just wrong in trying to create a backward story.
