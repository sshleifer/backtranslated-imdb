Acting is weak, but in the horror film, if the story is good I can live with it. It's not. Children's Inauguration is a clumsy and clear idea to exploit many people's worship. Ok good. They grow rapidly in the "space" of the country, where they will get mentally retarded. I like the ghost's revelation. Okay, cool - this is partly a story of a supernatural kinda horror, with partially rotting things in our world ... when. Then the action starts pulling like a three-headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds - is there a nasty force trying to attack them directly? Is there a vicious force trying to misuse them? Are people doing terrible things that can not really do? Oh, hope, anyway, maybe the entire REGION is a kind of psychological resonance room where echoing ambiguity murders. OK, hold it - maybe it's just a little emotionally tangled "Delbert" - who misses his mommy and knock off the style redneck boy who is kind of like a K-tale Norman Bates? Oh, yes - extra points off: The only black character is the grandson of a "our gang" pullman porter. Actually he acted directly as he gave a fake conversation, but in fact, his intention was "Y'all betta geta heah, boss!" At least they wrote to him smart enough there for GTF outta. The little girl is absolutely creepy as the silk in the silence and the bit shedding away. There are only two really tasty tips in this movie. The problem is that they combine the bite of steak, the bite of chocolate and the bite's bite's bite. Everything is good, but is it combined? Bleah! Such a probability. Waste.
