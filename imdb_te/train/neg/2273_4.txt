This is not a major disaster I'm looking for, but I'm as good as my description of the film. I'm sure it will not mean that this film is funny, but I suppose it's all about the taste. Personally, I can not find funny to see their monotonous lives live or to be fooling themselves on television, but again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's curiosity daytime talk show. I did not get bored at all, but I was never enjoyed. If you're in mood to watch a bad movie, but it's not too painful to sit, this is a good choice.
