The cut tries as much as the post-scream slashers, a parody of the horror genre that tried to be brilliant by suggesting other famous horror movies. Now, I do not call 'Scream' a 'scream', a horror movie that has a great job of mixing horror and comedy. The high level of cut will fail. It has its moments, but overall it's not just an "very bad" film, it just works less than an average. <br /> <br /> With the fact that the first five minutes or even Kylie Minogue does not really act, she takes her tongue out. Go a little forward and a group of filmmakers want to end its film, which is clearly blamed. <br /> As you might guess, a cast and a group will choose one who masks the masks slowly. <br /> <br /> The unusual storyline, some of the lesser acting and speculative conclusions that follow. There is plenty of reference in the film, everything from 'scream' to 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. It's not smart, but it feels like the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala scream. There is little gore and nudity for a slasher, it's a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that does not have a whole lot. We must support this movie because I'm Australian and we're not good when it comes to horror (though we have our gems) but the cut is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> But it looked me over for 90 minutes, so it was at least fine. <br /> <br /> I want to congratulate myself on this film, but if you're looking for a good movie, stay away. / 5
