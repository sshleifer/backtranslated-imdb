<br /> <br /> The product makes a bat from the lightning tree (leaving a glowing stump) where the memory is very cheap and evil ... remember the shot from "natural"? <br /> <br /> The filmmakers used the same scene, which slammed a tree branch into the house. <br /> <br /> They used footage from the natural, or they were trying to get out of the truck after that. Such high performance in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A bad image, really bad image.
