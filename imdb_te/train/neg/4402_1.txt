I loved it even when they were not in love with Lesbian movies. I'm biased, I guess! <br /> <br /> "Yes, the scenery and the buildings are beautiful, and there is a small but beautiful romantic disturbance, but the film is full of time, and the elderly substitute, the drug or the mildest / Alternating between rocks / getting out, and Ella can not be explained by the torture of the film by the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why is Anna so desperate and withdrawn? <br /> <br /> It is not a relationship between the two, but some satisfaction.Enmarie asked Ella at one point, "Why do you love me?" Ella does not even know it. When interacting with two women and local people, this is much more than a (unfortunate) lesbian. The film is a good joke, but I was inadvertent. Women with a seed in the trunk of a Ford coupe with two seats in the journey. Yet, when they set up camp, to the enormous tent, piercing, sleeping gear, and a table, chair and have a typewriter! On top of that, they board in a ferry, we see the piles of luggage, perhaps theirs, perhaps even in the small Ford's trunk! <br /> <br /> By the whole picture, we can not see a gas station or anywhere in the area where gasoline is purchased does not appear anywhere. Mostly they are on a journeyless journey of desolate desert. <br /> There are not so many good lesbian movies, there are good or bad, but it's much better and much less. Leave this a rock.
