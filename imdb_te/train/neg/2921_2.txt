The story is related to a genealogy researcher (Male Harris), who was appointed by the cosmetic queen-anunt of the Este Lauder. Her aunt (we're going to imagine marriage) is trying to get out of a large family in Europe. They are a girl who is standing with an ornate music box. The researcher is headed to Europe and maintains his search in places like Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The scenery is the real thing and actually shot in the city (unlike a murderer, she has written where Jessica is supposed to be visiting a distant locale and never left Lansbury Burbank). However, he encounters a young man who is looking to solve his own family mystery, and they will cross the clues and reach the team to intimidate bad people. The conversation, especially the romantic conversation, is terrible. I looked at the scene but the script was very bad and I stood up to see if it was more confusing. It did. Acting also survived. I can see why Mel Harris's career is not really afterwards, but she's enough (but her co-star is very old). But, the supporting players came out of the Community Playhouse. I also said how many times "Budapest". Yes, it is pronounced bud-a-pusht. We know, okay? I'd like to be one of those Harlequin movies and that's exactly half of the film. I think it's all right.
