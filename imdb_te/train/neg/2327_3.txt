The film comes out of the dark prison of Full Moon Entertainment. The production company has gained fame and fortune in the early 1990s, producing horrible bad and cheesy horror films. Their ouvre most famous disasters "reliefs", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". None of these are recommended and not Dr. Morridy. Hyperactive Director Charles Band came to the right company for his film. Dr. Mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely ridiculous. I saw it only for Jeffrey Combs. If you are his fan, I know that it has many losses. For every good image, he seems to have done 5 lesser ones. However, this story is about the war between 2 ancient wizards. A good man who spent 150 years to save humans (Jeffrey Dr. Morrit) and a scoundrel called Kabal. He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason that I already forgot. Combs gets his instructions from the teacher. The "Guy" is only pair of eyes in space. Very cheesy, too! Every time and on the light of a eye is shown on the screen but the image is about the only form of special effects. The whole thing was just a whining and nagging one piece and two wizards finally face each other, it was over ... before I knew it ... I would have guessed it for the evil wizard to fight back at least, but nooooooo .. Some scenes, you really are realism and creativity (Such as Jeffrey's speech on the Moon's influence on criminals) Ryu, who really care about you, you are also very small, but nice angles, known as Edgar Allen), but overall, it's a terrible waste of time and energy there. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and a superhero in my eyes ... but he definitely does not need to put on a stupid mail.
