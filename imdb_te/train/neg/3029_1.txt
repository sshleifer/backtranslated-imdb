From the very first moment, this "thing" is a terrible sequence of small cuts in the obscure camera work. Though the whole storyline has a breathtaking potential, the story is very bad that I can not afford it. In the middle of the picture, the actions of the characters do not understand me. <br /> <br /> For example, Ed's idea was to make coffee for them after being shot and killed by his son's hands. It's just a very stupid idea. Domino does not question the fragmentary orders breaking from Claremont Williams, and I try to get me through a breaking-up phone connection; She can not be too suspicious if Williams goes on. Since the FBI agents show one of their minds with the same helicopter, they have every reason to consider the capital mafia shoot-out. In addition, it is difficult to trigger murders by disclosing and retaining information related to the Sigliuti. If they are the way the FBI investigates the way it is for me to say goodbye to justice. In fact, if they take such action they have a case of repair. If we do not kill passengers too much, let's look at a car accident at least one seriously, but all the injuries remain. In contrast, the danger quickly brought Domino to Choco's love, not from the perspective of Damon, which was discovered by previous events, but it was just drugs for eyeballs. <br /> <br /> The whole scene of the scenes was dramatic with a dramatic sound that started from Claremont Williams's phone call. Combining this awful, sophisticated camera work just makes a piece of each time I call a movie. Sorry for the futile effort of the lead actors, its skill is not a question.
