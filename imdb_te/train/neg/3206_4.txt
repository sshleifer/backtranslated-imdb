I have heard that Seeran Montano decided to make a film in Sebiano. (The philosophy is not the 'dialectic' which is incorrectly suggested. Sebenuto and Tagalog are not mutually exclusive in Spanish and Spanish.) I was very disappointed when I saw the film. For Canadian and Sebbano's parents, I am optimistic about the film revival of the film industry. I've heard that Filipinos do not have another stupid action movie or drama when I love these films. <br /> <br /> Panagoye Caesar is working on Ego's journey to Montaña. Montaña plays the hero of this movie. And when I say 'hero' I am in the most ecstatic sense of etiquette; His work is to win a girl's heart and lead the bol-anons to victory against the Japanese. There is no depth or complexity in his role. He fits the mold of the hero. The remaining characters are a dimensional; They're all suited to their cookie cutter roles. <br /> <br /> I'm for slow-moving / mediocre films, but this film is slowly moving. It does not really meditate on anything. Because a movie is historically-backdrop, drama and slow motion pictures are not made. <br /> <br /> Specially Philip Antony of American actor. <br /> <br /> If Masano Wisan wants to revive the film industry, he really thinks about this concept. He wanted to make Wisan movies where he could compete in Cannes and Toronto, but this film was indeed an invasion of such celebrations. To achieve movies for mainstream consciousness, Vision made at least a film that attracted viewers, even though he was sacrificing quality. <br /> <br /> There is at least one foot in the audience-eye-catching film door because he does not think or get information about what kind of awards are awarded to Cannes. <br /> <br /> I'm scared now. If I want to see more Visayan movies with a Filipino I'd get an answer like, "Do not Visayans do good movies if you do not see Panaghoy Say Suba?" In fact it's ridiculous, this is an example of a Visas film and maybe anyone will be able to see these days. <br /> <br /> Example of meditation movies, tagalogog blackout or David Lynch's The Straight Story. I hate to encourage the Tagalog language because it is inadequate and unfairly encouraged and lessened by the utterances of the Filipino philippines, but I say blackout is a very good movie to call a spade a spade. These films are heavily dependent on what Hitchcock calls 'pure motion picture'. Images without words are used to tell the story. But I'm cooking this little definition for these two films, and these films use images without words to say the movie's mood. And they do well. <br /> <br /> Panagai feels that if they take only the sweep shots of the landscape, they have created mood. <br /> <br /> What's with a number of Filipinos movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother?
