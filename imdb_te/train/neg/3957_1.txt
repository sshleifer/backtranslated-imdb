The original Boogeyman is a crazy but entertaining supernatural slasher movie. Not a great movie but a fun one in the right frame of mind. The third installment of the series, on the other hand, the Boogeyman Return, is just brutal. It will have two things. First, cheap and deadly new footage. Second, the lads of recycled bits from the very first film. The new thing is unbelievable innocent but it's just too tedious, in an amusing way. This footage is apparently quickly and without any effort. It serves as a framing device for endless clips from the first (and second) films. And boy, they did not breach those clips from the movies before; Sometimes the sequences will be returned to the parts only correctly, which we can see with our own eyes. The overall experience of looking at this is really mind-numbing. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman is an example of exploiting the worst kind of back; The most hateful way is to capture the audience. I want this review to be brief and I want to make this movie. There is no value here. It's worthless.
