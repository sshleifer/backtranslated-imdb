I gave this one 1. There are always plenty of plot turns to be sure to root for you. Total turbulence. Everyone gets killed or almost so. I'm tired of cross-hairs and change opinions. I can not give away the plot. Convoded and silly. I looked at it and I paid my money. I'm more honest with the reviews.
