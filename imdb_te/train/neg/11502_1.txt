The film is painful and slow and there is no plot. It informs the lives of a climbing boat crew. One of the elderly is honest in his effort to get a job. <br /> <br /> There may be some social comments here, but no one is muddled because it is portrayed in a very sympathetic light. I saw all the tough things and built expectations for a huge redundancy payment. Do not disappear. The IMDb rating is always a good competition for my tastes. <br /> <br /> My wife Javier Barem is also good in this film. He is not my type, so, my contract does not mean much. <br /> Sigh. I give it a 1.
