I just met my friends and I hoped it would be fun because it was fun. <br /> I'm not stupid enough to hire this idea as a zombie movie there with Romero or Fulse, but I'll laugh it out. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an entertaining movie or looking for an image to move your head to trouble you go for it. This junior- "Mystery Science Theater" is perfect for fans, but just the downside is it's bad, it's fun. <br /> <br /> I personally feel that it is an insult to other Hollywood titles known as this movie has its own style when it sucks.
