Monica Mitchell's Showbiz irony has some laughter and some premeditated violence. I can not say blood soaking. But there is shame and trauma. Max Matio (John Cassini) is a protagonist, which has a consistent presence on the screen, but there is a terrible track record selected for the parts he went to. As a nephew of the producer or the role he desires. Well, the best thing to do, is to leave the competition ... Max is engaged with such ideas. A rewarding career is just swing, push and burned. Other actors: Reine Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and Kimmy Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, is it a trade show ... or is it?
