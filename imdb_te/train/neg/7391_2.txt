For most Steven Siegel fans I know I'm going to make a film every time I'm going to make a film but I think I have a very sororiter budget. The worst thing about dabbing is the main problem I've seen in the film, which has to be done in some of the films and I agree but if you overdraw with completely different voice voice and keep doing this movie away the overdinging magic. The sets are constructed without any caution, as it is at the top of the sliding glass in a sequence in a sequence. I really disappointed with this movie and only hope Stevens will be more complete before sending the movie for the next project purchase / rental. The story of this film has made me wonder if I looked at a sci-fi movie or looked like alien as some episodes but I never found myself totally confusing as they never fully explain what was going on.
