This movie reminds me of "Irversecible (2002)", another art-film film is a violent and intense method of human nature. I do not like the movie but I can not say that it is a bad movie, it's just special. I also reminded you of "Camping Cosmos (1996)", where there is a group of low-class group of sea camp in Belgium. The same description of the people living together, with all of the characters adjacent to their will and incompatible together with their will. I also thought about the books written by the French writer Emile Zola, who wrote a natural style. I do not like the film and I do not even like the people who it is. They all seem so vulgar, without the basic good taste. They can question why they live, as they are on this planet, those in a big procession need to live against their will. Or you can say: hell is this world.
