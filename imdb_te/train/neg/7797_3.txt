<br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films I've ever encountered, but I want to say that some of the criticisms that I have heard are unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Pure film production is the director of this film. He is re-managed by a limited budget and VHS camera, but the actual compilation, camera angles, camera movements and scene performances are beautiful. I have seen many films that are "very bad". There are at least scenes in the scenes that do not get confused and there are some clever shots here and there. Also, forest scenes have a good atmosphere. Not only so much you can do with a VHS camera, and he does a nice job for most of the technologies go. No artistic merit, nothing. The scene that sets the camera up to urinate a urine in the woods for 15 seconds is illustrated by the artistic style of the whole movie. This is pure garbage ... the whole worst. <br /> <br /> Gore is good for the film in this budget series. <br /> I'm not exactly fake, but there are a lot of people, and it's very unusual. <br /> <br /> I saw the American version with deliberately camping dubbing. It's a good idea (the only thing that allowed me to make me through the movie) ... Unfortunately, it's unique at the end, it's a really terrible movie, but I would recommend it to the value of camps. It finds a worse picture and puts it in a separate section.
