I try to keep track of this film by misleading the film as "killing and killing young people in his home." At the age of 10 I saw parts of the film for the first time when I was walking in the cab. It's very impressive! It is the kind of movie that kids can not see, and switch to the channel when their parents arrive. When I see who's cast, I can not believe that some of these good actors are in such a terrible film. Then again, if you want to murder those who cheated on their wives, this is an interesting movie. Also, if I remember, there is some pretty interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Perhaps the end of all periods, but still ... memorable.
