"Hitchcakian" is trying to match or reflect this "swivel", but Hitchcock fans are not out-of-out efforts to waste $ 7 in this film ... Weak acting weak story is a weaker script. <br /> The real suspense is not. <br /> You wait all the way through the weakness of this film for big payments or any payment ... You're the heck about how about about at all. <br /> <br /> Make "alternative lifestyle" HIP and politically correct !! ... I can not recommend it to anyone ... Did I say how weak is acting? Williams has done a good job as Peter Pan and "Mork". But those very innocent times ...........
