<br /> <br /> The settings and masks are very good, but this is a good piece of the film. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg does not act, he is in the film, looking stupid. Other actors would not be good. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about everything else is the story. It's certainly ridiculous! For example: faults are disorganized on the ground, but humans will not attack them, but they will wait until they return again! This is an example of a stupid story, but it takes a lot of time to tell everyone.
