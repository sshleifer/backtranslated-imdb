The quality I downloaded on an Internet site yesterday is good! I have received high expectations because I am a super star in the film, Amitabh Bachchan is a villain (I am a flop). Especially his actors were valued for his roles. Unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan failed to impress the villain, proving that nobody could compete with Azad Khan's magic rig to return to Amitabh the last seven years! Shale, old is a milestone in an Indian film, all-actors, Cult Dialog, Stylish Cinematography and a wonderful soundtrack. A good actor like Ajay Devgan's talents and his acting brilliance Raj does not know what a new person is doing. Nisha Kothari proved to us one of the worst actresses, and I still do not know how it is in a song in the UGMILA & Abhishek of RGV's team Mohan Lal with his best effort and Sushmita Sen's work is good, working in the film. This is the original Shale's carnage
