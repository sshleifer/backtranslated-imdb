This movie is trash-poor. It has a terrible taste, and based on realistic programming, is pedestrian and written in the script - it does not add too many numbers, but it makes the discouragement even more. The scenes and dialogues are not well-directed and directed. Robin Williams is not sure what he sees in this role or story. To begin with, Williams does not persuade homosexuals in the breakup of the relationship or the relationship is also interesting. Worse, stressed by an ugly pedophile story that is based on his character and is not a place like a plot device. You have a good Rory Culkin tastelessly spouting "d_ck_smker" - good fun - it's annoying enough and then laughed by Williams's character. Finally, you have the Sandhya Oh, who is the guardian of the envoy for Williams and is thrown at the end of the absolute shock. Tony Collete's role is the repeat-hash of her 6th Sense performance in the worst annoying and poor direction. Ability to miss a lot.
