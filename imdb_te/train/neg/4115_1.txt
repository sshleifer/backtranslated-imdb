"Power Play" starts off interesting but the hill goes down faster. Only good actor Tobin Bell and he is a very small part. Beyond Bell, "Power Play" has no redemption value or interest. "Power Play" has more earthquakes in California than in a few days a year. The earthquake scene in the mall is entirely made and completely unreliable. And all the action scenes will be a bunch of third graders putting on a game. <br /> <br /> "Power Play" in the 60s or 70s is considered to be the "Bee" Class Movie. The fact that "Power Play" took place in 2001 is really sad. Is the topic like a "D" class image? If so, the "power play" molding vowels.
