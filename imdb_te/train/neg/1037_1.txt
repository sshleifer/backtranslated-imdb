<br /> <br /> This poor suspension for an enthusiastic hourly show at Suns is a great example of what has happened to most indie film makers these days. <br /> <br /> The first is the cinematography art. Picking up a 16mm camera and pointing out someone can not make it for a real movie. <br /> <br /> I think the Director is a good choice for someone to choose a camcorder. <br /> <br /> Second, indie movies are related to real people. There is no truth in this movie. <br /> <br /> They can not see people in any way. <br /> <br /> "How cool and experimental" are the authors of the author they are trying to impress their friends? <br /> Sorry, but it is not good writing or good direction. <br /> <br /> The rest of the bad film that went to Sundance. <br /> <br /> My respect for the Sundance brand remains.
