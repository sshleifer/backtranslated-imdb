Boring conversations and endless scenes of monologues are confused and involuntary mess. It's not exaggeration: you need to make a lot of effort to get involved with it. <br /> <br /> I'm fascinous to say why Erwin / Elvira committed suicides in the end. Instead, someone is trying to explain in each scene: "When he was young, it happened ..." and "He returned from Casablanca and ordered everything to be cut ..." /> <br /> Soon to be in the film, Erwin / Elvira A friend talking to a whore (perfectly a slaughterhouse is the best place for a fun little chat) and Elvira Zee When the story ita, Fassbinder shows the killing of a cow after another. It's hard to know what the sequerer or the sequestrate say. <br /> <br /> In fact, we are very forced and coarse symbolism, "I feel so bad in my life and will die". <br /> <br /> He only recognizes Elvira only when he has performed quite gay choreography with two other guys (as he goes to the level of homosexuality) in small touch movements. <br /> <br /> Some interesting shots and ideas, I agree (when Sun Young tells the story of the young Erwin), but everything in the film is ruined by the fanbinder self-joy.
