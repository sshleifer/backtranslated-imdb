Here we are: two travelers from the world of distant future come to earth ... there is a desperate target to preserve a life, and another inhuman killing, giving birth to a whole race. <br /> <br /> What do we call this killing machine? He's kind of a vandal, or eradicator ... something like a devastation or something. What is the word I'm looking for ... something-eradicate- things? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the rescuer (who has stolen the white elegance stolen from Luke Skywalker in favor of local outfit) must first find a young man and be a future-born hero. Wicked Yuhhah ... "Destroyer" kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes, then by asking her to find a woman by visiting her office and frightening the eyes of the public and asking her to reprimand her. Then the seemingly death and unstoppable "eradicator" begins a desperate race for survival while chasing a couple across the countryside. <br /> <br /> At an amazing end, he tries to overthrow them under full wheel tanker trucks. .. acid. Then the truck will crash. They will be saved ... but not! He is stronger and stronger again. <br /> He kills the protector and chases the girl into a meat packing plant, where at the end of a horror he calls a large part of the industrial machine and destroys once and for all. Mr. Protector meets Sean Young by kissing her in a bar and then tells her that she will be born in 3 days. <br /> <br /> The costumes and effects of the film are very good ... The first time I saw them on the Star Trek I loved them: The Next Generation is a lot! Seen Young makes another great turn as a substitute replica, and career sweat-hog Stephen Baldwin is also the youngest fat cop boyfriend. Not sure where he fits the plot ... maybe he's imported from a different James Cameron film?
