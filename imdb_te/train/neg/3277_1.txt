If you ever see the disaster's dux, you know that you do not have to worry about drugs or slums or crude behavior. The movie you know is no longer the case! This image is horrible! I am not as fun as the main characters are drugs, funny and nice. They took a spectacular performance and made it worse. Daisy, who is a little fair in the original show, now looks and works as a street corner for her services. I'm very glad to see this movie before I get out of it, 15 minutes in the film I'm ready to go. I'm thinking it's better, but it's getting worse for a minute. I have never seen this film. I threw a good performance and left a terrible flavor in my mouth. Make it your favor, look at your money, it's not a waste of money, but 2 hours of your life is not waste, you can never get back!
