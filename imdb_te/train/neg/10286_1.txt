The roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee were kidnapped by the terrible duodies while shopping and at the age of ten, the girls reluctantly returned to a secluded island, claiming they were the last victims of evil and luck. <br /> <br /> A beautifully drawn film about the girls visiting the island for the first time and fighting with a cannibal family is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> It is the point that everybody who is very scary I really started feeling bad for the poor Hank Worden who deserved the very good. <br /> <br /> I would like to admit that this movie was like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> The Dark Sky DVD Extras: Vintage ads in various drives diet; And "Bonnie Kids" (featuring nudity), "centerfolk girls", "part-time wif" (nudity features), "psyche killer" and "eeten alive". The DVD also included "Barracuda" of 1978
