"Seed" torture is pornography ... There is no doubt about it. <br /> Surprisingly, Uwe Boll has written, produced, and directed a more polished film than any other remembrance made in recent memory. <br /> <br /> Every time I see a bol, the script must be lost. There are only gaps in story and dialogue. However, there is nothing either. <br /> <br /> The six police officers who went to arrest broke up and broke the seed. When their special ways come to dark, who will enter the houses, rather than real cops, who will be cleared by couples or tries? Why do not the cops always use their radios? How can dead bodies quickly degenerate, usually taking several months? (I know the time-lapse photography ... but the seed is spending the time to decline to the point of the previous victim). How should a woman wear the bib-overs and a mask when he is looking for death penalty instead of the usual jail uniforms? How can you enter the maximum security jail, stroll around the cell block, and then go out again without being stopped or noticed? If about 80 people (according to some newspaper articles shown in the movie) are murdered, why only one researcher working in the case? The prosecutor suddenly decided that he wanted to find seed in the seed house, where was he arrested and where his victims were killed? <br /> Why did he not think about doing this?) Why did the police detective go to solo, without a backup, without knowing what he's doing and where he did not know where he went. <br /> <br /> Bol was apparently disappointed when he went out of his way to understand why Electric Chair failed to work properly. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPELERS ***** <Smaller, the film acts as a frame for some sort of sequencing sequences (perhaps Bol is considered as "visions"), Bloodzing, Head Shots, Head , Execution dielectric, and a combination of live animals raised to their animals. (The animal's opening scenes are actually unnecessary and upsetting, but I understand their purpose in the context of the movie.) The center is frustrated by a middle-aged woman's seed. <br /> <br /> It spends a lot of time and reminds me of the classic scene in "Reservoir Dogs", but Steely Dawn without soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie Not. If you're a special fan of violence, you are sure to look at violence as a romantic model. As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, the film is pretty unpleasant and curious at points, which is far more than Boll's movies. Perhaps he will improve filmmaking. I only hope that I will go beyond the torture of pornography and continue in the vein of "postage".
