When the BBC was shown 30 years ago, this time was quite different. So for some it is very scary and may be impressive with special effects. <br /> <br /> Do not seem to be scary, <br /> <br /> Can a railway be allowed to go in red as a dark tunnel? I do not think so ...... But if you see this game again, you will first enter into the train tunnel and go straight through the red light! <br /> <br /> The pedestrian path that leads to the signal box is quite steep and can be observed in the poor state. The correct steps were taken with the harris for signalman cutting up or down. <br /> <br /> I have been performing spectacular performances by Dannon Elliot (Signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (traveler). > <br /> I'm not sure what will happen ...... I mean ghost traveler, or what ??? Does anyone fully understand this rather confusing story ??? <br /> <br /> "The role is not that scary these days, and is not too confusing at places, and some have unusual signaling methods." <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading my review.
