I want to see the film due to Elijah's taste, but there is only a small part of her, and she does not like her role. Nevertheless, the main character played by Melissa Szemmiller is very beautiful and has a definite pleasure to see throughout the film. This is not really a show for her form and talents. <br /> <br /> The story is very good. Some of the car criminals may have died, but they have lived their previous lives, but all kinds of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys are following them, but they do not really realize who they are (perhaps they are in the other car, but they are not exactly why they do not read it). The final scenes appear to be particularly cinematic, but I can not get what is compatible with it. The opening sequence is that bad guys (some weird masks) cut off an elegant girl's wrist and begin to collect some of her blood. The bad guys are back from the dead and have the representation of the surgeries trying to get back Cassie (Sazmiller) ... but it does not seem to work. Bad guys are just bad people; They really mess up a story that might just be confusing interesting. <br /> <br /> In a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice, who wants hell bad people? <br /> <br /> From 10 to 3.
