This long lyrical movie about Berkowitz and his impact on NYC will change less, but it is locally known as "Guidos", about painting some of the band's songs of Italian-Americans. <br /> The problem is that the "Guido's" story or what kind of story they are drowning. They are already living sarcastically, Lee only fills them up rather than raising them. There is a sarcasm that someone can do, they go home and say, "Hey, let the ears and the nose grow big!" This is what Lee did in the film. Two of those who love to avoid "Gido" lifestyle (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) are the most interesting characters in the film. Especially off with an uninteresting storyline for the characters, especially of John Leguizamo, and you get a nice picture to fall asleep. It takes into consideration a longer run time. <br /> <br /> Another strike against: Anyone who claims to be an Yankees fan, grew up in New York, spelled mischief in the spike lee fil Rizuto end credits.
