In the summer, a plane and the Da Vinci Code to be proud of riggin stinkers like snakes, this is a beautiful bold statement. But I stand it though. Superman Returns, over 6 months before King Kong, overlaps, up to the eye with hyper-igglt and CGI. <br /> <br /> Richard Donner came up with the idea of ​​'keeping true' for his 2 outings. I find your way to be specific to optimal and optical effects. Brian Singer really bombs us with CGI, which really takes you from the story and is the only way to continuously capture the audience over $ 250 million on the potential visual effects that can not live up to the hype. Everywhere we've seen everything and CGI takes us. There is no real atmosphere or participation in it. <br /> <br /> 95% of the film is in the film. Well you can see it. <br /> I've read a lot of reviews from fans critics. A human heart 'or' tender character moments'. Puh- lease! We already know dozens of times in recent years and I know who I am and the SR is shouting silently that nothing is new in this case. Also the plot is recycled garbage. Lex Luthor (a badly cast cast and Guy Kevin Spacey) plans to destroy the United States territory, which has already taken place in the first film! And, well ... your too much! They were able to draw this waste at 2.5 miserable hours! Even if the cast does not like it, it is less insecure. But Brandon Ruth has a personality on the screen of a red hat-stand, Kate Bosworth is totally unbelievable as a Pulitzer Prize winner journalist, James Marsden is 250% wooden, usually Kevin Spacey is really good judgment for his agent burning or buying. The only actor I like is lovely Parker Posey. <br /> <br /> In the past, all the films are bigger and more furious. Soon we'll have $ 300 million images. Studios probably need to realize they should start looking instead looking. For Warner all the money spent on this rubbish pile, to spend all of these movies ... is it worth it? In my opinion, definitely not! This waste gave me life Superman!
