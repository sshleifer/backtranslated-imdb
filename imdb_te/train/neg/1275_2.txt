It's a terrible picture. All three stories are unnecessary and all the stories are bracketed with the hypnotist, hypnotist, who is bad. First of all, about wild wolves and some ladies, some things do not make sense, but the topic of hypnotism is the same. Secondly, no one should look like a bad man with a build by Paxston. The last one, sadly, is the most incomprehensible which I guess makes it better than other rubbish.
