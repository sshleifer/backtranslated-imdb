I rented this movie to see Dalf Lundgren, who did not see any movie from Ralph IV. Unfortunately this movie is a big disappointment. The performance of all parties except Mr. Lundgren is very bad. Kata Dob√≥ looks good despite her ridiculous outfits and make-up. <br /> <br /> The plot is not at all intelligent, it is something that has been repeated a million times in different movies. Crooks is totally stereotypical, and there is no depth in the character of Lundren. I did not really imagine a cinematic work, but unfortunately it was not even a good job. The plot is very predictable and the unforgettable amount of over-the-top dirt and comic book like characters started to annoy me pretty quickly <br /> <br /> I recommend this to some young kids <br /> <br /> The joking action, But only when nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> (I should affect anyone who has made this film to estimate 6 votes of the current average vote of 7.0)
