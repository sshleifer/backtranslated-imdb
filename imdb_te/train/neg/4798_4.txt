* It has some spoilers * This film is all terrifying features cheesy 80 horror. The plot is too long to get out of the field, never being fixed, and then the film collapses around 40 minutes. <br /> <br /> Zombie fans have some gemstones, but are not nearly enough zombies to create a true feel of terror. <br /> <br /> Zombies also take a long time to make their appearance. First, there is a whole half of the film about groups and prison gangs. The film's leader is a former Vietnam vet. The main group bass sets him up and he goes to jail. In this jail, they are experimenting with prisoners to find a way to cure malignant tendencies and criminal behavior. But the body-minded head scientist / military guy has other plans in mind. He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum .... The Da Da .... Super Soldiers! When some of the infected prisoners killed some guards and a large number of prisoners in the prison had a wine reindeer, the military / silly scientist "hey may be a problem" and the researcher's journalist Hot Pizza ultra is actually an independent female character who originally discovered the original serum. Outside the jail, some of his safe ranks go to jail in the SWAT teams and go to jail to go to jail, and the hero's heart is suffering a golden heart in a riot. The hero guy and scientist / journalist lady team find a remedy and save Warden's children, and some deal with difficult prisoners, not both. Meanwhile, Maab boss Guy made a deal to go to jail, so he could save his prisoner's brother. <br /> <br /> There are many ghoomy scenes in which people are killed by being pressed or pulled by prison camps. There is also a creepy scattered scene and electrocution scenery with this infected Rasta prisoner. Also, the most disturbing scene in the opening part of the film was a gross corrupt guilty prisoner. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the film is a scene in the end. Hero, woman, and children are trying to make way for an escape. Their path leads to a long hallway, one wall on one side and one with jail bars. Hundreds of bloody zombie arms reaches the bottom, their hair turns and gateways. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is worth watching if you're exploring the zombie, there are many zombie clicks that have "jumping zombies in the dead bodies of dead bodies" and a practical instruction manual on what to do when doing a zombie movie. If Flick's new and want a real scare, you should look elsewhere.
