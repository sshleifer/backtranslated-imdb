Before going to the movies, I usually come to this website and I want to see what other people think of the movie. I have read many reviews of the film 'Thriller A Horror Film'. This will try me this picture. I must take issue with this thriller / horror statements, because it's not! I almost went and asked for my money, and if you enjoyed the worst of most of the reviewers .... well you should be easily pleased! At the end of the film, the people behind me said, "What time is vanity" and I returned to them, "I can not explain it well." I waited for something to happen ... but it did not. There are many opportunities for good fears (or if you like thrills) but nothing has happened. Williams has driven this role well, but I'm shorter by the poor script, it dried up and did not go anywhere. Save your money folks, which is a turkey in the near future of the DVD store 'Bargain Box'.
