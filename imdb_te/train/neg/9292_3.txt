First of all, I also look forward to another hero - an amazing work of art for action art. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that I am better than Hoofd. <br /> <br /> The elements of the hero are found in HoFD: Great landscapes, mesmerizing cinematography and heartfelt acting <br /> <br /> They can not understand the words you say without subtitles, but you still have attention - It's good acting. <br /> What went wrong? The political conspiracy starts with a love story. Worse, it's a soap opera love triangle. You have three characters, I guess, I'm falling in love with each other-no good reasons. After the escape from prison, the film is split mainly (I fell asleep in forty minutes). It was almost as if the authors changed that time. The rest of the movie is "how it is wind". Ick. Also, you really have to stretch your suspension of infidelity to believe the set pieces of action. This style is not unique, but because the story is weak, you can not wait for action, and it's not really good when the fight is broken. If you do not work in the beginning, but the film is out of gas.
