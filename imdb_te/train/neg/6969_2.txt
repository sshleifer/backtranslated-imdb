Blue Monkey (1987) or the 'Body Invasion Invasion' here in the UK is a beautiful boring horror movie about an old man bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant !!!! The man was rushed to the hospital, as the creature comes from his mouth, of course proceeds to transform into this germ monster and go on the devastation !! With Steve Railsback and John Vernon in the film, I seemed boring with a flat speculative storyline, un-interesting characters, cheap special effects and action! Horror fans really do not need to track this rare movie, you should not trust me too much! I will give this film 2/10.
