Harlem Renaissance and a movie about a writer in particular. This is contrary to the modern story about young, gay and black artist. <br /> If it is unclear then it is in the movie. It is a good direction, well written, and (most of) well-acted. Also the past scenes are filmed in the latest black & white films. One of the few film dealings with gay men who also do not shy away from sex scenes (that clear and any foreground). <br /> <br /> The film moves in the film, including snails (including the main hero) and snail moves (this killer). Three times I left the theater because I was completely frustrated. But the director is there. <br /> <br /> After his speech, this was a love-related worker and took six years to complete. I really want to like this more (there are very few films that honestly deal with gay black) but I'm not. If you do not have much interest in Harlem Renaissance, there is no reason to see this.
