Anyone who has seen the original must go out and destroy this terrible remake. Alex Baldwin does not work as a word for the remake of Steve McQueen's attempt to imitate. Although Baldwin has some admirable work, it has a flaw in full range. McQueen has Charisma, and does not try to compete with the star. Kim insisted in the role of Ali McGraw. The McQueen appeared to be a dangerous, dreadful and dab of the film, with the movie enthusiastic and suspense, Baldwin and the company made this comedy, I only apologized once, I saw this painful movie. And that terrible hairstyle for Michael Madsen is one of the more exciting and astounding actors of today! Do you have makeup makeup people for Michael, what you think they are thinking. If you want to see the source of the film directed by Sam Pekingpa, get the original!
