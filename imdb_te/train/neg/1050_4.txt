Nathan Detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in NYC, but does not turn on heat and he can not find a secure location. Sky Masters shares long-time gambler Sky Masters, Sky can not make a major missionary, Sarah Brown goes to dinner with him. Sky takes up the challenge, but two men have some surprises in the store? <br /> <br /> This is one of those expensive fifty MGM musicals that are splash color, with louder music, louder music, and bigger than these big sets, and display the matches; Broadway photographed for big screen If you like the sort of thing that I do. My main problem with this type of movies is just music. I like all kinds of music from Albinio to ZZ Top, but the Broadway performance tunes that are stunted with the Pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet ending in the fourth end of the fourth strap are not my cup tea. The tag team of Frank Looser, Mankiewicz, Joe Scirling and Abe Burrows (based on a pair of Damon Rouion stories) is written in the work and the songs are weak while the plot is very sensitive. For example Blay's two numbers are identical, unnecessary, taking the plot forward and kicking on the ears (and even if you have such a thing hurt you). Only two memorable tunes, Luck BA Lady (Brando's, Sinatra is not as you would expect) and Sit Down, You're Rockin 'The Boat (well done by Cai) but you sit for two hours. The movie's trump card provides a brilliant, constructed performance with a young brando; He sings very well and makes a little dance, and is always the same with Simmons. Two hatchbacks to Havana per night are the sounds of Novo Ak, welcome from bustle and mold-murders. Music fans may turn it on, but in my view a musical performance is to do more than just a stage show.
