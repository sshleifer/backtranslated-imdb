This image is bad. Bad acting, bad direction, bad writing. But it is not bad in the funny way. It is bad in a boring way. I saw the "walkway to the surface" because it was a laugh. It's not. Do not make a mistake. There are many happy ways to spend hours looking like dry or reading the dictionary. Seriously.
