This may be a strong candidate for "The Worst Flick Ever". Perhaps without John Hurt, it can be as kid-film. However, one of the greatest actors of the screen, John Hurt, cuts himself in this case ... Mr. Hurt showed me ... because I gave him two points ... I'll score 8 points, because he can not run fast enough . Until the other cast, they are just terrible. Jainine Turner, she can not work to save her soul. And the main actor, for all intents and purposes, AWFUL. If you can not do this problem yourself, please do so. It's very bad, it's roughly hurts.
