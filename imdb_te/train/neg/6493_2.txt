Oh dear ... an Englishman, and a small part of Welsh, the fan of Anthony Hopkins' work in the industry ... To date, I was disappointed. <br /> I hope I'm good. My comments are like grass in the air. But, that point is not it? - I have no ax to grind on the trade's worth of work. I will go to see a great member, a movie to move to another place. Yes, it will stop believing for a while. <br /> <br /> I would expect that by an unknown author and director, the product will surely be destroyed. Unfortunately, it is not, and I leave wide eyes and confusion. <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever I see some reviews from this movie, I'm a bit depressed. <br /> <br /> When you look at its talent, regardless of the writer, the director, the studio or the content of the content. <br /> My advice is too early: do not write and direct the same product. It is full of danger. <br /> When the school reports "can do what is good and can do ..."
