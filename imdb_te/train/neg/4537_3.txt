<br /> <br /> I saw a camp and we did not raise it. Certainly, touching some parts, but acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, the whole whole movie idea is awful (now I know it's dependent on the book I do not read, but the book is obvious because the film is very bad and boring). As I said, I went from a camp to some people, there was excitement, and I had a caffeine drinking, but I worked hard to stay awake. The only thing that kept me (I was awake once I woke up) was with guns, as well as a lot of meaning. I really did not like it.
