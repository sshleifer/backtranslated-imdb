There are a lot of trouble with this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the first twenty minutes of the film may have been reduced to five or ten. The whole picture (mercifully) is small, but it was created by showing more attention to Mean Leone (how one missed "The Wiz" on one?) And his subplot closer to the main plot. In short, the script has a seed of good idea, but it needs to be repeated again. <br /> <br /> Second, it could be done without raw humor. <br /> <br /> The third time this program has a little more self-awareness. The original series made its first film, well, it's way too much, way too. Brooker Frazer jokes just a bit more (and there is no mention of "New Rules"?). The heroine also has other garments and ultimate interactions. <br /> <br /> Fourth, CGI has been given a bit more attention. First, the Shemp is not a real elephant (except the course of the course), but here CGI is like a sore thumb. <br /> Surprisingly, the specific effects are only good or bad, and they can at least succeed in that set, so it's a very small problem, but it still exists. Christopher Shakerman's performance as George is good. It does not have the charm of Brendan Fraser, but Christopher only failed in that particular comparison - as he put George's personal depth somewhat, it was the main foul in the Jay Ward Ward-Inspired film. <br /> <br /> Many of the other shows are pretty good because they are not good or bad in my mind.
