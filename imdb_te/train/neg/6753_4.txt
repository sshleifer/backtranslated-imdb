A murderer killing friends of Hollywood producer Shawn Benning (Danny Wollsecke), a man dressed in a plastic white mask and black overcrow, kills his former owner from the conspiracy to the chest when he gets his legacy. Perhaps the mental illness is new to Madie (Dubbi Roche), who had previously had a family with a glamorous, flowing hair beauty, and suffered from nightmares. Shaun and his friends adopted a practical joke on Maddi, choosing a murderer to murdered every member of the Mordy Club. When the man accidentally murders in a parking garage, he finds that Shawn's pals move her chains as she dies in her car. But Shaan and his colleagues are concerned about the introduction of murders and convert her into the proper authorities. Deciding to make a decisive decision, a white masked mental collapse with a mask consisting of the fact that each member murdered her before. Or who is behind these murders? Low-budget slasher, Charles Band product executive, failed to convince gore murders. Performance and the Allen Nabor's Goofy character Chris can entertain that with less expectations. These killings are strangled to the neck of a knife, knock off an electronic cord, everyday female victim, throwing an ax that is buried behind a male victim, and top of it, a couple are strangled with a rope on their sex banner (for the additional effect, the killer is able to sniff their necks The breaker bar of a socket bar as an additional leverage to rotate the rope Payogistaru). Why Muddy had murdered murders, she had enough plot holes to drive a truck as she was able to kill herself (with blood on her) after she waited on her bed without leaving it in any way. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/] any desire of the film I hurt so much. This film has influenced Maddie in the past. Her family refused her for abortion. She has black-outs and actually takes the winds that always meet the crime scene. Many slashers, the guy who seems a lot killer frequent red herring, but this film goes out of the way to point the finger at Madison. When the twist occurs, we're rooting for Madi, and we know that she's not right on her head. It's a tough selling attention for this chick. She does not look great in a man Army shirt, though. And Rochen was not afraid to breathe her puppies. Low-budget horror fans receive a kick for seeing Brink Stevens who is a religious fanatic, opposing her model, calling her a murderer, her beloved troma producer Lloyd Kaufmann is the all-in-one father of a word. He is wise to save his daughter. Cult Siren Julie Strain is a small guest, as her heart (of course) getting a hammer crushed her head to the girlfriend's girlfriend early. Oh, and check the office which Shawn works, youll see a lot of work on the full moon posters and art across the walls.
