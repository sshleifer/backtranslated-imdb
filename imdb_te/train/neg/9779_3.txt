The worst stupid, no-budget "War film" made primarily to showcase the features of the Eve Meyer - not a bad idea - but it should be difficult for everyone connected with it. Logical "script", a Christmas competitor in a primary school, "non-passive" scenes, generally notable in the turbulent direction by effective documentary director Louis Clyde Stormen - is unclear if he comedy, a philosophical text on a wastage of war or a wave of T & A (Whatever the scales of the 1960s) Eve Meyer's adb Body tour - and simple air of common and incompetence. Eve Meyer Stuff is worth looking at his stuff, but it's pretty good.
