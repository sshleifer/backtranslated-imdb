I belong to the Puterotric descent, and this includes the composition of the "documentary". First I was scared to compare with Guevara by Mr. Perez Senar Campos. Even just a point, Mr. John Leguzaimo is not of Patertoric descent. His parents came from Colombia. It is not very accurate to investigate. I think that the future of our race will depend on education. This message should be shining throughout the film, and my opinion is that education is the way to freedom and power to make this product group's future endeavors as their point of view. In this view, the film has led to anti-American sentiment.
