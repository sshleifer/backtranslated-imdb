<br /> <br /> There are bad movies there, and Crater Lake (hence our title) "The Crater Lake Monster", a petrolisaur, a peelicosaur that goes to the hack people there (in California, to discover the capital of the world) It was able to escape from MST3K anytime. Maximum acting, good stop-motion beast and more, this is a horror aspect of the low budget robbery / monster film of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> When the film is critiqued by many crimes, Arnie and Mitch are the two biggest rednecks who work as our comic relief. They fight law stocks like Bumble around, "Banco Music", Ogl women, and curiosity excuses of humankind. The characters are very bad, they should be considered a crime against humanity.
