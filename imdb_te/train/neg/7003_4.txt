(These are: TRINITY still my name) This sequel shows that they will pay a spectacular European back-office success for the tranquility, this time only this time with Joseph E. Levin and the avocado-embossed images wanted to invest in it. America as well. They are not far away from Hill / Spencer's pictures in the United States because they have only a little bit of success here, and this largely boring, draw-out film has not helped. <br /> <br /> They promise that Trinity and Bambino will succeed their dead father (Harry Carey Jr.) and take care of one another. They are then subsequently involved in the arms and merchants who steal guns from a monastery and think they are mistaken for federal agents. The funny scenes, especially the Trinity and Bambino, are in a fancy French restaurant and do not know how to take it, all of which will wind up. <br /> <br /> The scenes with carbine sharks were also a little funny. <br /> <br /> The early title music sung by Jean-Roman, Bobby Goldsboro is a 70s pop song. Very nice. <br /> <br /> The movie may have been reduced to half an hour and it can not be dragged down for a long time. . The scene looks pretty chewed here. In fact, I lost interest in about 2 / 3rds about it. The DVD is also awkward with a poor impression that the DVD soundtrack is sent to a stable hum and a great scrap pile in the sky. <br /> <br /> Previous picture
