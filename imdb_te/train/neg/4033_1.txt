This is a painful way to write a review for me, but I do not encourage these people without doing so. For the first time, the image created in a small budget is not automatically good or pleasant. In this case, the small budget was probably the only success of the films, which prevented it from misusing the fox's horse in a large slum race. Have you ever seen comedy in the theater? Ever heard people laugh and thought "what dickens are you in"? Well these twats are not smiling too. When my cat took the first bath, it got stuck in the middle. This is not the film, these kids ... go to France where monkeys do not make images that you want. Got to go, there was a clown at my door .............
