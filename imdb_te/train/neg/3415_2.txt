In standard view, this is a completely awful picture. However, it gives a perfect score on a random comedy level. I can think of some of the original comics that make me laugh as I see this movie. The ghost of Andy Griffith wears Native American Garb Dancing and sends me to Hysterics everywhere. I can not sell gas or fuel driving for video rentals, but if it's been put on bed at 3 o'clock in the morning it will be on TV and check it.
