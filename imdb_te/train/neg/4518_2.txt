Some films have drawn expectations and are worried about me as long as they have fire. This film is a serious trash. It did not achieve anything at the artistic level. This is a ban on India. <br /> <br /> <br /> My illness has gone out of my system, and I'm still high. <br /> * From the beginning, the heroes feel unrealistic when they start speaking in English. The director, in fact, did not make a film to an Indian audience; But it is underestimated by its simplification of its international audience. <br /> <br /> We get regular climbs to Radha's dreams. These scenes are not effective. They are like jarring, blocking the flow of cinema. I'm still thinking how to connect to that philosophical conversation story. <br /> <br /> Love feelings are considered to be considered and are intended for audiences' retailer than a powerful statement. <br /> <br /> The names of women, Radha and Sita were shocking the names and the audience of Hindu gods. However, since the film was not originally intended for Indian audiences, the shock-by-name-selection was not intended to achieve its goal, which was absurd. <br /> * Direction is too poor and does not perform some important and sensitive scenes. <br /> <br /> Nandita Das has played a vital role in the film, while others have been wasted. I thought Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent was not clear in the film. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Earth and want to see more of the director, stay away from it. Please.
