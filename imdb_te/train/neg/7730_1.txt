Despite much style, flash and sophistication, this French music has failed to talk. The tunes are repetitive, predictable and tedious. The story is in many ways, unhealthy. <br /> <br /> Without inspiration or reason, people stumble into song and dance. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this video of restored version has been suspended before it has ended, and has had a negative impact on it. Me. Definitely an insult, so having a multi-talented cast in the weakest endeavor. <br /> <br /> When the followers (in this case, the great classic, "Umbellellas"), I often guess when going to the awkward place. One can not get back, only to recreate.
