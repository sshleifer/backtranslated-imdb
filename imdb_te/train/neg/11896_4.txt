Before I started, I was _love_ Eddie Ezzard. I think he is one of the funny stand-ups around today. <br /> <br /> "I love you," he said. Everyone knows him as a completely abusive comic, and we all love him. But in the circle, he seems to go further for irrelevant than funny, and completely lost me in places. He has covered most of the things that he covers - I also think that I have identified some recycled jokes. <br /> If you buy a DVD, you are a French-language version of Eddie's tour (interesting, but not very funny) and his performances. Die-hards enjoyed watching Edi in a different language, but the subtitle comedy is not so funny. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Eddie, you still get this or you can buy it. If you're traveling, glorious buy or kale wearing - you will not be disappointed. With the circle, you probably will.
