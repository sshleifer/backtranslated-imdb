2 stars, and I'm generous. (Small spoilers), which is a low-budget zombie film in Gangland Oakland. When the plot goes, a scientist wants to bring him back to kill a dead man after killing a dead brother. <br /> <br /> The main problem in this film: what zombies? Do not all "zombies" grow up (it does not even sound remotely scary) and duplicate red blood drip from mouth! No horrific eyes, no decayed meat, just a group are growing pathetically and running around like idiots. <br /> <br /> The cover is also misleading. There are only six zombies in the whole movie, so it's not just a whole "hood" of zombies or whatever, it's just a few, and at any time. <br /> The fact is that it is very happy. No one can star in the film (except one of the gang members) and a group of friends decided to run their family and decided to make a weekend movie. <br /> <br /> Final note: Doctors wear trac√ªts from ever? Please skip this, please!
