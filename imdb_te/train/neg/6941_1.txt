This film is not only boring, it's also really bad. Graphics are very bad, they are not rated twice - they are terrible. The characters do not show any facial expressions, the voice acting is empty and without any soul, and the plot is not completely .... well ... anything and everything. My 5-year-old likes it - but it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
