I expect expectations into this movie, from the hype, that it's brilliant and uplifting. <br /> <br /> Instead of making fun of the "process" and being a desperate and undoubted one of the band members. The record label who kicked through the first major singer / songwriter, gut-wrenching confession by the falling member's friend is "damaging their feelings" - as 18 years - "friendship is run its course," and this whiny, uncompelling story Immediately 50 received 50 offers from 50 labels (oh, tension ... not!). I suspect all smoke and glasses to produce a tragedy that does not exist. It does not take into consideration the length and breadth of the account as we do not have much work in a lot of stories, insight or cinematography in a lot of major songs. <br /> <br /> From the movie, the band are like a group of infants who are not infidel, they find the voiceless voice.
