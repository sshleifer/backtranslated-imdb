As cinematography goes on, the film is good in the mid 50s. Sometimes the lighting was very hot, but the shots were usually in the frame and remained in sight. Acting is above average for a low budget stinker but the direction is terrible. Several scenes have been dragged for a long time in the suspense effort and the effects do not exist. The skull attack on the pond should be completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to take the life of the skull is clearly visible with stick pokes and cords. I could not even help but think that the budget does not allow them to provide the home, so they are making suggestions for mowers and everything in store is coming soon. Honestly ... it was more fun if it was a bad image. It's not bad enough to be a "good bad" movie, but it's not as good as "good". Get the MST3K version ... it's fun.
