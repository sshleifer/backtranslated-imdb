There is an interesting campus in Parasomnya, but this story is not without any tension or logical approach. Patrick Kilpatrick is also an unbelievable cast that has played a great role in films such as Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The remaining cast is not known except by Jeffrey Combs (not very good). (Herbert West from the great re-animator trilogy). But he can play the role of his sleep (where he is doing). The main problem is that the characters are not understandable. <br /> <br /> The story is very memorable and is particularly imaginable, especially the cheapest computer effects that combine some irritation scenarios. <br /> This may be very good, I can not get good reviews on this. It's really below average.
