As well. For starters, the taxi driver is excellent. This, this is not a taxi driver or amazing. That's bad. But I thought it was a bad thing, which means it has some zealous features. Like conversation ... Wow. There are no more or less plots, the characters are all stupid, and the image is preachy. There are some areas where the film was thought to dive into the kind of taxi driver type, which hit the message at the end of the picture on a very difficult head. I can not even believe there are 20 other people who have seen this film. Yes, you're genuinely bored and you want to look at the fact that you can make someone a movie or at least try.
