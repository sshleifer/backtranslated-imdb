The film has more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck did not seriously try to act in any form or shape. He totally sucks. Nothing about the film is unbelievable. The first issues are in the introduction - the man Salvation Army reflects the value of Santa Claus but does not show why. And then the grandmother sticks to her head in the oven- really beautiful, and there is absolutely nothing to do with the film- it is not in the same tone of the film. There is no motivation for Ben Elchec to elect the house he chooses; The family he chose is unbelievable reactions; (For example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's roles go on a slope-the incident that makes her suddenly fall in love with him) However, there is a funny moment or two- but they are rare in the film. This requires another return (or 4). Hope you will enjoy it!
