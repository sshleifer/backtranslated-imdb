This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. One of the first few scenes was to be brought up, and I said that I never had laughing in my life, which was rented as a joke. The first scene of one of the most ridiculous funny stupid action movie moments in my life where Ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight. It's not a dinosaur film, but a movie of fun genre (and not all that is) of the genre. I did not see the first two, but I decided that the plot was complicated and I did not think I was missing. If you see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy, I rent this movie and sit back and watch a 100 years progress in the film, thrown in the trash,
