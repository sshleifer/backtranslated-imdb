I've never been to Paris, but after watching "Paris, J Taeame" I'm crazy to visit this city! I've been to NY for many times and I have loved the city and its barracks. I think I will move through this movie, jump into a plane, go there immediately, but, and behold, I'm spending the time and money I've spent. There are no people or love stories between a man and a city. Negative meetings and relationships or people who know each other and it just does not work fine. Perhaps reflecting the characteristic of this city, which has thousands of people living on their own. Can not you find love in New York?
