"The 40 Year old Old Virgin" is in an undefined world. An electronic shop employee can tell his employer "f *** off" and broadcasts videos of his naked donkey and severely criticizes the store. This is really a funny world for drunk driving and smashing to other people's cars. Sexually seemed okay for an employer who is undergoing sexual abuse. A world full of racial and dangerous stereotypes of ethnic minorities. The world without any funny jokes! I was totally amazed at seeing the audience who liked this movie. I think every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live Sketch - not too funny to start with, and all rational ideas were spread out. <br /> <br /> Karel's characters are completely a note. The romantic elements are fully compounded in the scenes where Keane finds porn in the apartment. <br /> <br /> I also found the "Aquarius" sequence completely annoying and overwhelming. I hated the hated movie that I hated!
