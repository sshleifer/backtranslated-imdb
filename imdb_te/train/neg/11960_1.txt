I was originally retired from Asian horror movies, and the ghost story turned out to be worse. Nevertheless, I recently got closer to exploitation films, so I decided to give them another chance. My first port director is Takashi Mike's highest rated 'Visitor Q'. I already saw audition and when I did not like it, I rated myself one of the modern modern horror films. So, I have taken the right estimates in this regard. And unfortunately, just found the boredom. I suppose this film is actually really intelligent and it just went over my head, but it seemed to me, just a little or no reason for them to be the only violent and nasty scenes collection. I am concerned about the work of Louis Bunuel and David Lynch, as far as I can compare. MiKic has made a movie earlier. Any intelligence around it, implemented by fan favorite fans, was disappointing to understand some kind of sense. Within 10 minutes of my headache (after having sex with his daughter for some reason), and did not diminish until finally; At least twenty four hours later, or it will appear. Do not make me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies, actually looking for the most serious pictures of active ones around; But it is violent, it also has meaning and embarrassment and I do not get an ounce pleasure from it. Takashi Mike fans may have a lot, but I am not one of them. And I'm definitely the last time I introduce it to one of his films.
