You know that you're in trouble while working at a movie with a cinematography at the cinematography of John Cassavates, and the "The Inbus" is a bad example for a great actor who goes through the moves to pay the bills. In fact, observing the direction of the hymn script and John Hogg's 'Baroque' art, he can not blame him. The film features a range of rape-murder killings in a small town, some of which are combined into a psychic hunt. Somehow, each scene appears to be a poem of tension and curiosity, and cassavites appear, at times ed. <br /> Inkubus, which does not appear until the last scene, also creates good things, but it will not wait. <br/>
