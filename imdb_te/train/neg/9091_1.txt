<br /> I've read some of the reviews from this movie. You have to ask me that I am looking for the same movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, set directors to rebuild 1930 Vintage Los Angeles, but what? <br /> <br /> No one likes the characters, the story is aimless, Karen Black is not just a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just icky. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not want to be alone, Love the movies and see each other for the rest of us and go, "What the Heck!"
