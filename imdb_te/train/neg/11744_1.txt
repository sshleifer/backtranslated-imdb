I was totally amazed by the end of this film by critics and online users. Was it the worst Western ever? No, I can not say. But "the last great American Western", have I seen a phrase applied more than once applied? <br /> <br /> A movie that tries to tell a story to this story needs reliable characters who speak reliable conversation and the dialogue in this movie is one of the most hacked and clich√©s I have ever seen. The film is measured in greners per minute; How many times was a forced actor or actress by the script to tell any man in real life? It's in most cases it's attention. Waves of cheesy lines come to you; Speculative, unnatural, and often. <br /> If bad communication does not cause you trouble, how about a bad pistol? Some Western soldiers will show you a gun that is totally unreliable when you are trying to take action seriously. There is a comic edge to deal with a gun like Silverado, but there are other illustrations of the initial gun in the Tombstone and a very high choreography that leaves the film in a good western list. The final showdown will be part of the score for the director, but I have not been in the film yet. <br /> <br /> Without those flaws, I can say that the visuals are fantastic. The better shot of the image and the settings look great. Acting was impractical, especially considering what actors did to work. <br /> If you're looking for the last great American Westerns, do yourself a favor - instead go to unfergent for rent. <br /> <br />
