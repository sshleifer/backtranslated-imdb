<br /> I saw Steven Seagal on Deadly Ground. <br /> You need to watch this movie. However resurrected in MST 3K. When Santa Claus invaded, Martians could explode on Tom Servo's head, which surprised the turmoil of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kurt Thomas has never been to the film industry. <br /> The writers of these ruins should force each day to placate their lives, "Bitch Child! I am a writer on Jimca."
