Well, I was enthusiastic and had to give this one 2. This is due mainly to grateful holes that cut the lady's shirt here on her chest. I found it a little fun. Besides, this film is nothing more than to offer some good laughs with a friend. If you like to dismiss someone with "Mystery Science Theater" remarks, it's not better than 2. And 2 is pretty cool.
