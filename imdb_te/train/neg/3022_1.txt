I am very happy when I first saw the previews about this film. Normally I'm looking for a good preview and I'm buying this movie correctly. Something told me ... I know you're going to see first. I'm happy. Keira Knightley has destroyed all future images with this character. When it comes to 2 in the Pirates movie I went to see it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated more for her. I think I have to cut a little for her hair and for Domino. <br /> Who is Domino? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not really know or care. I do not know who is in real life or I do not know who she is in the film. I did not care about her role and Keira was partially naked and it was not worth the movie. The direction is not perfect. The writing is simple and shallow. Editing is terrible. I do not care much of the style with poor overuse. It has space. Unstable, MTV style, colorful compilation (not sure if the official name is) fight club; Just off my head just off. The Enemy of the State also has a semi-similar editing style in episodes. It was used tasteless and was not used as a catchpock. I mean the same guy is the best gun and Crimson Tide directed. Tony Scott give me my time. <br /> <br /> There are many who like this movie. I would like to make fun of the idea that I would absolutely love or completely hate this movie. Frankly, I hate it.
