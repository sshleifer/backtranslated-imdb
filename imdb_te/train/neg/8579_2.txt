Although I'm pretty good performances and generally the acting-the-camera direction, I'm afraid this is a terrible one. It is the first and last attempt of the writer-director Soyo Liu. "Rub and Tug" (2002) is one of Canada's program's unfortunate products to promote non-home film-making. While the program encourages valuable efforts like "New Waterford Girl" it opens the door for untalented novices like Liu who do not aggressively pitch this project but her script or her credentials is flammable green without enough testing. <br /> <br /> You may not care less about the budget because of the shaky product design, bad lighting, poor audio and the deeper dock-style shot choice is subject to the subject matter; Workers in Canadian massage parlors. But the viewers and plot actors can not do anything to work, viewers do not see any mental challenge except the editor's editor or the lack of trust. The last thing you need when your story is simpler is a messy storyline technique; Although nothing happens, the film is hard to bottom and it is impossible to pin down. <br /> <br /> Don McKeller's performance as Conrad has nothing to do with his similar classification in "Exoticca". Lindy Booth's Lee is her standard quirky airhead; She likes as much as ever, but here she is a little lower. Kira Clovel's Cindy is a pleasant surprise, a type of Asian Shelley Duvall. Tara Spencer-Nairn's street-wise Betty, "New Waterford Girl", is another role only for any other consequence than canceling her marvelous performance. Her shallow performance in "Rub and Tug" reduces any trend in searching for other films she has starred; You need more confirmation to work with "Waterford" director Alan Moyle's talented young actors. <br /> <br /> You can not quickly get things like Liu's Reptian brain plot complexity, and finally a lazy and lame "deus ex machina" device is finally surprising. Although it may be worse, the careless story has very little inner logic, since it is generally not as common to be miserable. <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
