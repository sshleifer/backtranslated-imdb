OKLAHOMA! / ANNIE This Paramount Version / Repo Your Gun / Damage Jane is not all unusual or innovative. Marketing and introductory comments may sound like a Western movie shot and a live TV show in a Western movie really soundstage. I did not find the use of background cyclorama, yellow, or pink, or red, or .... all the innovations lit in different scenes. As observed, it is a TV show. I look more like an image produced in the budget: all the sound stations, with minimal set of supporting floating bicycles! (Compare with New Yorkers in 1952), the actors came out fairly well. In 1959, Paramount LI'L discovered Abner, and this style was very good. They wondered? "
