The worst Bollywood film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There are no plots. Very minor role consequences. <br /> Full of crazy and nonsense humor. The whole picture is shorter and farther. This story is not the right end. This airport was shot in a shopping mall. <br /> <br /> When you say, the same story again chewed. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this film is that it's around hot bags ... but most of Bollywood movies are now in the days. <br /> I'm not from Indian background. <br /> <br />
