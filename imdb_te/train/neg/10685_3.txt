Imagine, Hawked & poorly written. I complained that such a famous cast will not be involved except for the fool. I think that the competition between the actors is very serious (and worse) today. Initially we gave an indication of the attempted murder and since then it has rammed our voice. The film does not have a romance, giving the victim a little insight and a motive for murder. Some lectures are frankly and embarrassing! It is hard to believe that anyone is taking into consideration, and willing to spend millions of dollars to make this effort.
