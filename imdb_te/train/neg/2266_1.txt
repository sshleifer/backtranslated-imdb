Ringmaster does not need the tragic tragedy of the toy sprinter, which destroyed my belief in the art of the film to be reused as a toilet paper. First of all, it's made. Secondly, people went to see it. Third, some people are the best film they have ever seen. If a monkey could make a film, I'm 100 percent more than 100 percent. Most of the worst films have their movements (Godzilla also has some amazing special effects) when the theater's moment leaves the theater. If the Jerry Springer is star, the film could be worse. If I want to stare at the worst for an hour and a half, I'll take a dump with a can. If anyone does not despair this film, I am very sorry for your children and your children's children. However, contrary to Springer's beliefs, I can not forgive children who have sex explicitly.
