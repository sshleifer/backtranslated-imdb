A long time ago I heard about this novel, and most of my friends recommend me to read it. I searched it everywhere and eventually found it. It is the book that every man reads, because it is intellectual and its vision. I enjoyed every page. <br /> <br /> I know about the movie and did not wait to see it. Finally, I was very disappointed that there are not many things in the book (I do not think this movie is a spoiler) that is not just logical ... Michael Radford is a good director but a bad writer. Especially a book recipient. The film is not dark, the writing is really bad, the better, the greatest, the acting. <br /> <br /> John Hurt is a wonderful actor and Winston Smith is the only face I can see. <br /> <br /> "The best affair" without reading this book! <br /> <br /> By reading this book you can understand the brightness of the story and do not consider this as a substitute. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed as a fan of this book. <br /> <br /> I'm going to act on the points given to this film.
