According to the director, the U.S. There are difficulties finding a distributor in many viewers because it has not been able to reiterate the treacherous content of Christianity and American concern. <br /> <br /> If a minister is a minister in homage or a prayer to a person called "Godspeed" can it be a "Christian" image? In fact, it can be understood that it is ridiculing its "over-the-ground" religion, a gnome of soup and a well-organized mission to offer the Bible verse. Maybe plenty of unfortunate or suppressing? Plenty of indefinable homeless missions? How about Psycho Vietnam Vts Plenty? Do you think the American minds are "plenty of earth" of Paranoid patrons with the agent's cat-popping dualistic lives of "pink"? Can we have psychiatric patients too? In fact, people who do not express their concern in the politics of Palestine are based on phone conversations with the main characters. The unfortunate world if you work in a German homeless shelter is more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival to know how it comes to the glitter of "jewelery of the continent" Europe. /> <br /> In fact, I agree with the title at the end of the United States "Plenty of Lands" and in this particular case it represents poorly scripts, amateur acting and directing films. Life is too short and one, even an American, watching this piece is not "plenty" of waste time.
