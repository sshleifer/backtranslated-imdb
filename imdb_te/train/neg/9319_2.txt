I do not know what you guys are talking about, the first time we saw this film with two of my friends we could not stop crying. This is one of the funniest songs I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is really bad, but it brought my eyes to fame, poor dialogue and acting. Are not they talking about expensive cameras? It looks like one of those movies from my drivers. Class. Look for clues as they came from a high school drama show. The original Nintendo system sounds music coming from the game. The only thing I was afraid of this movie is that it's a killer clown, who can not escape the fat and revenge clowns? hahaha While anyone can see this though, they need to look for sound defects by actors like lisping some of the words and their facial expressions. <br /> <br /> <br /> "
