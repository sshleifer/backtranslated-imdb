When I saw the film, I thought it should come from a children's department - it's a lot of fun and ridiculous at times, which is actually a good story. But it has the ability to deliver "romantic chemistry" Robbins like Meg Ryan and Tim. I should note that Walter Mathau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein, his performance is exceptional, but it is one exception. This film seems to be a bit forced, directed not material, and oh ... music is ridiculously awful, it does not put me in a very good mood. If you do not expect a smart, well-designed comedy / romance story, it's definitely fun, as I mentioned it should be in the children's section. Einstein and his friends have been good relief from the nearly quest quest to steal the heart of Tim Ribins' boring, Meg Ryan. It is a very controversial film, but it's not too late, it's a late film.
