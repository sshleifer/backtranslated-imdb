I was interested in renting this movie trailer DVD. However, the resulting image is completely terrible! <br /> <br /> Comic, adult play: The main thing is to know what's not really the same thing. , Thriller, teen-porn? This story is interesting, it deals with the weaknesses of the mail-order bride, but the picture is confusing. A slightly interesting "comedy" (a word I use in the words that is too short) starts to go completely in reverse and degrade in a dark and bizarre missonicistic thriller. Nicole Kidman needs good, Ben Chaplin wasted! Matthew Cassowitz and Vincent Cassell, I can assume that the two have done this for money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad image in pretty much everything. It's not funny, it's almost sexist, you can almost forgive Benny Hill and the dramatic things are just worse. Kidman or Chaplin is a movie to be exempted from each of the movies!
