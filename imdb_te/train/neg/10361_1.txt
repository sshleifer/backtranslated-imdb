This ABC straightforward fantasy novel that is wrinkled in straight-to-TV failure makes perfect justice. Ms. Madeline L'Engle brought children and adults in the magical, grotesque and original world as her predecessor. The novel is the first in her 'Time Quartet', beautiful on life, the universe, and time. Yet, it is easy to understand any child or adolescent. Its unthinkable moral values ​​spread throughout the book. This film is not a mockery of the artwork of Mrs. L'Elle. Honestly, what are they thinking? The effects are cheap and ridiculous, the plot is soft and uneven, the dialogue is very far away and every magical feature of the novel is lost. This book is a terrific attempt to bring it back. I made an attempt to bring this book to the screen and I sincerely hope that a wise, valuable director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuarón) will make some effort to understand what is true: a masterpiece. This adaptation is comparable to the boring, fake and low motel-room art, which does not have the land and does not affect the audience.
