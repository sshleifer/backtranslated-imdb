My spouse & I seemed very schlocky with this movie. It's a good start, but it's quickly unbelievable & ridiculous. Most of the acting was poor, except for the little girl, Abby, really amazing person. In addition, the dialogue is predictable and lame - especially Gideon, the Angels. Also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters is tragedy, she looks almost nonchalant. First we thought it was 'shock', but we realized it was a terrible script. We almost love all the Hallmark movies & stories of their heartfelt stories, but this film does not originate as one. There are so many great ones - do not waste your time with this horrible movie.
