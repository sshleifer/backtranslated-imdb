This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that it's funny that it's too bad. First of all, there are no plots. The actors appear to read the queue cards and do dumbbell things. They want to go looking for their friends, even though they are dead by the dead. There was no fun in Romero's work, where the plague in the movie was also a horror of zombies. And the most intimate part of them is the video scenes unveiled. As we can not get about video game shooting zombies. Also, all 20 somethings know how to use automatic weapons and also how to hit the target without pointing the gun. And the way people die is stupid. That's like standing out waiting for the alert so they're like run out of ammo. <br /> Final Verdict: If these actors appear in a different movie then they will be rewarded. Second chance. The worst picture I've seen over the years. B-movie in Cinemax is good.
