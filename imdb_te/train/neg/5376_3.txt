CHOKE (AX AXE in the UK) is a slazar which is said to be a straight-to-DVD movie. I'm saying "supposedly" because the title of the image suggests that "V" in the bracket is made for the DVD movie (although it has a look). </ P> Plot easy? <br /> <br /> I think the film is not always a masterpiece, but it does not forgive the mistakes here. Direct DVD movies have direct emotional features as well as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which is a very low IMDb rating) and are sometimes one of the so-called "very bad and good" movies. However, CHOKE is a serious slasher (like Hollowne) or "Very Good Good" film (like The Nail Gun Mussorque). <br /> <br /> This film is good for a character to be killed by using a drill that is going to start. Blood effects given by a very low budget are very cheaper. <br /> There are many mistakes in Chok, I can spend all day talking about them. But, I'm going to go to some clear ones. <br /> <br /> The above mentioned gig will begin with 50 people but after only music stops, only eight remain (and they're all locked!). <br /> <br /> The characters in the film do not like it. Most of the band members are aggressive morgans or clear peculiarities. No one really asks what's going to happen to them, and they forget their friends about them when they send their friends. The highlight of the film is the homeless man's existence and the meat packing factory is considered some kind of church (seriously!). He's deaf to some really funny lines for the obvious reason. But unfortunately, his presence did not save the film. <br /> <br /> Many people do not speak walking. Looking at roles around talking about 65 minutes of movies. Explanations without explanations disappear for a long time. Like other direct DVD movies, like Cropodell and Grim WEEKEND, all of the characters spend a lot of time swinging at each other aggressively without any provocation. Over-the-top disclosure (mainly from the male characters) is abundant and results in a full-scale fight. In fact, the format is as follows: Walk around the characters - the murder happens - walk around the characters - the murder takes place. <br /> <br /> This conversation is terrible and it seems that a few lines of communication can be used without using the F-word. Maybe this means that it's funny, but it just comes off sad. In addition, we've seen it's done a thousand times (usually more effective). <br /> <br /> The film is completely different from any suspense. The bodies are used to provide the only hint of letters in danger. A maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like morons. They attempt to find a way to get out of the factory or to defend themselves. <br /> <br /> In masqueror, the murderer does not appear during the murders. Last killing exception when the killer's identity is disclosed). There is no random weapon anywhere to kill the victim in question. No one can find any characters at any time. <br /> <br /> As noted by another critic, the soundtrack contains music, which helped make funny funny (unfortunately, actually), but it's not funny here. Those who like punk rock are also very bad. The extra look it uncomfortable dance. Score (in the end, no music in the beginning!) Sugarbaby sing a song that is totally unrelated to the band's sound. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand the points made in this review. The critique of the bad movies (such as The Nail Gun Massacre and Bachelor Parti Masqueau) for Classics (Halloween and Friday the 13th) But CHOKE tried harder to do one of those types. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, this film is very small. However, when the surviving characters are not serious, these scenes lose their significance because the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion. <br /> <br /> Traditional 1980s fans should take steps to avoid B-movie slazers. This image. And classic fans like Hollywood and Friday should do everything to avoid their power!
