The sort of story is rather slower, although pretty much like the cast. Danny Glover makes a good job of making you wonder if he's a bad guy. Meanwhile, other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid does not have much room in the story because he was. I thought it was a bit over the top fear compared to how the first scene story unfold. I can see it again. I rated a 5 (I could have rated a 5.5)
