Where they are all physic mushrooms and action retarded is a bunch of human-looking aliens who go to Earth to eat crash land on a planet instead of prehistoric animals. "Dinosuars Planet" and thicker with footage from horrible jokes this is definitely one miss. Acting is even worse, and this is not as bad as "chickboxer" (which film can be?), Which is still a terrifying critical issue. It's a 90-minute timeframe and you have to blame life and you're in favor of the bigger and take this moving picture, there's nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers tried to make a strong replication of the MST3K style they made for a decade ago, but the albright was hot but Lilith Stubbs had an unattractive voice. /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Joke commentary, 17 Behind the scenes feature; 7 minute black color; Jessica Mills Reporting; Stills Gallery; And the original trailer
