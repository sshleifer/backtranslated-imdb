The film's title 'True' came with my alarm bells ringing. They cautioned a title card as America's Civil War 'States Between the States' (the decay was given by the hard South). Jesse James - a thief, slave and murderer - is described as a quiet, sensitive farm boy. <br /> How fraudulent is this picture? బానిసత్వం గురించి ఎటువంటి ప్రస్తావనే లేదు, జెస్సీ జేమ్స్ పేద భాధలున్న యుద్ధానికి ముందు బానిసలను స్వంతం చేసుకున్నాడని, మరియు జెస్సీ మరియు అతని సోదరుడు ఫ్రాంక్ బానిసత్వాన్ని కాపాడటానికి చురుకుగా పోరాడారు. According to the film, all civil war soldiers really fought to determine whether Missouri is a northern state or a southern state ... that's all. Blacks are totally different from this film, except for two seconds of a pair of bigger, completely handwritten (some scenes from 19th-century newspapers are inaccurate, with 20th-century fonts <br /> <br /> This film is a strange past construction and has some very exciting stunt riding (and stunt horses Some fine work), and a montage. I heard savyaksepalanu of a conversation: "Some of the guys will not see again the taste of the beans." The film gets some facts: Jessie's mother Agnes Moorhead as Jesse's mother after the attack of agents Pinkterton (here called 'Remington'), who suffered injuries in the real life of Jesse James, had her right arm hidden under her right hand. During the days, true Jesse James was unexpectedly part of his left middle finger I did see a photo of Jesse James's true wife: <br /> <br /> Hope looks like this in the movie, if she sees her scenes in the scenes, Jesse James is staying at home. <br /> There is plenty of revisionism here, and most male actors wear the 1950s hairdo, but the flaws of this film are Jessie James adviser William Quentrale was mentioned several times, but all actors misinterpreted his name and we see Jessie and his wife pay a $ 2 rented home-wide two-story house (he will die). In fact, Jesse James's last residence (1318 Lafayette Street, St. Joseph, Missouri) was a regular shop complex rented for $ 14. The upper floor is ... So, when Jesse James kills, his wife rises up and does not look like a langy here. <br /> <br /> A distinction error: Robert Wagner (with no stunt double) took a slug to the jaw, back in time while his hands were behind him ... But when he got up, the rope was broken. <br /> <br /> The screenplay dates some of the weird and unnecessary juggling. After attempting to exploit Northfield, Jessie says he expects to get home by his birthday. James Gang (September 7, 1876) The original Northfield Bank raid was two days after Jessie James's birthday. Later, Jessie and his wife see their sisters move to their home in a beautiful summer day, but Jesse says what she thinks about when she comes to Christmas Eve ... But in real life, Mr and Mrs Jesse James December 24, 1881 ... so this scene * must be BE * on Christmas Eve! These errors are totally avoided. <br /> <br /> Here are some fictional stories. According to this film, Northfield Bank Raid has failed because of a (fictional) hennaman delay in reducing the strings made of wire. In fact, this was actually a chance to escape James Gong ... but it did not affect the failed exploitation for other reasons. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I was disappointed by Robert Wagner. In other places, Wagner proved his magnificent design, leading the heroes, villains, and morally vague characters. Here, Jesse James was a good person does not determine whether or not to film ... so he baddiga fucked. John Caradine's phones have a short role as a fictional Jacquel preacher who is married to Jesse and his wife. In fact, Jesse James was baptized in early childhood by his uncle and Methodist minister ... but perhaps this second baptism is topped. <br /> <br /> Jessie James is not a Robin Hood. (నేను రాబిన్ హుడ్ రాబిన్ హుడ్ అని అనుమానించాను, కానీ ఇది మరొక కధ.) జెస్సే జేమ్స్ తన సొంత కుటుంబానికి మించి ఎవరితోనైనా తన దోపిడి పంచుకునేందుకు ఒకే ఒక్క డాక్యుమెంట్ ఇచ్చిన సందర్భం లేదు. After some of his holders, he left swagger with other parts of his gang. In the film, Jesse pledges to never refuse his gangster paths. In fact, the night before his death, Jesse James and Jessie Ford Brothers of Platte City bank robbery and the next thought was to use the stolen horses. Making the most of his exploits, Jesse James ... the poor folk who stole the horses from the local farmers (inaccurate Epics) doubted his palledaru beneficiaries. <br /> <br /> "I'm sleeping. <br /> <br />" I refused. <br /> <br /> "James' willingly betray a thief murderer and, as well as honestly about civil war, for a very impressive stunt work, a good montage and some good acting turns, I rate this pornography fraudulent image 2 to 10 points.
