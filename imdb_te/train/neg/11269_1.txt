Some of the supporters in my time have to admit, but most of them are. Plot trouble follow. Sexuality and violence can be distorted from the film that is filmed in a haphazard and extravagant manner. <br /> <br /> I would like to see that cast back on the final product and scatter it for a generation or two that wants to collect dust on a shelf. Sadly, in my case, I have a DVD. It sits on the shelf and sees me from time to time.
