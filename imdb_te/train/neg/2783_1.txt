For a while I went to one of my cousins, and we were looking through a theater, so we wanted to go into this film. What's wrong! This film is awful in every section. I'd never heard of the movie before, and literally everyone is still missing. No wonder, it gets ranked as it gets. It's a comedy, so it's just that the film is not only capable of such a film, or it's just funny. Getting closer to Christmas should teach you how to keep a turkey in about a year and a half. At the end of the movie, you come out as if you're eating poisoned on a sick turkey, and waste your time on your agility. Who knows why such things have happened. I've blamed you for some time before the movie went out of the theater and did not come out much earlier. It's really a bad TV movie that should be shown at 2 o'clock all morning and you see it out and watch that bad news, it's time for TV to show that it's really good for me to pay good money to see something good. In other words ... bad words are not right.
