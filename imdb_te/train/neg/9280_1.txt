Honestly, this terrible remake of me, this horror remake or the comments on this board are unknown. The review of the work is in tears, it's very funny. Anyway, this film is one of the worst films ever, and exactly at the bottom of the barrel for sequels. On the title "Omen" name stopped me and did not see this morning in HBO, but the other three had a slap on the face, especially the original. There are so many classic bad moments, but the guy catching fire from Juggler at my favorite mental fair !! Good days! "Motion Picture" is related to the whole genre, which is related to the Omen series. Avoid when you look for good laugh.
