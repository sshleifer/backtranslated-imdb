Given the possibility to write, live and star in my own film, I can probably choose something about guns robot women. Anthony Hopkins, however, probably decided that someone has seen a strong image. "Slipstream" is a very peculiar film, and David Lynch is perhaps the man next to him and asks, 'What will happen?' Say. <br /> <br /> It is a scene that crosses the road towards a yellow car on the right, which turns suddenly in a pink car on the left side. The film that has two letters in a conversation has the likelihood that random shots and insects can reach the walls. The film talks only about the "bodis that's invasion" to show himself (and later disappear in the thin air) for a particular film actor. <br /> <br /> In this window, I am hoping for Hopkins for the selection of actors in the film, aside from the way in which a coherent plot is needed, and using fifteen different edits, as well as black and white colors Some of whom have played multiple roles). In the participants, their characters deny themselves and they do not know what they really are doing. Christian slater's thug in a hat where my favorite is here is menacing during the obscure ambiguity and singing American national anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins made this film a joke and is the best way to edit it to "slipstream". It's a joke on the audience. When you try to understand what is going on and you expect to come to answer, you will see from the beginning to the end, the answer is just never true. <br /> <br /> I mentioned David Lynch before and I am a big fan of that particular director. I guess I will share my love for the likes of Anthony Hopkins "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Last Highway". However, even though "Slipstream" imitates his technologies (no surprise to anyone in the "slipstream"), however, no films of Lynch are satisfactory. It is quite chaotic and random - here is the image version of Alzheimer's disease which pointed out as another reviewer. No doubt there is a small number there who can see and draw something from it. Unfortunately for the rest of us, "SPAPREME" becomes a haggard and confused experience that quickly causes Hopkins's involvement. <br /> <br /> Watch out at your own risk.
