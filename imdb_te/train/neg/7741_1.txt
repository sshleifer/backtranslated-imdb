Josh Hartnett's dead eyes, it's a thick work, and Harrison Ford is in a buddy-cop comedy! There are 3 reasons to hate, prevent, and use 116 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> If you make friends with friends, they are fun. But their real golden age came back in the 1980s and 1990s. A Making That Takes To Combine Action And Comedy By Hollywood Police, But Its Final Result is not a Scandal in the Subtitled <br /> <br /> What really happened to this entertaining formula? Things are not the same since the entire decade. You have another buddy-action stubborn flap after another. (I was spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starkey & Hatch - 2004), and the worst of all (Miami Vice - 2006)! <br /> <br /> I do not believe that saturated natural causes after several similar cinematic discs and TV programs for the past two decades.

Yes, the roles of loyal cops we have 2 jobs, the background of the sinister city, but what's new? It's not about clich√©; <br /> <br /> Acting, especially from (Hartnett), is terrible. This guy is a comedian (or actor) or anything. His role is to take revenge for his father's death! Revenge on man, he probably died watching your acting !! <br /> <br /> When directing to some of those comic or difficult images, some parts remain high. Discouragement (arrest of a black man by absence); It's a rare time boring in what action / comedy should be!

Do not make me, God, or my children (Hollywood Homicide Part 2) In the end, see Harrison Ford's performance, he wanted a good time, but at least we did not.
