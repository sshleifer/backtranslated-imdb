Anne Bancroft kills Estelle, who recognizes Reita One-Time filmmaker Greta Garbo as a dead Jewish mother who wants her dedicated son (Ron Silver), and Estelle is acquainted with two before coming out of good. The actress has been named "Bancroft Talks" as it touches on these uncertain comic / dramatic / sentimental ingredients for her period. Hot-or-Cold Director Sidney Lewett can not get a stable rhythm, and Bancroft's continuing overtaking filmmaker is not back at all - she keeps her right front: beautiful, white-eyes and moves. Estelle is a drag on this scenario (the thinner-thought plot is unlike a lot). Silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks were among the stars, but everyone climbed to hunt her. **** from * 1/2
