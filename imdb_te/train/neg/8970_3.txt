The first Cube film is an art film. It has created a world that reflects all the mainstream of humanity, and they have shown that it is difficult to understand a contradictory world. It is a non-literal level, where a "man vs. brutal nature" plot, through the end of the person representing innocence and goodness, succeeds to face a new, indefinite world beyond the man's small squabbles; No world war, but peace is a world. I rated Cube 10 in 10 out of 10, a movie that does not have any sequels. <br /> <br /> The second film, Hyper Cube is a big disappointment. Some ideas are good, but in the context of the original film, both the story and the setting do not understand and they do not understand. And, to be fun, I rated it 10 out of 5. <br /> <br /> The third film, Cube Zero, secondly ignores, initially very low commercially B-codes signals. There is no "tribute" or "tribute"; That's only off of it. A similar plot, some things have changed with idiot (an idea that identifies the prime numbers between the cubes instead of the letters - it's completely realistic and nothing more to say). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Viewers Big Bad Experiment, And, in the film, just killers (as at the end of Kazan's first movie) are just killing - where is the bap * where that feeling? It's just fliplin 'stupid. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero's productive values ​​and performance are not very bad, but the story and the ideas are not entirely inspired by this movie.
