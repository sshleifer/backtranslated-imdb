A vaguely once famous actress in a film that plays a mother to a child. <br /> It has to be given to TVM producers, which do not have content on making a simple movie, they usually give us two background images, where the two themes are mixed and are now different. The first theme was a woman in an accidental theme cross with a woman suffering from a divorce theme, asking her why she was divorced by her son Sam because she had a scene of heart in her attempt to murder. "True, in the case of divorce cases," I replied that "people change", rather than the "right garbage" or your daddy cruise "open toilets for sex". Sam is not just for divorcing his parents, but he is thick as two small plates. He has no sympathy since he's stupid because he stole a person and a toilet a drug dealer would die if someone fired at you, and I He loves ill with illness Our own childhood is very na√Øve, Orwell said, "Ignorance is strength." Sam is suddenly an expert in marine life! The development of this role or poor scripting is what I realized my money and if the story is set in 1994, often wear clothes, drive cars and ride trains from the 1950s? Mom who turns fake turns into a story twist. Then this is the last plot twist that leaves you to feel like an eagle looking at the end
