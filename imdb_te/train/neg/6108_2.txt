Tarzan the Ape Man was the reconstruction of the 1932 film at the same time, and as the previous film, it was less similar to Burroughs's literary character. However, the 1932 Tarzan was shortened to "Tarzan-Jane" speech, which was played by Miles O'Keeff, the Tarzan, not talking or dagging. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek plays second banana as Tarzan Jen. Or rather, Bow Derek's left breast and her right breast is the third banana. <br /> <br /> The two action scenes in the film are slowly performed in motion, and they are really bad. <br /> Strangely enough Tarzan has the Orangutan side kick in the film. Perhaps a car with Indian elephants from Sumatra displays.
