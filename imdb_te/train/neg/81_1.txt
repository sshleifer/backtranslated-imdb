Lifetime restored. Can we say stupid I could not wait to get it done. This plot is unclear. Acting is terrible! Especially by young people. The story took a thousand times! Are we just acting to give actors a job? The previews are appealing and I'm really looking for a good thriller. In a short time life comes with good movies, this is not one of them. If I do nothing else, I should avoid this cost. It wasted two hours in my life. Can I get them back? I will peak my face on a brick wall for two hours. More entertaining.
