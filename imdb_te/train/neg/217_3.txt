This is a film based on a promise and some controversial image of homosexuality. Dialogues are curious and the sensitivity of "sex scenes" is totally absent. Acting and dialogue are high school kids, and the subject is intended for adult audience. This is a motionless and shallow film. If it is a story and more play it would have been nice. Ah and above, another thing: why is the use of internal monopoly over and over? It is very cheap. Romanian film in all routine films, as well as for a mature audience who tries to view it. But I do not necessarily need to portray it as a film. Start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians (teddy bears) - they're not working!
