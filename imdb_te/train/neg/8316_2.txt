Cedric Kahn's films are character-driven (I'm thinking of El NNYYE and FEXROUSE ROUSE), so it really looks like this is a series of expert attempts to give this sequel of an expert car to Sukco. . I did not recognize Stefano cassette as an interesting actor; He reminds me of the positive players who have correlated to movies like Bret Fawer. The gap spacing looks like the really vicious deer holding the headlights. <br /> <br /> The honest actor Suko is committed to reflecting his personality more. <br /> <br /> There is a small actor who comes from Nardille Le Beecco by Sukco storm. Blend's opacity in the interview at the police office feels terribly frightened about the future, the film is very small to recommend.
