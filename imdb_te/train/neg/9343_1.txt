'The worst director of all time' How can I review a recognizable film as 'worst movie' soon? <br /> <br /> An analytical approach that criticizes the film has two nonsense and a piece of band-wagon syndrome - <br /> <br /> The film's university did not say poor quality - 'Alcohol Sixteen Years' It does not compete for the title of the movie so it is pretty low sink to buy the title and hold the hold, but i Li belief. IMDb does not allow enough words to cite all the failures of the images and is exactly the same as the 'Sixteen Years of Eccan'. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, those moments of fame are not worth the job, so far, are engaged in this movie's sleep. <br /> My impressions? I thought I knew what I was doing and warned me to drink a lot of coffee beans before looking at this eye (I thought it would be cup of reference vodka). Despite my low expectations, "Alcohol's Sixteen Years" could not even entertain me in making fun of the bad images. Jabsson deliberately attempted to start poetry, but it was not too bad to go over and move our movements into deep and non-funny poetry, but not bad. .. and jobson trying to make a good movie? Even after seeing Alkal 's sixteenth Years' propaganda literature, I believed Jobson's honesty. Finally, and finally, many giles / chick moments (all of which I do not know exactly) do not seem to be sensitive, and some of those things prevent me from turning off the DVD. So good is good <br /> <br /> I can not say that this was just enough, it could not be considered too serious. <br /> <br /> Definitely bad movie, the connoisseurs of the movie. Go on your own running commentary. It has significantly improved the experience for me. Mike Myers commented on the Scottish accent in his cad, "When I'm running," I'm a man who dares to turn this whole piece into comic prayer, crossing a satirical representative of me. "
