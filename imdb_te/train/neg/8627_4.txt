Although it is usually a funny jungle adventure film, there are some specialties - the settings are very beautiful and the speed of adventure is good. <br /> <br /> Keith's backhoe Hoffman, a hunter in a cannibalistic country, haunting his van Hofmann and his gorgeous wife, Shower. He does not always keep things tight. The shower is in the decoration and Keith is widely used by her - she really does not work much. She is not the only woman to show her body and the bright elements of the film make about half of the film T / A. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that draws attention to this film, or away from it. The filter product, it will succeed without much fuss. A good 2 AM cable programmer.
