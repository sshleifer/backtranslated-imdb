Generally, Cruel Intentions 2 Cruel Intentions 1, again, are only poorly completed. The story is the same (excluding some lines) with exceptions. The cast does not know much, and definitely less skill. Instead of being seductive and drawing me looking at it, hunging feeling dirty because I compare the looking soft cord romance. I'm not sure if some of the idiot lines blame the actors or writers ... and when I feel bad, because I know how to do it both ... But it's basically two - my life's hour waste. It's surprising for me to make some movies and this is no exception ... I can not believe that they can make the third one.
