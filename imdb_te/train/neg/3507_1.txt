A little point of human interaction has reached the Maysles Brothers with this film. Remember, remember when you review this image, use the "masterpiece" words, these Maysles creeps just drive to the Hamptons and some unusual people do not happen to shoot the film. No, when they discovered these two poor curiosities, they funded their project financially (assume they had expected the money to sell the project). Then they made friends with two very fragile women. Here is the meeting of the mind or the real affirmation sharing. Whatever they do, they do nothing to contribute to this wretched mystical smile, kissing son and boyle. These hustlers think of having occasional thoughts of repentance and guilt. But the process of filmmaking, the preliminary, realistic shooting and later editing took a long time and in fact there were no rules for beleurs as humans. One of the weakest of people is a predatory image. By the time they gained their image-making reputation, they were severely exposed to what they did here. Their reputation as human beings is executive. People will remember them. Stupid hustlers.
