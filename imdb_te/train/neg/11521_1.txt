This film is really one of the worst trash pieces. It is truly surprising that something is really terrible. But, if you can keep mind-emerging plot, character development and direction, you can get a kick out of the soundtrack which is horrific that is funny. The picture begins to be terrible and quickly become unwatchable. Anyone who has a relationship with this film has been comforted because their career is likely to interfere in the film. If you look at this movie or see it already (I feel your pain) these words are very late. For other people, stay at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste 2 hours of your life. At least you can clean up or do something while watching it.
