No, it's nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach, fairy godmother and glass sandals, but if I'm widespread, I'll have to spoil it for you, it's not me. But this film is not spectacular, curiosity does not let you get better. It was one of those movies that began in the early days before cheating audiences with cheap scare tactics and unconventional storyline. <br /> <br /> Nine-Hee (G-Vone) and Hun-Sue (Shin Se-kayong) is your ideal mother and daughter. A successful plastic surgery, and another is your loyal, loyal, and beautiful young man. Their relationship is like a glove, so you'd like to think more about parent than parents. <br /> <br /> But the friends of Hoon-Sue, who are Yun-Hee, start making mistakes (they are not always) when they start fraud. It may be a warning to audiences, if the news reports believe, the Koreans ladies who do not bat a eyelid while going under the knife. The scenes in plastic surgery were really only horrific movements, but at some point, I thought Kim K-Duke's time was really gorgeous when describing and describing what was going on during the surgery. The two halves, the fist is an attempt to shock the audience with standard intimidating tactics, I agree, have just come to me. However, the latter half converted the film into unclear mumbo-jumbo melodramatics, and forced its conversion into its voice. Some things do not make sense, and attempts are always offered to explain, you probably will not buy it, that's not logical to start with horror movies. <br /> Leeds does not have a masculine presence with all the beautiful, and very low police character. But hey, I do not complain, although the storyline has been greatly improved. I'd recommend you watch this, if you're a fan of Middle Korean horror, VCD. Look for those face-off ish moments!
