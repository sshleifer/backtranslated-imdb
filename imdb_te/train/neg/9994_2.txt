Hmmm, a sports team is in a plane crash, trapped on a snowy mountain and is awaiting the difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead peers to survive. Anyone who knows noise? I have suggested "Alive" since 1993. Only the big difference here shows a big, white, aftershock of the Yeti sometimes a few times to drag the dead. <br /> Stupid: In the first scene when the Yeti hunting man does not have a trusted pistol, he is backed up. <br /> The accident is completely bogus. It exploded in the air, exploded when it touched the ground or was wiped out. <br /> Stupid: They survived, they were cold. It may be a good idea to control some of the burning debris so that death is not frozen. <br /> <br /> WTF: The pilot is alive and speaks when his face is snow, but it fits well, nobody will do it. <br /> Stupid: One of the players tells others to look for matches and lighters, but there are surrounding areas around the surrounding surrounding areas. <br /> Stupid: They will find coats and hoodies, but there is a stupid: I'm looking at the stick of a stick, and I say again, the pieces of the aircraft are already burning. <br /> <br /> Stupid: Himalayas are known for its storms. This is a general feeling to build up ruins rather than strengthen their structure rather than sit outside the debris. <br /> <br /> WTF: When questionable, use the dead person's shoulder as a slit. <br /> <br /> WTF: Many people know about the sleepy habits of the squirrels, bears and leopards in the Himalayas, and why he is not sure enough to get shelter and set nets from the start? <br /> <br /> Stupid: When trying to capture wild animals, the nearby vacuum conversation always helps in the trap. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how hard a frozen cut is? The corpse of the glass of the glass? <br /> <br /> WTF: The group is ready and the other two stand there and fight with the Yeti. The goat's heart was removed and the girl's head was tied up and the gang did nothing. <br /> <br /> It is a convenient avalanche to suppress two Itis and many testimonials ... or we think of ourselves. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues to be inertia but most action takes place in the last 15 minutes, as usual. There were good ideas with the javelin and chain, although it was not the beginning of the film (with a chain of magic) that they could not even die while they were around. Science fiction originals are typical, and ultimately loving couple kisses are not terrible (they eat human flesh and did not brush their teeth in a few days <br /> <br /> The ending is, though, the quote is lame.
