There are no spoilers here ... because there is no plot to spoil it. Madchann Amik is a face of proof that can live in a country - no talent is needed. Some of the best dresses from the Alice Kreike are the most beautiful dresses, but again she is Alice Krige. Her soft dreaming voice gives these odd creatures the only instruction at how seductively dangerous. Her otherwise unbelievable plot is believable creepy. She's a secret how she agrees to this project. Screen playwinners should be treated when they submit this script. It is important to make major continuity problems, superficial stereotypical characters, the horror formula writing, and no feeling. When the creatures have good skills like they go "dim", the question of where they came from and they never will be. <br /> Do not waste any time at this time.
