I can not get it wrong, I like action and revenge, I have seen many of my children, including Dolph Lundren's latest "The Mechanic". <br /> <br /> But with "Man on Fire" (and still with "Domino"), Scott uses puposelessly to show his lack of material that does not provide his material, . <br /> <br /> He is really surprised if he really wants you to be shot and edited by Scott ("Man of Fire" is 2 hours and half), and his steady camera movements and flashes are really torturing You leave it off the theater or stop it after 5 minutes. MPAA and studios have a questionable attitude towards ratings, violence, and PG-13 films, with a role that I have a $ 70 million film with a B-movie script, a guy with a gun in a man's ass, Hand blows, this also avenge the death of a little girl who is not dead! Why does a studio make a good script because of language or violence? ...
