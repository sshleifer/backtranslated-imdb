This movie should not be viewed as a flap. Ram Gopal Varma first wanted to make this film a remake of the classic Bollywood film "Sholay", but the original makers decided to go ahead with the project after facing problems and ... all the good parts of the film (acting, script, songs, music, comedy , Action etc.) He does not already hire staff to shoot and shoot the film Nevadu. Waste waste, waste of time. He made Coppola (Godfather) on us after making films such as Rangeela, Satya, and Company; What are you thinking of RGV However, this story, though hard, is almost an old show. Ajay Devgan Heero (Beru, Sholay) and Ajay (Jay, Shola) are playing a new kid in the game block. The "bad and funny" friends help the first person to catch the bad guy. Later in the film, now retired cop hires them as personal security and saves Amitabh Bachchan from the hands of Baba too. If you do not see Bollywood movies, the good guys at the end will succeed. There I saved 3 precious hours of your life!
