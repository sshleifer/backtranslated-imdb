The film is a comedy and mystery. It will fail in both of them. There is only a mystery here where someone is going to have such a poorly produced movie. The same comedy readers here I saw how high I saw. Can there be two movies with this same name? <br /> <br /> The movie that I saw was a pretty girl with a beautiful blue eyes and a story that was not there. <br /> <br />
