A good storyline, a good thrill ... but the last seconds have destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? A good story that was done very well and destroyed in the last seconds ... sorry a 1 in the vote ... what it deserves, I think Chris Shadley might come up with a good ending ... but maybe next time :) This nonsense blood gore is nothing No? The end of the story is 10, but it does not ... The end of the story has destroyed the story, I think many people are not dull and they want to have a good end when they go to a movie ... but here's the slowest end. Sorry
