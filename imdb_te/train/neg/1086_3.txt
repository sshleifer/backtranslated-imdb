Although its impressive cast and band pedigree Gingerbread Man is early and often confused. The plot is miserable, the amount of money collected by the actors game bad accents and the payment check of the director Robert Altman. Once again, he has abused the letter this time with an activated cast (like Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman). But that's only part of the problem. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh Rick Magruder, a high-powered Georgia attorney, is a mysterious catering company waitress convinced himself in the film's heavy-handed opening scenes and is in serious danger from a former husband and a deep father. Everyday red flags are a meditation lawyer who drives his children to harm humans. There is a hurricane thrown for a ridiculous finish if the gun and fist fights are along along with a necessary car chase and not enough. <br /> <br /> Brong plays MacGruder with a mealy and incredible southern accent. He is not explicitly aware of the continuation of the story, running in the trench coat of all kinds of atmosphere. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. Every bit a P.I. But there is little emphasis on bad voice. The elderly is Robert Duvall, who has done all the pork cuts more than a bed bug offering thick pieces of ham, but his scourge is acceptable. Leads to women (Embeth Davit, Darryl Hanna, Phamahi Jansen) Lean Leggy and Unmemail. <br /> <br /> Alston's Mice-Sean is unclear and his action sequences are comic book. It touched his offbeat and made observations (he did not know that Stars and Bars still wave in Georgia), which makes it very special for Altman. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man Altman is in his worst, even in the worst case.
