I am very happy to see that I have seen other comments and have clearly commented on only people who work in the film. I mean, I hate the bad things about an amateur product, but if you make a bad image, if you want to comment about it, make it a little bit less. "Groundbreaking" is slightly above the top. It is the most Boston-based college product, which does not even achieve the most enthusiastic college image level. It's what you expect kids to do in a bunch. Very crazy action movie. It's a lot of fun if you're ready to hurt fun. You will never see yourself as a student in Emerson College.
