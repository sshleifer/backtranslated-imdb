In 2004, I liked it. Then it became very stupid. It suggests that children are bleak. It insulted children. Cartoon Network is great. One of the programs I like is Haantoro. It has carried out children's events as interesting and imaginative as its method. The show (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) puts 20 spoons of sugar on your sprite. Today's televised producers seem to be interested only in guessing children and making more money than earning money! Recently, my kids are tuning in old shows (60's) to make them look interesting. Probably, despite the lack of realism, children's programs should be recycled after seeing the past for television and missing days.
