A geez ... there are so many other movies I'd like to see there ... I was stuck with my nephew over the weekend and this he wanted - yes ... <br /> I want to see this show when I'm in college ... It's moody, Somewhat functional. This show has a good heart ... and the characters are beautiful; No one has ever been killed or badly hurt ... it's got a cartoon life. Cut to 2005 ... what happened? This does not work. As others have said, is not just a cohesive story and the performances are strange ... almost unpleasant - the original characters are not sure ... the whole thing is like a mod TV skirt and more than 100 minutes! I saw this movie a few times Imbossed. What are they thinking? Better I can tell, for product marketing, toys, etc. All I can say is, this one is letting death die. It sounds like Hazard's original Dukes masterpiece theater. <br /> <br /> The only remake I will be doing from TV is Gilligan Island ... Good Luck!
