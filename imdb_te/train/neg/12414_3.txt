Jennifer Jason Lee and Mary Winnieham have played the role of a very different sibling, but Winningham can bring reliable or substantiality to his role. Lee, playing the bar-band singer and alcoholic fluid, relies on the folk singer who is constantly appreciated in the Joni Mitchell Molds in Old SIS Georgia. Perhaps due to double-duty co-production in the film, the league seems to have brought her to the corner: she is not as loyal as the singer, and if this is intentional, she has a much more screen-time microphone. Perhaps hoping for tour-power, Lee Wire-Drawn and Nude and Jagged; However, we can not see any talent in this role (LIFE is definitely a solid actress, but she will remove her from here). Sadie also has short-term attractions or appeals, and we can buy her (small) breaks. Besides, the likelihood of her growing up on stage is soft. Some of the serious dramatic scenes of director Ulo Grosbard craftsmen, and the ending of the sari's bar performance with George's soldier arena performing - both singing the same song - and this is a sinful moment ... but really? **** from * 1/2
