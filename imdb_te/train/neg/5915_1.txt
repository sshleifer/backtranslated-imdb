I've seen so many movies from China - and Hong Kong. It's the worst. No, the worst one is 'Unknown Pleasures'. I saw the platform yesterday evening and the other two films of Jia Jong Kae wanted me to be good. This evening I was disappointed. I do not see 'Jiao Vu' tomorrow evening because I put three pictures in bin! Whoever gave this film, ten of the 'Platforms' needs more cinema! Photography is very poor: the difference between some characters is difficult because of lack of close work. The storyline is so confusing, I'm disappointed. I do not recommend this picture to anyone. Give me daily Zhang Yimou or Chen Cage. These Chinese cinema are real masters, not pretentious con men!
