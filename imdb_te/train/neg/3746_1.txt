For the last few years, there is a terrible reality that is hard for me to believe, and it is still the worst place to go. This is actually STTV. I suspect that's done by gang. If Andy Kaufman is still alive I'm sure this is behind. Is this a disgraceful thing that can rock the band that is smaller than the INXS? The mantle is very simple and harmonious. A group of concert refuses to become the new lead singer of INXS, replacing Michael Hutchenz (suicide in 1997). Despite eight years of success and unsuccessful, their team has been strong enough to audition a group of talented Vanabas in a group of 20 years as the band's new lead singer. So I dropped all these terrifying singers (I thought I had a stake in American Ideal dozues), which made the worst of every classic (and predictable) rock song to be imaginative. Then they were cut to the INXS band members who seriously discussed the talents of each candidate. <br /> <br /> You can view good (and more original) rock performers at any nightclub in any city of the world. <br /> Every reality show has all the usual disadvantages. Lam Reality Participants, Sluggish Interviews, "Guidance" of Lite Host / Emmy, Lunar Performances and a partner's sluggish booting at the end of each performance. Can these presentations be imaginative? This is clearly a campaign on the part of the band; Finally the last gap of hope at rekindling their lost stardom before they are oblivious. Michael Hutchens should be rolling in his grave if he is alive when he is alive. INXS is not always a great band, but I do not know there are these curiosity. If INXS is the spokesperson for Rock and Roll, this program is the final proof, rock and roll once and for all, dead.
