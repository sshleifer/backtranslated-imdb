What's up here? Let me tell you. This (Alec Baldwin) exists. He is not a great actor but one of those good films is not one of them. He did nothing more than he did before or earlier. So (literally!) (Steve McQueen) is not in the same role as the original, because I do not want to do that in the first place. I'm not a big fan or fan (Kim Basinger), she has a lot of bad movies on her and she looks good on average! And they actually get my nerve when she talks about her seductive rare beauty !! Well, being an elegant makes someone attractive then I will yellow my hair as soon as possible! And what's with all the craziness to miss Basinger's legs ?? Is it definitely an insane or bad taste? I'm not only sexy, but look very ugly! And if you burn me, shoot me, but what do you know? I saw this movie so I was already dead! However, how much regret can you feel? Is not any of the credits the most deserving of her? - And I'm really (Jennifer Tilly) Now we have a unique sense of being a more realistic seductive chic such a unforgettable body and a nasty brunette (Marilyn Monroe)! (I can not help, she's the only new and so watchable thing here!). (James Woods) is here to summarize the initial events beside the pool (thereby the trailer is by his voice!) And he knows (and Michael Madsen) is better than the good man, as well as good guys, because it's the whole of Hollywood, "Your work, your cash , Good luck as an actor in other actors! ", Depicting the editing, the bright cinematography By the violent atmosphere, along with the main dramatic core of the whole thing (the types of betrayal), however, no means no echo, its main objects (action, thrill, ..) are here and are well prepared. Do not wait for it. Well, all the remakes without all the special remakes (except for the exclusive Jennifer Tilly's spicy moments). So with my goal I said Bashir, or anybody here (Basinger) than this film .. This is obviously an insult. Any film is better than this film!
