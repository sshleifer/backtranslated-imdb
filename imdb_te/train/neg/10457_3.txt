What can i say I'm a secret fan of top action and horror films. It comes with a lot of humor and inundo, but I'm not a fan of Snake on a plane. <br /> <br /> The film has three abilities: the situation comedy; ?? Horror; And ?? Hundreds of snakes are fantastic. <br /> First, the film is not a cheeky horror or comedy in a tongue, and only 1 or 2 points where you get smiles. If you want to enjoy the movie's feel, the trailer is genuinely referring to the film, the horror movie. <br /> <br /> Second, if you encounter a film that is full of actions and obstacles, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Third, I do not wear the novelty of the snakes of an airplane but you give up the idea of ​​cinema. <br /> <br /> I know this film has a high rating but it does not add it. Many reviews have been published and b) breakdown of consumer ratings varies less than 77% in the rating of 10% of people, only 9% out of 7% Such enormous empty hours?
