*** Warning! Spoilers located here! <br /> This is a partial-autobiographical form. Where is Madonna? Madonna does not have any challenge in this role, it shows. She played Madonna just Madonna, and she did not get that right. I know what you say, you say, "Do you know how much Madonna really like, you never met her!" Correct, I do not have to, but we all remember "Truth or Dare", are not we? <br /> <br /> In 2002, Madonna think you can learn something from "cross over" ladies, one way or another. Silver screen. For goodness, does not Madonna look "glitter"? Mariah Carey has shown how the film is done! Maria's beauty, talent, screen presence, carriage, you beat Madonna's worst butt of cut in classification! She is the only one we see from this glimpse into Madonna's world. <br /> <br /> If Madonna has something to say, it is her constant. When she was an MTV darling, she set up a women's fashion world for 20 years. Now, in the film, she has women locked inside them by women glamouriz all over the 20 years, all the most hated, terrible, reprehensible, ungainly traits of women's characters and the community, they are desperately trying to find the qualities <br/> Spoilers !!! <br /> <br /> Here is a good thing I can say about this movie, and I'm really impressed. They did not go for "Hollywood Ending" - the role of Madonna's character. At the end of the distinctive, happy Hollywood ending, Madonna's character was dying on the island, and her long-suffering and repressive husband's husband finally settled with a good, respectable woman, and her maternal wife, and they both were happy afterwards. But at this very disappointing end, she is protected, once again, this poor victim of her husband is sitting with his wife and his life is again a hell of hell. <br /> <br /> *** Here are the spoilers ***
