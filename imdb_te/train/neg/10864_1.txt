This film is going to take 2 hours in my life (actually it's just 35 minutes) to wish me to understand Indian film and hopefully congratulate me. <br /> I have seen all the old s movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Browsing via IMDB I do not know this thing after seeing this and seeing the 8.7 rating rating, and bring artistic pleasure. Oh my how wrong! The only logical explanation given to 8.7 is the Indians who voted for 970. Among them are the only Adam Sandler films out of boldwood production. With this rating, the film was ranked 9th. List of 250 Best Movies on Citizens Kane on IMDb, Sophie's Goodfellas! I'm not really in a mood to review and criticize because there is nothing valuable to remember from this traumatic experience. My only hope is that there is a lot of Hindu people like this play - plain stupid for kitsch and cheesy music.
