Italian 70-year-old film, coming up with original and good music, but with some exceptions, interesting but wonderful photography, poor and sometimes confusing storyline (eg wolf-dog character, and where the boy comes from?) Poor dialogue, good weather. <br /> <br /> The old young boy (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) with nude scenes (including the typical 70sudo-c√≥tatus), with the 11 and 13-year-old girl probably relatively familiar and demanded - And the US) from a societal political point of view of how these representations of whole young people were convincing and simple <br /> <br /> The other two characters A girl (Laura) revolves round threat, and her innovation in sex, a very precise representation of a young woman's life. The Eva (Silvia) character does not evolve at the end of the film and is already well-known in erotic art - she is "no age": she is a very addictive girl. Her sexual charms, but in the end she really used the crying image and still ends up like a little girl. When Laura appears to be a very innocent and weak victim, the boy is a totally unfortunate bully.
