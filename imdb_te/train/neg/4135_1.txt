This film is very good and I've been very good for getting good bits. What good bits? It is only a bit out of value worth it (what I mean by those who have seen the film). I guess too much from this movie as the dead dawn meets Freddy vs. Jason who meets dead dawn but this is the worst I got. The story is unforgettable, the cast was used badly and what the director was thinking. This might be great but I've always seen a very boring picture turned out. OK so what if a nice bit of T and A, I was after gore and I was badly disappointed. Do not expect an image to be good, but let's see if you want to get a bad horror horror and not do a horror movie.
