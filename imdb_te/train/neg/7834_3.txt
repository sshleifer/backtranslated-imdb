I do not usually write reviews but I do not understand why it's too high rated and I want to give a warning to horror lovers because those high ratings are given average TV watching. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> I see the first two episodes, but both of them have a cliché, which is not yet funny. You probably read the same old stories / two of the times already - bad toys from other toys ... and these stories are not innovative, they are not even pretty bad versions of that cliché style. I like e.g. "Chakki" and "Silent Hill" on those two episodes anytime. And do not ask about visual effects ... both in the first episode are good but in the second one ... awful. Some film student project is wrong. Blood ... or gore ... ma ... nothing worth mentioning <br /> <br /> It may be very interesting for a ten-year-old kid. I rather recommend "beyond belief" - now that's what I call a good secret TV show). But for an adult horror fan this is worthless. I gave up only 3 points because some beautiful cinematography (especially in the second episode) and some good acting.
