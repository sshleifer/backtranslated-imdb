I really liked ZB1. Really, I did. I did not have a problem with very low-budget movies and I enjoyed movies with worse production values ​​than ZB3 (if you would like, if you're interested, check 'wiseguys vs. zombies'). <br /> <br /> I am suspicious that Hollywood directors can not understand what 'about', but the ZB3 is so bad. It's retarded. I do not like to be dignified in my criticism. <br /> <p> <br /> <p> <br /> <p> Everyone spoke at the monologues. Even if someone made a sentence, camera work and editing and a bunch of F-bombs in every sentence also made a monologue-like line FEEL. At first I was excited about 90 minutes of ZB1 70 minutes, but there were fewer incidents in ZB3. It's all talking. <br /> Gore effects stupid came. <br /> <br /> Despite the epic description, there is not really a plot. And the explanation is actually epic! I'm going to see it, and I can not spoil it. (Do not look at it.) But, it's just walking around a group of walking letters and upset about ~ 80 minutes. Or less, if you choose.
