Honestly, my expectations for the little bush are low. I'm looking forward to a very small cartoon series (but it's better) but Bush jokes. <br /> <br /> Along with Cheney-chicken-eating joke, and some geekly-swipes, it's really boring <br /> <br /> This animation is a thirteen year old flash project. <br /> <br /> I do not like Bush, but I have experienced the bush joke as the next one, but it is rarely a product of Masromedia This is the evening of many funny days The president is not just a half-hour with the swipe nalu. <br /> <br /> "Lil 'Bush" in the past, the short comedy "That's My Bush" to buy a copy. If you say that, thanks to me.
