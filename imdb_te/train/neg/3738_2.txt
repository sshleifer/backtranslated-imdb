<br /> <br /> The film tries to make a fiasco of an "action" film combined with guns, explosives, and bled murders. <br /> What happens in this film? <br /> Is not it? <br /> What is the plot about it? What a plot? <br /> <br /> What is the point of trying to make the film? Killing is the only solution. <br /> What are the characters? <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this film? Yes. <br /> If you like constantly killing and greed, watch the movie. <br /> If you are repelled by such low-standard "entertainment", then "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> It sticks to one thing: the actors, the directors, and the one who made the film is certainly not "Made".
