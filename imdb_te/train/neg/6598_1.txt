This "film" is a mockery. No, wait - an abomination. NO, WAIT - It is without doubt the exact WORST film that has created and created the characters that were created by other actors. <br /> <br /> "Inspector Clouseau" instead of Peter Sellers <br /> <br /> They are like "Rickic" Anne and Money Chubby like Mr. Strawberry Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Laurel and Mr. Hardy died from 1957 and 1965 respectively. Appropriate upgrades for L & H also assume that Branson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain personally exceed me. I was totally worried and unhappy to be embarrassing and I'm definitely not disappointed. Everyone who participates in this curiosity, embarrassment and humiliation must block anything from everything and everything associated with Hollywood and film-making. All costs are away from this picture - you have to WARWED.
