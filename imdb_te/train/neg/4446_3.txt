"Serum" "Re-animator" starts with credits with many memorabilia of movies and is very indebted to them. The story is very similar; A mad doctor develops a serum that he believes he can relieve pain, illness and death, but he is not a big believer in clinical trials and breathes with a brain-eating zombie in his hands on his nephew. Zombie also looks like one from the "Re-Animator," and is actually not some of the make-up effects in "Serum". Unfortunately, the script is pretty slow and unbelievable at many places, resulting in a soap opera in the first 3/4 film. For some reason, the director presses us to say every day in big white letters on the screen. I can not see why this is important, not just trying to provide audiences as time goes on; <br /> <br /> There are many moments that are not tied here. For example, a victim fainted with a heavy weight hammer, but we do not have an indication of the mess when the victim's father is on. In another scene, one character is fully lit and looks at the world as he walks in the dark, with a flashlight in his hands, literally, literally literally a light corridor (actually we see the circles of light on the floor) ... but after a moment a second character runs down the same full-lit corridor. These are just a few examples. <br /> <br /> "Serum" is better in some ways than a straight-line horror straight-to-video. In terms of technical aspects? Sound and photography, for example? It has a more improved look than lands on a DVD. On the other hand, wooden acting (especially one of the main characters, the mad scientist himself!) And the involuntary movements and the lack of faith and writing and continuity do not have everything to do. This is the film, which will eventually get more experience for people doing this movie. One of the low-budget independent horror issues, late filmmakers frequently set out to remake popular movies and this is almost never working. However it is not in the case of "serum".
