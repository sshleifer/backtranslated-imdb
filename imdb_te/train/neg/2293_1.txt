This series Batman - the animated series, I think it's terribly failed if I feel improved for one. The character drawing is lousy ... (Catwoman, for example, looks terrifying ...) But really frustrated with me is what made Batman a bit like a wimp, just do not care himself in a battle, without both help, three sidekicks included. I mean, he's Batman, for God! I know comic books, I know Knight and Batman girl Allies as Batman's Allies, but still ... Batman wants to help them ... Could he not handle some punches? In BTAS, he can face a dozen opposers without any problem ... is he old? <br /> And one more thing: I do not really think that a boy like Tim Drake would be allowed to go into battle soon without any hard training. <br /> <br /> Batman - The history of the animated series, it is irresponsible (and Batman is everything but not irresponsible) and two, what has happened in comics. With its animation, its stories and its characters ... It's really Batman's legend. The New Adventures series transformed the story into another Batman film.
