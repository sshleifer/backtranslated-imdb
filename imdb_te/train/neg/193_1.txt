The story by Norman Macleen is a major work. Redford movie is a mediocre. The Maclean Brothers are going through a waterfall, which adds scenes of double dating in the Seeker Bar. The powerful storyline Paul McLean, a crafty attempt to play a genius outdoors based on what you are intended to do, is proof that Brad Pitt is dangerous or discouraged. Some of the fly-casting scenes are beautiful. Moreover, Tom Schritte's father and Craig Sheffer Norman have been as strong and purposely as men once predicted. Maclean loves women in his story, and because of the poem itself, no one has a stamp on the film.
