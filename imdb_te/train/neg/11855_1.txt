They are one of those movies appearing on cable as two afternoon entertaining bored housewives during iron time. The second rate of acting. Poor Matthew Modine is sleeping through the whole picture. And God helps Gina Gershon. She is on top of her voice. It sounds like a real English woman. Forced and fraudulent, like her acting. She must adhere to the best, lesbian showgirl con-artist in a rock and roll band and that she must have a drug problem. Other characters are not good. They are two dimensional. Empty, springy and silly. How should we care about these people? At one time Christie Scott loses in the Cashmann Central Park. Really? It is not difficult to navigate the Central Park. Just follow any path. Not only did I mention the characters, but I hated them very much. I'm with this train-wreck of Fisher Stevens film. His clever humor could even save this dying fish. Every scene is a typical romantic comedy fee and we are surprised. The script is awful as acting. If you catch this fish then throw it back!
