I have seen this review several months ago .... The trailer has promised me that this is not a slick for the movie. This is a joke that is literally a real joke of real genres of horror's earliest generation, such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), which also fits in the back of cover art. Producer flip burgers played by Brandon should go to the hamburgers who go and collect .... Hell is not even good! The lighting bad evil is bad and the big annoyance through the movie you could not even see the faces of the actor. Do not even remember the rest of the cast members who are really sad, and you will never do anything to make them memorable. I will waste this convention all the time It keeps you entertained It does not buy a piece of straw at least if you do not get it for 25 cents you stay away from this thin to get away! br> <br /> <br /> If you would like to have a good quality low-budget fun in this movie then check out Jeff Hass's picture ... Take it in the horror to have talent and have a kid! br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
