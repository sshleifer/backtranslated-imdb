My brother is in love with this program, let's give you this simplicity. I totally agree with the people who told me the Dexter's Lab and Fairly Odd's parent's copy. <br /> <br /> I really do not like very okay parents, I mean, some things laugh at me, but most of the time it's not apparently annoying and beautiful. I think this is about the Johnny Test. Except, nothing makes me laugh at that show. It's so stupid and meaningless, and you tell me the truth, maybe it's me, but kids do not like that! Yes, I think Johnny's hair is awesome, but c'mon! <br /> And Dexter's Lab, it was one of my favorite shows and I still do not mind watching it. <br /> <br /> If you do not know what you are doing, And the voice of the guy! And what is the gay voice? What's that confusion! I hate the dog that dies and go to the show and take the same gesture and watch the bad garbage and watch it. If you do not want to see, do not look!
