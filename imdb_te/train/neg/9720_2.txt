<br /> <br /> It tries to copy some of the effects of creative director like Jeunet in "Amelie Pouvin", but it is much more. Dialogues are pretty bad, I have heard, Gillam Canat (I do not recognize him very much), his father is playing badly in the movie, the story is dumb and ends .. <br /> <br /> I am "Le Pacquin des loups" from Christophe Guns, (Wolf's brotherhood) I do not like much movie (and I see about 80-100 movies per year), but The film had at least some action and good actors. <br /> When I never commented on (rating only), and when I saw the rating and comments, <br /> <br /> We have no problems selling the DVD I've given: it is not such a bad image in our collection <br /> <br /> You can see the open minded (I'm SF, Western, Drama, Comedy, Silent, Horror, Fantasy ... Movies!), but this film is so boring as I lost an hour and a half.
