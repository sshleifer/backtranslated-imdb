I do not know where to start, so I start with a snippet from behind the cover of this film. "Alice Kimurao's own versus combines the tension of Vincenzo Natalis Cube." I did not see Versus, so I can not comment, but I think it's a wonderful film I recommend to Cube. <br /> In this case, someone "bored" is clearly confused with "tension". <br /> I'm going to go now, because it'll spoil the entire plot, along with a sacred Swiss cheese, moldy cheese, and the picture is not worth spending any time even if you do not know the plot in advance, so it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The American Army in Nevada once lost a UFO in the Namib desert. This is obviously because they are both deserts and they are absolutely practically the same place. Different continents or not. A monkey entered the UFO and earned an alien subject to a Japanese researcher who had a monkey eaten in the desert. What ever. Now the alien has been issued to anyone who is "bloodthirsty" enough to kill the current host. The Japanese army wants to use military equipment, so they decide to go further from the current host (researcher's daughter). Instead, they decide that it is a good idea to remove some of the offenders from the military personnel and rather than pick up the full range of people who are already in the army, instead of choosing a soldier. Oh, and the reason they choose this particular criminal from the death row is because the first person in the history of death from the deadly electric shock is because it is the standard implementation method. . <br /> They do not know if they do that, so if they die in the staff room or die if it dies, or dies the electricity bill, then die. <br /> <br /> It turns out what the matrix was like if it was really lame, and the tears superfluous bore us for what feels like an hour. And oh wait, now remember that they already have a person infected with the alien subject, so to this point the whole movie is actually completely waste time and human lives. Then everyone will die. Eventually. <br /> <br /> When I go away and sleep in a sandwich for a moment, a man is pinned to a wall by a tube through his chest, and he hangs around there and walks another man. The person hanging on the wall says, "I have suffered pain, bake me." And the country Dude sees him, and he is not an average dude or anything, so he is really sad and does not enjoy the person on the wall. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
