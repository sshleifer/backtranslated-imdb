One friend gave me another classic saying it was "Dallas makes Debbie". Somewhere close. My main complaint is always about the most unattractive lead actress in the romantic industry. The more terrible she is on the screen almost all the time. But I read it back in those days, and has some "artistic" value of romance. I could not find it though. If you are interested in the history of pornography, you can appreciate the art of pornography. I do not know. But the film's director looks like a talented person. He tried to give him permission to use his songs by Simon & Garfunkel. However, they refused.
