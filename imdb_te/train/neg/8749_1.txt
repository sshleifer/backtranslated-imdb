It's a terrible picture that everyone says. I laughed at Scott McNeil, which was awarded to one of the foremost murderers of the Sun's logos. MCNealy is CEO of Sun Microsystems, which practically defines Microsoft's hate speech. They played a key role in filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. <br /> <br /> Are they crazy for thinking that this sunshine will add fuel to the film? <br /> I do not have any public record of the Sun's involvement, but apparently the filmmakers know Scott McNeoy. Interesting mystery.
