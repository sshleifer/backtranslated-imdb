I think I was raped as I did with an unsatisfied Christian, but the Beagle Magic World is still contrary to Beauty and the Best. Like Christmas, BMW hates its audience, but not for such extreme levels. This is ugly, pronounced, idiot, and the writing is scary. Stories did not work. These are not the characters we loved from BATB, they are a group of pad people. I wanted to abandon it, but after a few minutes, I gave up, because nobody in the right mind could take this clappt. We have three stories here. "Perfect Word" is an apology, inspired study. "Fifth's Folly" If you agree that the name of Babbade is actually PIFF and she agrees that James Bond is an idiot related to Villains and Lumi√®re women. "Bruunwing Wing" (or "Broken Wind" I'd like to call) is probably the worst of the bunch. Does the Beast hate the birds? Since when? Do not check this trash - every copy of this video deserves to be burned. Beauty and the beast still is a cinematic classic, love, art, intellect and overeating of the human soul.
