Oops! I've heard a ton of mixed reviews for this ... Hardcore horror reviewers found it really frustrating at my journey. The man he is right nose! The film was cast by pure enthusiasts. They were cast to take one for each scene, and the film appeared to be quite jumping. The script is also poor ... there are lines that are special but unsuccessful. Badly. "Get your moths out of me!" Oh man, I hate when movies do so. It happens with comedies at all times ... but with horror film and below average actors ... The results are very exciting. All of the lines and scenes are very imaginable. But I feel so quick on this film, again, damn acting. It's awful. There are also some Asian people who worked with Booth. <br /> <br /> This movie is 5 stupid dumbsh vacations in Asia! T is a tourist. They end up at the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia run sex / slave. Sounds like a cool story. But diarrhea is very pleasurable to look at those in a bad case and looking serious. This is the only reason for horror, because killing. There is no trace of suspense. <br /> <br /> Many of the horrific fans die in order to get their bloody little mites in this regard. But unfortunately with a huge capital U, the film is very disappointing. I enjoy ankle interval and blood effects. <br /> <br /> Everything about this film screams enthusiasts. The first feature of this Ryan Nicholson is length, and for the most part he failed. There he is refusing to have a sick sense of taste for humor and horror. I prayed that his next film did not act like another B-horror movie ... unless it tells us what it's gonna do. Even after this disappointment, I would like to give Ryan another shot. From what I have seen about him, he is a genuine, dedicated person to the genre. Good luck next time, because it's bad news.
