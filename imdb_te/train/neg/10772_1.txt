The saddest part of this is the fact that 87 minutes never lie back. I know this terrible thing from Go-Go, with a man who is dressed as an Indian head with a lunatic on top. (See how they stay away in 2008). My 10 year old boy is currently a baseball, so we have decided to rent on a rainy day. Although he enjoyed the parts of it, I had to fear when I heard all the unnecessary foul language. Bad, bad image. It's a terrible repo of Bad News Bears. Completely shameless and totally predictable. It is very well done and the imaginative movie does not ignore, but it's definitely not.
