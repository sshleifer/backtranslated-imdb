I do not want to use the term "awful" to describe any work of the film, but it's time, effort, talent and money in its creation, but Jerperl's attempt to get the Charlotte BrontÃ«'s novel 'Jane Eyre' is the total waste of time. <br /> <br /> Unlike the script and lack of power, everything that is unexpected to the audience is less than the imagination. Leading actors are badly mistaken, apparently renting their stellar names, and the musical score is drippy and dull. There is absolutely no chemistry with Charlotte Gainsberg and William One. She is like a wet noodle, capable of at least emotional interference in the storyline of the east and worst hobby than Zone Fontaine. And William hurts the whole movie in a tone and the tone is flat and powerless. <br /> <br /> Jon Plorite's Mrs Fairfax is like some Disney Creation, but in this film the Limp and Wapid script take her the best surviving sequences. <br /> <br /> Rochester's first wife is not a mystery around the story. The second wife role role space cipher starring Elle Macfeshar as Barbie Doll. <br /> <br /> The great actress Fiona Shaw, Jane's aunt, is completely wasted like Mrs Reed. She had a good cast as Mrs Fairfax. Amanda Route, Jane's beloved school teacher, has aroused any authentic sympathy or trust. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of 'Jane Eyre' after seeing Sean Hands, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones in 1997 for Robert Young's British television. Not comparable. The most important, romantic and deep-moving version of this is a burst of Nova compared to Jeffrey's wet ankles. <br /> <br /> I am interested to see the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, the things on this website. I am amazed at how much Zefferelli's Yorkshire film book likes. <br /> <br /> I can say good about this film because the house is beautiful and cinematography is in clear color and is full of breath.
