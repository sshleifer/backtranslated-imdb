This program makes me bugs! It's no joke and it's so serious that it's called "fun"! This is a great study at my will! The characters are very stereotyped and unappealing. The plot is repetitive and the morals repeat again and again. Where's it fun? It's also too long in the BBC and the transmission path is too high. Is there really a slot in T.V every 2 or 3 months when running out of a brand new show episodes? I think that BBC is the time to bring back some of their old performances: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Raccoons and Ducula are more than ever in deals with these new shows! I'm taking the Danger Mouse back to the BBC, so what's going to happen with it? 3/10
