Return is one of those films for a crowd of people who love the movies and confused them in the same movies. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a mysterious buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or naked. I'm ready to give up with this, but I'm not always ready to give up with the worst past ever with the worst editing ever. Eventually, when she was younger, her car collapsed in her car. Or I'm wrong and it's just a flashback. It can not be said with this movie. Are you the worst product of the same person who made the Darkness Army? It is good to be in the army home and watch of the Darkness in Science Fiction channel. The film has everything: sluts, zombies and a brass dude for hand. The Forgotten does not even have one in this regard.
