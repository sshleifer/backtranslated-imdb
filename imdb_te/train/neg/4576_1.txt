This documentary / fiction / cartoon at first glance is very entertaining and thought provoking. But when some thought arises, it will look. The reality is that this film combines metaphysical with the surreal and baseless conclusions. The link "Bleep Wat ..." that you see between science and spirituality is, in fact, not in all of science. The transpendental meditative study referred to in the film is a group's meditation in this regard in Washington DC. In fact, the crime rate for HRA (murders, rapes and assault) was about 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. There is no reduction in the number of murders during the study. <br /> <br /> My resolution from this information is not a little effort to teach people or jokes. <br /> <br /> I suggested that you waste your time. <br /> <br /> If you look for a long, windy picture about the science you can imagine, you can consider Mindwalk (1990).
