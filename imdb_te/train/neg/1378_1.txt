It was like an evil 80 TV show came loose and tried to become a soft core romantic movie. Oh my God is bad. The plot of each character has less importance. This plot is nothing to talk about. I guess an incognito. Will he shoot himself in the end? It's not really clear, but it's something like a volleyball game. And the main character (Randy) sleeps around a lot. Casper van Deen was the only reason my friends had rented the movie because they were in it, and they wanted him to go with scenes, which at that time were just to be seen. Thanks to God I do not spend any money, but I have that hour of my life back.
