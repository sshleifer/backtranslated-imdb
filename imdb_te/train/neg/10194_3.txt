This 30-minute documentary Bunuel was one of Spain's poorest regions in the early 1930s, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First, 70 years later, Spain agrees to be very wealthy (when I say this, I fully agree that wealth can be brought in the same way as its own personality and consumerism, and in all prospects it is a far better phenomenon than painful phenomena). And if the poverty in Spain is reduced, with Bunuel's socialism, Western European style is not perfect with capitalism. But it is one of the most surprising things about the film: In one scene, the protagonist teaches children the value of the children in school. Mathematical teaching for the poor people, horror! Bunuel is the shortsightedness of its most glaring, which helps to overcome their condition for the poor knowing the latest knowledge and access to technology. Is he proposing What exactly do you teach in school? Does not Bunuel understand that there is no advanced technique made by Bunuel compared to other people?
