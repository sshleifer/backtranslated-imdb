The film was discouraged. Very slow, very intense (and very cryptic) begin to lose the film. Most plots left too little time for the explanation, and I wondered about all of this when coming from the theater. The stories are uncomfortable, not all of this story is convincing, it's your job without the most ridiculous references and some of the cheesy parts ... The young cop eats a body. Of course it is night and it rains and he alone is doing it ... yawn! Or the manifestation of the Evil "Nazis" plus "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, it's really original. Some nice bits, however, are like the fistfight scene, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (Reno and Vincent Cassell though they do) it certainly is not worth it. (3 of 10)
