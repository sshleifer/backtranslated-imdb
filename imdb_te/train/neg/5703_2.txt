For a while, Disney was one of the thrillers to be surprised by all. To the very end you will be surprised. In the Pirates of the Caribbean tradition, the film becomes a ghost and is sure to kill your village and rape. It's terrible. If you want a foolish, mindless, imaginative "action" image, go ahead. I think they like good kids when they win. But for me, I love movies which is going to win toss. The film does not have bad guys on top. By the end, when the leaders are left in an "inescapeable" pit, you realize they can get out of it. Everything cage and his friends will do the right thing, no matter how complicated he is, do not think over a riddle or springboard for more than 10 seconds. If you want to see a good acting or good image, look at this picture if you want to see some impressive set patterns. Let's look at a Superman movie, it's a lot less and kids will like more. For example, the sight of the cage fleeing from gunshot guns, and bullets are exploited by fire from the fire. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just a small piece) The movie is a film of decay and the film industry offers cheap costumes and dull, unrealistic actions, the film's size.
