The sitcom "The Leg of Gentlemen" follows the lives of many strange inhabitants of the fictional village "Rayston Wassy". <br /> <br /> In the first series, a sketch show, Main Plaza, with a new highway to be built by Royston Vassie. Consequently, most foreigners visit the small town. But Edward and Tubs, owners of a "local" shop, in fact it is far from the town, the aliens do not like it. They will kill him whenever a visitor enters their shop. In my opinion, some scenes are not tasteless and funny, for example, when the couple realizes the two engineers who want to build a new highway. Edward drums and half the naked dancing around the Tubbs victims. <br /> <br /> In addition, Pauline lives in Royston Vassi. She works at a local job center. Although Pauline hates people to work with her, the woman should not lose her job. So if an unemployed person made a firefight invasion in an interview, she would not allow her to go because she was not ready for a job yet. <br /> <br /> Then Barbara Dexton, the transfer taxi driver, details about "her" sexual conversion. <br /> Furthermore, West, Mr. Chinari, kills animals from time to time. On one occasion, he comes into a field and goes to the room where the dog sleeps in his basket. The farmer goes out. When the dog feels unwell, Mr. Chinnari is sick of him. <br /> Secondly, the farmer opens the door, "real" unhealthy, lamb, holding in his hand. <br /> <br /> Some residents have been killed by the owners of their nephew friend husband, wife and wife). The couple is very cool. For example, there are towels in different colors. Each color stands out for a part of the body. In addition, there are different keys marked with different colors. <br /> In my opinion, the actors play well. By playing women, the scenes have become jokes. The actresses are also suitable for the actresses. The tabs wearing a scarf and some silly characters, for example Edward and Black teeth are incomplete. The event included a great deal of Dark Humor, special British. The set design reflects the mood of the series. The village and all the houses are gray and depleted. The frequent fog effect around the local shop strengthens the threat of intimidation. <br /> If the actors do a great job, I think this series is not my taste.
