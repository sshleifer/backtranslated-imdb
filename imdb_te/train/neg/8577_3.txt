I know you'll get my summary. How is this film like a pet rock and a disco? Well, if you live in the 1970s or 80s, someone is probably new coke or pet rock (and at least in Pet Rocks, I can not fully understand)). They just seemed to feel at the moment but there were a couple things that really baffled the younger generation. That is for Kay Kesar and his band. During that time (mostly in the 1940s), they were very popular and the studio starred alongside Boris Karlov, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorrey. However, if you do not live in that time (it is before my time), you will be surprised to see why anyone likes why it's "very fun." After all, Kaseir and his band mates are very bad and their humor is very wide (ie, inconsistent and cheesy). Frankly, I congratulate myself that I can not retain their antics or just a large number of people in the film. Due to these factors, a great assistant cast back seat is provided and fans of these actors are probably disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film is a young girl and her abusive aunt. Once there is a bridge washed and strange events begin. In the end, it ends on Sally's life and sometimes a few trips. It has played for all the laughs - and this is not a horror film despite being really cast. <br /> <br /> Overall, the fun is fun. As a Lugosi and Carlf fan, I definitely felt cheated to have to see Kyser and his knuckleheads.
