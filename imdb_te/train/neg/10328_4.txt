I think it's a pretty good idea to work on the show. But execution is poor. The script is poor and good acting. There are many problems that may be filmed in a better way, as finding a protest or cemetery against same-sex marriage. The show is not joking as it is not funny jokes. <br /> <br /> I would say this program is not very successful in reducing the life of Muslim society to some extent. I have my hopes high about this show, but I'm kind of disappointed. However, I would like to congratulate the CBC on such an idea before viewers. Anyway, I wish good luck in the future.
