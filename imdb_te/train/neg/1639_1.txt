"Wiped" is 82 minutes long. This review is 82 words long. The two women who played Amanda Peet with the neglected results were the three New York Lothoros, the ruthless "scammers" who were disappointed. The story and the picture applies. Most sophomoric, flawed, fainting and funnier, "wiped" shock jokes, combines Tammy's philosophies with the Penthouse letter letter fantasies. Although technically skilled, it hates, hates, poorly writes, understands and understands. People do not like it. People do not speak. Really.
