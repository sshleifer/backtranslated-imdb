Pier Paolo Paulosini, or Pie-pee I would like to call him (due to his love for male civilizations), perhaps a lot of overtered European Marxist director - and they are thick on the ground. How can I see this violent "art" for anyone, the cheapest sex-rim composing is beyond me. Here the "stories" may have come straight from some soft-main romantic film, and I do not suggest much simpler and more common and simple, often unintelligible stories about nudity. <br /> <br /> Anyone enjoying this relatively viable but dumb opacity is really sinking his teeth into a soft romantic German 70s film series because "decagoner" looks to me. <br /> Almost all levels of the film are closed. Editing. An example: in 1 hour: 15 minutes: 45 seconds There is a chasing scene that is very clear to the wrong place. It should be a minute later, but I guess I was appointing Buzz-up editors who had just a bit of "good detail" in the making of Passolini. Fans of PE-Pee have probably deliberately put it in control - I am very doubtful. Moreover, even if it is true, it will be much more bad because the story is very difficult. (This is not exactly one of the "Eraser Head" or Tarantino's broken-form films). <br /> Acting. We are sloppy. Fans of Triple Pe's (total 8 of them) proudly announce how proudly 3P-O uses "real people instead of actors". Other actors have used and successful enthusiasts (Alan Parker or De Niro), so why are the PPP's enthusiasts so much in their movies? (They are not actors, or they are Martians? Many actors have sub-par IQs, but do we not understand them? Are you awful? The answer is once again the alarmed sloppiness. Pasolini is sloppy in everything, and he would have been trying to get more from entrepreneurs without his teeth. You are a lazy director, Imperfectist. Kubrick-Anti, I think ... The main goal of the P-PE is to try to find as much as possible (and younger people who like him) as much as possible of the old ones during casting. Pasolini has a simple formula in the world: lack of teeth + strange face = realism. It's nice to have these worthless ones, but at least try to get these partial-good performances from at least partial-good performances, otherwise you are an enthusiastic you - an amateur director in the case of Possolini. 3P-0 does not change anything, or simply ignore it. <br /> <br /> "Audio synchronization If the 3P-0 thinks that microphones are too disturbing when filming a film, then he will have at least one attempt in post production, <br /> <br /> The conversations in the film have taken place somewhere else, we have no dozen stories. Some people are simply anti-counter (later longer), some are just sexy, meaning cheap male (sometimes gay) fables, stories and characters are not fun at all (if not all), but the lowest. Children can laugh at here ... and there is nothing wrong with that, but then it does not call superior, intellectual art! <br /> <br /> As a result of point 4, there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories, without saying it.Pe-pee has been able to set in and out the exact picture, which means it can start to get back to the beginning and start to first go back. "Decamerone" is a bowl of spaghetti: When you start eating begins with the thread you want, it makes you <br /> 6. Understand the meaning of stories. Many stories end up with less gag / jokes, which means directing them out of some romantic comic-books, and some stories are not at the end: they are just ending. Finito. Best of all, the stories are semi-anonymous, and there is no deep meaning - unless you find "deep" meanings in a romance. There is nothing easier to find and "understand" because there is no meaning. Hence, the romantic film of which any of the heroes can endlessly become philosopher / harder. It's easy and fun. Try it out, oh 8 PPP fans! <br /> For church-bashing ... Some spectators are happy to attack Catholics. In the Principal, it's great and nice - after all, I'm an atheist - but those people ignore the fact that Paasolini is a simple but essential fact that Marxist is. It's like a pat on the kettle block. Marxist criticizing church for hypnotism and stupidity? Where does he believe? Moreover, Pasolini is not an atheist, so his high-power and self-righteous attitude is not supported. After all, Marxists are believers: they have just substituted an approved god with a utopian idea, which is just another supernatural surprising thoughtful fantasy. <br /> <br /> This popularic Hapadomah concludes with the mythology of the mythology: "I wonder what ... art about it? It does not mean that he is a little artist, > <br /> <br /> Earlier, Bergmann films? Send me mail
