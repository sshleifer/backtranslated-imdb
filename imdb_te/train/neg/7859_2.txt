Oh my. This film is terrifying. I can not complain too much about it. I saw it was going to be charged. It did enough, sort of. <br /> <br /> Many of the most disgusting parts of the film have been forced to give birth to a baby that is very scary. <br /> <br /> I'm the famous actor Hispanic soldier in this movie, the next Friday's assistant actor. Everyone in this movie has done a terrible acting job. It's some worst act that I've paid to watch. <br /> <br /> "This is not it, I think it's more brutal than the sequel and horror movie sequels are generally less successful than their ancestors." Gore and torture are usually the horror film these days (Grudge 2, S3, Zipper's Creares 1 & 2, Dead Silence), I thought it was more intimidating, but it was actually not the first <br /> <br /> "I love you, mommy" four times saying his The whole concept of showing the clip of the female soldier's camera on the camera phone. This is stupid to show in the first place because they are trying to hurt the mother who is more harmful than the rest of the soldiers, and by showing that it is more ridiculous for us to try to hurt her it is three times for no reason. This film is a joke.
