This U.S Soap opera, 'Knots Landing' has all the entertainment values ​​caught in an elevator. Each episode includes plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking, which at that time did not differ from the plots of other theater performances. In the cast and cereal box, I saw good actors. From the late 90s, the repetition of 'Knots' is like a mountain like U.K-Gold, a little thirty nappies. I'm sorry to announce that I'm suffering because I'm a huge fan of my mother's show and I see it religiously. Since then, the returns are very low (let's hope it will be). The only positive thing about 'Knots' is that the impressive Saxophone signature tune, then the I.T.V sitcom, was used as title music for 'The Upper Hand'. Great legacy, e?
