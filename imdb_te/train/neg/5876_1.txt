I had to compare two versions of Hamlet to my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I chose this version. Camera shots (all the medium or close shots ... scenes shots and shots are very low back ground) acting actors (the directors are directly distributing their lines directly to their camera) are completely terrible. I saw it in my spring break and I feel like I have been out for 114 holidays on my holiday. The imagination is not recommended by any stretch.
