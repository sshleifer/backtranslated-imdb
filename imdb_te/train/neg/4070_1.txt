Filming a fugly annoying Goth film from college in a Scott film, throw a lot of pinch and awful acting in the story, and the film does not come close to how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The shot is bad, bad effects, worse acting. An attempt to shock the shock. I've seen everyone and it's very frustrating. Sexual scenes are not necessary for their content, they are interrupted, but it is more likely that they want to end it as soon as possible. <br /> I am one of those who love to see these people hate movies, so I have chosen. But for yourself, save yourself time and avoid this abomination. This is bad. I literally threw it into the trash.
