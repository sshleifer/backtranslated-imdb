In a word ... endless. I give a star for hippie sex scenes and eye candy women, otherwise forget it. Carman's worst attempt, bar none. Ben Werner's name has been permanently stripped of his name. Another retro stinker - I can not believe that it's now on DVD (as of 2/15/05) with "Wild in the Streets". I woke up in the bed this morning cool, some decided to watch a movie to cheer myself up, digital channels scan ... Teen Flix looked interesting enough on the premise because I'd be watching the B-film Science Fiction, hippie culture and rebellion on the premise. With Ben Vereen in it know and cast something, I thought ... why not? <br /> <br /> When I see it, I know why my newly awakened brains are taking place. The film was reminiscent of the upcoming attractions of the age of 14 (aged 45) when I was at the local Art Theater, which is still in the original / cannabels at Sambrero, laughed at the whole theater. Acting: horror, story: awful, cinematography: almost awful, music: horrible, acoustic: horror, direction: a joke. If you choose to see it after my warning, remember ... "I said that. <br /> <br /> The title" Goss-Essay "for this movie ..." You're watching this closed movie - or you wast your brain To get a "gas" chamber to take. I saw super 8 films that insult the film. My new all-time Top Ten WORST movies is definitely a new addition ... with it (er, down there) with "tentacles." <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
