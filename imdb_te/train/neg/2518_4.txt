A dark version of that kid is "Power Rangers" and you think you have "Robot Jokes" since 1990. The film you are faring giant robots, two people into the arena and who comes out of their country. The robots are huge and appear to be slightly better versions from similar shows because they are less colorful because the film is not good and it's not all bad to see. I recall these two robot fights, one ends and the last showdown ends. There is a storyline twisted section as revealed by a traitor, but there is nothing you can do at any time after the end of the plot. The battles appear to look like big toys on the rampage, but some fun to see. The film also has a bigger robots and similar plot, such as the tournament for other films. So worth checking once, but probably not more than that.
