This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I loved the novel because I looked primarily out of sick curiosity, and I do not want to. I wanted to stop it after five minutes, but after less than an hour I stopped it. I wanted it. It changes all kinds of factors without ignoring most novels. In the last 50 or so minutes (which is not impossible) I would not recommend this film without redeeming it. This is a disgrace for one of the greatest authors of the twentieth century. I do not think, many say it, "Bell Jar" is necessarily ineffective, but this is not done without a special composition. I want to see this day, where the director and the screenwriter can do justice.
