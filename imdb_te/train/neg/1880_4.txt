Even though Fred Astier and Ginger Rogers were a fan of films 6 years ago I saw 'Follow the Fleet'. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the songs are impressive and when Ginger Rogers is sweet and funny, you know songs from an old Asti / Rogers record (yes, vinyl), but just do not like 'bread baker'. When trying to do his longtime partner, he will constantly wreck his career. <br /> <br /> Worth watching songs by Ginger Rogers and great solo tap routine.
