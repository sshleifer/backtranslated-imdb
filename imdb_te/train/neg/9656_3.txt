The film is built for everything in TV. However, there are great ideas, great looking sets and authentic objects and textiles. The film was quickly turned into a nasty cheesy conversation, and TV relapse dramatic acting. These characters were very confusing, sometimes I thought that Goo's fierce beam would be underwhelming, and the actions were mired and poorly cut and the soldiers just stood around and fired with each other. The Germans are portrayed as being unrealistic and painful. The only thing that German officials spoke about was how amazing Americans were. Please take my word for it. I'm a fighter for war style, and this film is even worse. However, the DVD contains an extraordinary extra feature of the characters that came from the lines before the WWI, so my rent is not a waste of time.
