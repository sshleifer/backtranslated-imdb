One of the low-budget "buddy" action films produced by the 80s thanks to films such as Cage (1989) and 48hrs. And Lethal Weapon. This is a stars Reeb Brown and Lou Ferrigno to the former Vietnam Vets who will run a local dive bar. He saved his life in 'Nam' because Rebe took care. But Lou was filmed on the head and is now pretty soft. Although he is older, Lou has a child of infancy. One day some Raffians dismissed their expectation at the bar, and La and Reeb beat them ashore. But the restorative mother. They will crash the bar that leaves the loo and rebe. <br /> <br /> There is a plan in mind that the two thugs are brought to the picture (one of them is a real nice guy). Perhaps when they go all and a hard-core action movie is perhaps the best way to do it is to try to reduce the grace of the situation. Oops, it's not and the audience is holding the bag. Oh! Good. This is a bad thing because it has everything you need for a great B-movie. <br /> </ p> <p>
