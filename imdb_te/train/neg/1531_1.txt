This film is very bad, and it wants me to be vomit. Poorly generated, full laugh free zone. Why would you rob a movie like a picture of a spoof with a degree in the name of God (and a damn funny one at that) it stands out? These sets are ludicrous and the effects are not too bad, they are not ridiculous, acting is ridiculous. It's absolutely no secret why you take a look at this dirty chaos. The National Lampoon has once made Amazing House, which people still feel totally and completely happy. Now they've been expelled to make TV movies like this paste of ****. Your eclectic name, and this image will be used to describe.
