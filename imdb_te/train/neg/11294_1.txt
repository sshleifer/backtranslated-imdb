OK, I'm a huge fan of Black for a long time and DISGUSTED after seeing this movie. Name the Issues ... First two of these two are the same staff. It is also called the PREQUEL for the original block stallion. Where is Shetton Dam name correct or she can not get her color? In The Black Stallion Returns, we learn that we are Sager Black's chestnut mother and is the gray name Jenny in the film?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it was set in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I was wrong but the first ship was set when the ship was broken in 1940. The timeline is not quite right for me. In addition, she is also a frescian at the beginning of a film that is considered as her father's father ... after more observation it looks like a walk. Ben Ishaq also said that the same character is the same as the previous two. Some people can be a beautiful family picture, but it's a year of my big cinematic disappointment.
