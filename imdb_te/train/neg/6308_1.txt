Complete marks for the content of this film, as a Brit, I'm not aware I was segregated in the US Navy during WWII. This is a very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. However, the film is pathetic, the direction does not exist, the acting wood and the script is just one clich√© after another. Honestly I can say that this is one of the worst films ever seen. I sat down, which was crushed to the end until it was very rare from the start. This could be a great movie, the story of us outside the US is new, unique and interesting. The tragedy is the way the truth is put together. This genuine story, which can change people's attitude, is miserable with a low-budget, badly directed movie. I think it will take some time in the future, one of the major studios and take this theme.
