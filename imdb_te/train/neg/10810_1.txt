I should say only about this film - a musical numbering scene with the role of Francis Capra about Shock's desire to become a gene; Never see this movie. The story is horrible, the acting was terrible (Simon, it's shock!) And I saw the Kapro in two free willy (equally terrible) before I saw the film.
