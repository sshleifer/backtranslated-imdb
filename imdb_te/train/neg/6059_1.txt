<br /> You are a fan of Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - perhaps someone who created his best images. <br /> You've got this POS. He would not logically think that all of this would put any effort as he did with cigarette burns. At least his son made a good soundtrack. <br /> You have to look at what you do not look like an image. Someone seemed to have directed it for one thing. <br /> <br /> I'm listening to his old school H2 / H3 / Fog Soundtrack and is especially awesome at times. <Br / <br /> <br /> There is no one, and he worked well for his films.
