There are awful movies, and there are movies that are very terrible, they have long been considered to be forgotten and unwatchable. Also, add a lot of torture and bad stuff (just not cheesy stuff; you know what I mean) as well as mix. What is the result of bad movies with such obscene things? Why, "the ultimate justice" of course! <br /> "Michelle?" Joe Don Baker is the film's actress, and has been criticized by Joel and Bates in "Mystery Science Theater 3000". At this time, Mike brought Joel's place in the Satellite (but not the same bots), the trilogy of MST3K's second Joe Don Baker movie "Final Justice". Because Joan Don "hate", I removed a lot of naughty stuff I mentioned, but still, though I want to see that episode (and "Michelle")? Why, "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> If you have big boats near you, check out the store for the untapped tape! LOL is done to another user!
