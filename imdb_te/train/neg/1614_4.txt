Steven Soderbergh's revolutionary bio second half on Che Guevara deals with Bolivia's final campaign to export the revolution. To preserve his gentle image of Che's Cedarburg, he focuses entirely on the mass executions that followed the revolution in Cuba and his crazy adventure ("The History of this Failure" in his preface to his Congolese Journal)) in Bolivia's struggle to support the government in Bolivia. This is a disaster and Guevara becomes a final act. <br /> <br /> Soderbergh follows the first chapter to study Guevara's beatical interview with his film Slowly Speaking in the film. James Dean in Eden of Eden by Berniceio del Toro. Guevara has little success in acquiring morals and he soon finds himself and his hungry comrades are swallowed into the heart of the Bolivian Jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog, Aguirre, the wrath of God Soderbergh guerrillas did not use the transformation of the jungle to increase the disappointment. He is more concerned about putting nimbus of his hand over his head than exploring the fear setting in dead enders. There is a Harjogia moment for a rare horse to shatter and shout, but not all of Soderbergh's Myz En Seen flat, sloppy and unhealthy. <br /> <br /> In both of his films, Soderbergh clearly shows that he is a group, so his vision is narrow and narrow. He spends a lot of time building his souvenir as key and his saga's key complaints, especially Fidel Castro, are very poor in his relationships. To make matters worse, he does with slow and violent methods, which always keeps the fire. Knowing that a sweeping change was performed very well with the sweeping style he thinks he was adequate in Eisenstein and Vertov.
