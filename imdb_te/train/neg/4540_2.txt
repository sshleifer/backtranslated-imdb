First, three words: read the book! Truly guys - these secret things demonstrate the difficulties of the true composition. I loved the book and was totally disappointed with the film. It's ridiculous, half-hearted and bad story explained. Novel - first place! - Not to focus on an adventure! It's just the surroundings. In the film, the vision is just opposite to it and the message is back in the back seat! In the end, visual effects have been clearly shown to clarify the power of all organisms and events that took place at the end! They scraped it up! ... I'll never see again!
