Strange Comedy, Sketch Review, which at one time was a vehicle for showcasing radio star Jack Pearl but is now the best introduction to America's The Stooges. Actually, Larry, Curley and Moyle were billed together with comic Ted Hayley, such as Ted Hayley and his three stooges. Supporting actors such as Jimmy Durante (Jean Durante) and Jesse Pitts, however, are only inspired by audiences today, and they do not get much more to praise here. Incredibly loud and uninterrupted, it shows how much distance Hollywood should go to a certain level. **** from * 1/2
