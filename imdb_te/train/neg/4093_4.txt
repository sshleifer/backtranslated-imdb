The plot and characters are laughable and just "plots" and "character" qualify. The biggest problem is dark, outdated, and obscure. Filling the whole film with urine does not help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely hideous and filled with sex and violence. Inequality is very entertaining, one of the main characters tells him he has friends, and he latches the new guy in a minute in the screen and has a whole gang of women on the side. Although he is performing his anti social attitudes by putting an arrow in some poor B ***** d he accidentally sees his own business! But the funk of the blood or the gore flow is more attention than the characters. Perhaps his career was destroyed, but it's not really stupid than zombie. Worth a rental if you like Garry Italian Flicks or are upset for knife and hypnosis or something strange. How can someone sleep in your head with a 2 foot pit and throw it for help?
