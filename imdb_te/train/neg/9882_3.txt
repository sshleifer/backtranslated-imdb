<br /> <br /> A) Bo Derek's unusual, poet-inspired aesthetics. In the film she is casting Catherine Zeta-Jones for her money, and it's really high praise. <br /> <br /> Her nudity is succinct and delicate, but it is enough to see her face. <br /> The Greek island set, with its sun and crystal-blue waters. <br /> <br /> The story is a slimy jerk, the story is missing, the dialogue is impossible and sometimes unexpectedly funny ("You're a woman where he touched you!"), and Peter Hooten's character. Bow plays the innocent character of his character, but again when you have to work with the conversation, the bad actors (in fact, continue to say that the name "Damir" is a big embarrassment) in almost every sentence. Oh, and if the film is set on the Greek Greek island, there is rarely a Greek word to hear - apparently everybody speaks of the whole of English, the old time from older children. (*)
