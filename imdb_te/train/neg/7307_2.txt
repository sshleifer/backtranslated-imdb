This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. The events in it are totally random and less or no. The fact that the sequel is so sickening I can come down with a case of cabin fever (I SORRY SOMRY). I will explain that it is penetrating into a newspaper because it's a mixture of different parts. Eg. Kevin Pancake loving Karate Kid is simply freakishly weird, then there is police who is a little weird and weird, then the drug addict, is the fact that they attacked some random man who clearly needed help. Stupid said that she would go to a plane and her main friend was having sex with her friend girlfriend. After some good old family racism, the rabbit was working on the karine karate kid. It is pretty unpleasant that they can use racist racism in the film. No other reason to enjoy this film unless Eli Roth does not like it. Hatred is a strong word, but it is only necessary to use the only word I have allowed it to use. BOYCOTT CABIN Fever 2 !!!!!
