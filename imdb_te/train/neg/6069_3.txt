It will never surprise you how to take a wonderful actor and never put waste in the image like this. Robert De Niro was one of the best Hollywood actors of all time, but he could not even save the film. In fact, it is very good that his character plays in Cape Fear, which is really good, but I can not stand up when actors do the same in a single movie. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprising in this film, but the story is said to have been written a million times. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his perspective shows his role. <br /> <br /> De Niro is in the film, but if you're a fan it becomes a draw. ) He sees how bad he is. But de Niro can also be viewed as "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas" or "Cop Land" or "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II". <br /> My rating: 3/10
