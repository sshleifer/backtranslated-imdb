I did not think it was absolutely terrible, as some people were doing clearly. This is one of those cheesy horror movies that you can take in the middle of the night when it's sleeping, though it's not a good quality. I believe that acting is not great - for example, Marry MacDonto was considered as Kathy Beck, for example, completely enthusiastic - but the main problem is that most of the plot's does not really understand me. Part of a tour that was part of Beck's (Stewart Mass) and partly honeymoon is part of the work (now it's romantic!) In which there is something with tour caves, in which is a cave associated with a work in a cave?) But he is doing research in the area of ​​preventive medicine A doctor (huh? That connection totally lost me.) In this cave, I imagined that the human bat was a hybrid Wants to be rid bhavincabadutunnadani (look for him in the end, he will be seen by some as a monkey man) and starts a killing spree. Another problem. The first killing was a nurse in the hospital. First, everyone thinks her death is in danger. The second murder is a young girl, who has peeled out her throat. Sheriff (Michael Pattaki) is the same thing as her death nurse (meaning the throat will melt out?) - what's wrong with someone?) And what's with the sheriff? He takes a swipe of alcohol until the scene in the Kathy hotel room, and then does not understand when almost everything is raped, and then everything goes back to normal. It's almost impossible to barely endless, and one of the most irritating theme I've heard in a movie. For all of this, I'm looking at it here. Sometimes pure cheese can be obtained by an hour and a half. Pretty bad, yes - but not as terrifying as some people say.
