I'm not really sure how to comment on this image. Special effects are poor, acting is terrible and if it is plot for everything, it is at the back of the box. I do not think that this film was bad for a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobs !! <br /> <br /> The film could not be saved without a terrible need to pay someone to stand before the camera (or to lay in this case). <br /> <br /> I have pretty much the whole "zombie" effect. Apparently in this film, zombies are running on a couple here and there, and casual is a factor of the ending of a gas station (an interior windshield repair but one with no interior bathroom) is not so simple, zombie film genre is not 'the end'. <br /> <br /> Vampires: Clearly all males are males and all the vampires are females, this is ok to me. Whether vampires do not know how the daylight is in the daylight, or why a soldier vampires stand in the middle of the road, still holding his gun in his heart, and just waiting for the queen, vampires can spill it all the way. The last section in the old nanny does not make sense, and when a hot lesbian vampire asks other hot lesbian vampire, "Did we do the right thing?" <br /> Acting and Special Effects are all of the time. You could almost see the tubes that were sent to fake blood out during the closure of the zombie who ran through the general. General said, did they know where this Kenny Rogers appeared? <br /> <br /> In all, if there is nothing good or a strong desire to waste $ 3, look at the movie. My $ 0.02.
