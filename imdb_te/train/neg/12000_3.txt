The only way to enjoy this film is to bang your head on the wall, some internal bleeding in the brain, your brain cells die, once you officially mentally lose, then enjoy the film * Enjoy the story between king and Stephanie protected. Govinda is amazing in the role of Cobb driver and Brit Girl. The more enjoyable film they have created in the whole of their imagination in India and eventually fall in love. <br /> <br /> When I came to comedy with his ability as a Govinda and an actor with just 3 ratings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the Heatrow of the Union, there is a lot more to do with the plus scene digest. As an international traveler in the 9/11 post, Anil Kapoor painted a lot before he reached the sky to the bridge to explain his true love. But that's the point of the image logic, gravity, physics <br /> See your own danger. At least I know the spots for life :(
