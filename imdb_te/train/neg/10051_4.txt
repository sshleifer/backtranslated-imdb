There are so many interesting themes that I have mentioned earlier because I gave these 4 stars. From domestic violence, sexuality and many bans in it. Outside of Gore I really can not call this horror science fiction. <br /> <br /> It is sad, discouraging, and disappointing. Even though I do not care less than the cheery end, I am really tired of "killing human beings" for every movie. I know you can not get a modern artistic degree without changing the self-hate as a member of the human race, but how are we as a writer / director? Notice that ALIENS HUN RIGHT is bad! If you read right now, if you believe that humanity deserves to die, go out and find a lake and get your hands tired. In this way you will not be around to direct the next book to tell me next or next to tell me that I am entitled to die around to be alive. It's not crazy, intelligent, and boring.
