One day after work, I sat down to relax and move on movie channels. The film came up with the guide and made it interesting, so I initially tuned it. The first 30 minutes were of interest to me, but the lack of performance and slow motion in Jamie Fox I would like to have me to eat food and food during the film. If you want to give any credit for acting in the film, it must go to David Morse, who tries to make the film interesting. In all, a movie does not plan to impress your friends by choosing this one for a movie night.
