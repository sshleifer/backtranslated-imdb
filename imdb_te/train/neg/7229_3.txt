The beginning of the film is introducing peripheral players as important and provides major characters without any material and paper-thin and / or impenetrable back-stories. There are almost no one credible or unrecognizable inspiration for their actions in the film. The plot is rambles and finally has not gone nowhere, the conversation is clunky and unassuming and the director has less sense of how to get the best from his actors. <br /> <br /> New York City has revealed that a mysterious pyramid has appeared and Central Park is an arctic wasteland that does not explain. Yet in this case a lot of people are moving in the general public and this is the lowest concern for the government. <br /> <br /> We are provided with "bad company" in Eugenics, but it is indeed a concept of a density populating with a couple power-tripping servicemen. The whole "Eugenics-Bad" double-entender is heavily handed and never pans completely here. We need to care about the central characters but we never learn about why. The world is neither developed nor fully developed, which comes as a 1-hour, 40-minute falastic rationalization ration for rape. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the animated world created by digital "falling on the ground", I can say that all the other directors in this film have done the same thing with more patches and incredible results at the same time. <br /> <br /> When you spend time watching this film, in my mind, "What's that?"
