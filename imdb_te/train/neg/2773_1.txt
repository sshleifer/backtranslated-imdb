At this time, the sensitive rain was the picture I found the worst in history. This 'blockbuster' came out of Asia. It has a "star" and is John Rice Davis. Swashbuckling he is cast here, the magical flying flight way out of the bad shape. One of the rest does not come out of the junior high school. No clips were lost in the conversation and special effects were often phoned. <br /> <br /> In Asia, somebody has some bucks and some actors wanted to throw money at them. Or it is a director or writer who needs credit. In my opinion, what is this film with which film? <br /> Do yourself a big help and do not look at this picture. <br /> <br /> A funny scene is not accidental. The king's brother appears in the scene. King? A beautiful, old, short-lived Asian actor. (Bad actor) brother? Six feet European. (Even a bad actor) made no excuses for this. They predicted they would not be able to notice that this poor man's jet liar was a vampire brosnan on the right side of the old western film from the forties in a cheap spine "isjun".
