The Jungle Fever is a lot more stylized, normalized, and essentially honest. Wesley Snipes is basically wrong and there is no chemistry between him and Annabella Paario. While the film has plenty of talent, it is mostly wasted, because parts are slightly lower than the decorative roles. Moreover, instead of showing racism for just ugly and stupid things, Spike Lee is a flag of flagship and boring. I've done a lot of cinema but I'm not quite able to finish it, and rarely happens to me.
