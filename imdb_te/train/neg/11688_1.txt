My wife realized that this film was very unsatisfactory. While the plot is going to keep you busy and busy, when you leave the theater, there are a lot of loose ends that do not seem to bother. (Supremo of SPOILERS) Christopher Plummer, a NY bank's wealthy head is a terrible secret secret. Profits from WW II deal with the Nazis and hide evidence of robberies from the Jews and puts evidence in a security deposit box (including diamonds and documents, including the Nazi Swastika) in his bank. Why? If it is ever wanted to be disclosed, why not destroy and destroy the documents that he wrote years ago? And diamonds? Apparently, he does not need them - why keep them away than dispose of them? How did bank robbers find his secret? How Does This Security Deposit Box Be Delivered in # 232? Ace Detective Denzel Washington also show bank records No 231 and 233, but # 232 on the bank. Curious. He was unable to find a time to reckon with a certain fact and explore the bank records. They are threatening to start running for a while while dealing with a red-hot pledge and bank robbers. Wow! Talk about super powers for a detective. <br /> <br /> The bank looters have gone back millions of dollars. They only take the contents of SD Box # 232 with intent to threaten bank president. <br /> <br /> Jody Foster, using his political ties with the Mayor of New York, explains what rational attempt to describe Laines, as a crime writer, or logical explanation for his servicemen with little brains. Several hostages were taken into the bank under the control of the bank. She is now the chief bank robber and he now offers a deal to buy back the documents by hand, but he is not interested. <br /> <br /> My wife Christopher Plummer (Bank President), Denzel Washington (Ace Detective), and Jody Foster, cracked down the frustration of all athletes. <br /> <br /> The last pair I saw was Foster's movie, "Flight Plan", even hard to understand with no meaningless holes. <br /> Now I can hardly persuade my wife to go to the movies. I can not disagree with him in this ... "the burden of money, and the decline of TIME." Stay ahead. A well-designed movie, good actors, and a lousy script.
