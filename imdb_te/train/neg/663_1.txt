Imagine the scenario - you're in the movie theater because it's in the weekend in Washington and it's raining and you're done with the museums. You can look at the Sarah Marshall movie trailer look and you do not need to engage your brain. It's sold out. Options? - Bank job, Brugs, The Leather Heads or Prom Night. You're down to both so you've seen bank job (called suprisingly decent heist movie) and Bruges (again, pretty good). You do not want to look at the clooney or look good from the office in 1930 football uniforms, so you see prom Night Right? Wrong. If you take $ 8.50, go to a stranger on the street and ask him for an interview at $ 8.50. <br /> It's more like comedy than a horror / thriller or whichever is. I do not know if that movie is financing and I laugh or speak as I eventually cut it if they cut me off. Maybe two. As an insult to anyone's intelligence ... my co-starring as laughing as an actor, for acting, they played robots (or maybe dogs), they were more realistic. Detective maybe I've seen so far (Ben Affleck and Hayden Kristansson (I hated what I do not care about spelling his name) you can relieve your title (s) <br /> <br /> So summary is not 'good'
