The prequels and "real" Star Wars trilogy also make a film to pay a great filmmaker ... Mr. Lucas is not a film producer. <br /> The good man into the dark requires a good actor ... Mr. Christensen is not the actor <br /> <br /> The first 60-80 minutes are still overwhelming light saber stunts are boring with only a few pockets but The lack of edge there is always the main characters that exist for the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cock Doo (Christopher Lee) has a very frail role here and jar jar binks silent about the best idea! <br /> <br /> The Chancellor has nothing to do with Jessie and has a large (overlap) order in the film lava themes.
