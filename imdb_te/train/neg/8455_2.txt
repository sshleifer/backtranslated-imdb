"Arah" There is nothing suitable for Kung Fu generation. This confusion with the quality of inspired craziness and Stephen Chow's films is wrong to compare the film. <br /> <br /> First, the fight scenes are not new. Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaw and Jackie Chan are performing here before and afterwards. Fights in intelligent motion pictures need logic. <br /> <br /> Attractive lady chief Soy-yi Yoon attracted the screen but never convinced her physical demands in her role. Jiu Jiang made it easier in "House of Flying Dogs". Marshall Arts works well in Kung Fu films. There is a serious mistake in acting in this skill to perform inexperienced actors (see "Yumi" in "Aumi") If you are not a very talented director, "Aran" proves that it is not Seung-van Ru.
