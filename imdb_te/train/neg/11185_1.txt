Yes, the MTV market is really a way to Duria. The question of how "you should face your problems" began as a young man "comment on everything that makes the audience feel good about their lucrative young life". I loved the Doria all the time and loved it. Now, looking at the "movie", I'm just wondering what's going on here. Daria tells us how to lead life in college? Sorry? Do not do every episode of diarrhea, what you want to do, is it right for you to think about the rest of the sick world in the long run? The whole thing reminds me of the scene in "reality bites", the first time the film channel shows the documentary.
