I remember when I saw this movie, I'm in the sixth grade when this happens. Before I saw it, I heard its original Broadway recording, and I really liked it! But when I look at it, what am I what is he? This movie has lost many tracks from the music for loud tears! <br /> <br /> I really am a big fan of Jean Kelly, but this film is probably even worse than a music he has done so far! The film appears to be more like a Hollywood set than Scotland's beautiful highlands. And the heck decided to remove all of Meg's songs from the movie ?! <br /> When I saw the film, Lerner and Lowe agreed that I was probably surprised: "Have you decided to do this work for our success in this world?" <br /> <br /> Hollywood has the right to say that they are probably mad, even though they have become the biggest music of the film. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie based on music by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this is not one! <br /> <br />
