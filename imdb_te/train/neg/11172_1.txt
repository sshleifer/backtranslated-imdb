In 2002, "I Love Love 80" was the first of a long-line of a strange, harmful television programming that was the first performance mentioned at the end of VH1, an idiot, idiot, offensive and obscure pop-culture mess. At the same time true music-based channel TV remains on TV! I've practically used it to live in VH1 until spring or winter, and by 2002 I'm forgetting it, no worse when there was no such trash in 2002. With a generous curiosity curiosity (I guess what you call) I went ahead and saw the announcements as a complete trash, but I'll see it on the first night of the day. At least I can honestly say that I am not a bit disappointed because my expectations are clear to start lower basement-level. The significance of the show was the lowest of the year in the first five minutes of the 1980s and it was culturally important or not popular (I wanted to see it), but instead a more disturbing stage was really a joke of any comic actors with their comedic skills * All were dead. It is pretty easy now to see why no one ever heard about these idiots before they appeared on the show because they are all terribly inappropriate and curious in their efforts called "humor" because my intestines killed each other. Overall, I have no problem with saying "Love of 80" / less is worse of the denominator, and one of the main reasons I have never seen VH1 ever since.
