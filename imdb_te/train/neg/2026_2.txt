Bill Shatner is such a hype about a game show ... and especially with the right deal or no deal and 1 vs100 in the background. So, of course the new game show that everyone had to tune about what all the fuss. No disappointment! <br /> <br /> You only know what this story is about, and you know that you will eventually overdo it. It's going to sit through the full hour and go to the dentist ... You see your clock in a 10-minute interval, at the last clock to find out if it's just over a minute (but it looks like eternity). So, why do not I switch to the channel? Well, maybe the same reason many other people ... not sharp optimism. <br /> <br /> Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I never thought that this is the same vehicle. Demonstrate William Shutner's talent. My chief complaint is too dark to set up. Seeing it discourages me. You wanted to get a little more excitement, but there was no one. <br /> <br /> Dear Network: People do not see game shows to cure their insomnia. .. They watch the game is excited and shows that you have a good time. Let us all do one favor and lose this treasury.
