The unfortunate mistake of seeing the film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was well shot from the beginning, but I have a last positive comment about this film. Performance is awful, I wonder if the original gogo hired girls? But the reason I really gave this 3/10 is that it's ridiculous and boring is only really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers **. <br /> <span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Seriously. <br /> <br /> In the bus scene: the girl is getting on the bus. But, according to music, the world ends. <br /> <br /> Rolling under the clothes line: Wow, this one really displays the skills of the plot author. After the sale of raw meat and skill. Do not have three sins all at once? <br /> <br /> When walking down the stairs of the mall: Look at one of the girls who run on the steps that follow the dough eating meat, and do not wait. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A half marathon in red paint is dumped by a passing car, flying over the stairs and finishing on the bridge. It is not only, but by the most self-obsessed girl in this suicide film, now the character is sticking for you. <br /> <br /> I would like to think that this film was created a 16-year old and their colleagues. <br /> <br /> But, if you're in a mood of irony and laugh with a few members, think about it.
