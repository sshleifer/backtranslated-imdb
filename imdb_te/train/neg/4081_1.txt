It's not the lowest movie I've seen Peter Greenaway but it's close. The worst thing worse goes to the pill in the book. I have seen 3 films of this director. Like Cook ..., any of his favorite movie flourishes that he has performed are not completely undemanded by the criticism of his material and overall performance.
