This is a very bad movie. The only reason I sign up for IMDb is that I did not complain about this movie. I walked out of a theater or could not stop the DVD, but I almost stopped this one (I should have). But I definitely watched all the way until the end to get down a terrible finish again. Wow, for all his time is to increase his time. I've never seen the first one and it's never seen. Its terrible act with terrible story. Hey let us go check it out looks like a mirror is shining. And when the sad part comes to this movie DVD it will never be completely checked at the blockbuster. So I think it's bad for everyone who saw this waste.
