When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi co-stars, you need to find good horror movies, but it's different, that's how I explain it as an early effort in science fiction. Carloff and Lugosi Two game scientists (Rouk and Bennett respectively) - to a degree of competitors, until Ruk Benet was successful with a performance that proves his great theory. Science here - at least say - a bit rough on the edges (hence science fiction, which is of importance in fiction) but somehow Rukh years ago. "In the pre-historic times, the huge asteroid slammed into Africa, scientists left the substance deposits to call" radium X "- which can be healed and destroyed.The large part of the film is placed in search of asteroid deposits unfortunately in Africa, which Rugby finally created to create a great weapon Unfortunately unfortunately, creating a great weapon But the Lugosi pulls off a character which is pretty good man, although I frankly found him a bit unbelievable - especially during scenes set in Africa. The story itself plodded along a bit, and while it's my attention it does not captivate me. It's really a horror film Ains fiction, and science fiction is in its early stages, so I suppose the image of the need to cut a little slack. It's OK - nothing more, but less than. 4/10
