A teenage young man of the 1950s in the dragstream Holo's Ghost Crisis. This is not a horror or science fiction film. The teens group is concerned about the plot to remove them from their "hot rod" club because they can not rent. Once kicked, they decide to try the old haunted house. The only save grace for the film is the "ghost" (Paul Blissdale in her Shelcher suit) working out of the movie monster played by Blissdell.
