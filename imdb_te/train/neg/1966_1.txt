After reading a positive review from another website, I was mistaken for watching this film. It took me at least 15 minutes to pick up the half an hour B / C I do not want to see anyone. Then another 10 minutes to build up the courage to take it into the counter and actually use real money to rent it. I wanted to pay all of my stress at the time when I saw the film B / C and the reviewing film was a pleasant surprise; No joke! If you can then do it in your luck through the first hour of the film! b / c Until then the film was not turned into horror. This one does not bother with folks, your better looking off "comes of wickedness"
