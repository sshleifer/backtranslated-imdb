It's bad, bad image. I'm a real fencer: Trust me when I say that the accuracy of the accuracy of the film is accurate. This absurd little scene is especially unique when combining moves with the Fencers 80's Pop. The ending is predictable, and there is a bore from the beginning to finish the film. Horrible.
