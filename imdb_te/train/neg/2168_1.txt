After reading another review, I thought the film was actually good. I enjoyed "B" movies, but it was not even classified. Photography in this movie is probably only half way. But it wants to have a lot of compilation. It is very choppy and skeleton. Who has done a terrible job of choosing music and sound. The music is scary, especially for any weather or scene setting. If acting is good, they may have removed the movie. Unfortunately, I've seen romantic flares perform better. If you want to see a "B" vampire movie, check 'Blood Ties'. You'll get more fun.
