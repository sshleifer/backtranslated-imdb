I've now written reviews for MoH episodes, and it's even worse. At the beginning of the curious premises fully credits will be abandoned by the time of roll. People's subjects are never in real life ("Check the dungeon!"), This is your appearance. Besides, it's fun but not entertaining - it's just annoying. <br /> The range of the virus is never shown. I only affect many men, and the situation is very frightening. But then the daughter is away from home and finally dies in her arms. The woman flees north and runs in a few tens. Then, a sort of soul or alien or something looks and will save her (things that you can go to HUH). Or anything else. Then, she is huddling for warmth. End. <br /> <br /> <br /> These directors are in this trip.
