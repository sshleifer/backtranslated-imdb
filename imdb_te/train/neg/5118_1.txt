I am a Christian and I have this film terribly acting, dubious conditions and have completely fairer for Christianity. You can also see the "Remember Titans" and mix Christ with a formula like a formula steroid for at least losing. <br /> <br /> Some of the comments that really do not hurt me in this film will do. The school is in Georgia and is the White Academy School. I do not recognize a black student or player in school. I have acted with white "Christian" academies in the south and were built for reasons other than to replace secession. This film is embarrassing when changing the lives of Christianity and Christ ... How to change the hearts of separation? (Note: I totally liked the token black coach, which was created entirely for the white team and all the black 'giant players. <br /> <br /> Everyone appreciates the Christian critique of the film, compared to other films that are bad acting, If I compare it to another football movie, it's okay Do you have K. Charisma and Power? <br /> <br /> The half-baked Christianity has been shown in lesser sense than the unrealistic end of the christianity If one reads a small book and prays for a complete life change, no one can hear what the Christians say. He wants to sell and he does not need to sell and he does <br /> <br /> I find that the film is inspirational to some people, not much of it, it does not give a true picture of struggle and heartfelt tension, but it is not really a Christian, Not in any way or in story. It has the values, but this film is empty because it is small and struggling in up-to-boot-third world living conditions and / or many churches today in their religion.
