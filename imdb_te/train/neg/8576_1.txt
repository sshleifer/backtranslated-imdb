Solid comedy entertainment with music jokes with a fast pace that includes dialogue with the tropical sound of the humorous and chiller problems. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorere set up the evil villain. The script is all standard mystery image credits-sliding panels, secret paths, thunder and lightning and blow-bats poisonous. Carlof, Lugosi and Lorrey go for heavy levers and clear melodramatics in the era of gaslit. Kai Keys and his team provided great entertainment for people living in the 1940s trying to forget about the horror of World War II.
