Maybe you can not compare, but the wild style and style battles are the original hip hop. Beat Street has many of the original artists of early hip hop, but it is clearly stated that this is their biggest break, and it's nice for some. If you see this as the original hip hop culture you are wrong. It is high and is a Hollywood sauce. See the first two films I mentioned. They have been informed of the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating is low for the movie, but the reviews are mostly positive or rushing. Although story, acting, dialogue and direction are all terrible, this may be what music and dance people like about it. For me, I love to dance but at that time electric hip hop (I'm rounding a new generation of classic hip hop artists now Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc, Jungle Brothers, BizMarmer), and I still beats in this film Not quite like it and that is why it does not work for me. I mean, wild style does not have much story, but music is great and authentic. Of course the difference in taste and it's alright. But I'm worried, this film is much worse than the break-up dancing and some music and I can not rate more than ten to 4.
