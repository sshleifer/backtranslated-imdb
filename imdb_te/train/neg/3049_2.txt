Why such a simple headline? Santa Claus ??? So bland and unpredictable. The movies have tried to make money in the holiday spirit, especially 'Santa Claus Conquerors The Martians', at least it was fun and all stock footage was used ... for some reason I was happy. But this film just screams on the butt in the butt, and all the kids scream. Staying in Santa's place The ghost of his enemy pitch? Can Santa help me from Merlin the Magician? How random is it? Well, after being made in Mexico, some of you can understand how this film is made. I had to accept some of the effects. It's a whole group of madness! However, it still feels like a Christmas movie, with all the problems with the film. Good conquers evil, and thanks to the Martians thanks to Christmas, thanks to every good girl or boy, or perhaps the universe, Santa Claus in the world still plays part of our hearts .. Clearly. So, I think you give one a try, even though you're one of the worst holiday movies of all time ... although it should put a smile on your face any day.
