The real star of this ludicrous story is an excellent technicolor. Visual treat to the eye, film mind and heart failed to stimulate. Initially, I initially regretted the idea that Dietrich and Boer's love had "left" their ability to love. What's down there is a big disappointment. Boer is the only true actor in production and his harassment. Dietrich's amazing wardrobe brings her acting out - sometimes her face is frightening - an unresponsive mask. As a monk, the Laker of the Boer Math (reminiscent of the true story of Chartruus) made him a permanent reconciliation of his fellow saints' reaction and shaky religion when he left his "monastic marriage". Director Boyer feels that he will completely erase his past. However, travel follows the following is very predictable.
