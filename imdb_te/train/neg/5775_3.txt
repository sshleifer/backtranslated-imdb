They showed it on off-network. It's the worst. While B-movies are shown on Saturdays in science fiction network, they have a very bad fall. Acting is fulfilled. The plot and writing are very sub-standard and the motion is very slow. Every minute film in the film is part of the film they're wrapping things before credits - the maximum level of the film, not the denum. In addition, large portions of the cast will look older for the age they are in the age group. The whole thing is speculative, boring and not worthy of being watched. Save your time. It's also worth taking time to see it for free.
