The problem with the "Megis of a Geisha" in the book is that it had Japanese surfaces, but under the surfaces it was the idea of ​​an American person. Looking at this book is a great ballet wearing great dresses, sequences and costumes and are made by the Girnar animals wearing in the costumes? Not about Japan or real geisha. This is the story of some American men's false opinions about Japan and Geisha filtered by their own ignorance and misconception. So what's this picture if it's not about Japan or Geisha? Is it pure fiction as many people say? Yes, but why can it be an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There are many opportunities. A puritanical hang-ups assumes a culture of sex that does not have sex. Sex is natural and simple. How does sex work in this film? Right. It's messy. The closest thing to the romantic scene in the film is that she cut her nose and dropped her cockpit on the toe on the thumb of a man trying to mount her for five seconds. <br /> Does anyone in the movie have sexual pleasure? Nope. A character is said to be dazzling but what we see stops her girlfriend, because she does not like to be dirty. <br /> <br /> When she was auctioned by Cherry, did she enjoy poetry for the first time by some old cooper? Nope. She is a cold slab of meat in a secluded block. Of course she is not supposed to enjoy it. What I mean about this film. Why did she not give her a joy? <br /> <br /> The chairman of Mumah is Seyuri's secret patron and behind her auction of virginity. He made a bid and won himself. Nobu did not even bid. Why the chairman get his fingers on his naked body, winning her with old covers and reeking of old man stink? <br /> <br /> "Being behind Mameha, the chairman of the company Sayira's Geisha is lending money." Dr. Mameha The chairman sold Sari's sexual favors to Sari's gentlemen, which the chairman could earn some money from her chairman was not her patron, but she struck her! <br /> Yes, this film is gorgeous but very attractive The voice of the film, the soul, the soul and the core is completely American and male under the surface of the image of the ill-fated Japanese image of the ominous mystery <br /> <br /> Some of the differences between Japan and Moga: <br /> <br /> Japanese chaos <br /> <br /> The Japanese Japanese ice cream is hard on seasonal rituals are. Rounded snow is definitely a summer treat. Mog smoked - Chiraro buys Chuyo, a cure-blossomed by the younger seer fairy Suzuka Ogo, during treatment. The idea made my whole body shakes cold. <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Trained and skilled entertainers. <br /> <br /> Japan Wind Chime - Thanks to the wind for listening to the sound used in the summer, the Japanese feel cool. Mog air chime - a door hour! <br /> <br /> If a person in Japan is standing in front of another house and makes sounds in the air, they will be considered a lunatic. <br /> Japan ?? Focus on human relationships, group based Mog ?? <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance? Refined elegance. An almost geometric and mechanical precision. Mog Dancing ?? Martha Graham is not out of LSD-wearing a very-sacred Japanese funeral mask. Will Geisha perform in a ramp on the spot that looks like a strip club? Ha ha ha! <br /> <br /> The Japanese House of Fire was a strip club that they did most of their research in the fire. Creating or firing such a terrible threat in society will also be killed. Those wooden villages, towns, cities destroy hundreds or thousands of homes and many are being killed. Mog house fire - a great set for a fighting scene but there are zero branches and out-of-control fire keeps surprising because it does not need to. Technically, the film ended here, because Sai was so small and again with her sister who never heard of her. <br /> <br /> There is a need to boycott both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall enough. Movie sticks.
