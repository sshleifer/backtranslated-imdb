This film is one of the most awful films ever made. How can Jon Bon Jovi star in a movie? He is not a singer, actor, but he kills vampires with his guitar? And about the terrible plot? Oh my God this film really sucks. The ultimate vampire Ari Jowar (Blade) is a vampire queen who surrounds the vampire army, but only 4 vampires remain when the "fantastic" sliders come! What happens with 10-15 vampires? They run out in the sun ??? And when "Grand Finale" Bon Jovi wounded a gun on his head ??? It really is "not". Not a single vampire killed by A Shotgun in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes? It's realism!
