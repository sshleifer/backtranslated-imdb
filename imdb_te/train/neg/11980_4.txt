<br /> <br /> The opening match is a waste of the Lazio of Doom, but they are the only way to be eliminated by demolition is double-DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect would have been put in overtime. Kerry von Erich, I-C Champ, here ruined. The perfect job place is the third ppv in the row. Remember, he was always lost. <br /> <br /> The second match is good, perhaps the best for the night. Ted DBAS and The Undertaker are fantastic, but Jim Neidhart has one of his WWF headlines, and Bonnie is suppressed. The first tradition kept on a new heel was coca B. Weare (Remember Big Bassman and Yokozuna?). This was a reference to Bret Hart's singles career, as he returned from the two-to-one and almost avoided the match. He and DBC participated in a wrestling clinic, and the match's place was to forget that DBS was a boring fighter with Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Although its members are the first team to survive, and the second from the 'survival of four survivors from 87), this match is not squash. It is the night's longest match, and Jack repeats his '88 show, which he dominated by four men alone. I think he may have actually pulled off a desperation. These days, the match would have ended the other way. <br /> <br /> It is also the most awesome of the SS SS matches. Perhaps the lesser-than-expected wrestler, Tito Santana put the Warrior on the night of inspirational wrestler, war paintings and Boris Zukov, Takaka, and the ultimate survival competition. It's so strange to look at him as big, then go back to his normal career. Sgt. Slaughter also did well, leaving Wolcuff and Bushwalkers, but not surprising. <br /> <br /> "The small Undertaker is cool for the first time, but Tito Santana reminds me of this.
