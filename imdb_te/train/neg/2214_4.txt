This film is not exactly brutal, but it's very bad. Acting is really beautiful! If you do not know such things, it's a pretty darn good job of jeffrey combs like mad scientist, which is his special kind: D. Bill Force .. Well, I'm not sure why I'm in this movie. He's a very good way for this kind of thing, and his character is not exactly demanding. I rented on the strength of these two leads, and I was not really disappointed. I mean, heck, it's a picture about a half man / half shark. It's not Shakespeare's folks. Apart from the plot, filled with holes, and I want to see that poor dialogues and cinematography also want many things. The shots are trying to look "cool", but it's coming off the scene or the plain cheezy off the scene. Many times when they have a good conversation, it is cut and the person will stay away from premature before releasing the line. This is very bad. But if you're a Zaffer Combine fan, it's a worthwhile one. He gives a great show and he can do with the character. Forsythie is not bad, and either male lead. Heck if I can remember her name though. Bottom line, I would not waste your time otherwise.
