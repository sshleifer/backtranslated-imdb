Well, if I tell you that I can easily compete with Spiderman or Batman films, I'll lie. However, it is very appealing to moral value. I bought the first VHS when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite. My wife and I were interested in Robert Townsend and came from when he used credit cards to his first film, "Hollywood Shuffle". True, he needed to make technical expertise and imagery more credible, but his films are still fun. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man Urban offers a hero with contemporary feelings. If I had superheroes, I always thought that they did not present the same scenarios as described in comics. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man is a real hero with real problems: the division of cars, the use of children for distribution of bad neighbors, local drug trafficking. The scope of his mission remained perfect in society. James found out that Earl Jones's "youthful" performance was entertaining, and he had a neighboring reaction to the newly discovered powers. Without his input of course, he did not take a full-length agenda to lined him up. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is weak, the film is imaginable, bad acting and continuation, but it is # 1 with my kids. Robert Townsend works to talk to "home". <br /> <br /> He'd really be honest actor / producer / director, he was really there, but his efforts were laughable. <br /> <br /> Picture, I find amusing: Total War amount with Simon, no one bothered to call the police? Moreover, do you know the mother and the father that their son will see a fight from a window? My mother is going to collapse my toe and thumb from the toe. The father loads his gun. <br /> Let it rent and check it out. It's good to see that fans like Simbad, Luther Wandros, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Cane look at once and look good.
