Man, I really wanted to like these shows. I'm hungry for some good television and I appreciate TNT to give these "opportunities". But, sadly, when I come to the cinematic Stephen King I am in a minority that I guess. As brilliant as King's writing, the irony is that it just does not translate well, just big or small screen. With some exemptions (much less), the King experienced experiences are not painted with the same effect when reading. Many have disagreed with it, but I have acknowledged that they were the best-remembered King Story in their best hearted hearts, but they were the tender memory of what they read. The reason is simple. The average King Story story takes place in the mind-scene of characters in the story. He gives us the shortcomings of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes broken or vague views. In short, the king takes the reader places where you can not put a penis camera. As a viewer who views the king who painted the picture, we remain with information that is less accessible to the reader. This is not too far to say that they can be a role in a King Story reading, while at the same time it is limited to the small audience of the same character. As long as King is writing, Hollywood attempts to shoot everything that comes out of his word processor, regardless of what they might do. I do not condemn the filmmakers that I'm trying to do, but it takes fantastic talent and excitement to remove the worker Stephen King's adaptation. This work leads into gold, or some mystical Zen mastery. Oh well, good luck next time.
