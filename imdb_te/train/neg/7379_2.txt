What was Steven Seagal thinking? I love Seagull first. I love his movies from the mid-2000s. His earliest thing is the best in the genre. But it did not live with its amazing name. Attack Force (with Prophet Marshall Lawson [Seagal) is considered to be a foolish action film with Seagal, a single liner ass kicking form. However, we have a criminal mystery, with little or no action on the political thriller. Seagal is always in the shade due to his weight. I can not follow this story. They change to superhumans when they take medication. What's happening in this film? Seagal's dubbing is a disgrace, a move and an insult. Why is man dub? The story is terrible. Seagal asks for a backup even though he has an army with him, and a joyous fight scene has brought me a 2/10 view of the scene where the girl is facing a seasonal camera. "A Two Way Street of Revenge" Seagal says in this film ... Well Revenge Forget Steven, you need redemption!
