An unconscious picture. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a thief for money. Then they double him. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the dead men's wife, and he moves with her without knowing he is a murderer. Then when she realizes she kills "unexpectedly". Then, in a walking tall kind of heroism, he gets a double revenge on the gangsters who cross him. The first issue, admitting to being assassinated by appointment, drifter loses all feelings of sympathy, goodness, and heroism. We can not accept him any good and the result is not a moral center. We can not care about that kind of person. And a high-profile female woman who runs a mission for homeless, as well as homelessness with the homeless people on the couch (as well as her well-done by bringing sheriff - Kary Wuherer in eight league feros) apparently weakened by the state after her husband's death). And, when he learns, what does the man do to her? She grabbed herself in her home (like all the houses, such as she did not open out of the house) to go with her. Stoo- PID. However, George Wendh was a stupid one in the role of a blatant looting. Director Stuart Gordon did very well with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
