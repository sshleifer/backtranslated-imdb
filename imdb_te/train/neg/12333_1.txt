Un bleeping- believable! Meg Ryan also does not see this her typical pert lovable self, which usually makes her excruciating elegance acting schtick forgive. I believe that she is the producer on this dog. Plus Kevin Klein: What type of suicide tour is in his career? Whoosh ... Bangy !!! Was it eventually directed by the person who made the Big Chill? Hollywood style - to be replay of Jonestown. Wooofff!
