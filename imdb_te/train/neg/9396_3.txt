Radar Men from the Moon is a pretty distinct fare of the 1950s serials. Special effects are very inexpensive, lunar rovers are obviously the Second World War surplus jeeps plywood, and so on. Acting is just the same. It causes the children to be motivated, and I believe that I have driven them. According to today's standards, it's boring, cheap and bad. Stock footage is high in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.
