Slow and nice pictures have changed one by one, sometimes changing the music (you know Bijor), for the first 75% of the film. If you do not have enough sleep, it's a good time. <br /> <br /> But, in the last 20% of the director, the decision to take reincarnation, re-incarnation, or a number of S & M images: "Spiritual lovers" cutting each other's bodies with knives. This made me very disturbing and actually changed the general impression of a mixture of abstract art and images of modern Japanese mystery. <br /> The operator and director are great, but weird. <br /> <br /> "
