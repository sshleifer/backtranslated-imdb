Plot: A romantic couple decide to engage some extra wedding hijinks in an elegant car. <br /> <br /> They are ignorant of the rural area until they are rescued by the officers who are compromised. It's the whole movie. There may be some conversations here and there, but do not mind anything. It should be clear now that this movie is not just pointless, but actually physically painful to see. <br /> <br /> Two British best up-and-coming actors (now dead when one of them suffered) was only added to horror. <br /> <br /> Ian Charleson is a very good Oscar-winning 'Chariots of Fire'. Remember him for that role, and try to pretend that this particular celluloid indictment has never happened.
