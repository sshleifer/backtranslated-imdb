I have nothing yet, but it's awful. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others are part of this insulting chaos. If some actors do not intend to question their sexuality, maybe they should not be further away from these films. At least one of the things that made me seem to have appeared. My opinion. Let's see what the idea is about to cut off from the film. What's with the minds of actors who made this film? The hedonistic view of the thinking process of the directors and the hedonism. As I mentioned before a humiliating confusion. It's also not funny. As Ebert says about Calgary's film with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, it's not a good story and it's not a good romance. YESHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
