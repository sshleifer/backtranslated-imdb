As I was looking fast and furious again, but with different actors and little different plots I felt. I say the cars are very good in the movie. So, if you like fast cars, this movie can be fun and entertaining. I also enjoyed seeing from Nadia Lizards Days of From Our Lives. She was a good singer, but very bad people gave her such lousy songs to sing in the film. I understand songs about cars; You are not exactly on the radio here. Since this is a Hollywood movie, you have to give this story a little Lee way, but in real life I can not come across a hot girl like Nadia Bj√∂rlin, who can run a race car, engine, and a lead singer. <br /> On the other hand, a nut ready to place 25 million bets in the car race. But Natasha stood in front of the finish line and was finally cool when moving on to Michael. <br /> Final Verdict: The film is related to car freaks. So, if you like fast cars, I would recommend this.
