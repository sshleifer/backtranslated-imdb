I recently saw this film at the 30th Thought Gothenburg Film Festival and I have always been unfortunate to be honest. Do not get me wrong, funny and entertaining bad images (eg "Manaus? Hans of Fate") and then awful bad pictures. (Which comes into the second category). Cinematography is unbelievable and not a good way. The cameraman deliberately considered everything (except for an inappropriate nipple shot), lighting was something between "a man walking around with a light bulb" and "already existing". The actors were not as bad as the soap actors but as bad as the porn stars, and each line gave the impression that the whole surprise came to them. The only ransom feature is the look of the masked killer, "Friday 13'Th" from a classic look La Jason Vorhees. The plot is very poor and is worse. I would recommend this film to anyone as an illustration of how to make a horror film or a sleeping need for sleep.
