It's probably the worst act I've ever seen in a movie. And what's with casting. The prominent woman in the film has a nose de-figurator and is almost impossible to see at any time without rectifying her nose. You can go to your local grocery store on Sunday afternoon and look for more than 50 qualified, best women. I made a bad mistake to rent this movie because it had a "cool" DVD case. This film will look like some class project for a multimedia student group of local technical colleges. The movie spends the time I spent with the public access television ... at least some of the special effects are good and the people there are attractive to anyone you see in the movie
