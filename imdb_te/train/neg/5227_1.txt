........ And that's a very bad one !!! How long was this train-wreck? 14 episodes or anything ?? <br /> Now I've purchased the "Serenity" episode from Amazon Anbomad. It's my first purchase, so free. <br /> <br /> I do not really comment on acting, because I really guess this work, many new people who have earned the job are still down. At least I have never seen them before any type of mainstream, theater or TV. If I did, I forgot them easily. <br /> <br /> But the special effects are completely terrible. True, this is definitely not a multi-million $ $ project, but the original Star Trek did better than this & thirty-five years ago. I got a laugh of bad guys (reapers or something like) chased hilarious looking firefires, especially with smoke out of the engines looking something like a big model rocket. During chase after the road runner, I'll eventually travel to the top of Wiley Coyot. <br /> <br /> Modern jet / rocket engines do not do those bad things. <br /> <br /> It's not even the worst. <br /> <br /> Wild West type shoot shoots I'm really wondering if I'm looking at a science fiction film or a Jean Autry one. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, regardless of the hype ... I did ... all 80-something minutes of disaster called "firefly".
