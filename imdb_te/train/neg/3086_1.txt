I once considered "The Stoned Age" the worst film I ever did ... I was wrong. "Hoggoblins" surpassed it in every way I imagined and some I did not. In the "The Stone Age," I hated the characters. I hated actors in "Hoggoblins" ... and everyone participated in creating this disaster. I do not add teaser in this movie, I'm not that cruel. I could not control such disobedient innocent people. In fact, discussions about stories about the film are vague and destructive. <br /> <br /> In the film, the words used to describe the film: I do not ask you, another from a movie lover ... Please, from one man to another. There is no watch for your own integrity and intelligence. Destroy any copies that you come across.
