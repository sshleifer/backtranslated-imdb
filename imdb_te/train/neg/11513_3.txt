* Have spoilers. <br /> <br /> I am going back to the film. I acted as Madonna. I spent a week in theaters. I know that I got very bad reviews. I did not expect a deeper and thoughtful test of class, culture and sexuality as Italy was original. <br /> <br /> Madonna continued her twelve minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> Madonna is the husband and housewife who has suffered from Hannah (who is as bad as Madonna), showing some really face expressions). Adriano Gianni's ship's first companion, Madonna character acts as a slave and insulting in every scene they have. Why is she such a bitch to him? Because the plot is intended, the tables change when two are transformed into a deserted Mediterranean island and he will teach her a lesson. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> "Out of sweep" is a silly, simple, superficial image. End. Madonna is usually a wooden display. There are many moor scenes: Madonna singing and dance in Madonna Gioni's demeanor, a Phantasy scene with Madonna, and he kicks her into a bland and her butts. Guy Ritchie made his "stylish" editing ridiculous here. In this movie there are some of the worst dialogue I've heard in a mainstream film in many years. Ending is unsatisfactory and unsustainable. It basically meets "The Blue Lagoon" "overboard" nausea of ​​the former minus and the latter's sense of humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> Madonna's ego is very big, competing actress. Give Madge for yourself and yours. This is not her worst image. That distinction still belongs to "Shanghai Surprise". She has not done anything worse yet ... yet.
