The caveman is the biggest load of the worst ever wasting my time watching. This program, based on GeoCo commercials, is less fun, then 30 seconds for GeoCo. Even after the dentist went on, it was hard to make a caveman with white teeth to make it difficult to predict. The show has a chance to get a funny series if it has a cast from commercial performances, thus having a secular performance in the self-exhibition. Perhaps it is possible if the authors are identical to GeoCo ads, instead of pilot's good story. I gave this presentation 10 to 1, and I prefer to keep zero from 10, but that's not a choice. In this program I am praying for death quickly, and I must give 5 parts less before I die of the deserving death.
