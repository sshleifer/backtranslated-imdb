I have seen many movies in my life, but many are not so bad. It is a movie, which makes fat people fun, is a real story, bad actors are not funny and more. Is not the movie you want to see? <br /> <br /> I assume that the filmmakers are genuinely and creatively trying to find, but 12-year-olds seem to have no cinematic skills. Funny parts, such as the pies in people's faces or the breaking of wind, are fun. If you like the humor of your choice, it's a picture for you. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money in this movie!
