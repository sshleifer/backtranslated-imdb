When you see a little man, you spend time trying to disclose its run time. If this film is a comedy it is not a good sign! It will laugh at you! But you? Maybe not. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the little man is its feeling - the most ridiculous (also cartoony comedy), so loud, hard and jokes above the kick, <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> "This is not true but it is not necessary for a dumb plot." If you see a baby with a GROWN MANS FACE, think about it, are not you at least bit skeptical? Calvin Diamond is very worse How can I find him in a nearby shelf instead of a random woman's handbag? How can I not find a qualified doctor as Calvin's grown? What can I mean seriously? <br /> <br /> You may be saying, "It's not about the plot but laughs about it" Well see the thing here, the little man hardly any laugh and just make the dumb ass plots stand all the more. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a confident brothers comedy with a plan suspended platform, be sure to stick to white chickens because at least some laughs.
