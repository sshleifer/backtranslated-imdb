Guy Ritchie's great work was abandoned, shot dead, shotgun, shot dead, shot dead, cut off, spitting, punched, sodomized, and abused by the horror of abuse and madonna. Her performance was a memoir of the graduate from the All Gore School of Dramatics and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie made some effort to make this remake, and if you exclude the views of his wife, this is the best film. I should have the best acting job, his wife comforting guy that is good enough to re-act for her performance. If you have an opportunity to cut off your toenails for 89 minutes or see clipping on your toen ... go for extended pedicure.
