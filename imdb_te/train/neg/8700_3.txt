I really do not try to do action horror when ConCard / New Horizons did when they made Carnosaur 3, or hope the film was flat-out crazy from start to finish. Also humor in the C3 is funny because it is bad. 'So bad is good' style is definitely a high water mark. If you enjoy the bad things in the trash, it's for you.
