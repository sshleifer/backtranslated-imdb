<br /> Spy Who Shared Me Much Overrated And Over The Hype Sequel. Mystery's international man came out of blue. Some people heard a lonely star. But it was fantastic, advanced humor and plenty of humor, always kept in good taste, and had a brilliant cast. <br /> <br /> I saw this film the first time I thought it was very funny, but only after watching it twice or three you will see all the flaws. Acting, but Heather Graham did not appear. Her performance is not very convincing and she is not as good as Liz Hurley's first. Those characters who flourished in the first one (Scott Evil, Number 2, etc.) can not listen to background and do not have many stand-alone scenes. <br /> <br /> In particular, I hated that they completely ignored some scenes from IMOM. When they initially killed Vanessa and sat down in Basil, she knew that she was a parent. What is that point? They killed the first number 2, and now they are bringing him back without any explanation. I thought it could be a spy, I do not think any characters have a gun. <br /> <br /> The new characters are very unpredictable. The whole mini-me `makes my size fun 'joke gets older very quickly. Fat Bastard is just a lump of excitement for macro-out humor. There are two or three good jokes in total. The remainder are IMAX or rehearse from IMOM. <br /> If I were the first film of this series, I would have been easier on it. But in this series, a series of dry leaves began, and then dropped to the humorous level of humor. I mean, if you do not see the movie before it, the Spy Who Shared Me is a final disappointment.
