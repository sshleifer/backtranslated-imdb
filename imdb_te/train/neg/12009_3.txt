I have a video of the subject. And my fourth attempt was to see the whole movie without sleeping. It is slowly moving, and the thought of the Atlantic platform, which is revolutionary at the time, is now just bigger. Besides Conrad Weedt, the rest of the cast is pretty unforgettable, and it's really interesting to take action in the end. <br /> <br /> When water started spraying a long time, in one case, I woke up. No one can capture a cigarette like Conrad Weedt. He does not split it between his index and the middle fingers like the low humans. He was holding his fingers while showing us old-fashioned wheat. There are some scenes in the film, where the smoke flows to the sky in a dark background and is very artifact. But smoker about this film is smoked when you smoke.
