<br /> <br /> Hurt Locker is the most original shoot of the soldier's rotating team (most part), which hired the movie at Netflix after winning all the Oscars. Iraq. The film Will Will James, a careless soldier, receives a solution that can take care of his own aperture and bombs. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be in my opinion the plot and direction of the film. Unlike other films such as Black Hawk Down, the film did not have a clear plot. The film seeks to do more attention to the characters and their attitudes towards the war. Biggl does a job that focuses on characters, but there are many points in the dialog that seems to drag. The Hart Locker is 131 minutes long, but it looks like a 3-hour film. <br /> <br /> A scene from the film is a complete snapshot of the horror and motion pictures, particularly through the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought this movie was OKA but I replaced it instead with 7 instead of 6 because it was a major disappointment at Oscars to win the best film. I thought this film could be very good, the private Ryan lost the best movie, but it's better than this film. Another popular mention is Black Hawk Down 2 Oscars. <br /> If you are looking for combat actions, hire a black hack down. This film will be forgotten in one or two years.
