HAH! So the film is going into "Next Action Stars". <br /> I 'm the first 10 seconds (about the movie? I mean, come on! See those titles!? One evening this movie (or "TV" "We can not bear to see the episode and the whole thing) in a watch watch series as boys like Las Vegas for girls once in the show. No, it's not because it's a great script, but the film's reality, acting, scripting, and just about everything else, is a good idea, can not Las Vegas (or CSI recall?) The rest of the group is easy to change without any complaint I can say that the producers can not give the film the quality of the film, and this is the ending, well, Joel Silver actually produced some of the best action-film films (Die Hard, Matrix 1, some name) It's just a Joel Silver movie to sell the movie because it's obvious Alanu a desperate attempt to conceal the staff really made it.
