The film may have weak production values, but it's very good. Special effects are gross and well suited. My favorite character in the film is to act as Chrissy starring Janmillie Brady. She also has a super hot and good nude scene. Robert Prichard is the happiest and the other members of Mumbai's leader. The film tries to make a point by saying that it is actually a waste of nuclear waste. 4/10 fair comedy, grass out film.
