To make it better, the image is lousy. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> To the camera man The camera seems to have thrown to the camera camera. Perhaps they have only one camera. It gives you a sense of volleyball. <br /> There are scenes with persistent, contrary, scenes. After they make a 'split screen', it is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> When flat, everything is flat, it's ridiculous. These people should learn how to balance the camera. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> If I am an SS agent, I will sue the producers. Marx was seen as the Brothers with radios and guns. Sutherland is in his '24' mode - I'll watch it for free. Eva Longoria is a bit shorter and a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> Unlike Douglas with the President's wife, I could not see the real plot. Karunanidhi never said why he tried to kill the press. I do not look like a rat as a maze, run in his life in the tunnels of the purpose of a building by the president of the United States. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This picture is proof. I like the 'big screen'. I am a kid. I'll go on so many more movies. What is the matter of Hollywood, who made the most chic Flix, forget how to do a real picture? If I had a theater, I'd start running old movies. Good actors and good stories - good cinematography. <br /> <br /> This film is a dog. Do not waste your time or money. I'm casting this film 'zero! Douglas is not enough for this role. I can see his age, but him just a wimp carry this off too.
