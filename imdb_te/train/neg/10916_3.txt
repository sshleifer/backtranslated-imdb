I will see how they will praise this film for the domestic audience. For outsiders, with no selfish interests, it does not make much sense. The Germans are portrayed as inequalities and Russians. The supposedly romantic perspective is superfluous and a distraction. It is not unexpected for him to see that a young man loves a lieutenant. As the end of the film says, this promise has passed over me, and she does not marry her. I said that the Germans were portrayed as idiots and cited in Chase in marsh. Several hundred German troops advanced, the Russians pushed into the marsh. So the Russians hid and the Germans stopped at the edge of Marsh and was just listening there. I think I do not want to wet their boots, but I'm sure an officer ordered 20 or 30 people to search for Marshall. But that story ended. Furthermore, the Germans did not enter the grass hiding on the grass and did not fire in the ceiling. In the garbage some soldier threw a grenade into the grass and did not climb a ladder to climb to the top. <br /> <br /> Some critics have seen that I finally shouted. Why am I wondering You know that this little band will end up and they do not have any heart-pulling in it.
