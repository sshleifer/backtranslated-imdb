I can not say this movie is bad, but it's not good. I guess something better but I guess Hame Apeke High Coune better than this. It's totally old. At each stage of the film, I hoped for a few twists and what could I get? The girl is gray and wins her aunt's love. <br /> While engaged, they must take permission for every little action they make. They are also cowardly after many meetings. I thought the aunt was more cruel than that. All her cattle she is mad. <br /> Hey, we have children too, but we can not see them and our eyes do not always have tears. This film is a dream. Happy family, a cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her. Hook is the poor bride's father in Anupam Kher and now it is vice versa. I know Mohanesh Behl has acted in this movie. Anytime I'm wasting my time. I give a 2/10.
