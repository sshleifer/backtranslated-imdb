<br /> <br /> I love this film, but they are wasted in the film. <br /> <br /> Do you think that this coincides with the trash? <br /> <br /> Debra Winger just phone it up; Dennis Quaid and Arlis Howard satirical images. Some people thought it was deep. Well, if you liked "Breaking Waves", you probably would like it. I hate both. 3/10
