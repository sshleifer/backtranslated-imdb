There is not much to say about the Las Vegas Lady. It is dangerous enough, but a little more than 70 is a frustrating haste image. While it is working hard, this film is not so sexy or sexy. This storyline is repeated about the old tired casino robbery story. Except for the Las Vegas Lady, I think I made a theft plot by a 3 year old. There are three women in this plan Circus Sikas is the only unwanted and simplified viewing out of the building, to be a waitress, in the first opportunity to scatter her cover and to keep her cleavage outside. That's pretty cool. Complex, huh? Apart from Stella Stevens and her above-mentioned chest, other women in the theme do not particularly remember. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Stevens does not spoil the film, his involvement in the film is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun battles ever made in the film. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. It's not 70 I always have fun and have some nice shots in 1975 Circa Las Vegas feel it. But is the image too dull to rate anything more than 4/10 ?? And that's probably daunting. Finally, the Las Vegas Lady is a waste of some perfectly split.
