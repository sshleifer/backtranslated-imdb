You will get the reward. It's amazingly wrapped. The box is located from the best timber and specializes in small details. It is beautifully handwritten with beautiful paper, handmade and artist's most talented hand. The whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace. <br /> <br /> You can cut the rib and tear the paper, open the box and see nothing. It's TOYS. <br /> <br /> This film is not without its point and purpose: the war is not good. Well, not the original! Morally it is embarrassing to say clearly. And that weak insight, especially the war-fight figures, is a bad thing, different from the heroes, which require the outstanding climax, and the movie will kill the war using innocent dolls. <br /> <br /> Previously, yes, it is a sight to see some amazing, wonderful pictures. These sets are intuitive and cinematic skill that captures colorful scenes. But the pictures are cool and mentally clean. Like the screenplay, the image's appearance is enjoyable and sometimes beautiful and obscure. It is an image that wants to praise the wonderful and special things toys, yet it shows that they are a world creations empty and cool. The film is fun, sort of Moros, but humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, a troubled descendant of a toy making empire, touches him in his announcement-lip shock, which appears to be the only alien to the bizarre, cold-built world he lives. In fact, the film that is scattered throughout is trying to blur the film in contrast to the storyline and tasteless sexual innuendo child. To work or make sense in this movie, you need to set an Oz at a very long distance from Kansas, in its own universe. Every time the jokes make us reality, the picture of the dolls is clearly a clear understanding. <br /> It is said that director Barry Levinson's pet project is ten years old. Suffering is clear why he faces trouble. Like most pet projects in the end (Radial Murders, RADIO Flyer & Battlleepy: The Great Examples of Earth) It is a dark spot in the eyes of the filmmaker. Perhaps Levinson directed the TOYS often over his head and eventually did not get any fresh attention when he was not in soundstage. He did it to die. <br /> <br /> Many figures in the picture are clumsy, mechanical, air-up macroscites. So this is also a picture.
