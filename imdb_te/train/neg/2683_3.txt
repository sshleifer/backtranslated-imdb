Have you ever wondered what happens when the characters from Beverly Hills 90210 are thrown in a Thai jail? This is the Midnight Express for MTV Group. That's OK, but the story is poorly executed. The new plot has twists, poor conversations and unresolved issues. This little picture does not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends. Plot line related to the potential spoiler and imminent chaos - the fax tense moment was filled when the hotel staff had no room and tried to kick them out. (This moment is suddenly played on the same majestic and gravitational when arresting at the guarantee). Then the same hotel employee something-found and a big city in Bangkok, Mind you, I'm there- and if a couple of free Mai Tais issued 40 years in prison, evidence against the girls. C'mon. Instead rent for another day in heaven.
