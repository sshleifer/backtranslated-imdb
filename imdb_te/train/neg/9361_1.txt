I'm thinking when I see this preview on TV, "Well it's a good shepherd movie" but it's not. That's not scary! Acting is good, the plot is terrible, the military bid is just plain stupid. I think SCI-FI channel could do better than this worst band. The film sounded like a wolf that was transformed into a wolf, but instead he mentally moved, and some of the doctor turned the voice. If you read my other reviews on other movies, all are positive, but this story is terrible because it's not. 10 is the maximum one. I'm sure you all expect some werewolf image, but I bet you did not expect this. Loch Ness Beyond is better than this movie, heck, any film on science fiction channel is better than this film.
