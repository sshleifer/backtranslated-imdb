- When the local sheriff was killed, his wife took up and decided to clean the town. Everyone in the town is not happy with what she is doing. When a curfew is ordered in the town of Sharif, the owner of the local saloon (also a woman) hires a murderer to care for the sheriff. Saloon owner does not know that sheriff and killer fall in love. <br /> <br /> If you have a very interesting feeling, what is going to happen when you mix with poor performance. There is a good movie trying to get out of nowhere. With more powerful hands or big budgets, Gunslinglis entertained the role of women in the Old West. <br /> <br /> Ganslings is a sloping mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> There are many things wrong with this film: acting abilities, stilted and unnatural dialogues, sets. But the big culprit editing. I'm surprised at the scene many times I start with summer actors (and horses related to that topic), and Carman shouts "action". The best view of the two riders on a horse standing next to a building. Suddenly, as they struggle for several miles, they leave and run around the corner. Or, take the example of people who travel unnoticed throughout the town. <br /> <br /> When a few good actors do not work in Carmen, one person enters the building and the second will go out of the city to hit his horse. While nobody had great actors, Beverly Garland, John Ireland, and Alison Hayes were all able to perform well. <br /> In Gunslinging, they do not give too much to work. <br /> I have now seen MST3K and MST3K non-MST3K versions. I strongly recommend that I go to MST3K route.
