<br /> <br /> When I first liked it, Certainly the special effects are technically excellent - but they are not worth watching. It looks more like a cartoon. Okay, I agree that 80% of the Chase scene would be - but fighting with Mr. Smith? This is very clearly animated. <br /> I can accept everything. I can not accept, but the reaction components are worse. <br /> <br /> Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I learned for a speech that never went away and nothing suggested. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the existing small plot. The film tells us that there is no truth in the first film (excluding the existence of the matrix). <br /> <br /> The movie looks like the episode of the entire Dalas, where you realize that the whole previous season is a dream. I want my $ 7.00 back!
