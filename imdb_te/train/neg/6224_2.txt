Before and after Q & A, this is what I collect: some Irish guy wants to make a film. There is nothing special about any particular film. So, one night at a party, he heard some ex-road telling him a classic bit of rock n 'roll knowledge; About how the Gram Parsons corpse his loyal road from LAX, he can honor Parsons' preferences to burn down on the Joshua Tree. <br /> What do you think for a movie! Rock n 'roll (well, country), sneezing, escaping, friendship, 70's! I think I can get Johnny Knox from "Jackass", which is a kind of continuity, and Knoxville wants to do "a movie". <br /> <br /> This story is not really that exciting ... we need something to fight for Knoxville. ! But Parsons' were married at that time. It's O.K., no one knows. We can get Christina Applegate along with us. But if the audience does not like to steal a corpse, we'll join his father's hand, but eventually let's get permission. Parsons's father killed himself at the age of 10, and in fact his orphan status and tragedy were the key parts of Parsons Mythology. Mythology? We're "A Movie!" This is a creative problem solution. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is interested or interested in this will feel uncomfortable. Doubling the existence of Applegate. The first character she had invented was Beverly Hills Bitch before her - she ran a cell phone with her whole hand and secondly, that kind of hell? The facts are simply not distorted or left, but come back. <br /> They are able to identify the villain who wants the Parsons STEP Father, who are trying to recreate the body in his own state, the music I like. Music Hacked Up (here is a song's bridge, where the chorus) is forced into the background, and eventually, hippest is covered by a new indie band, Starsailor. My girlfriend asked for an unnecessary, irresistible question - someone who was there, writer, producers, director, originally a parson fan of the village? Well, no. He did not really hear about the Parsons, but in fact, Blah Blah, I learned to love it, and here are some facts I have read on a bio online. He and Keith Richards tripped on acid together and wrote "Wild Horses", vouched another person for the Parsons' darkness by telling the facts of a mixed up group as off-base as the film. When many people came to know about it from this movie, another person asked me not to rewrite history? <br /> He said that he allowed the actual road (he was also set up) and the Parsons estate, and that these other people were intact. <br /> <br /> I really am surprised, really a much lesser (one million) film, if the original Gram Parsons were not viewed as audiences, really was asked in the puzzled Parsons geek's tremendous shaking voice. The director and writer agree that the fan of the Country-Rock 70's music fan, if any suspect he is suspected of reading the Mojo magazine, is no fan favorite. But I guess I'm a group of brits, and they just do not care about cosmic American music, or it knows. It is not just a true Parson film, it's not even in the right spirit - it's not even worth the legend. At least one of his songs must have pity. <br /> <br /> If you do not mind the title of a Parsons fan, It's just cinematic.
