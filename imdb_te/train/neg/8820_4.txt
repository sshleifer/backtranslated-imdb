I'm going to be like this, I'm looking forward to what's been fun except for the thousands that I killed ........ I'm less than that. <br /> <br /> <br /> Christmas Eve 1947 Kidnat is in Santa's suit by Daddy as his parents testify. Frightened, he climbs up the stairs and cut himself. The story began 33 years later and Harry Stoling was your regular Joe .... He was busy with Santa. When his owner ridiculed him, he went mad, dressed up as Santa, and Sandra believed that his patrons and his owner were killed. An immense neighbor catches him and he takes his van into the moon, as if he was going to burn him. <br /> <br /> It's a slow-paced boring image that does not have any redimetric quality, except when it really is infamous for those who run Harry's church. A gore is rare and "sex" scenes are also reduced. <br /> 4 in 4 4
