I can not find words to express how horrific this film is. With Segal and Stealth Aircraft, I sold the promise of making an entertaining action movie. I can honestly say I'd gouge out my eyes with a cocktail stick than I have to watch this film again. Acting is very horrible that it is very funny. This story is very weak, with rare halves of plots holes you can fly through the F117. The script is very poor and I have noticed that I'm not surprised at the age of a 10-year-old. The direction and product is so enthusiastic, I can not even take these people to shoot wedding video with my worst enemies. Fully understand. Those who are responsible for doing the film have made art cheap, and they should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Seagal should not always show his face publicly, but he agreed to play the worst movie I had ever seen in my entire life.
