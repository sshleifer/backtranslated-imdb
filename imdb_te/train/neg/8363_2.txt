I replaced 1 to 1 because I was worse for "Wongo Wild Wild". This is a tolerance exercise. This is like cleaning your teeth by bad dental hygiene. No Plots There is no logic. There is absolutely no acting (even if the shark has some quality dialogue). We are not surprised at anything. We do not know where they came from. It's always wonderful for me how things like this are also released. I agree that the previous author also was not even funny. I know. It completes about 90 minutes longer and more space in the DVD collection. It's like a paper weight. Or bad painting that you bought in the sale of starving artists. It covers the wall of the wall.
