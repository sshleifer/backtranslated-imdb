The film is portrayed as a comedy in the trailer. This is a serious tragedy. This made me feel sick for my stomach. I hate it. If they want to make people to reflect the realistic intent of the trailer in the trailer, I would like to make this film. I can not see this movie if I know. I think the trailer reflects the theme and intentions of an image. I was frustrated. I really wanted to have a comedy comedy and I am very disappointed. It's been a long time now and I still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie. I was never disappointed in the film, I never commented on the bad picture. I really genuinely fraudulently involved in this trailer because no one can see if they show the true intent of the movie.
