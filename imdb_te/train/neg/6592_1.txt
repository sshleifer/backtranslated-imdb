Summary Summary: Demeans everybody touching this film. <br /> <br /> First, I'm not Puritan, and it may be funny for a few minutes. The satirical elements are not bad. But overall it's just dull and not okay. <br /> It is clear that these films are now only for the last few dollars in the trademark Laurel and Hardy. In the history of film, or their talents there are no real producers for their construction. <br /> <br /> In fact, my daughter likes, so I'll be a parent also;)
