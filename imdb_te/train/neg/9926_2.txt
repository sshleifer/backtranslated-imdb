I saw just 30 minutes anniversary edition. The TV pilot for Black Bart Stunk. The plot does not exist and the acting is not good. It is also an attempt to gain advantage from the success of the blazing saddles and the TV programs that have succeeded in making take-offs of larger films, but this work will never work. They can not imagine that they could display the display on TV that was thrown up with the word "N" for a number of years, when they were on the air, as the TV did not have distorted sounds. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces !!! For many years actors / actresses I have seen from other shows in years. I had to write all the names and do some searches. That was fun. I argued with my mother if Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
