Sorry, this film did not intimidate me. It's just frustrating when I saw the potential and that, all that, fell by the wayside. Children! Father! Hint! Have a very probable and ziltch! Zero, nada! I heard that before. Scary! No! I'm just scared, sitting here, and more than they are in the film. Did the woman write that person that she was suffering? Huh? This movie is very atmosphere. Or at least it may be, the director / writer made it sad to work. If anyone worked hard, we added good music to tension. I really want to know why they get the money? Give it me and save all the hassle. Abandoned ... ... not where we are cheating
