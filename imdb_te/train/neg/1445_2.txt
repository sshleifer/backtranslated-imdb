As well. If it comes from the original script it is not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Haggard producers, directors and authors have not understood "There are no women in this story except Faulata and Gagula?" I mean, it's pretty plain English. I understood that at the age of 10! The beauty of KSM is that it has a striking description of three different worlds, colonial Africa, the unforgivable desert and Kukuwan Land, a mysterious and isolated kingdom. The producers should be too small to work together. But, they will, they will throw into it "romance". Pathetic. In fact, it is advisable to all the poor you thought would be close to the book. Leave. Peter Jackson will come back and you can continue reading Tom again until "it's right". BTW is a sequel book (originally clay) that is Alan's wife. This gives the theme of the quartormine story. It's a bit creepy but good.
