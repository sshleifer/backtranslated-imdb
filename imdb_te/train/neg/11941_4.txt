<br /> <br /> While it breaks down the odd good joke, humor is usually seen with panning members face or moving to coarse language and awaiting the audience to praise enough jokes. <br /> <br /> The other comment says I do not think this is best done by RTE, its really dry and sarcastic. There are some really funny intellectuals that the scarcity is the lowest form of intelligence, where you can actually laugh out loud. Besides judging the quality of the hypocrisy that is not really good, comedians seem to be convinced well-known names. Overall, it is mediocre with some good laughs, but often it is very mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens Stuff. I know Benny Hill is confident.
