This film is not a waste except for some boring scenes in the middle. But women have performed better than the funniest men. <br /> <br /> But Christa Allen really rocked in the movie .Her voice is so seducing and sexy. Krista should have been shortened by the bed's scenes but she made so much more watchful and sexier than it can not make. Christa is truly the best of such characters. She has been silent in the last 5 minutes and is an interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds is not good and it is not his best as an action star. He could have chosen a better script than this. I really think he thinks for money.
