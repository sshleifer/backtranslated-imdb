I've seen poor movies in my time, but this really takes the biscuit! Oh, why this movie was made? Nothing here. Please put your trust in me, switch off switch and destroy the copy of this image. There is a plot ... this may take about 5 minutes to show on the camera. The key issue is that the story is based on 'true story' (mmm ... whatever) is 80 minutes reprimanding. So we should sit around for an hour and walk around people. That's it! The whole first half an hour takes absolutely nothing, since someone walks a shop and walks through a wooden 3 guys. This time is probably the role of the character ... but not. So people do not have any connection on the screen, so if they start shooting, we can not take less care! I'm in the ending voice of the Buddy for the end of the film! The above camera work is really horrendous! The director / editor / writer / producer, T. West is worse. I hate hitting a man, but really, his work is pants! I'm sure he feels brilliant, but the results are pretty dull - I constantly stop the film and wanted to wreck my wrist! This person has exceeded me how to direct the next cabin fever! To complete, acting is also a mourning, which goes for the whole movie. Protect your knowledge, this pile of total exclusion is clear!
