I am an avid fan of Lucy Fucci and is also called "Zombi 3" (aka "Zombie Flesh Eaters 2") in 1988, with two other directors, Bruno Matte and Claude Fragasso. This was particularly frustrating, especially compared to its great ancestor, Fulsy's own Gore classic "Zombi 2" (aka "Zombie Fell Eaters" / "Zombie"). Definitely, low rating 4.5 This is not a good image, but it is, these low ratings come from people who are not usually Italian zombie flicks, and the enthusiastic fan of Italian horror movies and low budget exploitation movie, I love many pictures that are rewarded with very low ratings. In addition, most of my fellow Italian horror fans have underestimated the film, and I can not agree with sin. The film is not completely disaster. It all has some zealous features on Fully's devastating gore effects, which is always happy to see for Italian horror / gore bou. The basic idea behind the film was not even bad (most of all) and I liked the brutal depiction of the military. Sadly, it's about it. Although the great ancestor "Zombi 2" is very much Gary, it is also actually crazy, it's not a creepy or scary for a minute, and the only real reason for the boring and often strange gore "Zombie 3". The picture is sometimes fun to watch, but for the gore, and a random comedy. I was frustrated by Fult's core Gore and Mattiki and Fragasso, the first being in the dirty cult-flix (like D'Amato's "Porno Holocaust"), and one of the worst films in the latter is the worst "Troll 2" responsibility. Overall, this is definitely worth watching for Gore, but, from all the Fulki movies I've seen so far, this is definitely the worst, and I've seen the majority of this great filmmaker's concert. I'm a fan of Fulki, and I'm always there, but this is definitely not his magic moment. It may be fun for the gore, but I would recommend to see any other fullscreen movie before!
