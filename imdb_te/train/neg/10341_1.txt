I've rented this movie from the library (hard for the good reason) completely curious. I am a huge plot fan and I am disappointed that this film is complete. The Bell Jar (1979) is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The script is not terrible, since it is the original novel that breaks out of the text, but because it will strays without vision or intent. The scenes were created ill and the viewer should not go anywhere. What's with the hokey voice of Plath's poetry? Lady Lazarus has a low level of Greenwich; The poetry of Plath was totally abusive. Marilyn Husstett Ester Greenwood (or at the age of 20) was totally unreliable (she was 32 years old when she was born, when she was born when she was born) and she was unable to work. Hassett is not all emotion, no skill, skill. Medium in direction; The director does not just do it, it's not too much. The only reason I was giving an image 1 is because 0 is not an option. Sorry, Silvia, you should wait for someone to put your good work on.
