This is a very boring image. If you grew up during Vietnam, as I did, you've now seen and heard all of the footage and claims of a hundred times. But really this film makes the story of boring director Carlton Sherwood. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to remember Vietnam, you can speak Sherwood directly in the camera, find something new here. There are no new evidence to condemn the new testimony that corresponds to John Kerry or another documentary in Vietnam. Young viewers interested in this topic should see George Butler's awesome film Going UpWire! Stolen Honor explicitly intended to work on John Kerry's hipchat job, but failing to achieve that goal.
