For the first time in the Soviet Union, I saw this film and the censorship committee just modified several sex scenes. But in 2000, I saw in full form Poland. But now The plot is very stupid - 2 men survive the genetic disaster and the feminist find themselves on the planet filled with strong, straightforward and primarily intense women. Men are now trying to fight it and then feminists (you can not agree with or not, but idiots are not), and so on very boring clicks a whole bunch-sex-drive, persistent masse for sex, idiots, and so on. The stellar jersey Stuhr's performance here is wooden and amazingly bad - he's on the elevator with nude chic and I can not do anything to her! He pushes unfunny faces and repetitions when speaking words. It was intended to be comedy, filled with predictable jokes and lower-waist fables. Do not waste your time - it's just bad.
