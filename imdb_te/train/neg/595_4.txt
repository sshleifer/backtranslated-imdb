Creep - "Your journey will end here." <br /> Almost all the graphic scenes for this film and ... well, yes, this is not a storyline. No preferred characters, well, 'characters' is not correct to consider if you really do not have a clue who is anyone. I mean, some thing they look dirty (who's this thing? He is why), it's very scary, but am I really interested? No, I do not. Why not? Because I do not have a clue for these people and I do not know whether I lived or died. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <I'd fall asleep and miss 45 minus to build. It jumps right into action. <br /> In general, some women and her friends are locked in London underground, following an unnatural creature, and they eventually run away from it. <br /> You creep have its moments <br /> <br /> It sounds good and the sounds are okay, but unfortunately it makes a good horror film to go waste. <br /> It's not new. Kate (the main 'character') is constantly stupid "Hey, I know I'm sitting at home, I think I want to do the right thing in this situation, but oooh no!" Because I'm elegant in a dumb to do the whole opposite "thing. I think I can not do that, I've done it many times, it's boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> "Your journey will end here" is the tag line of the films. Well, Crips Travel ends in a short while. If you have some beers, you've got some colleagues, then obviously, see it all. Avoid if you want something original and brilliant.
