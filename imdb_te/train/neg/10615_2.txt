It looks like a lifetime that is at a younger age of less than 2 hours when sitting through a flat, unbearable drift. If a story seems to be in harmony with Sal Potter, does not she show a little bit of interest for her performance? Her performance was completely separated, and I did not think of any chemistry between Sally and Pablo and Tango sequences, which had been blurred by the nature of the dance, rather than awkward and painful to see. Obviously, such a personal story is hard to reveal in the film, and Sally Potter is a good actor to be a good actor rather than performing his own lamb victim.
