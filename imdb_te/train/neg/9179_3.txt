It's cheese. If all the video game you like is complete with straightforward-to-computer-cutaway sequences for action, the film is actually very little of exclusive effects. Our theater and I really saw great time because the theater was largely empty and we were able to get a bit of a bit. This image really requires hexing. <br /> Plot? Is there a plot Well, some stupid college or later varieties have been invited to "come of the year", one of the San Juan islands ("they stayed in Seattle only, they are still alive." - Direct quote or almost.) They stay there and everyone is gone, and the site is somewhat destroyed (but hey, kick is still full!). With the help of a crusty old captain and a coast guard lady (they are a little less tough - and cast a bit less than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight with lots of zombies (some of the acid stit), freaky earrings, and more likely to be killed. <br /> <br /> It's not quite as bad as Dhenonicus, but it's far more frightening to see more than a second, but still much more than a second, but still more than a second - they're sort of my own personal alpha and omega - is). On the other hand, if you are expecting a video game fantastic like Resident Evil, run away! Okay, some real big questions (without too much spoiler): Spanish ships of the 18th century into the Pacific Northwest Why are any of the Pacific Northwest smuggling guns, and to whom - San Juan Island for loud crying - Oh , It's naming (oh sorry, it's called "isla del marto"), San Juan Island - and Outdoor, still minded Pacific Northwest And Rowe will attend 30 people - "The Year Rave", my patet. <br /> <br /> The lucky thing is that a lot of people are around. Many of them. Everyone has them. <br /> Lastly, when the movie started playing with a little "daddy" (I know you and naked) <br /> Finally - Intro comments (in voice-over, not less) are usually letters One thing is to say "she leaves her boyfriend to focus on fencing" and that the film will eventually do some fencing. Not good fencing, but a couple of people hacking at each other with swords, anyway.
