Even though it was 2 years old, I still remember the whole waste of the whole story. Unfortunately, after my friends I came across the film and selected it when I was browsing through the new releases on the blockbuster. We decided to make a movie because it was not what we saw and it seemed to be enjoyable. There is quite a while since I saw this movie, yet I still lack the plot (seriously, no real plot) and the time spent watching the film is totally waste. If you are in the video store and the film hold your eye, walk and find a better movie. If you see this movie, I understand your pain :)
