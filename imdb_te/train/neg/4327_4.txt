Some amusing humor, some comes flat, some good acting, some are very outrageous. The film is just hit and miss, entertaining 12-year-old boys more than any other niche. <br /> <br /> In the film, the child actors are simply unacceptable. When you're a family comedy, it's a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises up on this topic, and I mentioned the human performance in the midst of this courage.
