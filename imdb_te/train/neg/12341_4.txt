Horror spoofs are not a thing of the 21st century. Before the 'Scary Movie' series some examples of this genre are in the 80s. But franchise says that most of these films are hit or missed. 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark' are some of them, but the rest is 'Saturday 14th' and it fails to laugh the sequel. But one of these films is a particularly big offender and it is 'Transylvania 6-5000,' for many reasons, the main waste of time. <br /> <br /> Pros: This is a great great cast. Some dopey comedy is fun. Not a corny, but the theme catch the song. <br /> <br /> Cons: Threadbare plot. The most tedious move. A lot of humor does not cut it. To make the monsters less and give a small screen time. Have I thought of these monster movies as sarcastic? The audience is likely to be angry. <br /> Last ideas: is it comedy? If it's then really funny bits are so few and so in between? Comedies are lying on the ground, we do not have to blind our eyes and be hurt for it. I can not believe that Anchor Bay will release this tired waste. This is not one of the worst films I have ever done, but it's not a time or money for anyone to be a fan of the actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
