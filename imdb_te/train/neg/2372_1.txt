The stupid, redundant and insulting ending to "Elm Street Nightmare On Elm Street"! Part 6 Director Rachel Tallel deliberately sought to turn Wes Craven's initial campus into a big, bad and unflattering joke. This is not just the worst entry in the "Elm Street" saga; It's also one of the most awkward horror films ever and it's a clear genre of fans! The story is dumb, the character drawings are ridiculous, the structure is all muddy and? Almost everyone ?? Special and visual effects reflect a Tom & Jerry cartoon. The sequence that Freddy Krueger murdered by his victims was endless and very unhealthy. When a Jabbering Freddy Breekin Meyer converted a video game-character and into Pogo, should we feel like a baby when wearing him around the walls of a house? This story goes back to Springwood and looks like a middle-aged daughter Freddie is impressive. You'd think he mentioned one of his previous adventures, but ?? While only a young man in Springwood and Kruger remains to be used to contact him with his long lost daughter. Another reason why this final installment is so terrible is a completely inappropriate construction. John Doe Boy is introduced as the main character, but suddenly he dies, and both are wandering adults! About this: Freddy Krueger spent five of his films killing a young man, eventually wearing two glasses and into 3D glasses! Is not it the whole essence like ruins? For the most part I am concerned, "Elm Street Nightmare" is always a terrible overrated series, but to date, even weak entries have at least some ransom items. "Freddy Dead", however, is simply undeurable and no one should waste his / her precious time watching.
