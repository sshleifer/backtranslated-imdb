First it is wrong to study Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophetic scriptures. It is wrong to make such images to try to display the Gospel message. So my trouble with this film is not in its holiness or aspirations. As a Christian, though an amillenialist, I believe that he will have great labor and believe in Christ as he says so much. <br /> <br /> The lesson of this image is not its truthfulness or its message, but the lack of product values, the awful script, the mediocre acting and the Pitfic FX. The film was composed of cheese recipe sequence in the 1950s. No, there is this picture with Plan 9 from Outerspace. <br /> <br /> Apocalypse art filmmakers have learned how to do the film before, but they have failed. Behind the series behind the series, The Apocalypse Series, and Omega Code Series have failed to learn anything, as they mention the FX issues and the dated look issue, but their scripts are still poor and their performance is carved. <br /> <great Christian films have very few budgets, but this film is not one of them. I'm surprised that MST3K staff have never lampooned this one.
