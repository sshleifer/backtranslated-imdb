It is the nature of businesses that try to achieve success of others. Previously taken from a Dracula (1931) and a movie from 'Frankenstein' (1931) - village leaders in a German town believed to be the cause of recent deaths of vampires (in the shape of bats) and bloodless victims. Though filmed at Universal (and in the Branson Caves!), It is the Poverty Row feature; <br /> <p> Lionel Atwill waits for the arrival of Fay Wray and Dwight Frey, to give a good 30s mystery image to the main titles (this should be by Misscha Bakalinikoff), Talkie, but with the opening scenes for this famous, exciting, watching. Unfortunately, it did not. <br /> When we earn little more than the formulaic elements of the movies, with low speed, low budget, adequately Dwight Frey, Mad Eburne (Aunt Gucci) <br /> <br /> Human blood is required or his servant Emil ( Robert Frazer) was proposed by Lionel Atvil (Dr. Van Neeman) to show how to control the brain. <br /> Do not look for technical expert doctor.

Structurally, 'The Vampire Bot' is still not good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Vampire is plodding along with a lot of talking or unwanted humorous relief, without focusing on the villain. 'The Mystery of the Wax Museum' (both 1932 and co-fan Wray), Lionel Atwill 's most famous performer is as an armed military trained cop like' The son of Frankenstein '(1939) and' Morality 'like Sherlock Holmes and Secret Weapon "(1943). Dwight fray steals his manic scenes in 'Dracula' (1931). 'Young lovers,' Melvin Douglas and Faye have a nice kiss scene, but about it. He can be seen in 'The Old Dark House' (1932), and Fey 'The Most Dangerous Game' (1930) needs to be pulled around by Joel McGraw. Then she has a 1933 classic screamer. Too bad for most of the time, money, additions, and Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye's chemistry are not available for this movie. Sadly, then, this awfully disappointing picture gets only 4.
