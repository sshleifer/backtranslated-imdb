Okay, this is rare and I have taken it for free. That's why I got this film on that limit. I looked at Hollywood cemetery for free and was very disappointed. The film's question about a "bookdend" about Native American references is a questioner's question instead of putting hands on everything in the FAILED. <br /> <br /> Native American references --- Native American references are really contrived, contrived. This was clear that the director and the author tried to solve an arena they had never played before. They should adhere to the old saying of "write about something you know". If they are clearly familiar with the film, it is not exactly shown in the film or the beauty of this particular culture has not provided proper justice. <br /> <br /> Clicking on the clips and on the nose --- I agreed to see this film based on an indie. So I've done high expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" saw an indie and popularity. It was also raving how I was already going to hit it before even leaving for the wider release. UNFORTUNATELY I did not say the same about "expiration date". The "Sunshine" clich events took us but the filmmakers take us in a different direction, avoiding the trap as a "clich√©" so the result is clever at their approach. On the other hand, the film will not fall into the trap because it has already disappeared from the beginning. <br /> <br /> "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best one and this movie <br /> <br /> I congratulate the filmmakers for making a good turn from their family members in the cemetery.
