This is one of the worst films ever made. For a biker movie, it's rock bottom. There is a gang of bikers who take on a small town (how much original!) And the efforts of the urban people to fight them. Why do not they call for help outside? Who knows? Fighting scenes are clearly fake. Adam West and Tina Lewis but it's too little and both are shy of being shy (understandably) the movie belongs in the trash heap!
