Kirsten Dunst is terrible as an actress. You can always say "acting". I liked Ezard. The plot is very boring. Audiences have no real connections to the characters, no one knows how to really sympathize or to care for. Slow, frustrating movie, some smiles, but some and much fun anyway. Plot does not have at least participation or suspense. You can see a mile coming a mile away. How is this movie Comedy? Drama? Who cares? At the end of this movie you will not.
