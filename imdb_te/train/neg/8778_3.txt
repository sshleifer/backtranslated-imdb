"White Noise" is very likely one of the most I talked about movies from "Exorcist". The fact that the EVP is considered to be true is that the truth is really a frightful truth. Many movies come in fear of people's minds. As I said, this film may be, but not done. The film became a low level PG-13 horror film. There is nothing compared to "The Ring" or "The Sixth Sense". Someone really needs to be charged in the horror film industry and makes us think, but it makes a movie, but it's horror, everything, a horror movie. The PG-13 is honest illness of horror genre because of its own style. We need old days, blood and gore days, Freddy Krueger, Jason, The Mike Meyers days. Some movies do not have to worry about this mentality. So why try pull? Some good highlights in the film are not one of the foolish conclusions in cinema history, without any clarity ... Do not waste your money in this film.
