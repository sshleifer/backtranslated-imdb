Some of the best jealous stars. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Pohler, and The Great Christopher Walken. With such a cast, only the best. <br /> <br /> With "jealousy", no one can save this disaster. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Wonder Pearl (Black) are good friends and colleagues at the sand paper factory. Both make a good life, but since Tim has a better performance, he can earn more than his friend Nick. Nick always comes up with new ideas Dreamser. One day, Nick puppies will come up with a spray that makes the pipe disappear (yes, I'm serious). To fall in love with this idea, Nick really decides to discover this product. He makes a proposal to invest his idea to Tim and share 50/50 of profits. <br /> <br /> Nick's discovery ends with earning millions of entitled "va-poo-rize" (again, I'm serious). He spends his money on big money, horse, personal trainer, and fancy deserts. Feeling jealous for Tim Nick starts. The name of the film. <br /> <br /> The feeling is not bad, but still awful. The film has all the worst dialogs from the cast and has fewer performances. Then again, as I said earlier, nothing of them has saved this mess. Great Christopher Walken also did not play the role of "J-man", which made it funny. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie: * You like the worst (you do not get angry) * If you want to see Jack Black in white tuxes <br /> <br /> I say, avoid all the costs of this movie, Be: * You are hurt by the bathroom comedy * You love animals
