I really hate the most ending of world films. They show what the Hollywood people think about the rest of the world, and they think we are a ruthless idiots (or at least some of the idiots in difficult times). I have come to L.A many times, I have a family working with show business and I want to say that they are the last people who are looking for this reality check. Some catastrophic films have painted at least a brilliant picture: Children of Men, 12 Monkeys, but usually the message "People do anything for survival, all of which is dark and sad and deliberate, we all want to be shy." /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the story of the story of the social order system thrown out and the story of the people experiencing the horror of the horror faces, and some people have shot this film, but sadidal idiots, I seriously dissolve the society into doubt just every man a disgrace.
