Terrible !!! I do not like to be very negative but I have a IQ of the stupid monkey.What a disaster. I can not believe how bad this movie is.The things are so strange and subjective, sometimes the camera work is just terrible, like the soundtrack for Arabian Lawrence I saw music See how much worse the film can be seen. The pitch kick "actors" a bit Iii my thumbs and toes and anything vipattusorri but hang down on my body fall to the ground. Harvey Keitt was a great actor, but he was found to be in a financial crisis to take part in such a film Ficaccha. . . . . The film suggested that students in all film schools should teach lessons about how to make a movie
