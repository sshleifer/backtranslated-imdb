I got sick when I saw this film. I grew up with Pip, and every time there was a real pleasure. When my wife came to Sweden she had a real good smile looking at older people. But this American version name should be changed and will not be shown again. It's terrible from the beginning. They can make it bad. Well I guess HH Hahah is translating someone else but they are not close to the pipe. This movie may never be seen again and never sent to the broadcast. Burn the picture and save the children. If you want to go to Pippi, you will have a good laugh at the original movie. We love Pippi Inger Nilsson, sorry Tommy Erin will never stand forever .. Oh yes .. "Spoilers" When reading the description, "It's a surprise and steal the viewer of the film's suspense and happiness." Well I guess the director stands out for this. .. you are watching this movie at your own risk .. It really is wasting time ...
