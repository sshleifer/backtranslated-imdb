The only thing that can prevent this film from the whole disaster is a couple of interesting stylish touches. <br /> <br /> (The latest spoiler warning) Death is a bit derived from Death by Twilight Zone: The Movie. <br /> <br /> Moreover, looking at the inra highway and separating the color are well organized. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is another good scene with ghost motorcycle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> I bought "Soul Survivors" at the same time and both films are similarly annoying with constant experiences you have been looking at a dream. <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" does not have anything to redeem, or any sense, has two of the above mentioned notes. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, 8 'nightmares' will be here, the only way to see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From 10 to 3.
