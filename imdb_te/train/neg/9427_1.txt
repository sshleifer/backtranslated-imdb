When I rented "Unhinged", I was expecting a gore image. The box also stated that the film is in the film's violent scenes slashed in the theater release (I now have so many doubts about the release of the theater). <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: A group of three young men in a car tour collapses on the tree. This building, which has a sexiest woman, makes their home. Apart from this point, the film has mainly innovative scenes, intended to fit the film's release. <br /> <br /> The film is doing well, it is acting. Lisa Monson, who plays the lead role, seems to be reading her lines from her queue cards. Acting is bad for others, but it's not nearly as bad as she is. Another thing that makes this film bad is the camera technique. Many shots are taken by cameras attached to the roof. This film is getting worse. Above all, there is a very small gore, the box makes it very misleading. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. My rating: from 10 to 1
