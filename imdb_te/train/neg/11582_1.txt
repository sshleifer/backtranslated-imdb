Many people here are not happy to think about this movie. It has some big names in the cast, but it is. <br /> <br /> In this story there is nothing else to preserve and recommend some beautiful women you can do in thousands of movies. <br /> <br /> In this story, unexpected, self-centered, chain-smoking, "hip" national film critics all like ... and can not stand a lot of people. <br /> <br /> Oklahoma tones are naked, southern racist stereotypes come from the Liberal Hollywood 101 on the right and the story is discouraging.
