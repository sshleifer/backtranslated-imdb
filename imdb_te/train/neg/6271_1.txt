There are no words to explain how bad they are. It just describes the explanation. Some people kill or kill them about a computer that can replace personal items in silver balls that enter the mouth of the victims. The whole thing is so varnish that it's amazing. There is also a girl with a personal computer in her room and computer talks through a hand craftsman !!!!!!!! I did not make this stuff. <br /> <br /> "Cinema" is even worse. Surreal garbage. Wonderful, a kind of one-off bad trash. There are a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there that are not too hot or romantic. <br /> There is also a scene where a woman seems to have seen, or French kissing a tarantula, which is rolling on the floor. <br /> One of the worst films ever made is one. There is also a wretched live-home home video boarding, or Bujziman II (two days all have scenes with BOOGEYMAN II and a killer toothbrush). At least try to make it fun and fun to see what's going on.
