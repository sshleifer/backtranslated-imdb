"Drawing Rest 9" is a kind of movie that loves or hates; Luckily or not, I feel stronger of wasting time and leave it with stuffed with "killing whales bad" campaign altogether. In particular, the first half, although the film is not clear of every action that is portrayed as different perspectives of a different hunting, the film might be attractive. Until then, it's a little fun to see Japanese workers work everyday, but it is clear that there is a campaign that appears on the screen and no single frame is exempt. I use the word "campaign" because the film primarily uses old morality play device because "good" and "bad" are removed during operation but are set in stone. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's all for me, but I'll find the kind of art in the art and the predecessor of the great (sarcastic) quest to protect the environment. <br /> In my opinion, it is only a stretch of cinematic material without a stretch of cardinal sin. In my opinion, "Drawing temperatures 9" could easily fit for 75 minutes, but the length of torture for 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but they left enough 15 minutes without notice. The film does not have a standard view, and the characters do not evolve, but it is not a documentary, it is a kind of constructive installation. This is an unusual form for a movie, but it is still considered art, and the concept is as simple and as simple as it is here. OTOH I believe that the director would have some honesty and would be able to deliver at least 135 minutes less. <br /> <br /> Yes, music score is mostly whale sounds. How surprising it is. <br /> <br />
