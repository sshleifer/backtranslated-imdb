A very weak picture, mainly poor story, but also poor performance of Robert Downey Jr. and irrational behavior of many characters. If you are a person who wants to change your mind, if it is watching a movie for creativity or acting standards then you might like this movie. Personally I can not do it with a drama and it's not too far. <br /> <br /> One of the main characters that I think is brilliant, I'm constantly annoying, nervous. In the film, the main character does not have a movie if a person behaves normally in these situations. <br /> <br /> The main character, Magruder, is a successful attorney, leaving behind a party that plays Kenneth Branagh, and a girl, Mallorie DÃ¡szd, has appeared to have stolen her car. <br /> She tells about a luxurious father's crazy father and crazy things. When they come at her ruined shock in the poorest of the town, they notice her car driveway. <br /> There are lights at home and some things are broken at home. <br /> <br /> Things are very strange, she's stupid (looks trumped, naked in front of her, yes!). Moreover, the father is weird, the house is a wreck - everything is said to Magruder, "Hey this is very strange to me, I'm here!" <br /> <br /> Then Magruder is not sleeping with her, then she is inspired by the story and sex, which takes the case of trying to persuade her father to adhere to it! He is likely to have a late attorney at the office where he had the night before. Magrader disappointed some of his cases and thereby fearing that the police were scared of him and that the police are afraid of him and I do not believe that he believes in witnessing. The police would say Hours. <br /> This is very rare.
