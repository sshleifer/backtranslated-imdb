In a film based on a historic person I rarely got frustrated with disappointment. A terrible joke of an image, I cringed across. <br /> <br /> Famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershah is actually a consultant for the film. However, he declined that the script was historically inaccurate and ridiculous, and he also demanded that his name be terminated as source (he was embarrassed to think that people would feel as he was involved). A scene Hitler hitting his dog. There is no source for this. Hitler loves animals on people. He adopted strict animal welfare laws in Europe, banned diversity and animal experiments. <br /> <br /> The film brought the Iron Cross into a farce, corrupting it. Is lying. <br /> There is no historical document that Hitler has sexual relations with his niece. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, Hitler is portrayed as a rarity in this movie. <br /> <br /> He did not even know that he was in existence, in the dark, real, real life of this incomplete film. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film is totally feared. <br /> <br /> Take the view and give a very wide berth.
