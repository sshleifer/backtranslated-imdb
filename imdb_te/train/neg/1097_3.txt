By 1971, I realized that the US Army was desperate, but the film was unbelievable. This is not a training camp for the SS penal battalion in a Sven Hassel novel. The author must be a true army adversary. The Psycho Sergeant jail cell has been damaged by the public waste, and the uncomfortable black top sergeant should also be removed. These men are going abroad, so that where no unused delegates come from, the inquiry will be there. It is a completely shaky scene that is one of the electrocution. The barrister worked on the barrel on the barrel to issue a genuine attack on an unlawful sequence (violating POWs against Geneva Convention), a registered person, sexual abuse and conduct of an officer. He walked just walked. After this, disciplinary brakes have fallen into a wardrobe and the picture becomes spectacular. I do not know how it ended, I went to bed.
