Rick Sloan has allowed five films to be more difficult to believe than a cool combination. The film is completely crime. Before looking at this film, I thought of Manos: Hate of Fate had seen the worst piece ever since, but at least Manaus slowly moves you to sleep, thus protecting your eyes from pain. The great tragedy of the film is that the old man who keeps Hoggoblins "locked" makes it to the final scene. The time I spent watching this movie was a complete waste of my life.
