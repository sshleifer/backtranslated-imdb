Are we talking about the same movie? The film is totally ridiculous, the plot is full of disgust and logic. It's a typical simpler for DVD / TV, including all the necessary tools for a terrific film experience: Stages from the previous acting, actors, vaguely plain platforms, ghirl shows her t * ts (why god, why ??) Do not respond to the public. I'm bothered by the details and it takes me tonight. Well, okay, just one: If two people are killed when you walk down the street, one of the victims dies in your hands and penetrates his blood from his blood. Is; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!" My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost life.
