The best way to describe the film is to enter into homes where two newlywed two friends are killed. It's good and good, but what makes a boring broom an hour. In fact, one of the funny things about the film, there is a warning in the beginning, that guarantees no one to die of the shy free coffin. Trust me well, nobody took that offer if anyone out there was afraid of plastic skulls, peacocks, weird gardeners, and doors. And the music is the worst, it has consistent tuba music which sounds like it is played by some sixth grader. And you will find terrible secret that you really need to be surprised that people in this picture are thinking. When someone runs and hits their head, someone dies and the police should not be investigated. Finally this is a slow (motion picture per hour), a boring short story, which easily finds by the average person. None of the characters in this movie is the average person.
