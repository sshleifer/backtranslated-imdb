I am very impressed about this film. I thought and looked good on the script paper but the filmography and the standards I expect is not the standards I expect from some very talented people acting. This is CV I suspect these features in filmography. Michael Cain appeared as a doctor in some of his characters, at any time I do not really believe in his role. This theme does not particularly relate to the victim's son. Some scenes have a lot of memories for other movies, and I'm surprised if it's actually a spoof thriller. At times the light was dark and it was added to the idea of ​​seeing low budget images with some big names, and I was surprised to see why I could not see why.
