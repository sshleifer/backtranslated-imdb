(Honestly, Barbara, which klicking all of the "NO" in my review 22 times I do not know how many people can help you here? <br /> Steven Spielberg said to Barbra, "It's Citizen Kane 'That's the best film I've seen since. <br /> <br /> What are the ingredients for a perfect Fire Cinema Disaster, and one that haunts you, forgetting you both tears of laughter <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " In fact, almost everyone should be an egomaniac in Hollywood.  నారు? "కళ" కోసం?!? బాగా, మీరు వారి జాగ్రత్తగా సిద్ధం ఇంటర్వ్యూ లో మీరు ఏమి నమ్మకం తగినంత మూగ ఉంటే ?? మరియు స్ట్రైసాండ్ వాటిని అన్ని అతిపెద్ద ఇగో ఉంది! ఇది చాలా ఘనకార్యం. అహంకార క్రిటిన్స్ చుట్టూ, మరియు ఇంకా వాటిని అన్ని టాప్ నిర్వహించేందుకు ?? <br /> <br /> This film, like her "solo" attempts, is ego traveling ego straightforwardly. Every scene is in Streisand. Was born dead. But not enough, she sings a whole bunch of Streisandy songs ?? You know now that you have enabled the world's Maria Carrise, Celine Diance and Whitney Huston to poison our valuable wind waves in the Divine Dynasty. <br /> <br /> In the premise, Streisand sounds like a jazz jazz comedy to wear as a man to become a rabbi. Unlike a cliché, the obvious problem is that Streasand does not look like a woman or does she look like a man? Of course I do not know her. She looks very well in this movie, well ?? It is not explained in words. E.T. By comparison it looks like a high school joke. She looks more alien than Michael Jackson in 2015. She looks like a Harrier. <br /> The songs. They tremble to me. Specifically "Papa Ken Yew You Will Here Me Scully Like A Demanded Female Wallace In Heat?" And "Tomorrow's Night I'll Prepare a Sequel, Yentl 2: The Bitch Return". <br /> <br /> Stressand has a nose job initially in his career, and when she says she can change her voice? Do you believe She should have done it! <br /> <br /> Please contact me by e-mail for reading my biographies of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals. <br /> Barbra Stretsen want to retire last? Click "Yes" or "No".
