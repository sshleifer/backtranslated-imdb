At first glance it is going to be a ridiculous blaxploitation flick, and it gives the impression that veers in that direction have moments here. Nevertheless, the basic story concept is much stronger than expected and is an honorable effort in filming racial issues in World War II. Notable cast is Hit and Miss, Glennen Torman, Richard Prior and Andyusis Billy dee Williams. <br /> <br /> Stephen Boyd stops short of repetition of his hyperbolic moment. <br /> <br /> The fluctuations in the obvious low-budget production values ​​lead to volatility. The positions are great, the effects and the action are weak. "Default Ryan" saves five Germans in a jeep and for the climax when sneezing as well as walking around the Hangs, Damon and Barnes (we can not see the shot unless we can see the shots). Nevertheless, when heroic soldiers respect their performance without respect they are blacks, and Boyd's racist captain has this effect, the scenes of the character of the character of Tomman his seeming exports <br /> <br /> Small, "Black Brigade / Carter Army" is not very successful. But it's not a bad joke, a respectable failure. It can be rebuilt as a good film, and when it stands, it's a very interesting attempt.
