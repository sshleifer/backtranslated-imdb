Here goes the perfect example of what to do when you have a great idea. Is not that a problem? The concept is fresh and probabilities, but there is no real substance in the script and its implementation. It should grab you from the beginning and then pull your emotions a little, you get the interest and invest in the letters. There's nothing to remove this movie and stay on the plane, and why it's here. Firstly you do not care about the characters because they do not have people in contact, I mean this is a superman or mission Impossible, let's think about the common people put in a stressful situation. They are not as reliable as they deal and interact. For example: Jeffrey Combines is a gum on the cheek, cheating and watching all the time is not the way to go here. What am I? He looks like a toilet or something. I loved him back on the animator and the money he played serious / nervous, dramatic medical artist. But for this, he is very intense and supplanted by looking at the edge but still tries to be very difficult to be surprised he does not dislocate his jaw during filming, it is not natural, it is not a natural nerve form. The film is primarily supported by life, it has just been a pulse and it never came and never kept me waiting for something.
