This film is a real disappointment for me. I have been a longtime parson fan and when I got out I went to a lot of people, when I came out of the movie VHS, I was sick of what I saw and the film was not about his life, it was after his death. I thought it was a descendant of Grammar Life and Music, but they had to make a film about his death. I'm tired of hearing about his deaths in books and films, I wanted a movie about his life, his infamous death. I was very disappointed. I want people to see his life. Its soundtrack is only good about this movie. The film was disappointing for any Gram Parson fans.
