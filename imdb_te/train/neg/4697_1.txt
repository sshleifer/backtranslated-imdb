Okay I saw this stupid movie's sneak preview. First there is no truth in the film, not the truth, they all act. They can not sing. They are full of themselves. It is painful. Kids like 8 to 10 may enjoy yes but its really stupid. I will tell their manager child. And the record label is duplicate. Its stupid. <br /> <br /> For setting up and directing, that's not so bad. It's a beautiful documentary but a stupid thing papers. <br /> You can only see if you do not like really good music. Moreover, it is very cold. It's also not tasteful. I hate doing so ... but it's really waste.
