Watched 1/18/2009 ?? 10 to 2 (Dir-peit Risky): A stunning psychoanalytic picture about a girl in autism, being tested at the hospital, power flickers, and then all hell is broken. I honestly do not know what the filmmakers are with this intention. The next one hour and a half (at least it's not the longest) was the end of the horror / twilight zone / socialist / deeast film that really did not seem too late. Initially, after the power came out, everyone was missing in hospital, except for the small group's misfisition, including the girl and his father. The usual annoying character, a creepy old man, and a very tough guy like many frightening and, in fact, the young girl is attracted to the main character. Random stuff begins with going on different times like ghost and demons appear, that time is stopped, and this little group of dead people try to escape from whatever they are doing. However, the autistic girl is something and I am the center of everything really hated how they used this girl suffering and she really said that she was responsible for the reason and her hospitalization. We never find an answer to what will really happen, it's very strange, so avoid this dog. And if you do not want to kill, and it's not confusing for an hour and a half or not for you or any cinegore. What time waste? Really !!
