Even after 20 years, the Ninja mission stands like the worst picture I can sit on the mission. Scandinavian Ninjas quietly entered a scene and burns their unhealthy noisy sub-machine guns, and then quietly left. Wow, how do we find those silent invisible murderers? Just follow the shell cages and smoke! Is it a painful bad dialogue (or it is intelligent and just correctly translated?), Not an Asian in the cast, and 3 asians in the stunt crew. The plot is funnier, acting does not exist pretty much - then again, ninja will not work! Save yourself - do not see all the costs!
