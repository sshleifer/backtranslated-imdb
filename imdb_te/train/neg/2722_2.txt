For us one of the big thinkers, "Intruder" is a bad image from France, a bad name known as "Art Films." The story is about a story about Luis Treber (Michelle Subor), who is looking for Tahiti for heart transfusion, but something more than that, or what are they doing? They're doing. I am absolutely delighted to accept that there might be some people who are receiving some deep message of the movie, but the film's prevalent storyline will lose us first, without breaking it. <br /> <br /> This muddle, snail-drama play takes about two hours and five minutes to complete.
