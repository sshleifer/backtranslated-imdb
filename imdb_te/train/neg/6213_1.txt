This film made it one of my top 10 most awkward films. Horrible. <br /> <br /> There is no continuous stretch to fight with a monster or someone else. There is no chance of development of any character, they are too busy to run to another in a sword battle. I have an emotional attachment (except for a big trash machine that wants to destroy them). <br /> <br /> Scenes are clearly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br The spider machine is sure that the spider is attacking a spider in the River of the Kings (Elijah Wood is the victim of two films) and waits ...... it is hypnotized (stitched) its victim and wraps up them ..... <br /> < br> The whole machine vs. humans theme matrix .. or the terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are more examples, but why <br /> <br /> A childhood story has been moved to a childhood finale and the film is not a child's film or adult film and is not too much. <Br / > <br /> <br /> Just awful.
