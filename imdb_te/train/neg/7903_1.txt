I saw this movie, but do not look at my desire, as I was watching and it was exactly as I was sleeping "it did not hold my enthusiasm and imagination." At least I know it's watched enough of it to know I'm not looking again. <br /> Geez, talk about lame ... really lame. Completely dull. It can not appeal to six years. It's basically NO worthy dramatic effect. Zilch. Nada. Just become shell trash. Comedy? Need a comedy <br /> <br /> Even though the image of aliens is similar to those in the "Critics", human characters are so overwhelmingly smugly than cutesy ... they can be something more exciting than watching and drying so tight and running their lives that they can not eat. <br /> Do not bother looking at this. This is not worth the effort. You can find something more interesting to do. It's like looking dry. Or fall asleep.
