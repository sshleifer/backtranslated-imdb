There is a lot to be said for this cartoon; The backgrounds are rich, lushly colored and finely full art deco detail complete. Animation is currently up to standard studio standards, which are undoubtedly greater than today. <br /> <br /> Music: It's definitely not for the standard standards of Scott Bradley. Although this is probably an inspiration for a "Great Gatsby" setting, it ends slowly, sleepy, repetitive and unchanging (not as repetitive and monotonous as Beethoven's fifth symphony certifications). Many people (including me) have closed their eyes when they do not, and the average viewer has a lot of missed cartoon scene. <br /> <br /> The storyline: I am giving the secrets that the plot is not already present - the country is good, the city is bad. This is the most common thing in animated and live films from this era. It is a false place for rural experiences that do not exist, and is still reflected in a similar nostalgia for "values".
