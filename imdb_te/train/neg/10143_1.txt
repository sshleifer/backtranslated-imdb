<br /> It's terrible boring, without any interesting action scenes, not Seagal really in this effort - he fat and his voice is dubbed once again. <br /> <br /> We are very sorry for co-stars 3rd routers. <br /> <br /> The director's direction is very weak and it is not surprising that he is also responsible for another couple of Seagal Stinkers (Shadow Man & Atlas FORCE). The writer co-authored by Seagal does not find himself utterly hypocritical. <br /> <br /> IMDb $ 12M This boring loading cost of old tosh - If I know that these numbers are correct, I will know as big as a somewhere near that amount of money. <br /> <br /> The flight of FURY is actually a shot for a shot remake <br /> <br /> Michael Dudikoff's film block Thunder is better than this trippe. ***** from 1/2 *
