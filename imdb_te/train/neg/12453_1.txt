I was a big Linda Carter-Wonder Woman Fan when I was on the science fiction channel. I was disappointed.It is only a Wonder Woman movie titled. A proper costume [she must make big changes or order] and the plot runs like a poor James Bond. The comic book heroine has succeeded in winning, ie, supernatural strength or decisive commitment. Bad dream. I do not think that Kathy is attractive anyway. I can not waste your time.
