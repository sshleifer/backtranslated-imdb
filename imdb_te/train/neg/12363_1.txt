It is one of those films trying to ride a wave of martial arts. I guess as Billy Jack. However, while Billy Jack has a famous martial art scene, you will not have anything in it. We are introduced to the star described as Judo learned in the Navy. I'm in the Navy and they do not remember any significance in judo when they are pretty stuck in boxing. As a result, James Macwere contradicts why Judo is a reason why he is easily defeated by a state wrestler's wrestler. Lame.
