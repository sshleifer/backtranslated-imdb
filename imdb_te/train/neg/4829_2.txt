As a general film viewer I can not say I was enjoying this movie. It's not too emotional for a drama, not too gripping for a thriller, not too fast for an action. Plus, the few moments of the film are rarely reliable. Well, I realized that soldiers are out of their minds, but it is hard to believe that a person will risk his life, and in the midst of hostile city Karzak, and a professor's wife fled, without question (in the right way). It looks like an animation or terrible romance, but it's supposed to be a serious film about the war .. There are many parts like this, so the whole picture makes it an impression that it's a raw preview of an image, and <br /> <br /> The producers seem to want to create an emotional brave soldier, but these 'curves' of his psychology are just Hajamainaviga found. <br /> <br /> This film leaves a question on my head: Why? Why did they give an Oscar? Why six And IMHO It's a very thrilling piece of image :)
