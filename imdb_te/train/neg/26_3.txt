Assuming it ends with a direct video release, I have to cancel all the costs of this title. Unless you're bored of good, well-executed movies. I watched this last night at AFI Dallas, I stayed for 20 minutes and I was not overlooked anymore (about the plot, the director was not about insulting ... it's awkward). When you shoot 5 minutes into the film (shot, the front window of the trash can be removed before the shots ... then the window will break with the first shot), things are bad. <br /> <br /> Let's say this is only an index of upcoming things. <br /> <br /> I am leaving you all the details, but it's disappointing that if you look at half-comede acting from him by half-donkey acting by Michael Madsen. And the rape scene ... Christ! The rape should never be used in the scene. <br /> <br
