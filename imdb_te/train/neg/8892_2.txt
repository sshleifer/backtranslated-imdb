Accept, this version Shakespeare upfront is insulting! No one can work except nurse who is my fav! Juliet is a good young man, but it is not possible to give her emotional depth and we can not always connect with her. She's doing the scene when she is thinking about drinking her sleeping potion is worse ... God will stop listening! I poured out her mouth to shut her down! Anthony Andrews ... miles! Considering his other great films (Bridgeshead Revisited, Evanho, Scarlet Pimpernell), he is a very shocker in this regard. And do not get me started on Romeo ... puhleasssssee! This is still good if you look to see every Romeo and Juliet made in film history. Olivia and Leonard's version is still the best, then Lesley Howard's version and the current Leo and Clare!
