It's like a red wine which is the sign of a classic movie. This film is not a cabernat and is certainly not Casablanca. Now I agree with other critics that the children in the film are an unfortunate mutation, which now spreads us in sit-coms and the conversation is stilted and preachy. <br /> <br /> The wisdom comes after sixty years of history. While on the Rain, writer Lillian Helman exposed his bidellusque plagiarist with his "Real Life Story" "Julia" from his book "Pentimento". In the most alarming of Western-based USSR apologetics, her background is clear in drama and film, their military superiority in Spain, to move the United States to protect the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism. <br /> As one reviewer correctly states, this is not an American-friendly play and film. The film describes the senseless folly of the intellectual forces that created the American left, and now the Daily Kos and Michael Moore's full full-fledged left parties have purchased conspiracy theories.
