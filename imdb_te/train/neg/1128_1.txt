This film is one of the worst I have ever seen. Pure Drewwell. How someone developed a connection with the heroine, or has empathy for her, is beyond me. I see the case history of a schizoid person with border personality disorder. <br /> <br /> If you think this is a good thing, , She missed a mental institution and was treated for two days with anti-psychotic drugs, or just the streets and allowed a bag to become a woman.The other characters in the film did not sell anything - and she tried to help her in the quest for her actress - Any effort to convince her to have her iki features more than speaks for their diagnosis.
