We bought this series on DVD because of the lovely reviews we saw here. Sometimes acting, directing, and writing are very good, so I gave them three stars. In fact, they are very intelligent and we do not see the campaign that is streamlined smoothly in the series. With a discerning view, the Fox (Fox) News Network sees the total exposure of radical rightwing beliefs. To avoid giving any spoilers stop I opted out all of the dozens of specific cases. Brief scrutiny in platforms found here in IMDb reveals everything about gun control from network violence to provide "infomercials" and is called news, the best of which are the actors in this world. As a brilliant example of why they should use all sorts of torture using the Attorney General Gonzalez, they saw a lot of shows and finally disgusted with disgust. The series manages men and women homosexuals in subtle ways with plot devices that show nasty people. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this program is used by future historians as proof that America lost its way to the beginning of the century. <br /> <br /> As a student in history, I created this campaign in the league with a campaign created by Goebbels for Hitler and some campaigns by Hollywood to American audiences during World War II. <br /> <br /> If you want to use it as your teaching tool, you will be able to help all your students understand what kind of ad campaigns are. Be sure to buy a cheap use copy so that ultrasonic wight wingers can be prevented from producing the dust at the Fox Network.
