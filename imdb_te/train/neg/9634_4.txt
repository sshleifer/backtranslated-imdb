The rating I gave to BOOM is the only reason for the wonderful photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, it is only for the Elizabethth Taylor (her step down) and Hardcore slaves of Richard Burton (his fault factor). Tennessee Williams wrote "The Milk Railstest Stop Here Anormor" and likes him to follow his drama - but apparently, he is the only one. Taylor hated it and Burton needed money. <br /> <br /> Which is the "must see" thing among Taylor fans? But if you sit through this without a drink in your hand, you will go ahead with me. Unfortunately, the film's film Taylor finally got a bad deal as an actress after winning two actors. For Burton, it is equally bad and critics call it a bomb. Judge for you if you dare.
