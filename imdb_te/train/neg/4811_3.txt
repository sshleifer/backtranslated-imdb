I saw this video's Canadian video tape "The Witching", which went on to New York State. The audio is very bad, I increased it to 7/8 and it sounded and the soundtrack often overwhelmed the dialogue. Orson Welles was more bad than usual, and his speech was driven by some and others' resonances. His voice is distorted by a ghostly person who repeats. <br /> <br /> A group of witches or a group of satanites (the ultimate credits group is not intended to represent any real team!) is a dance where they are naked and aborted by a toy stab. The woman with abortion and her husband goes into a town called "Lilith" where he is employed at the toy factory. <br /> <br /> On the way to Lilith, her husband is impatient with some. Although the AKAs of this film are clearly "The Toy Factory", we can not see it and it only occasionally suggests. To her questions about what his new boss wants Mr. Katow to know about their religious persuasion. He drives aggressively and drives another car out of the road. After police arrives, she takes a picture of a falling car, the second of several handmade dolls in the film. <br /> <br /> It turns out Mr. Cato and all the towns are witches and the ones they caused her miscarriage, although she did not realize it. <br /> <br /> Some of the images in this image have some effect, but there is not much in the whole movie. The film does not seem to be a bit of a bit, and this is no doubt due to the re-editing and new footage combined. According to the final credits, the original version was called Nechromancy - A Life for a Life. The magic of the DVD is able to watch two versions on a disc, but it is probably not a priority to release the film.
