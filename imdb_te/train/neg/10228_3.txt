Be honest I heard this pretty bad before I hear it, but there is nobody else to influence my opinions, in fact I have a chance to see some trend! Before I could see the bull whip, I had something to do with Rhonda Fleming and that gorgeous eyes. The film is not very good, and is very morally untrue, all the characters are corrupt and shifty in a way shape or form, inspired by all greed or narcissistic triumphs, if the surrounding picture can do justice to all this well and good vicious people, and put a tatt climax chiding picture created. It's not unfortunate, and in the end your eyes fill with sugar, you can not help that you are being tricked by watching a bad image, no one in the cast comes out of the credit, the main guy Guy Madison is strongly <br /> <br /> Very nice Rhonda for me 3/10 Anyone can recommend
