Finnbaughn's performance (who looks strangely fun) and Ed Harris (the smallest) Ed Harris is great, unlike Connery in his role and does not appear to be rhetorical in an 80yr old man. Actually the screenplay does not make sense; Imagine 60 minutes. Happy ending plot plus sudden turning attachment without any reasoning structure for roles. It is much more dangerous than the screenplay and can be good for screening purposes in screenwriters schools. The more you remember this strong impression of this stamp. Death penalty is not a problem here, but it is initially a factor; It's sort of folding without further comment. Subject-matter and environment are good.
