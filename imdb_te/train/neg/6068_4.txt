Vodka Lemon is a very lovely, very uneven Armenian film. While it is reasonably well-made, the film does not have any genuine "jing", instead of relying on several scenes, it's easy for a surprising art director. The film has a little bit of motion picture brightness, unfortunately, they are an appropriate image of their genius. Being a dark comedy and dark comedy, the vodka lemon leaves many opinions and is ultimately unsatisfying. You may laugh, but these moments are very low in the snow-covered landscapes and seemingly unexplained series of bus challenges. A great effort is made in the absence of narrative synthesis.
