What? Do you think Jamie Fox is funny? Does he really believe he is funny? It looks his belief in being funny. The man does not have any identity ... You immediately find his idols, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, he really struggles to imitate many of his movies. The only problem is that he is bad and uneven, and he looks like some dengel, where Maco's ** t attitude and suddenly Martin Lawrence goes as funny and clumsy-silly comic. There is no personal touch of everything, he does not contribute anything to the effort he sells, and I'm sure he's nothing to say personally. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am really hoping for Hollywood, and blacks in the United States are good to enter a super star like Dan Chedel, but perhaps Don Cheads is a curious Jimi.
