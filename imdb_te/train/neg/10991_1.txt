My brother is an avid DVD collector. He took a look at the cover (two models of toilets) and had to add to his collection. I've felt obliged to sit by and sit with him to see what has changed the most collapsing image (I use the loose term). I did not get to know my brother with my brother, I'm sure he should be blamed for his fist fraud. The whole of the movie, Michael Clarke Duncan, appeared in a scene, and decided to show everything (about four) throughout the film "Motion Picture Producer". In fact, the whole picture follows this suite too. The fact that the DVD contains footage is a shock. (But I went to bed without seeing). There is no surprise, I found this disc without its case behind the TV a week later.
