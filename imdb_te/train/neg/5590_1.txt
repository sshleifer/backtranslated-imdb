Terrible picture. About the old muscular painter hanging around with a young girl. Irritating. Tatham O'Neill walks through his movements, and has some of the most lofty lines in film history. Richard Burton is close to death in this film, and we're supposed to believe he will be "sixty good". This acting is very bad, as well as the plot. The characters are terrible like the story. It's hard to tell anyone in the movie, it's fun, except for Larry Evans, who plays a man in a porno theater that hits on the Tatum. This film really wasted time. If you're a tatum fan like me, I first rented - please do not look at this film. She's really bad, and you'll probably wonder if the paper moon is a fluke. It's not because Bad News Bears and Little Darlings are, she knows she can work well, but still, this movie is not rented. And if you're Burton's fan, he is good looking at something, and not the fossil.
