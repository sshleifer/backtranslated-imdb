I'm ready to give you a lot from the late-spring / summer action flush movies, but they are usually very reasonable payment (ie cool special effects, interesting plot turns, comic value, Steve Busmi, etc.). This film, however, is nothing. Eva Longoria's shimmering of several minutes short of the thrill (a film of Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is a difficult problem, such as plotting, suspense, back story, character development, continuity, etc. I like to come up with clear, but quite frankly I've forgotten most of this movie. <Br /> I was kicking myself myself for spending the entire time in the theater, I spent a 24 hour season watching DVD on the DVD. Save money on this money. Really really, except, really like Eva Longoria's split.
