I'm finished looking at the overboard. I have sent a copy of this film to Iraq and I want to make them see. I also tried to see this as a blind woman and she turned it off like 20 minutes. Did Adam Sandler not find a better project than this? For writing, if you want to call it, that responsibility must be forced to watch this film forever in hell !! I have read somewhere that the budget for this film is $ 10,000 and they are under. Was Walmart good deal in this regard? This garbage big big bin is sitting on the floor of each store selling. The only good thing about this film is that you can use the DVD as a coaster or a friend can apply it, but they are not your friend anymore!
