Another weak third-season entry, 'Is There Into Truth No Beauty?' However, at least one key plot element is very different and Spok says it is lovely. The main character is an alien to be maintained in a black box, because his appearance is very scary, which leads men madly. It's very bad that the episode can not live up to this wonderful campus. Apparently, I think, it's a mistake by the alien ever 'show', as its original visage itself is almost up to such a discouraging set up; All standard episode psychedelic light displays we use are used for a variety of different episodes, usually through a ship's magnetic storm or something. In any event, Mr. Spock can at least temper the appearance of Colos, if only Spock is wearing a special armor. (For a long time, the alien's name was 'Carlos', which I found jokes, but I would turn it off.) Spock needs to combine with Colos at a time. This can be achieved, but when Spock / Colossus goes back to the mind-mid edge, by Golly, Spock forgets his face. Oh ho. He goes crazy but in the end Colossus assistant recovering with the aid of a blind woman who has mental powers. It may be really bizarre, exciting episode, but it is poorly directed and is another bad show in the series's last season.
