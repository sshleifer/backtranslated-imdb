A small town will attack a group of bloodthirsty vampires. <br /> <br /> "Darkness" released in 1993 earned something of a culture. Seeing why loaded on other budget cult horror flicks like "Dead Next Door" and "The Children of Ravensback" (and I understand that I'm loading) and it's power and enthusiasm. <br /> While it is true, it is not unfortunate to protect it. The film was shot in Super 8, so the film is wheat and dark, which is the most difficult thing (it's great if the main characters are blurred by the terrible mullet). The soundtrack, the annoying Casio fame and the more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what does this mean with any horror moods and bad Death Metal?) Does not expect an Oscar's worthy shows, acting is sometimes definitely a clutter hour, actors sometimes feel confused <br /> Finally, I would like to say that no budget gorefest fans like it As a think. But for everyone, there is more meat in the rib cage.
