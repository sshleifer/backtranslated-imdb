Seeing this stinker has a brutal and unjust punishment by Sandler. Really slow and painful death. <br /> <br /> Wall Street has bought a DVD in $ 5.88 bin. <br /> <br /> "How can I get my money back?" <br /> <br /> The most unforgiving thing about this film is that the boat does not take place! <br /> <br> Best structured advice: Mystery Comedy Theater. Some guy and his Muppet-machines in the Seismic Channel that you know provoked the most unwanted horror flicks (Mystery Science Theater). Immediately, a funny program will spin off and have this picture. Without the ridiculous irony of this train wreck, I'm afraid the audience will actually follow Sandler with ice picks and chains.
