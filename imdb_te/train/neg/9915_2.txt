I finished the "Dark Chamber" aka "under supervision" and I'm stunned. Surprisingly, this is not through the film, but by some reviews I've been impressed by it. The storyline is well-lost with plot-holes, and a lot of action is a very flat one, which makes it ideal to classify as a comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Justin Mom's Despite the alarms of living in the house with a pain killer-addictive mother to live with his Cop dad, I warned Dad that my head was shaking and laughing. When a young woman is murdered, Justin suspects tenants living in adjacent apartments. With the help of a pair of pals, he installs secret cameras to keep tabs on these folks. The truth begins to hear, Justin finds the unexpected secret. <br /> <br /> Felicia Rose HOT! I killed one additional star or two here, she repulsed a bit, but there was no such luck. The film's potential savings were kind. Eric Conley Justin was very simple, I thought, and I'm not surprised to see him in the future. <br /> <br /> In the general premise of the film, even though the clips are suffering, perhaps the humorous "performances" of the lead characters, especially Alexandra Etil (Kaila) and David H Rig (Justin's father). The horror! <br /> <br /> I have nothing against low budget films. In fact, I believe that the independent film is our only hope for a suitable image in the coming days. I'll slack low budget films when it comes to special effects, lighting, musical score and overall picture quality. I do not give permission for stick figure acting and Swiss cheese lovers' script. There are fewer low budget films. Sadly, this is not one of them. I can not help but suspect that some of the critics who have praised the "Dark Chamber" here are some who supplement their product.
