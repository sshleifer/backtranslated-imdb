When I started watching this film, I saw Dude from Buffy, Junker and how good he was to live in the movies. Now a weird movie I have to stand in and stand in a mood of sort, given that I have a good dose of weird as David Lynch movies, twin peaks, lost highway etc. This one however reminded me crazy websites about mockingly sure about the conspiracy theory in the sense. I mean the evil forces will come to Nazi's people who conspired with America to make a holy trio? With Hitler flying saucers and lizard people, I am surprised that they did not mention empty space in the film. If you look like a heroine of 60 grams with this film, it will make some sort of sense, but I do not really pardon the drugs that I do not condone this movie. So good ol 'Xander might get another acting job so it should be gray, shredded and forgotten. It was not his acting, it was good, but the script just did not make any sense. Sorry.
