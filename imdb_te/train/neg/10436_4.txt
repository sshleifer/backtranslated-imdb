In the 1930s, an alert for documentary films about the remote parts of the world, the ancient peoples with wild animals, exotic landscapes and extraordinary cultures. Despite the logistics of transporting a motion group to a distant and dangerous place, even though 'em alive (with cinematic footage), these films have been made more than traditional Hollywood features ... because there are no expensive sets, costumes, or high-priced film actors. <br /> <br /> The most successful manufacturers of such films (artfully and financially) are Martin E. Johnson and his wife Osa's team. Events clearly demonstrated in Africa and Asia). Johnson's safari movies are very popular, many parodies ... most notably Wheeler & Woolly's "So Is This Africa", which plays a very sexy Esther Muir Mrs. Johnson-Martini (instead Martin Martin J. Johnson, geddit?). Although many other filmmakers at this time produced safari documentaries, Johnson's movies became more popular in the genre, because they were heavily based on humor. In Johnson's documentaries it's very significant (I hope) in perspective: funny little wheat or yellow people can easily see two idiots faced by two brilliant difficulties. White Bwana Johnson and his wife. <br /> <br /> The existence of an exact property of these films is Osa Johnson. She is ten years older than her husband, and she acts as a teenager to be her daughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "It is not attractive to the impressive elegant Esther muir, Osa Johnson, who liked the camera in front of the camera in all of the films that co-produced with her husband, perhaps Johnson's best of the film, and the shots of the Congo are interesting and in 1930 It has a historic value as evidence and strokes of pygmies and other locals The best (and funniest) scenario in 'Congolilla' Osja Johnson is an advanced range trying to teach a jazz dance to some pygmy women (Dancing Block Bottom, no less ... Bob Hope Daisy and Violet Hilton and Composeion, who teach the twins.) Wearing junks, riding shoes and pythom helmet, Osa Johnson At the same time, she stands staring at her, wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish, which is a very funny scene, but it has some unpleasant references. Osa Johnson is doing a dance invented by black Americans: black Africans have naturally suggested that rhythm can be performed by using a natural rhythm that I expected. <br /> <br /> I would rate the Congolese 4 to 10 points. The film was a little bit about African life in the 1930s and more about American cultural awareness in the decade.
