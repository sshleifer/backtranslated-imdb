As a thriller director, the film is enjoyed by the critics. Shot with perhaps the low end digital camera with 35mm adapter for the DOF. Editing is good acting and the sound effects are not at the top. I gave a 7 for an indie movie, but the story is not interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are afraid of it, </ P> <p> <p> This film is good in the 50s <br /> <br /> The film is about a family with a dry garden, and it is.
