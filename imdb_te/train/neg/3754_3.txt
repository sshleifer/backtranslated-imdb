As a longtime fan of all the Star Trek series I have found this dismal episode, and Will Ricker's exploits are a positive (and more romantic) and negative (pain and a band's death), a money-saving device, and their "Battle Shows" (all scenes happen in the company Episodes). Diana Muldar (at least twice in the original series) gave her a better performance than Dr. Kate Pulaski. Trusted viewers (Star Trek world, any other kind?) Also fell a little bit. It is the second episode of the second season; Thus, the season ended "with no bang" but "a whimper."
