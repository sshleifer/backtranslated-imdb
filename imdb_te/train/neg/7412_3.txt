I love the cheesy horror feelings. If acting sub-par or monsters are dark, I do not care. The rest of the movies, except the most memorable concept, finally liked the film. Look, I do not need a 10 page article or a sign with uppercase letters explaining a plot for me. But dark floors "What about this movie?" Subject to the newest (annoying) level. <br /> <br /> The film is not spectacular or horrific, but if you think you are killing an hour and / or if you feel angry and confused, then rent this winner.
