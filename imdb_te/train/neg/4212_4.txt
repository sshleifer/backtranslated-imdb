<br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film the film is excellent with excellent sound and some good humor, but once the film changes in animation, it quickly loses its appeal. <br /> <br /> The colors in the animation are much less contrary. It does not look at least, at least on VHS. At one point it breaks down and looks great, but often not, the characters come and go very quickly. For example, I would have liked to see more of "Moby Dick". When the film begins to drag, however, it will be completed with the dragon's entrance, and the film will be completed. <br /> <br /> Overall, in the past decades, it has not been able to compete or adapt to great animated films.
