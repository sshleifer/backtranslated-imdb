William Fredkin's "Classic" is a very overtered film and, in my opinion, is not that time or a surprise, every horror director thinks "Exorcist" is a complete riddle. Yet another clean rip-off here, this Spanish Spanish, is rarely repeating the story of a little girl who gained pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschchee (I must admit that I feel very hot here) plays an honorable priest consulted by John Gibson, because his sister Leila's behavior has changed dramatically since she met her new boyfriend. Firstly the priest did not believe it but when John's body was discovered with its neck, Leela's demonic behavior becomes more recognizable ... "Exorcism" is not only quite unrealistic, it is also an unsustainable boring image! Here Naschie and director Juan Bosch have an open opportunity to make a full-blown religious backlash movie of shocks and gore, and as a result, you have a sleepless and total bloodless play! The last twenty minutes have some atmospheric conditions, although they are very stupid, and very beautifully filmed female nudity and sleaze. The absence of the budget is enough to prove that he has already proven to make money shortages because Paul Naschie has already proven. It's just an awful movie, the end of the story. Other European "The Exorcist" Rip-offs "The Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and they also absorb!
