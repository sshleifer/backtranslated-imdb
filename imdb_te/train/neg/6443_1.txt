I'm one of the few freesters watching Steve's video. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a real documentary of Michael Moore's visit to my local school, UVSC. Another liberal, slash-and-burn effort for the Slam Conservatives and the Local Religious Community. <br /> <br /> Previously surprisingly, the previous '10 votes' were posted here. Did they even watch the video? Goli Geeb Batman, which is to rank with the All The President's Men! Their ratings are as clear as bias in the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, IMDb is similar to the stacking of the vote at the IMDb. My vote will help balance it.
