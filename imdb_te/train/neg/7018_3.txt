Completely forgetting. Especially due to weaker acting. This was the first film I saw with Docs Shepherd. To my surprise, he has been in the late 90's. I thought I was an actor, because his performance was very bad. I can say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I looked good in her other films, she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv Diane Keaton is not the type of actress that can make a fiery, emotional personality, but she is pretty surprised to see her lines in Whisper style. It did not have a very good chemistry between acting, and Diane Keaton felt the same way. She was an amazing actress, but the film was a bit over the top. She wanted to get this film as soon as possible. I can not blame her.
