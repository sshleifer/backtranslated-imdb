Although I am a well-produced film, I do not limit movies that escape the boundaries, and often do not break "the rules" that I do not enjoy. It is true that the director of the film Pasolini has broken the rules of the film. <br /> <br /> But the work of Pasolini is visually impressed, but it is actually less than the actual screen. And the cinematography of jumping up of his films is a result of artistic selection as a result of amateur cinematography. This is related to DECAMERON. Pasolini is often preferred to use non-actors, and although many directors do so with the outcome, Pasolini will direct his actors but not actors. It's also true for DECAMERON. Pasolini often has shocked audiences, images that are designed to offend or induce. Such items can often be used with a staggering effect, but such items in the hands of Pasolini rarely contribute anything to movies. It's also true for DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I also understand many people who worship Pasalini movies. Nevertheless, I have never met anyone, I am never able to read or write about his or her writing, which means that such a will or appreciation me. He was an ambitious director himself alone, with no choice but to "break up the rules" by his choice of skill alone - and firstly intellectual of his day, "the boldness of existence", and thus ensuring him to be just a film producer in bad habits. I recognized his work as tedious, wisest, and vengeful. And this, too, is the truth of DECAMERON. Actually the image of every Passover is also sad, the truth, my misfortune to endure it.
