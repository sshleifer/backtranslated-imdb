I do not mean building a second part of the film like "My Girl". "My Girl" is a very good movie but it's ridiculous to make a second part of a character, one of the main characters (Macaulay Kulkin dies as Thomas J.). The story ended after the first film. I was surprised when someone tried to try to make the story happen. That's wise!
