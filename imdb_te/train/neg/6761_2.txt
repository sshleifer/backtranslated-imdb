Be honest. A film school project made without budget and "real" actors, this is an interesting interesting picture. Something released on DVD for an innocent viewer, it produces very little product. I will historically change channels and if you accidentally catch this film, it will take my eye and attention for some time. I was going to get the right film production and bought this DVD, that is, the movie, I was disappointed. This is a video tape TV drama, which has seven sixty serials, but with some charm. Unlike the famous Mr. Redfield (director), other actors from the campus (actually a bit too old) or members of the director's house, not only from acting fences, make-up artist or hairdresser (one on permanent bangs on Bengal or a mullet Cap is too long since creating 1840s). It burned everything using a motionless mounted camera in a small, bear studio, sometimes using the Blue Screen for backgrounds. The synthesizer rabbit insulted a "romantic" concert in more than one occasion of the audience's ears. The film tries to be "like a dream", in fact it has changed the scenes to a collage that is not just editing (and I believe, the standards do not begin). Every now and then there are interesting conversations, but overall it is a pretty dull and two-dimensional product in more than one way, without any way to the intellectual from any member of the board or group. How did "ART" try to see movies in the 80s? Mr. Redfield is a better actor than an actor.
