The true shame of "The Gathering" is not in bad acting, nor is it in the vicious story of the wicked. The real shame is worse than the series it started, although it is a major attraction: Takashi. I would like to see Laurel Takashi at the room with Surana Ivanova and see for five minutes. She has that irony, that deft, double-grown personality is unstable and lovable at once. Sadly, the "Babylon 5" pilot film has a very fictitious story that has been murdered. Patricia Tallman - who has never been better returned to the series until after - luckily here was better with the age of Lita Alexander, who is a little more than a whiny, tiresome telepath. I will leave you with one last thought - why is the outer space frog man (though she is a woman) Thanks to the sky as seen later in the Minar Barry show.
