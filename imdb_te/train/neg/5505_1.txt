Shazbot, this is in trouble. In fact, here's the list of 100: 1) a failed return for Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels play the same role played in the live 101 Dalmatian remake which is basically not too juicy to play. He is definitely a funny way to promote his Purple Rose Theater ... 3. Disneyneffeff. 4.) Jet Lee for Bob Hoskins in Wallace Shawn Unleashed is another disappointment for Disney. The original Martian Rey Wallstone from the TV series, a bit of the film (read "Camo") and two years later, Lupus died. Coincidence? 6.) Exceptional special effects. Seriously - awful. 7. -100.) It was a bad voice, voiced by the different Wayne Wayne Knight ("Newman!"). My favorite scene? HA! HA hey, ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... weve! ... good. You - you are a joker. Well, close this review with silence for the frightening death of this franchise, and if you like, Disney has not forgotten this mockery and can not do crazy things like Mork's movie simulation Mindy "played by Tim Allen .............. ............................... ............
