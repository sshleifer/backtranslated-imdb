When you see this movie, "Yes, it's worse than that," there are some good points for the movie, you have to look at the drunken youngsters and have serious deaths. A girl in thin underwear, having dirty concierge, cranky doctor, and absolutely no humiliation, getting dirty rats, and grotesquely massive, dumb jocks, i can'nt personally wait these drunken fools rat, I root for rat Rooting for the time, it had a nice premise, the first part of the film, while with a scientific description of rodents I think that it is offended when dumb drunken horny teenagers come into play, in my opinion the rat, one that is lost, her name is Brenda, so is fake, a CGi rat, looked like a guy wearing a beaver suit , This is pretty schlocky, lame, but not completely horribble,
