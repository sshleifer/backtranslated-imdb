Kurt Thomas cast Jonathan Cabot as a gymnast of a gymnast, a Nintaz group for hunting a special game, but Ninjas does not retain an opportunity, especially a gymnast in Cabot! The whole gymcotta is taken by a hello bad movie, unfortunate acting, the awful script of God and really inefficient direction producing quality rather than human standards, although this movie is terrible, really really funny. With such a dialogue I said, "I know I've beaten them!" Or "h !, by yourself!" Only Add Gymkata more then acquired mock value. Also, (the intellectual) heroine Gita Mataram is the gymnast of the film, the heat of the moment is damaging.
