Unfortunately in this review the spoiler is nothing to spoil the film. B. Matt√©e never used to do the masterpiece, but he used to do his job, making him a fun urotral director with humor and integrity. But in the past 10 years he lost it. The film is empty, the first time you have nothing to wake us from the deep sleep that you sink after 10 minutes. What sex, what blood (it's about it snap?), Which actors, no dialogues, is just as bad as a 90'TV film. His past is much worse than cannibals and zombies myths. Rest in Shanti Bruno, Rams, LRhor Inferno, Virus, Cruel jaws, and other gems you'll never forget: unless you have B Mattei with a new image of Jess Franco's soul, this good artist's career keep track of your old pictures .
