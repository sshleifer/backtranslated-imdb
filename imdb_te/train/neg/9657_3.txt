1) I am not a weapon expert, but I can see the difference between the WWI and the US General in the WWII. The movie can be found in the movie "M1 Garand" (invented in 1932!), The standard "1903 Springfield" (aka "Silent Death"), private to WWII. Difference - M1 can load 1,5 times higher ammunition and 3 times more fire rate! M1 is semi-automatic, requiring a Springfield reload after each shot. Little difference? 2) German Army Uniforms have been borrowed since 1940. Especially - helmets. German helmets can not even see one in the movie until the WWI is up to the end. And if we do less searches in the archives - how true is this true story? I am surprised, how many "honesty" directors are involved in promoting a lot less?
