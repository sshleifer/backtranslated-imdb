It looked like I was watching this film when I came out because I was a huge SNL fan. When my boyfriend and I went to see it, people came out of the opening show "Do not waste your money!" <br /> <br /> There are some funny bits (laser bra 2000, root boy slim), but most of these are the most amusing 1 hour performance. This is very bad. <br /> When the opera singer arrived, many people got up and walked out. It laughs at me because I realized that O'Donogh was just pressing people's buttons with this picture. Or else he is just insane. Anyway - you do not need to waste your time watching, it's that bad.
