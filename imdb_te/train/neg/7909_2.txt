<br /> <br /> This image comes from 0f to 7. This is one of the worst films I've seen over the years. Acting is not very bad, the storyline (if you can call it) is just bad. Everyone knows what happens in the first five minutes. It is not a bad thing if you can attract audiences up to that moment. However, that is not the case. There is no action, no suspense, and a spark between the 2 leading actors. It's unfortunately my time is waste, and definitely waste my money. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
