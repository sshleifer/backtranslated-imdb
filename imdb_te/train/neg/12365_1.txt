I think it's the best proof that this piece of garbage can ruin good ideas, why not all American animators think these days good stories stupid GI JOE versions of kids ??? Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history, but they are not created as Xtreme, I come and mean !!! Tiny Toons is a great example of how it can be updated with an old idea without losing an old attraction, but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that only hay kids wants to create a cheap idiotic presentation because of love !! ! Children loves super heroes right ??? The whole presentation is a waste of time in which we are trying to be very difficult to copy the series like Batman when we see this time in the new versions of the Looney Tunes but superhero, this is not too bad noise but this problem is the result of the animated series, or new justice league ,? Flash (Road Runner) or Superman's Bad Copies (Someone Bugs Bunny) The problem is not to make Looney Tunes dramatic, they are considered funny! As I said before sucks this series, and many wonders why anime is taking over the world ??? The program tries to dramatic and action pack but you can make some old and animated ones, if you want to see a better upgrade of the old show watch of small tonnes, an example that gives you a chance to come back to life. Old characters, but respecting a good story and original sources. I think a very bad show has already passed, another corporate wise decision.
