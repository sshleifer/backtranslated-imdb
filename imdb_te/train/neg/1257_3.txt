If there is one thing that makes me very angry at seeing a bad image, it is well known by filmmakers. The "re-imagining" feature of this "plas of the apes" may use some assumptions to say nothing about the essentials of character development. Noah, the girl in the original planet, better development role than Daena in this version, not to mention her single word for all. <br /> <br /> It is better for Tim Burton, who has such a spectacular visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humor from this product. Development of the plot. The first large mistake allowed humans to speak. It's the difference in the original image * made * all the * basic difference between monkeys and men. Although he is mute, Heston's Taylor recognizes that it is different from other humans is the ability to communicate. In the current film, Marc Wahlberg promotes human slaves revolt, but their lack of redeemation and there is no reason to recover their ransom already. They have the ability to communicate to create skilled tool-users and plans and can not make silent humans. No one needs to protect them from the stars. In fact, as technology technology comes from civilization, and without any technical knowledge (in advance) he finds himself without any technical knowledge, Wahlberg is used, not viable, but vulnerable to being there. <br /> <br /> It is very sad that Helena Bonham Carter worked hard to create a kind of spark between him and the irresistible brick wall Marc Wabberg. <br /> <br /> Dana at Danson (Wahlbergberg), after some began to show interest, humans were practically neglected in the third act. The boy suddenly shifted from the background to a passionate gang-free freedom-fight. It develops the poor character. (Estella Warren, particularly, looked as if she had more great ability than she was given in the script). <br /> <br /> "Michael Clarke Duncan 's performance, especially on men, is very exciting, he has a lot of emotional eyes (why he is very good in Green Mile) And the decorative design allowed him to utilize it completely, but the monkey ladies did not appear on earth, not a human or a human being, but the realistic looking miner jumps like Flash Gordon's rocket V: There are no jumping monkeys that just might be removed from the catapult, they do not have long-range grace of real monkeys, secondly, mixing poor sound - Gorillas roar is obviously from some animal, perhaps feline, making them ridiculous and unrealistic. /> <br /> In the original movie, various "human" things monkeys and ka ("I do not know a monkey I do not like." "Human see, do the human!") Here, monkeys just do thing-of-fact-exactly 21st century humans, and it's no joke. <br /> At the end of the film, I was more afraid than "V-Gear from Star Trek". The first of all, the errors were read in the distant past with the Roman letters, because the name of the toilet is in its semi-hidden form. Secondly, the mystery inscription that gives the name is merely sand, which makes Wahlberg away brushes, which may have happened cent centuries ago. This moment, the movie is much worse than the most vulgar ending. <br /> <br /> The Things of Nature are typical of most science fiction films today. Back in the 60s and 70s, they generally do not have the budget to make beautiful futuristic sets, but real themes and ideas are really science fiction. I was thinking in 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1967 Planet of the Apes, THX1138, Soyland Green, Silent Running and 1972 Solaris. The first Planet of Apple also utilized the experimental scientifically valid and physically possible method of traveling the first time. However, the film is only about every nasty science fiction storyline: straight storm, storms and insect holes from Star Trekki; Solar system and their lunar planets are clearly visible together with large globes (from any planet, all other bodies, even their own moons, are just points); A traditional rocket powered shuttle that runs from Saturn to Earth, in minutes instead of minutes; Two thousand years of gunfire has been fired and will work in full and print the hero. To say nothing of a comfortable bulletproof interior glass door. <br /> In the contemporary setting, you explain why you're bullet-proof, but "science fiction" because you do not have it! <br /> <br /> Overall, Burton's most disappointing movie.
