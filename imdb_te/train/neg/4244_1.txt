In contrast to my principles, I first came up with one end because I saw this art "art", and still under stronger impressions. <br /> <br /> The film was terrible, and did not write about it, "44 Minutes" illness suffered me sick. <br /> <br /> The fact that I have paid is not correct for me, as well as the image that qualifies for the highest consumer rating. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this picture? "44 Minutes" - It has a fashionable title. The first one is thinking about "15 Minutes", which is a very good movie in my book, but still quite small, and in fact both are somewhat comparable. But, good luck it has, they share things with their worst properties. They have both Mr. Oleg Tacturov, who makes clear popularity expectations and biases with his strong Russian voice. His purpose is to appeal to the Cold War mind. Oh, we do not miss good old times. Now, he does not mean that he is a bad actor, I do not confirm his true performance yet, but he is not a real person here, he's like a motto. Still someone was able to fully grasp how such things were overwhelmed. Here modern American Xenophobia can be identified. Rotharov mentioned in the film that his companion Romanians were not Germans and that they were really ridiculous in America. Do we think the greatest desire of the turbulent duo should become "true" Americans? <br /> Then, the media has a problem. Yes, most of the things we learned came from cameras, interviews, and reporters. The director will have to experience a 44 minute rhythm of imagination. Instead he is inexpensive at the TV show with interviews throughout the film, trying to invent Wheel. The center of the media in 15 Minutes is one. A teacher is referred to as a teacher as a student, but it deserves a special comment, now we're focusing on 44 Minutes. So, I am trying to figure out the purpose of this movie. What is this To glorify weapons to give audiences a good time? To glorify policemen? To display violence Oh Yes, the officer gives the Bible to the younger. So why should it promote peace and understanding after all? I think so, but do not ask me. <br /> Ah, Michael Madsen. I agree, I'm a big fan. I was hoping he was a bright point, but I was wrong. This is not his fault. <br /> Finally, one of the worst lines I've ever heard is the "pistol" in the end of the film compared to "pistols". <br /> Level 1-10, I give a pure, unilulterated 1.
