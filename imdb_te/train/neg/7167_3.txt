Show another trailer trailer for it, and decided to rent it when it comes. Boy, I was disappointed! The story is very boring, acting (aside from Christopher Walken) is bad, and I can not really care less about the characters, except from what Norah's husband wants to look thrashed. The character of Christopher Walken is that no sadness!
