My roommate number, no, no soundtrack came into soundtrack and she was going to listen to non stop. It's totally dedicated to me, and I think the songs are irrevocable, especially famous, I wanted to be happy, but I'm not happy ... but the soundtrack is not about any idea. Another day I saw a copy of the video store and thought it was the longest lost version of the film. I'm surprised that the soundtrack is so beautiful. Unfortunately the video I saw has a lot of songs that I have never seen anywhere else. Now I have never seen the 1930s version of music, but this version was sadly disappointing because it was really bad because it was very low and practically no dancing and sound. A lot of time. The highlights of this movie are really the fashion of the late 1940s. Nanette rabbit ears and Kansas Kitty puts her on her arm and then she wrapped in this net scarf worn this crazy hat with the two feathers that stick to this bizarre feather muff. A dance sequence is very small with the images of the girl above her doing the most unpleasant ballet stuff on top of this. In fact, the film's more bright spot is the artist Guillesse. He dreamed a fine artist, but now he has denied drawing up pin-up girls for money. I like how Guillespe keeps old school, his masterpiece, the piece that is to make his career, disands the soldier sold for $ 5250 by Nanalt. Did not she realize that the piece was immortal? Silly rabbit / girl with your feather rabbit ears on your hat. When will you learn Why can not he just pencil in cigarette before advertisers do the job?
