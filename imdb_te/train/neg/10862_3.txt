I saw 8 or 9 Herzog films, and none of them had any effect on me. <br /> I saw several documentaries about him. He is obviously a clever man, with great knowledge about movies and hobbies, but makes him a good director. Sure NO! Full anti-talent. Because of the features mentioned earlier, he can make a good documentary, but a film with the actors ?? <br /> He can not direct. His filmmakers were seriously thought of, and many of his feature films / conversations were much child and bad, and in no sense the word "art" could not be hidden behind. There is no chance. Unskillful direction not to mention, so as enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> The shitz was arrested and was similar to the scene when the Stork's hiding behind the store. <br /> He is a fraudster; He knows what fake intellectuals and critics do. He knows what items to put in the script to get your attention and empty praise. Ignore the rest of the script and the vicious direction. <br /> See Julia Medem. If Herzog can make a film like Medem, I will look back and look at his old films and find out the talent of them.
