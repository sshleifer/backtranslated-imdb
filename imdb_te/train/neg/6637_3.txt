They should be named after this film ... Blonde women who need to get their roots in color. Even the main character, the geez, very tight sweaters. Giggle. The guy felt a good job though. I see a good 8 star Christmas movie to watch this week. Throwing dart That's also laugh. And yet there are three more DVRs to watch, perhaps we'll get lucky. Oh yeah, I found the guy pretty quickly and he woke up when he picked flowers and pulled out with his cousin. I told my daughter on their way to the cemetery. And how stupid are the two stupid they pursued them to spy on them? Creepy.
