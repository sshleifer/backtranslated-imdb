I have not commented on IMDb earlier, but after seeing Batman animation I feel like it. Its absolute worst! In the early 90s, Warner Brosman has a perfect animated series in Batman, so what do those who are attempting cannibalism with a winning formula? I feel like writing a complaint letter to WB. The original animation is darkness and child, Batman intended way. WB with some trip batman of the future. Now they are producing this move. The Joker does not resemble the Joker from disco comics. DC must claim. I agree to use the power of people to send email to everyone or write to WB and to retrieve the original formula
