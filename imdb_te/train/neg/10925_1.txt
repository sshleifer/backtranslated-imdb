In this movie I discussed with the film "PapiCock" to see if it is complete. They have a pretty interesting idea, set the buried image, and it is. So far this unforgettable mess is not true story. There is a set of burials, some wolves are a group of bad actors who have been attacked by a monster, a rescuers, and a wolf. I've missed a good meaning to get out of this nonsense, a Dune Buggy Chase, some really bad C.G.I., some amazing stupid dialogue, more bad C.G.I., and hero fighting paper cut out. Unlike the original idea, this film has zero zeroing features. My fault to continue. - MERK
