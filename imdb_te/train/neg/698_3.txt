An unpleasant addition to the stalk 'n slash bicycle that dominated the horror style of the 1980s. It was filmed in leprosy but was released as The Dark That Dripple Blood, a clear theft from the 1970s horror album The House Drupid Blood. Daphne is the only notable face in the cast of Juniaga and is her first horror film (she also starred in The Initiation and the Fly II).
