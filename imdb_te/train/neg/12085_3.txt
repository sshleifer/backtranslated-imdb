There is no need to start this short review with a plot summary. I mean Shakespeare's Hamlet for Goodness? Perhaps one of the finest plays. Many people on IMDb have come to this version of Hamlet and I do not mind to admit. By Mystery Science Theater 3000. Although the program is not the best venue to judge an image, in this case I can not imagine trying to watch without funny quips. In a word, this German is hampered by Hamlet's TV version. 152 minutes? There is no chance! It's darker and frustrating, and I spend about three hours. How many times have I said it, but entertainment is something for me. And this wrist-sliter is very entertaining. Nevertheless, I thought of some good things. <br /> <br /> When I enjoy MST3K, their comments do not help to make the honeymoon more beautiful. There are some good rips out there and there, but overall, Hamlet is just wrong image for MST3K. The Shakespearean comedy speaks to any kind of rhythm or flow. As it pains me, I had to give Hamlet 1/5 on my MST3K rating level.
