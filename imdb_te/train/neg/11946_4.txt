The film was titled The Running, Jumping & Standing Still Films. The film was intended to be seen by them. The film's intention was to see Lester and his partners only, but the main reason for the film was its work The fact that it worked as an experiment to make, is the cost of 70 pounds And it's included in a field of Sepia-Sundays, all of the stacked films are included in the finished product, the finished product is 11 minutes long. <br /> <br /> Running, jumping & standing English Sundays and people are still funny about their hobbies. All the events in this movie are held on the field. Some of these sitcoms, a scrubbing woman in a lawn, a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record, a photographer growing in a pond, an artist helping to draw numbers on a model face, a tent with a player running on the tent and a knife Man between man and a man with a gun Vandva fight. The people at the hobbies that pass the time away can hurt the fun, but it pokes fun in English culture as compared to American culture. One of the many events in the film is a group of men and a kite built from the flag of the United Kingdom. One of the men jumps inside the swords while other men try to fly it, and kite breaks. According to Richard Lester's The Films of the Richard Lester writer Neal Snyder, the event indicates that the United Kingdom is less powerful and technically comparable to the United States. According to this view, the British primitive cats fly, the Americans, the world's energy after World War II, the most advanced rockets and space ships.
