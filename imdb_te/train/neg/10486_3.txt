My main comment on this film is that Zwick's trusted actors can work in this film? Impressive cast ?? Even for the supporting roles, nothing really helps the film. If I admit, is not Tom Hank's Cameo worthy? What About Tom? Have you lost the race? Although the film's best character is Joe Isuzu - by far the classic! The campus is good. Bingzinger's role stimulated an amazing pyramid of aesthetic sales to go to the Vegas Motel by motel, struggling to exist as Pink Lady. This happens when Carbett is on his way out of Wessa, as his Elvis Suite is soon inspired by his wife. When they both made their way, they made several runs with Elvis creators who went to Elvis's fraudulent convention in Wales. Soon, the FBI will take part and begin to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Unfortunately, the film is not good. <br /> When looking at this movie, are you in first grade? Story lines and continuity are not really important. It's cute to look beautiful in her pink lady outfit but is much more enjoyable than wondering why she really does not make sense of what. The movie tries hard, but eventually the path gets short of the way. In the end, it's theoretically filled with ideas that are fun but it's not that funny in practice. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst, but if you find this building you feel that you want to get out of the building. Do not say I did not warn you!
