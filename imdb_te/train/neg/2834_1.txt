I have now seen four Boe Derek vehicles, directed by her husband, John. All of course, very terrible, but this is exactly pits. Have a simple flimsy plot, bad scripting ?? Naturally by the director? And acting and casting should not indicate disgruntled nudity, but she continues to talk and talk with her older husband Anthony Quinn (she has admitted to her shotgun suicide, claiming he always admired Hemingway!). In fact, he wants to be back as another young man, but only for the final scene! Derek is always lovely, and still playing the innocent (!) Especially during a muddled middle division with which a rental killer pursued her at a spa. Quinn is also very large - here is life (like: hammy), but it's easily his nodding; Moreover, for a long time, he works behind a shiny plastic piece (perhaps referring to his kind of limbo)! His 'alternative' is a pretty-looking studio that clearly, bright or personal. As well as cast starring Hollywood former Dan Murray (as Quinn's best friend and Bo's business consultant) and Julie Newmar (as Quinn's protecting angel in the post mortem) ?? Plus a surprising guest appearance by billionaire Donald Trump (who needed this on his reboot)! It also gave end credits a helping hand that many people are gratefully grateful (and tranquil) feelings of the 1990 Razzie Awards Board, as John Deerec is his own cinematographer and can not be wiped out by ghosts!
