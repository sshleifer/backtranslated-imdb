I can not get a lot of ratings for the Amy Girls, and I think it's kind of 10 to 10 people. In fact, a fantastic story is that the whole amount of my eyes with a set of more or less good actors. There are so many clicks in the film, women's hair is just awful and the sequences seem more or more dubious than most dubious. The film does not have a real hobby, but some actors act on any limiting limits. It's not funny enough to be comedy, it really is very fake-sad to touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. I did not believe in watching it, how it was made in my room in Switzerland on my TV. But .. maybe it still got lost in translation. No one knows. Surely one of the oddest movies I've ever seen and this is definitely not a good way! Sorry.
