I'm very surprised with good feedback because one of these fours has seen this screening and we all have gone. We personally felt that it would not be difficult to see through it and sit through the whole movie. And we really tried to stick with it. Specifically, those who feel that they really like in the group are not willing or discouraged due to their personal experiences about sexual orientation in school years. <br /> <br /> The film really resonates with a lot of people here on the boards and critics, aesthetics of art of art.
