The film is in the worst confusing. You never know what's going on. The characters are not well written, and for the most part they are totally impartial, except Gus (played by George Eed's). I hate this movie but it should have won an Academy Award when compared with others (the curse of Dark Harvest, Dracula). It's very sad to see a talented actor like George Eids in such a humiliating and frivolous film. You're drowning all the lifespan of life. Someone has to make sure that this director has never acted in movies. It should be a horror film because it's a lot more fun than scary. For Life Time, shame for shame.
