The thing about the "House of the Dead" is the worst picture of all the time it is not really. There are worst movies. <br /> <br /> The Elot of Hong Kong Ninja movies is mainly due to an incomplete Japanese police play that contains technically the footage of Ninjas that was included in the end to create something called "a movie". <br /> <br /> It is one of the worst films I've ever seen in theaters. Walking the half way through, I really felt I was somewhat blurry that I had to set it up by 45 minutes of this piece of garbage.
