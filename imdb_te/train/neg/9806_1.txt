<br /> <br /> I can not tell you what is the popularity of children's television program, Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Textures are totally greasy, like the multi-colored spondex wearing people go to gym. <br /> What exactly is this purpose? Show anyway, but kids learn how to fight to solve their problems? What are the awesome hair cuts and dresses in this show anyway? <br /> <br /> This program is still not played on cable television, they make money to teach them how to fight each other when disagreeing on a particular issue. It's very fun for today's kids, hopefully <br /> <br /> Oh, what is Homo romance tension between red and green rangers anyway?
