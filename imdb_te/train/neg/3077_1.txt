Hoggoblins ... no feeling. Rick Sloan is a master in the film. He has a brilliance to build a film with actors who can not be cast. On top of that, he chose to write the script based on the bad acid tour that sort of went wrong. Put it together, you end up with a suitcasing film over a warehouse filled with suave cups and vaccine cleaners. This film is very painful. It is pain due to pain caused by a spoon of pain in your genitals, and then having a full wound covered with salt and hydrochloric acid.
