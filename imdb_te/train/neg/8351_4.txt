By the Monogram Standards, this mystery (reconstruction of the sphinx) also has a strange plot, which is not very effective - you'll see it after about ten minutes. Both leads have some nice windy dialogue at the start, but hell is dull as John Hamilton's villain (the perfect cast Lionel Atwill character) and Warren Hyamer's nitwit shtick is pretty annoying. However, Nicodemus is the gateway to a five-minute show by the incomparable Montan Moreland, the Guardian, which improves defense lawyer in a hilarious courtroom. You are handed over to Bill "One-Take" Buidine; He is not quite a director, but he will always punch a regular programmer with some goofy play.
