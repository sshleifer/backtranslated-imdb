It's a remake of the thing (1982/1951), which I think, had a lot of reasons to detect previous images. <br /> <br /> This acting is not bad, James Spider has been a super lover with his coffee mug and some of his strange thought / motions, and he does not have any other actors. You can not get to know someone in the main characters. And the plot evolution is slow, boring and, yes I know what's about to be happy in 30mins. The scooter / music ultraBoring, Ian makes ucertallented people there alot, makes a coke and scores for credit, but this is the main worst. Some of the special effects took place in the early 90s. If you want Slimy Aliens, cold and thrills, this is nothing to do with the movie. The combination of Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and some of the Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay structures is really bad. <br /> <br /> Something this combination is cold, they know where they are doing, and only everyone in this product knows. <br /> <br /> Even if I've seen a lot worse, somebody, but if you're up for a cold night, and just a moment at something, it will be slow, time passes.
