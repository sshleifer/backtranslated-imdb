Open scene 'explains why' the 'immune' 'contaminated man' after the hurt. While it is not too bad to explain: how he / he got 'found objects' / how fast it works? Then we go to "Current Day Budapest". OK, in the past or in the future opener? It will, of course, be of course, but for a minute it is just possible that the picture moved to the beginning of ND. Sorry, I should be close attention, huh? Or it just happens badly. He was confused about the different jobs in different fields, and eventually referred to the fact that he had been dead from the original experiment and that he did. Wow! So one of their top guys to visualize the effects of the Ens and the private industry came together with poison? He wants one of the top players, he friendships with the chemical company C, for God. Then there is also the ingredient: technically poisoned, but the immune 'transmitters' have changed, so we have whatever we want; A poison, a disease, an allergic response, all the different things in real life. Amazingly, it's not just a death victim, but just from the carrier. How convenient Then there is h z z t t protocol: They do not have any idea what to do in the store or how to prepare for it. After the producers left the scene of a dangerous unknown substance, there was not enough money for the construction to wash properly. I kept thinking that the hurt would die from the bad cleaning technique, and the open sequence becomes closer after all.
