I thought I was going to see a horror film. I think they were funny when a human being transformed into a wolf. Today's computer games have ten good animations. Low budget, comment suit. I would recommend Wolf (1994) for a good wolf film with Jack Nicholson. As good as they should be, special effects (with the change of human appearance). I do not recommend you to watch this movie unless you want to smile. This film is a joke.
