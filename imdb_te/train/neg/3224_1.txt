When I was a kid, I saw this when visiting our "Uncle" Phil's friend. We are back! A crazy cartoon about a dinosaur story called Dinosaur Story Rex (voiced by Wonderful John Goodman). The little boy tells the story about the story that dinosaurs returned to land to live. He explains that he is part of what he brought back with some friends and brought them back. I think the doctor / professor of the film will take them back, but I do not care about him. Children may like it, but personally it's very cheesy. John Goodman is probably the only good thing. Poor!
