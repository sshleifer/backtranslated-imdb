Like most of Ben Affleck's films, comedy is dry and story is imaginative. If you want to call this story. Many points left to connect without any thought. I want to thank the director explaining the points better. I said because it means that the violence was no longer. In the case of Ben Affleck's failures, this is no exception and other actors are alive. However, most of the acting is not fake and reliable. I'm not worth the trip entry trip down the memory lane with the actors I have not seen in years. All thought to be said, they are also quickly reached the ranks of "having it". My choice of waiting for my car to be correct or watching this movie. I made a wrong decision. All in all I gave a laugh ... mainly because I came out.
