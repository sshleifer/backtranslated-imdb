Take your primary Frankenstein image, inject some Reanimator (but not the best parts), and you have Dr. Heckenstein. <br /> <br /> A scientist accidentally kills his wife, so when he tries the entire movie takes place one night. To restore his wife. <br /> <br /> To restore his wife, he decides to chop body parts from some women who decide to stay overnight for his part. , Not directed. Everything is very standard here. Smaller attempts at what's going on at comedy really work (Heinstein is hidden behind his dear assistant because she is undoubtedly holding a woman and needle), but this film is rarely recommended. The music is good, the good is the blood, and the cast is great. By half time, I've also been entertained by this film. I never thought it was anything more than a time water. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker instead.
