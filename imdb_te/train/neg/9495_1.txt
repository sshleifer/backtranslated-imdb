It's a horrible movie, and there's an ounce of honest emotion in one scene. <br /> <br /> When William Hilden (who is very sad to see him in this role) at the age of 55, the characters are omitted, clearly drawn, the speculative and story line is clear. He is playing in any of his early 40s and appears to be in his 60s. Ke Lenez 20 and was credited with being irresistibly appealing. Holden's character is the same age as the Clint Eastwood (not), directed by the film, Sexy Sexy and more romantic connection they find on the road - 60s are placed with the obvious loops of hippie cold: Bachelor Pad, Swinging Meals at hi-fi, yamashi <br /> <br /> The film is ridiculous uncool, a clanging claptrap of old fogies desperately hope they will find them in the Sunset and Laurel Canyon free souls and find their big honkin 'cars sexy <br /> <br /> Ug. Youth culture has never been that never done. And I thought Bill Holden was very disappointed in the youth, he took this awkward piece.
