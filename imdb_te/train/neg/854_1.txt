Ladies and Gentlemen, please do not be fooled by the "A Stanley Kubrick" movie tag. It is one of the most deadly horror films ever made. While horror movies are thinking of a real horror film in the night, people must cry their hearts. In shining, there is no real horror, but what we have discovered is an innocent, silly attempt to create a retail horror. If it is different from reality, this movie is good. This is a view of the snowy valley. Most of the stars submitted by the hotel are very good. Actors lose a word about Jack Nicholson, looks like a lazy spirit, not sure what to do. About a dress, the colorful actor was busy with Kid's actor for a very long time. There is no need to blame bad weather for the tragedy. The poor Kubrick did not live without any changes in the film.
