Start simple lines. From the viewer's side, the good pair of "director details" and some scenes in the movie scenes are good. Special effects are good enough, good acting / good scene. But the story is very simple. This is how Elite Army Bomb Squad unit works, actions and sometimes dies. It shows the life of drama in battle. As a serious action movie "slave" in my film experience, I lost the click that hit my eyes and my brain. One of the things that I needed to be in a film is considered a good reality and the ability to immerse the audience in time. It did not happen to me. <p> Honestly speaking, I feel that the film has gained fame based on "patriotic" appeal of American patriotism, "healthy and real feeling". Cinematic fame is not an appropriate use generator. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Not sure. Why? <br /> <br /> I do not think it's worth the prizes to win compared to rivals in the Oscars.
