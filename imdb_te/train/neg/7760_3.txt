In Fiji Islands, the resort of the resort Primal Park is a greedy and unscrupulous owner of investors and guests who seek to identify the hotel and zoos for the opening party of his compound in accordance with his discoveries. When a group of college pedestrians put a virus in a security system to take part in a scavenger hunt, the great attractions of the zoo? Which of the fossils found in the fossil would die from an earlier historical age developed from the DNA? <br /> <br /> "The Sabretoat Attack" is one of the worst and cheaper movies I have recently seen. The characters are awful and funny or not fun and the story is a terrible Jurassic Park Rip off with a bad collection of cliches. Usually all lines and conditions are poor and stupid, but the winner Gary describes sabretoothes bulimic and like to kill for pleasure. <br /> The title (Brazil): "O Attack Do Donde de Saaber" ("The Attack of the Sabretooth")
