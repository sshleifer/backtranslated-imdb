I'm 11th grader in my high school. I have a video in my class in my class at my current World Affairs class and we have suggested to watch. So we did. My moon is working for NASA and we are convinced that we have gone to the moon. I've always seen a large part of the film's worst, yet the guy who created it has some serious balls. Did he first show the JFK shot? And how he dares to use all bible quotes. The only good thing about this film is that it sparks the debate, which is weekly negotiations with good class B / C in my class. The film did not change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore work together and make another film. The next film of Michael Moore is called "A Funny Thing" on "SPECK 11" or "A funny thing on the way to the White House".
