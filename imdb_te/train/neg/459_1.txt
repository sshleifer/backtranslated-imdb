<br /> <br /> I'm looking for a beautiful, simple comedy, but it's proved to be a huge mistake to choose this movie. <br /> <br /> I can not write a good thing about it. First, the script is tired, recycled jokes and a walk to laugh, but everything is not stupid and funny. In my book, it's not funny, it's curious. <br /> <br /> With low budget effects (if I call them effects) with terrible cinematography. In many places it seems like an indie film that does not have much money. <br /> Acting ... I am sorry for actors. Pamela Anderson and Denis Richards think that they will agree to some money for some money? (Seeing their recent filmography, it looks like that.) Despite these dresses, Pamela shows her age and the whole, they do not look sexy, listen to the fun. <br /> Picture is not even in the very bad-it-is-funny category. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
