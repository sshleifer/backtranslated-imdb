Let's see what the director is trying to do with this movie. But the problem is not very good. <br /> <br /> The movie is not really original and the plots are well presented, the main characters are darker for everything and you do not have any trouble. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />] It is unfair to review this film and compare it to the best budget films. But alas, what should it do? On its own, it's not very good. And compared to others, it's still not very good. But it is not without its good points! I liked the plot. It is well structured and well blended at the end. <br /> <br /> It has created a creepy feel in really dark scenes. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film did not impress. The characters do not exist and we do not care for any of them. None of them die, but it will take a final decision "from the very beginning".
