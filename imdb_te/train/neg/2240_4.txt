"Sassy" misconduct of four au pair who joined London on the same day in the early 1970s. A Swedish girl, a Danish, German and a Chinese. The story contrives the corpse Street Rogue Johnny Briggs and the horror filmmaker of some of them having a couple of them on-on-type humor, and the future house star Richard O'Sullivan includes a couple of them with different misfits from British film and TV culture, Freddie Man (to play the role of Shake). <br /> <br /> The number of actors in this film is very beautiful. Girls stereotypes, and German anita, especially with infantile disorder - was engaged to a colorless TV, which she was dressed to show her personal parts as a child that was not abortive and deliberately; In another serious film, she is a psychiatric case. The most interesting section of the film is taken to a club in London, where some dodgy types are still attracted by a middle-aged rocker, losing her konerity and finding that the scene is not for her. These scenes have some of them, and we live in a lifeless lifestyle and CD's lives of casual music and upper classes (John Standing is a fine turn for the public school rouge). The most important of these stories, the Chinese girl with the piano prodigy owner (fianc√©e May Me Le) falls in love and without any good reason in the middle of the night, the orientalist concept "is not absurd for Chinese birds, is not it?" The film is pretty damaging to its women's roles and has one of the conversations and the homosexuality in nature. Finally, as a shy of Jasmine, except for any terrestrial cause (they have to end this film), she is a shik, and all women are white stuffed away from her Arab Empire <br /> <br /> Many people are stuffed and nonsense, but by an experienced Wall Guest A fair amount of skill is directed. 70 Brit sexually flix.
