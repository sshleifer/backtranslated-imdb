A cheesy, compellingly awful (and in a fun way) C grade image. Everything is shocking and drugs and sexual relations and recommendations from the brutal script (extreme courtyard, limited accessory and predictable conclusions; turpid lighting, sound and hand-held wobbly camera angles); <br /> <br /> I saw on DVD and Edward Wood hoped to pop out.All the forgiven - your worst films are works of art, and are more coherent than these couples. <br /> 'Warbling' My dreams every night I hear you '- are you sure Titanic crew did not take part in this side?
