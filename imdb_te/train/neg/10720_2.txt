I saw this film last weekend and it's crazy and mindless. An ancient curse turns into mummy in his pajamas? The victims are horrified and can not walk away from the old man who moves slowly. They try to disperse him or leave their torches and shakes instead of burning him. Quentin alias Ferbsham of the Honeymooners married Diane Brewster alias Miss Confield to Beaver's fame, who was unhappy in marriage. Wow, love story. Wait for Kills to follow the rest of the cast castes, respond to their help and drive. The Egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not give much picture. Where is mummy? Really just built a curse. It does not have a fire for at least universal mommy films. Look at this picture if you fall asleep because you are deceived off.
