It's a real bomb. We believe that Mary Obern was a privileged daughter of a prestigious politician, who had to prove Tom Deley in the 1930s, who supported him as presidential candidate. Poor Merley can not go anywhere, but political leaders and their quacking, wives quake and gracious uncle Harry Davenport surround only support. She meets her two girls in a blind date and is going to show Gary Cooper. Some of Rodeo's shots, one la "misfits," but there are no such luck in this regard. Gary is in the back of an official dinner, Merle presides, but reads a sermon in their snarborough, even though he is invited to join the group. Where does this different cowboy's vague prompt come from? The most painful scene in the film is Gary's phantom party in his incomplete home for his incomplete wife Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.
