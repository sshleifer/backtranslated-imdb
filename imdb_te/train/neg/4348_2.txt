It's just a horrible movie. It hurt me to see it. In the context of the film, almost every action is not removed, the acting is really poor (the best actor P.Diddy who claims something about the film) and the plot is usually predictable. Some of the links to Carlito's voyage, for example, are a day of moving to the Caribbean, but overall they are weak. The interest in love in my opinion is mistakenly flat but hey that debates. However, I do not really expect before watching the film and I can say that I have not fulfilled those expectations. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he's really good actor (Friday night lights). He is lucky because he's sure he does not have a lot of people watching this movie. I'm going to go ahead and give the chain these two stars so if they make my point of view all of these things, give me a good rating. Test your luck once again. And yes I enjoyed Carlito's Way.
