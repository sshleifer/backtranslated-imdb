Well ... tremors I started in the original 1990s, and I found a very enjoyable movie to watch. However, they have built earthquakes II and III. Believe me, after the first films have been completed, those movies are going to the right, I mean, donkey blasters ??? Now, only God is God "Why does this create another dumpster diving of this film?" He answered the question. The Tremors IV is not considered a bad film, in fact it is not considered a summary of the bad image, because it lives up to more than that. When I tried to sit down, I saw my eyes started bleeding and I wished to kill me by the little girl TV from the ring. Do not think people who have seen in other movies do not make any film in the dressing (in perfect cases) if they're really from the Wild West? Honestly, I never suggest buying this movie, I mean, there are fewer ways to find things that burn well.
