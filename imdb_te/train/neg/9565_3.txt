I can not say Warzmills: Dead code is the worst picture I have ever seen as having one or two good moments, but I can say that it is the most transparent image ever seen. I did not know a plot device before 10+ minutes earlier. The film has no scam, no intelligence behind the scenes is clear. <br /> The intention of the line that I speak or type is impossible to "enter" in the picture. </ P> Very often than I was enjoying in the movie.
