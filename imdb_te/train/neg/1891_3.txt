The documentary about navigating the massive mountains of nomadic peasants for the grassy ground. This silence, black and white feature is partially abusive by a freak-twin-twin oriental music score that is not used in the original show, which also discourages more than the sound. The spectacular scenery falls on a small black and white screen, and what kind of plate line to establish is totally failed. I loved the Nakuk of the North and the March of the Penguins, but deprecated the film, depending on the similarity of the film. The physical hardships alone are not just interesting.
