The film has all the stuff as a smart and alcoholic comedy, but for some reason it has taken the path of Dumbas. <br /> You could not find audiences: but the image of the cast and the plot is not very difficult, and there is a lot of slap and mute-sounding to appeal to women. <br /> If you've seen Legally Blonde and its sequel, then it sounds like a scary shocking sequel. Great actors like Luke Wilson should expect a better subject. Jessica Simpson also managed to do so much. <br /> <br /> Many of the things in the film are painted-by-numbers, various uber-cliche montages, and Rachel league Cook and Penelope Anne Miller supporting characters in the last minute "misunderstanding". <br /> <br /> If you do not take this seriously, it's likely to enjoy the movie, but you can not make it so bright, you're frustrated and discouraged in the scenes.
