Amelia and Michael are the couple who cheat each other. Amelia has a long time lover in the hospital and Michael appoints a prostitute who is not satisfied with him. Manage two smolder with their disbelief but eventually connect to each other. <br /> <br /> This is a very small amount. Directing is straight forward and dramatic, which is good, acting is honest, but the story leaves little to be desired. Why, obviously, we do not care about these two people? It is very difficult to see if this story sticks from any other infidelity story, it is very low and does not explore the meaning (if any of the pace's welcome change). <br /> I do not know, I could not connect them with these stories because I did not enjoy them. But the narrative of these narratives is usually the same, namely, a couple speaking out while avoiding eye-contact, pretending to be in the magisons, etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <p>
