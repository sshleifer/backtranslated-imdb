My friends and I walked after 15 minutes, and we were not the first. Later, we tried to get our money back. Movie Theater management does not allow this, but they agree that we will look at another movie. The only time that worked for us is Dickie Roberts: a former child star. You can say, it's not a momentous night. Maybe one of my worst movie nights. I saw the second title of Dual Head Domestic Distances and Heist. At the end, for humanity, please do not look at the order.
