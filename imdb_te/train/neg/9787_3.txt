... but the trouble of this product is that it is very good music. <br /> <br /> Witty Masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter can never imagine. And this piece of music also makes Andrew Lloyd Webber witty. (Which is one or two exceptions) was terribly dull and unpredictable and I could not recall the same important melody after I saw - the whole thing from three hearings is rather tragic than the one who learned another Hundred People. <br /> It is amazingly playful. It happens on a big stage (sorry for those in the front row that break their necks to see 50 meters on the right or 100 meters on the left) and there is nothing to do with it. When singing on the stage is a person, it's just you're getting - and the rest is a great empty space. It's almost sad to see me as an amateur theater director. <br /> In fact, Cole Porter seems to have seized French culture in his work closer to those artists. And I was surprised by this famous-musical-epic music.
