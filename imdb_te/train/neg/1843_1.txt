Wow. Just awful. I was a fan of the original film, and gladly improved by sitting through 2, 3. 4,5 and Freddy Dead are very bad. But nothing like Freddis Nightmares is bad. <br /> <br /> Freddie's attractions have been featured in movies, but at least here, they looked like a horror series High School Productions. Poor actors, if you really want to make sure that they have paid exactly what they paid when they really participated in this program. I said it was a stop point for the two actors. <br /> <br /> When they start the Hollywood ladder, they have to take that romantic job that last week has been willing to take any part of the brand ready to take off, or willing to take any part of the Hollywood ladder down season stars in their season down <br /> <br /> I am a Hanna Star to Dana Platon Half expected, but she was already dead when it was in production. To hear Nancy's lyric in the original Elm Stunt, "You're never sleeping forever."
