Ronald Reagan and a group of US soldiers in a North Korean POW camp. They tortured ... we learn the evil people of the North Korean Communists ... we learn Americans' bulbs grow very slow during the days of violence ... <br /> <br /> I'm trying to suppress, smiling at this movie. This is the scene when Rengan comes out of telling the Communists who want to be with them. Then, he asks for a bottle of brandy. Later, as the rock-cold acted intellectually, he took the Drunken companion, Dewey Martin, to get a sulfur to cure Mr. Martin's hangover. However, the North Korean Communist guard is the dumb when they come. So, the dragon goes to Reagan to get something from the guard while distracts the guard, which is next to a group of blank boxes. I'm sure he's supposed to have something in the boxes; But, in fact, Ryan moves adequately to say openly that they are empty. You have to see! I think the "prisoner of war" will appeal to the family and friends who have worked on it - otherwise, it is waste. <br /> * Prison of War (1954) Andrew Morton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forest, Dewey Martin
