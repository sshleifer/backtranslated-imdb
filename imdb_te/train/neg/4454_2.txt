First few background; I lived in my life in English and London. I'm in many games in 'The Den' and many other London club grounds. I know very well about the type of person entering the hooliganism, I know how they work and how to talk. It's a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the dubious movies I've seen. Most of the film suffered. <br /> a) People can not speak in London as in real life; Motion picture producers took a long way off and sounded stupid. Unfortunately there are unfortunate types, but you are more like parodies in Green Street. b) Actor Osama bin Laden played Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunam) as 'English' or 'Cockney'. He was in the north of Newcastle and I was able to act directly with the other actors - we should seriously say how to take him. Why did not anyone get me from East London to play this part. I've done a 'bang-up job'. C) Frodo. I mean Elijah Wood kicking the people's donkey twice in his size and who seriously feels the evil hooligans. He's dead. It's easy to do. Honestly (as a Brit) this movie is hard to see. Everyone knows that the film will bomb in the UK. Americans do not know (or care) it is not correct. <br /> <br /> My American and foreign friends do not believe this nonsense word. Yes these companies exist but it is very underground and hush hush and very low. Some people in this movie get one out of me because they actually filmed a part of London. Normally they expect Cardiff (Wales) or something to try to paint these things and not notice all of us.
