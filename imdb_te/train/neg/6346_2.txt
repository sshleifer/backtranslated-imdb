This movie sticks! You want two plus hours back to get through it. Sliding Doors, directed by w / Guindy Paltrow and Peter Howit, Melinda & Melinda tried to do very well. The film was brilliant, witty and well played. <br /> <br /> When Melinda & Melinda is tiresome, the conversation can be done and at least one of the megabytes that I can deal with. One Melinda is very unsuccessful - her first glass wine is at 10 o'clock - and she is laughable, and not in the sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's last ensemble films have worked, because I guess, the time and the cast of the screenplay is talented. With a piece of trivia for this film in two months he wrote this screenplay: You can tell. And when Chloe Sevig was talented - those around her did not have the whole existence. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Chloe Sevig and a group of other people you've seen in other films but do not remember too much. <br /> <br /> Very sad.
