I have not seen this a long time ago, and I should say: This film is terrible. I'm looking for active movies for fun. Scarlett is not fun. Scarecrow stupid. He enjoys tremendous unconscious lines when he kills his victims (actually worse than in the sentence). He uses his hard fortune to justify his hardships. "Everyone of us is my favorite, the only girl I'm thinking of is not the trailer-trash one of the guys who chose me and I want to kill everyone." Okay, I am exaggerating. <br /> <br /> In the premise of this film, it is enough to put aside the list of the most fun films in the premiere. <br /> <br /> I am adding to what I say, the kid's mother is prepared, and when the mother gets his current boyfriend, Kid denies telling the mother's boyfriend to leave his home. The boyfriend chases the children into the field where he kills the kid right in front of the mother, the mother shouting in terror, like the boyfriend, "OMG! I do not understand!" Then he tells the mother not to tell the police about it. However, the kid was killed under a scarecrow. So, like any kid who is murdered under a crown, he comes back to the killer giant with a vengeance. His victims were "not as before ..." (Scarecrow's official tag line) <br /> <br /> The film was shot in 8 days to make matters worse. That's right, 8 days. I'm going to give this film to 2, because it also has one or two redimetric moments. (If they really want to see this trash, I can not ruin it.) I've been able to forgive bad work, terrible special effects, abysmal script and bad camera work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "If you want to see how you do not have a movie, or if I enjoy watching movies, look at your own risk as I do. It should be safe at any time.
