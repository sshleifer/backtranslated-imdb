The film has a slight expectation because it has good performances and is back in the Akshay and Saif duo. I saw this movie made by the same person who wrote the story for the Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2. But compared to Dhoom 2 Tashan, I say Dhoom 2 is very real. <br /> <br /> "Well, the first scene itself pis * me off. Scenes.I and my friends were laughing at us looking at these sharp bogs, which had 30 piles and all of them like Akshay and Thugs were machine guns! Pew ... to see how bad you can understand the action sequences <br /> <br /> The other thing about the movie is a very predictable story. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of some movies in the early 80s. <br /> <br /> This image is valuable only <br /> <br /> You can see that some people laugh at some terrible combat scenarios. <br /> <br />
