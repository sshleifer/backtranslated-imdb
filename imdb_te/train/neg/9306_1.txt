This movie is for the film I have seen. First of all, if you want to look at the horror horror movie with the monster clowns, you are very wrong, by deceiving the cover of the film. In fact the face of the killers did not resemble even a little covered, which they should have found on Google and it looked cool. Some people in the movie are searching for a friend of the old woods, a scene that is raising a young magic suddenly in a shiny of the screen shops sunlight ... I mean seriously WTF ??? They walk in the dark forests. I bought this movie in a market that was at least expected to be entertaining if it was not horror. Wrong! The next day I came from my work colleague, S.I.C.K. <br /> Bottom line: Do not see this movie!
