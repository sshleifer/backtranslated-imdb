I saw this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 mulletes. It is every 5 minutes mullet. While seriously, the film proves that the formula works. If it is not broken, it does not need fixin. A streetwise-yet-harmless heroine, a hard-fired former police martial arts master with a golden heart and a 'serious' killer with 'problems'. Pure magic.
