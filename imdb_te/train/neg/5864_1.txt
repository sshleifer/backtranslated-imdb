I'm pretty sure it's the worst picture I have ever done. You should give up comedy forever if you can not make a 13-year-old boy laugh at crazy humor. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chooses differently. The film is filled with hypothetical hypocrisy (some of which are racist) and very alert jokes. Especially memorable doctor died of a rabbit and he was pregnant with a scene (when I was writing, I can not believe it is actually a movie scene). The man rushes to the rabbits dead at the doctors' desk and tries to give the mouth a mouth. ROTFLMAO! NOT! The punch line "How do I know that I should be on top?" Ha ha ha ha ha ha aha ........
