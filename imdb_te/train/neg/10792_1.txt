This film offers dramest conversations but nothing. In fact I could not possibly imagine how to make a film, how synthetic was up to an hour ago, but again how I saw this video. In a film that does not rely on a powerful script, at least good acting and desperate dialogue and a few comedies expect, and the film loses all of them. You can not hear them. There is no point about this film, nothing. I hate it. I'm sure someone will do that too. The name is intended to give some idea of ​​nudity and subject matter to the target audience, even if it fails at nudity. But I do not know how I watch an hour or this thing, and I definitely recommend you do not do that. I saw in my entire life. If someone gives you to see that, insult your LiIIIFI
