Sean Penn's direction is not very fond of, and this early work, Indian runner is no exception. This film is not important, it is one of the most honest in pen's work with a kind of raccoon, anti-authoritarian correlation, and its latest work is much higher than the previous one. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, are all honestly producing some kind of honestly, such theoretically benign product, but most of all, Hallmark cards have developed Hell's Angels greetings, and Deliverance's days make me taller, . Viggo Mortensen's performance is very expensive, and he has given this sort of faded Eastern prominence with Karonberg. The film is meaningless, and there is a lot more exercise than a story, many techniques. Kudos for Charles Branson, however, proved he can work. I want more of Sandy Dennis's character. This Indian runner was 3 out of 10 for the worst.
