I really like this movie - the location shots are mostly shot in Pittsburgh and the trailer has some amazing photography. But, for a painted cartoon, this is really a badly built movie. Both the sequel and the speed are terrible. The best bits out of the movie are below the credits, so it's finally sticking (almost) to the end (ultimately, it does not take it in the last half hour or so). <br /> <br /> If Andy Dick is doing the best performance in a movie, you will have a problem ...
