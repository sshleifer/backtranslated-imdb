<br /> <br /> I took a rent on DVD yesterday and did not realize it was a "role study" film, so I struggled to spend about an hour before it hit the stop button. <br /> <br /> The theme in a role study, I could not get into this film. Maybe it's my mood in wanting to see something else, or maybe I have other expectations, but set aside, I tried my best to move it looking, but offered. Actors have driven their roles well, but the world's combination has not been able to keep my interest. The only interesting thing was that Sgt's gun was stolen and he hurried buying another purchase, and spray painted black to appear in the police issue. I think this film should be named, "who sarmts gun stole?" Scenes did well but I thought it was wrong to add anything to keep me going. <br /> I do not end up watching. There is some merit to rent this movie. Maybe. For me, good view is a waste of effort and time. I will try it, try it out, but I'm not strongly recommended.
