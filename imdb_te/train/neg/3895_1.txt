For a while, some nasty people go to Saturn, but really only the solar flares are shot into space, to some stock footage, and then he gets a nose bleed, and before you know, he comes to a hospital strap with a nurse with an unhealthy uniform And when he eats him, he is all NASA, or NASA, at least one person, worries about it and calls another person to hunt him, but they have a soup going to a man who sent him to hunt the meltdown, and his unusual shape forgot the crackers , So he can not be crackers, and then he will go outside Look for the melting person with a Geiger counter, and it really does not work, so he really follows the trail of only half-eaten corpses, and then a sheriff, and two ugly old people in a lemon, and a women cleans a woman, and trigger -Happy Security is kind of industrial type with guards, and I can not tell how the movies will end All I can say is that Jonathan Demme Burr DeBenning is somewhere with some people stupid, and if everyone in the world associated with the film has a strange, violent death and could not make more movies, and enjoyed the world happily - END!
