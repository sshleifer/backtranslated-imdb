Everywhere in the homosexual face is another insult and slap. This sluggish attempt in comedy is not recommended. Once again we have a cute 'straightforward' hero who can not get any woman interested in her. Yes true! And we are also provided with a 'sympathetic, attractive' homosexual friend, a fat, cloths, ugly old man who is really attractive. Even I found him attractive and I was a fat, ugly old gay man (but fortunately not balding)! Any acting talent can be thrown into a bad script, and really awful direction. Mr Sneedeker was banned from the film, but then he was not different from Hollyweed's work countless other hacks.
