This low-budget Roger Carman is a horror / creature movie. A DinoCroc is created when overturning prehistoric genes. An engineer Crock first kills one of it, then receives human taste and becomes a fastest growing terror after fleeing. None of the characters have any depth, but they are not central. <br /> <br /> We get a few moments with a huge two-legged dinosaur heir in a huge budget movie and some of the best "kill" scenes <br /> <br /> My favorite scene turns into a dog and crock food for three bait . There is nothing on the feet but the feet on the ankle. Jane LandeDeker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier: There are no real characters. Very pathetic Matt Bolenghi and a bad professional crook hunter Casta Mandirler. I was impressed with the impressive Joanna Pacula as Dr. P. DINOCROC feared dignified with a clump of pickles.
