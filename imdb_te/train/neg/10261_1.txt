Wow, I'm in T.V. in "scary" films that show around Halloween. Got this rate? The film is not really scary, or worth looking at. Moreover, it is said to be other people, but I think so. For a spoof, you are called "humor". This low-budget worst-fest does not have a cloth of humor, and it does not make much sense. After a monster or any bleeding, you can not see the monster violence ever since you basically come out and kill the goofy monster (man in rubber suit). <br /> <br /> The Spinning Newspaper tells you that the military is trying to weaken the soldier and it is not much larger than man. They have a very bad aim. Then the military fell! Wow, this film U.S. What is the army's curiosity or what made it? The monster does not work too much with shuffle and roar around when it's hard to kill. Oh, and occasionally the second head pop out its mouth and shrieks. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting, yet the whole foreign repo. <br /> <br /> What is the deal with a scientist playing a geologist to attract the monster? The dialog is hard to understand because of poor sound quality. Also, why is the monster around the main wimpy guy for so long? Why not go to the monster's room when there is a chance? Why did I try to disclose the unrealistic feeling?
