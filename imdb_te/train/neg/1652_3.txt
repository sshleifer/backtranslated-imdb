I am stupid. This film is not good. My movie featured film acting, script, story, direction and almost all edits. Amanda Peet has proven that she will be acting as a high point in 'The Whole Nine Yards'. So she should avoid this film with a ten foot pole. However, I felt a very small part of the film that was very funny. If you forget how low productivity is, and if you're funny funny, then you should be right. And that's what you choose, for those of you who do not get your pedestal off. My inner child is dead, and I have made a fair bit of laughed. However, only 3 out of ten, because this is not true in the movie.
