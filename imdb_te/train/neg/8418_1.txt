Here are great shows. Unfortunately, they occur in the context of an image that does not seem to have a clue what they are doing. The first 45-60 minutes will be realistic for all music. Suddenly, about an hour, the characters, to this point, always talking to each other, suddenly start singing to each other. Do not worry if things go out, they actually dialogue in a 15 minute conversation, then drop the idea and go to other things like a jazz club. A drummer and two electric guitars have suddenly become a fully-fledged band of strings that are not fully visible. On the volatility of how to use music, there is a clear inefficiency of the composers who write music in reality. After the first couple pieces imitated the 1950s motown sound, the rest of the movie was just a baudeau show music. The snippets of the band have a pure silliness, with James Brown from Little Richard then mourning the bad Jackson Family simulation and Eddie Murphy. When he started making a channel on Stevie Wonder I could not help laughing out loud. One of these films I spent less time on earth and I wasted two hours for watching this film.
