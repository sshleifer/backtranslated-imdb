After reading a lot of good reviews about the film, I thought I would give it a watch and I thought I gave my own review after much disappointment. <br /> This is my first for me. <br /> <br /> It's awful or scary before I start horror scene from the genre (unfortunately you'll jump when working on my own.) I call this movie called the movie. The film is about a spoiled naughty girl who falls in a few times. At these times she goes home after she returns home and decides to go home and add something to her home, which makes it a bit more active in reality as a mournful little baby. When she's friends with her boy, she learns that her imaginary world is actually better than her real world. She is constantly trying to get her home to her home, making her father bad and misleading herself. <br /> <br /> She is trying to make a little diminished version of Nightmare in Elm Street, but is very fond of going to the beach. <br /> My generous 3/10 in the end hopefully stop at least one since you are looking at this crab!
