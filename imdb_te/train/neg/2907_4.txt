Chinese critics, as well as outside Chinese film enthusiasts, have always voted for China's greatest film ever, and apparently, I could not find it. I have seen the most common melodrama, imaginable, direct and acted, and totally perfect for the hero. Wei Wei (laughs), a young married woman who has suffered from tuberular husband (u shi) over the past few years. It was a WWII post, and they lived in a house with their spouse's teenage sister (Hongme Zhang), who lived in a non-cash (they were rich when they were married). Moreover, the husband's older best friend (Wei Li), was also used as wife's boyfriend when he was a teenager. She thinks that her husband will run away from her husband, and the husband thinks that his friend may be able to engage his younger sisters. It's setup, and you can not expect where it will go. I actually saw the remake, directed by Blue Kite director Juanzuanghong Tian. It runs a half hour long, and is actually dull, but it's pretty. This classic classic is pretty unsustainable.
