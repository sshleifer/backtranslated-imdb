I and my girlfriend went to see this movie as "Premiere Surprise", before we opened it in Denmark at the ticket. We sat for 1 hour or so, and then we left! The film's era was seen to describe the era (and club 54), but it was not for the development of the character, and at the expense of the lowest stories there. <br /> <p> <br /> <p> <br /> <p> If you want to listen to some good music and get a 70-year mood solution, I guess it's okay. <br /> <br /> Do not expect to get plots of unbelievable characters <br /> <br />
