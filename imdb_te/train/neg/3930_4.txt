Let us know how the machines are rebellious against the second revival, part 1. It starts with only one case where people have the right to live, the humans have a robot and so they can do anything. <br /> <br /> Although it is an interesting space, the story begins with the riots (violent) riots between robots and humanity. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br . For the second revival part 1, I say it's very violent and very crazy. 4/10.
