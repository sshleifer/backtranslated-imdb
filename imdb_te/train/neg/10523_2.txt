For the first forty minutes, the empire really counts: it looks like a strong, confident and relatively unknown gangster movie. I do not know why that time, I thought it was good - but now I'll do it. <br /> <br /> This is one of the main issues in the film. It is completely and totally unpleasant. I do not mind pictures with psychoses and things, to prove a point- Take Jackie Brown for example- but they are all terrible, but it certainly throws for entertainment. You literally feel pull a knot on your stomach. Another major problem is the role. He is self-confidence, proud, yet- ridiculous- that's not bad. He does not seem to be strong enough to be a female killer dealing with drug trafficking. In fact, at the end of the day, this film is entirely pretentious. Clever, faint, meaningless - this huge mess should be avoided at all costs. <br /> ***** From (1 to 5)
