I gave this film a very positive opportunity, which made me cheated. It is very little to bring hell out of the audience because of the immense Bogdanovich (who made it better with the Targets) to have "great performances" from their initial hams tones. Many of the sexual harassment of the young man is revealed from the film, the teacher's wife doing the duplication, impotence, doing the ugly waste (not the most awkwardly painted and not halting things, things can not go anywhere) and thinner naked <br /> <br /> I think it's funny because all the sex nonsense is so funny that it makes me feel bad. I've got so much fun by cleaning my finger nails than watching this mess.
