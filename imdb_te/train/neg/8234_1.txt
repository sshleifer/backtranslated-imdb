This little cast writers and producers have lost their new depths of deprivation. The author's block was too bad, or ideas dried up, a young man was forced to include a frustrating sight of a woman in the van's back seat, and immediately throws a fire in the car and at least summarizes what the value of this film is). One kid of her friends at Gun Point, as well as several episodes of graphic vomiting, have treated one of the other women in the kidneys; Once done ... we got the message! This is really taking a toilet comedy to another level! If the script and the acting were good, I forgot to see the film that was completely featured in a low-budget video. It's a very clever storyline, in a clever (unique) direction, we've only got to get the view from the inside of the van. It has become more realistic. <br /> <br /> You can not see in other places, many women, such as the store or the field, have been disappeared, and this adds a much needed tension. <br /> <br /> The script is terrible. Like Lines: 'I do not feel very good ... I want to go home' after a mental illness after the girls; By a screwdriver, the shot is subjected to a little bit undercooked. <br /> This act is diabolical (unlike man). All mainstream 5 actors have worked for taking a famous course during this long postal strike! The sound was very bad, I had to watch the whole movie with subtitles. <br /> The director has an easy job. <br /> For screening and screening ...... If you look at this, please make sure some paracetamol is ready. !
