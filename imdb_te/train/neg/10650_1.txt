The film is without doubt the worst horror film I have ever seen. And I have to say a lot, considering such stinkers like heaven's daemon, Lovers Lane, and Bloody Murder (which is close to the second). However, I love the bad horror movies, and as you can tell from my user name, this one really sticks up. There is nothing to entertain more than a poorly made slasher image. For the film, there is no bearing on the film in the opening sequence of a woman's tanning gray, especially the film failed to tell the rest of the film two years before. This acting is continuous, and most camera shots round the scene of women's areas. The police I saw a lot of stone faces, uniform actor. The best / worst part of the film should be a murder weapon. A big security pin ?! What are they thinking? Who is the killer An unsatisfactory "huggies" employee? It is necessary to give the whole picture zero, but it drowned if I did not have the fire
