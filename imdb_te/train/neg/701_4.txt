During the Christmas break, college colleagues are preparing the door to stop and lag behind to help replenish by apartment buildings. <br /> <br /> This is a bit more complicated, murdered, choked-and-dressed psycho pushes the crowd in different violent ways. <br /> One of the '74' Video Nesss' listed by the UK in the 1980s, The Dark That Dripp Blood has a good reputation for its first sight. The word 'video nasty' some great clear gore, torture, sex, etc. Some images of the touch touch the mind.: All things dream of a horror fan. So, after hearing all of that information, I settled into the pranks (alt header) with the expectation of a dismal slasher. . . And that's what it tried, but pretty much failed completely. Visually, the image is not great. Cinematography, Gore (except for a couple scenes), and all in the whole direction fail. It's not just enjoyable to see. Besides the lack of an asymmetric script, it often throws in random things without any real cause (such as a random killing). There are some cool death scenes, pretty face face melt (can be seen in the poster), but it's positive about it. Acting is pretty bad, the story is incomplete, the killer is not cold or scary, and it suffers a major flaw in which to avoid any major flaw: it's a bit boring. Overall, The Door That Drupt Blood is not a total mess for a movie made by some UCLA film students, which cost $ 90,000 (more than double today). It has a couple of good things, and is very watchable. . . But a slazer image looking to be at the level of images such as the Sororita Row and the House of Peaces. . . It's not just comparable. Do not expect too much, and you can at least entertain. I hate what I say, but it is one of the few films I've seen that I'm good at remake. . . And yet, they go after great works like Black Christmas. Oh! Good. . <br /> - Violence / Gore: Some people who have been killed, and Gore is a lot of okay. . . But there is nothing special. <br /> - Sex / Nudity: Nudity is a bit simpler (i have) nudity, but not much. <br /> Killer (s): Nah. <br /> - Frightening / suspense: A jump scare or two, but none is very effective. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Humbug! <br /> -AP3-
