Many people feel that the movie is very cruel. When I see it, I can say that the arguments are not correct. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this film is really stable. But overall, hanging is not all fearful. The ultimate scene (iball thing) is not really that nasty. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to being mad, rather than a low-quality ultra low budget video of violent shale. <br /> <br /> Anyone who watched the original film will be disappointed, there is no story (most people know it). Gore fans are disappointed because of the contrary, the blood and the buds are low. <P> <p> <p> <br /> <p> <p> Avoid this.
