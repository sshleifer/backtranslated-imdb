Very promise and nothing more. An actor who is absolutely pretending to be HK scales, but oh man this is a stinker. What story? Okay, Action HK will make for action flicks like. What? The action is terrible, corn, and less? The releases of the Dragon Age are up to this point and are larger and are generally considered classics in the Asian cinema. It's a blight. They were disputed by the actors couple from Infernal Affairs, but they did not bring life to a confusing script. There are continuous dialogue between two or three lines between the middle and the middle and what the characters say. You almost feel like they are giving each running ad and just ignoring the other characters. Michael Biehn made of wood, really? Does Samco Hung Stunt Use Double? There is no chance. The right path. Stay away.
