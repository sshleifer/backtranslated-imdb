This is one of those films trying to be a movie and time, and instead, tripping ends. <br /> <br /> When I saw a Queer Film Festival, I was worried by writing "The Young College Society's Wrongful", but over-all was disappointed. But I found this confusing, dramatic and totally depressing - it's dark and almost bad, with a thorny creepy flash painting of seventies with majestic music and jerky close-ups - it does not work - some scenes are very dark As a result, my audiences suppressed snickers and rolling eyes. <br /> <br /> The story has an interesting story to story, but it wanders down a dark, painful spiral.
