Does anyone think that this program really helps some people or is it only angry people who see it? When I am flipping through the channels and in the show I'm half the way to know about half the curiosity. I understand that Pat Robson is not all together. I think that if his audience liked him or they are good people, they will have a better life when he hears. Pat Robertson is a little consequence. The old man he thinks in old way. The fear of healing has been the same as it once did (thanks to God). Now if anyone answers my question, I will be shining for eternity.
