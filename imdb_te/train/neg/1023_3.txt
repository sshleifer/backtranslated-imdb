LL Cool J is much better in this movie than I expected! He made an excellent job of dealing with a "rebel" cap in a "rebellion" section. At the very beginning, he does a great job of constructing empathy for his character and the viewer who is in trouble. He deals with being a "gentle giant" - its harsh external person can threaten anyone, and its heart is clear from the very beginning to the right place - and he does an excellent job. <br /> It was a performance that certainly did not win Morgan Freeman awards. After the film starring Shawshank Redemption, the movie is definitely a step. His role in Edison was not just allowed to show his true talent as his actor - and he blamed him on the back burner in terms of a combination of characters. There are many ways that his role (Mos Ashford) can play a very important role. He is frustrating and does not have a real speech. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Timberlake is in the music industry. The young journalist was very less and vigilant to play his role. The film is a common action film (at least in the beginning) has had some similarity to the corrupt police affairs LA experienced in the past. As an action movie, it has shoot-m-up-scenes, blood and guts. These scenes are usually unrealistic and painful predictable. There is much less suspicion about what's going to happen at the end - I think you're expecting better in the good cops / bad-cops fight - it's a little bit closer to the real police shoot. <br /> <br /> It's hard for Timberlake's role in the shoot-out scenes. He has guns and does not use them. If he finally fires a gun he will wipe it out. Then he runs out bullets and does not have a gun - and 30 seconds later, moving or without anything - suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns and extra ammo! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> What you are looking for is a fantastic fairy tale in a fairytale world. Personally, as long as this is true, the movie's KIND does not matter much for me. I think the story is true. It is fictitious in many of the things that I think this story is very unsatisfactory.
