Criminally Insane 2 is included in the new DVD of Satan's Black Wedding / Criminal Insane, and this is a very good thing because I'm so curious to see the movie and the sequel (especially the obscure). I am now satisfied with my curiosity and can not see again. I guess, recollecting most of the CI2's only "flashbacks" for CI, and Ethel's sleepy footage, binge memories. Proposal 13 was released from Napa State (Wonder if she had to watch her play crash when she was there) and Ethel immediately sent half the home to run through a nice old woman who takes the call "granny". It is portrayed with all video camera, so the image and sound are very exciting and it will be done with the "rolls" pair. Ethel of course is her thing, which is sending someone among her and food, specifically the guy exposes one of her mayhem and extorts her dessert. Moreover, any half of the crowds should be surprised for the murderers who have made sharp knives with a kitchen and rat poison in the kitchen. That means misleading "loyalty". If you have liked or disliked criminals, there's no good reason to see this excluding the curiosity. The wonders why these makers are suffering. 10 to 2.
