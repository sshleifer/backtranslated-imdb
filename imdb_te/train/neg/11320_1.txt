Someone has to pay the car ... this is really awful ... Jean Claude's cyborg looks like gone with the wind ... this is an hour I wish I could have delayed getting back ... Fortunately it was a serious trouble ... I fell asleep . How can these caribbean actors create this dog? I spend time watching algae grow up on a fish tank rather than participating in this completely terrible concoction of many genres. I will now use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table. $ 5.99 at Walmart This movie is very much expensive ... if you really have it, they managed to list them for many years and then wait until they threw them after they were bored not to sell. <br /> <br /> For the love of God, this movie will die in the dark.
