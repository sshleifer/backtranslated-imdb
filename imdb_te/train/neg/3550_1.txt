I run a group to stop the comedian extortion and spent the horror stories I've heard for the past 2 months from comedians who just tried to audition, "The Last Comic Standing." If they are not a good agent then they do not even get the audition, so they have rejected more than 80% of the comedies who refused before showing off to anyone with talent! If they make an audition, it is said that if they get a second chance it will be "predetermined". So TV viewers do not see the best comics in the US. <br /> <br /> If comics take it into the program, most of them do not get IMDb credits. I know this because I have all 6 seasons credits, "Last Comic Standing" and I do not have to pay for the Producers' job. This is really insulting. A month ago, I asked, "Final Comic Standing 7" Facebook Why the producers did not give IMDb credits and I banned them from their Facebook page! I'm not a comedian, so I do not have this personal share. I want people to know the truth. I do not want to see anyone exploiting, so I helped the comedians. Comedians will be exploited in HMO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a BIG THREE network, so they are responsible for allowing this exploitation. <br /> <br /> The comedian is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
