This film is very skeleton. It's a fairly low budget movie (I hope!) Somewhat excuses it, but lack of a good cast and a fleshed-out plot hurts it too. Phillips is too parrot in his role as a parrot-away son of a good family looking for himself (his family ... though ... well, a little too white ...), but the rest of this cast is available in Strauss. Every moment with potential is ruined by high drama, and * there's a lot more sub-plot (a clear sign of plot-defect which requires filler ...) I'm not a hard-core Phillips fan who did not recommend this movie either, or totally * do nothing is. 4/10.
