<br/> If it does, it gets an F. Holy Mother Mary God. I mean, I have collected every time it was straight for video films, but it left me at every turn. Like many other B movies, the basic storyline is good and the filmmakers seem to have a reasonable level of resources, but the joke of execution. <br /> <br /> Fright Doug Bags, frat boys hosting their annual Halloween predators house fund racers, hurts into a living hell when a satan spell book is out of nowhere. Well thought out anyway, but rather the film is dedicated to presenting the consciousness of this frat boy's relationship, stretching with the outrageous Lesbian subplot. The original story is very little Halloween or mysterious spell book. It seems to me that the filmmakers actually think that such a dot will be put on. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the relationship between the fraternity boy. This film is not a bill. I searched for the producers and threatened them with physical harm. As bad as acting gets it, it's outrageous! The script is unexpectedly funny. Cinematography is just plain lazy. The whole movie enthusiastic night. The film is actually a masterpiece of Syfy Channel film productions. </ P> <br /> Filmmakers did not produce a soap opera for cinematic manufacturers, horrific scenes. The evil spell book eventually comes into play and their character becomes beautiful. I'm almost crying when I write this review. Wow! I mean Wow! This is a disaster that is unnecessarily cut off.
