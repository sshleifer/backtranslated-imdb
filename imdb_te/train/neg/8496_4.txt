Have you ever seen a movie made with longer width shots? No? I'm not. Well, I finally saw one of "Spring on my birthday" and I'm confessing why, now I know why people will not do it. The technique "Artie," is perfect, but it is not exactly mature for people's use. Tactical characters do not have any emotional attachment, and possibly the director's overall motives because this policy is heavily flawed. I do not know, I can not read the mind and I'm not sure how to judge the director. <br /> <br /> But one thing about this film is painful. Anti American sentiments. As an American, I know very well about the role of my country in the Korean War, I know that we are not always angels, but I worry about how this person's reforms will be. This blind man is not the source of the war Americans, we are the CAUSE of the war, and we have almost unilaterally destroyed the country. Anyway, Mr. Director. And if we do not compose yet, I would like to make this movie in the Communist Korea. Discuss forgetting your history. This is almost the same as the Nazis making "human beings" when the Allied forces become "bad men". The film is very historically naive and in fact is inaccurate, which is almost impossible to see. For a person who has come from a country that is very passionate to American intervention, he is definitely a high and powerful and legitimate person.
