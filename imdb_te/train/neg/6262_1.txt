I read here that I agree with those reviews and I have no words to define this sort of turkey, but in spite of everything, I still find a reason for the existence of these images. Video is a wealthy business, and are you happy with the only reason that many stores fill the shelves of video stores? This film comes from that period and I can imagine that this is the only reason I have produced and many, many, many other stinkers have done the same. Do you remember the "Rambo" simulations? And so many slashers of Z grade, I still feel nostalgia for that period. I can not waste my time watching because I first pressed the fast forward button after about fifteen minutes, and the funny sequence of a guy scolded to find just a lot, because if you look at it, they were made of plastic. And in the end, well, I did not understand what it was portrayed very badly. Same, I have an existing plot after all. But boy, the age of the video is a great age despite films like this.
