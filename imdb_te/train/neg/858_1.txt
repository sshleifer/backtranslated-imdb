I hate this movie! It's nothing like a book, thinking about it and making me mad. If you look at the picture before reading the book, then yes, this is a good image. But King's book is Amazing and this movie is nothing. I mean, the general meaning may be the same, but most of the elements of the film are completely different. Example end! So in the book it's too intense and seconds to escape Danny and Wendy's before the hotel exploded. But this terrible movie version takes them through a stupid maze like in Jack ... Yes, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. Another part of me that angered me is killing Mr. Halloran! What the heck, he is basically the hero of the book and they kill him as he is not important. Overall, this movie is very bad.
