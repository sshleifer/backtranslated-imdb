Fred Williamson, Mac Daringinger and Gary Bassie, (Lenny), deal with two former football players. Mac Dherringer arrives with his ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Dherringer), who works on a sex talk on the telephone. Jennifer feared by a caller who wants to do her terrible things and she asks her for help along with many ladies. Mac & Lenny has more time on their hands and often Miami, Fly. Take part in the sports bar that goes on all the cities of golf courses or towns. There are plenty of punches, murders, and double meaning words that the film brings to the fullest extent. Do not waste your time, this film cost me 50 cents and it's very high.
