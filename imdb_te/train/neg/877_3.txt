<br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with the title titled "Private Lessons II", and I feel that this should be a sequel to the traditional "practical Lesson". I said it. This is a simple soft-cinemax image that does not change your life. There is only one hot sex scene in a roof, but it is. I've seen this a long time but believe me, it's just a simple boring soft core movie. <br /> Women are hot. My advice is to watch only if it is broadcast on cable.
