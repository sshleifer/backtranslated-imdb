For just 80% of that time wasting a couple of hours watching this and totally disloyal, I can give this worst Turkey Year Award, no problem. There is some big description to say that the plot is unbelievable. Apparently losing words to describe this complete triptych. There are absolutely and completely different roles without any comparisons of realism (dozens of such items are made in 'serial killer flicks') but acting is terrible. For those who pay to see this, I hope you return your money, for those who have paid to do this, I hope you give your money back. Many are better, I believe there are many new releases there. Go and look.
