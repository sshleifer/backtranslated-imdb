Do not be fooled by big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. That's just a gloomy extra. Their scenes were probably shot in a day. Whatever their intention to be in this film, if you have an actor like James Woods, you can use him better. It's a sign of bad direction by which and by me. The plot itself is not that bad. And most of the actors are above average. Cuban guding junior is terrible. He did not believe much about laughing at dramatic scenes. And this is not a good thing, it's not a good movie. Action sequences are not bad, but they do make special punch it more exciting. Good direction again. Passing for such a film is also wrong. The main character takes about half an hour action. For a very slow 90-minute action thriller. Angie Harman is the only ransom. She does her best to do all the work. A very bad director left her hanging. Yes, the film was much better with the great director. Andy Cheng is a novice director who does not have much experience. And you can expect at least some exciting action scenes for an action / stunt coordinator with his expertise. Do not waste your time. Avoid!
