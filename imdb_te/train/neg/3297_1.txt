Why do millions show that we love our children and make them feel full joke? They asked why Hollywood did not make it. They remove the garbage and pay large amounts of money into the worst people and ask to pay $ 10 to see their worst. The TV program is good people in the worst conditions in the top IL 'boys. It was not with the wind but it was fun. This image is rubbish! Because Hollywood does not get anything with the original, they are good and for some $ $ $ it will be ruined. I hope this film makes 10x less than cost to make. Any funky single person with this garbage, who have come to drive a simple lean. Audience is a victim. <br /> <br /> Do not see it, rather see the rebuilding of the TV show. They are still holding 20 years later.
