This film is not awful but it's not very good. I'm a big fan of Tony Colette, I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. The film starts with writer Robin Williams and receives a book from a 14 year old. The book is great and can not believe that he is a kid. Tony Colt is not sure whether this kid really is or if she does it all, the kids are the guards. <br /> <br /> The film is very scary, and Tony Coltay's performance is amazing as well as Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> I will wait until the film comes to DVD.
