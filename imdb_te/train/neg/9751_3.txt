I'm not giving this movie less than 3 stars because there is no similarity with Manos: The Hate of Fades. The film's biggest crime is the head-blowing boring and horrible, unfortunate British. The motion of the film was an effective promise, the whole teleporting concept, but the direction they went was absolutely interesting. This is a film about research funding and dams rather than projecting lasers. The actors are wooden, ineffective, and away. The love affair between the two scientists - it is anything but mysterious. I do not know what the attraction between them is because chemistry does not exist. Why is not the realm of the Melfi-face-to-face really understood why he met everyone he met? I know at least now that I should always give a fair trial before anyone can cut their research funds, otherwise they will be robbed and killed by goofy hand gestures.
