Sure, we all like bad movies at one time or another, and we actually enjoy them, but it's not just a guilty pleasure, it's just the worst. Some, Vince Offer, thought he was able to play the lead role, perhaps possibly drunk / over - probably two - and thought it was a great idea to make a film. He showed his script to people who were equally high / drunk. Overall, the film was so bad, predictable, and unrealistic I could not get up to 20 minutes before I turned it off. This will serve God as you serve Citizen Kane. Bot man? WTF ... a bat, some guy running around with a real original. It is better to call him Fat Man, and a fat man in a superhero outfit.
