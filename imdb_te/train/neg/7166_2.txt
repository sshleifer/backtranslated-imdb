This film is great, but it gets smaller. Cheesy special effects and acting. If this story is not too lousy I might have looked past. If the background story is greater, it would have been better. Platform is linked to this woman centered around a nasty druid witch. Pulling on the image and on it and describing something that is clear, it just puts the plant. Christopher Walken has a part, but it is very unclear, it's a very movie. The film is capable, but it looks very bad for the TV movie. I will escape this film.
