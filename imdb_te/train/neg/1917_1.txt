Even if the film that has realized events is not entirely bad, it should be shot. On the night of June 3, 1980, the Grand Island, Nebraska destroyed seven storms. Grand Island is located on the banks of the Plastie River in Hall County. The film was produced by the filmmakers in the film Tree Mountains in Ontario, and moved the entire event to an unincorporated city called Blind Worth. People of Grand Island have dared to forgive the poorly produced movie due to this terrible night.
