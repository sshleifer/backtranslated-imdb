First, the main, Brad Dourif is a kook. If you are trying to make this film serious, then I promise to destroy him for you. If you do not take him too seriously, he's really fun to see. As another reviewer, I loved the scene that Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Doriff announced each other's love. Another great camping scene saw John Landis as a snotty radio show producer, sitting around the room and stroke. In fact, I realized that the last 15-minute film was non-stop laughing-off, and I'm not sure if Tobey Hooper was to be that way.
