It's a silly movie with an imaginative storyline and horrific acting! Willie Nelson was as strong as his skull. The film appears to be a big announcement for the bright red lipstick wearing Jessica Simpson - not too much fun on her face - it's not fun in the campus and I think - is imaginative. Whatever money to make the film is a disgraceful waste. Any references to other older Marilyn Monroe films did not see Blond Ambition. It is also unbelievable - Jessica Simpson is capable to step into an executive secretary position at a cap drop - that's ridiculous !!!
