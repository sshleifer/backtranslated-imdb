Burton, who appears to be even worse with every film he's directing, is still worse. Many objectionable items are the first of the film. This is something that every time something happens, you "he's got out of his gun!" Shout out or be sure to hear someone or just let everyone know. Carter is really awful and so this is Wahlberg, who does not play directly and convinced. Very good effects and photography in John Williams's mold by Burton's best friend Elfman, but poor music. Heston appeared in an involuntary scene to disperse his most famous catch-fortresses from the very first film. Very poor results. <br /> If anyone in there sees in the sleepy house, if they notice me, the bursts of the movies will decrease. I heard that this particular project was produced by others and Burton was brought to the director, in which case the judgment should be questioned. But I have no possible vision approval that he might have in his career before his slip; These films have evidence. In "Sleepy Holoo", he did not even decide whether he was a comedy or a real horror film and whether the British character actors (Chris Lee, etc.), a monster rally film (never intimidated by horror fans). The film did not succeed in horror or comedy because it was schizophrenic, and did not develop any style to combine both. "Planet of the Apes" is quite similar and the result is a "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" than Science Fiction. He was also falling short of the "big" directors trying to satisfy the whole audience. Word to Birthton - Select something and use it directly, or use all the same ("Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejus") or you're the same. Fans of your movies stop me.
