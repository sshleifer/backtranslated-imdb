Sometimes a movie is very comprehensive, it has an impact that can ruin your courage. You started to question yourself, what does this mean to our society that is very small? <br /> <br /> True, Gun is still the main character, plot tool and still producing Hollywood's main role. Conflict and resolution in films. The character needs a gun. The gun gets. He can not do that because he has a gun. First puts his gun down. OH MY GOD What are we going to do? He has a gun! He waves around it, acting more harmful than real humans. He pushes questions, pushes the face of each other for 90 minutes. The symptom of any ending is the consolation sound of police sirens. <br /> <br /> It is a real challenge to work with the hacked formula, such as tired; An image is very clever and well executed. This is not the only one. It does not have life and any personality, and it will suck these parts from you. This will make you feel the time and place you live in. Really, who needs it? Yes yes, I said: I think it's the worst movie I have ever seen. Anyone involved in making the worst killed by this sub-medieval spirit publicly disrespect the evils they have done to us.
