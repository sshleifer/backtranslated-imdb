A reasonable effort summary for this film. Good sixty film but no meaningless success. Maggie Smith gave a good performance, it was incredible but it was not as good as she gave, other actors just feared! A terrible character. It's not too funny and it really is not particularly funny and does not really achieve its genres because it's not dramatic. Romance is the only one to achieve a satisfactory level. The target spectators did not hit and the message sent messy messages. The most basic storyline and the most basic storyline is not pretty well removed or not displayed and the film is not as good and why it is confused why the target audience is climbed, but Maggie is very cool and storyline.
