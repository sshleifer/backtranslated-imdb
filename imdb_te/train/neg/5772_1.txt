I just have to add, someone actually reads this and has not fully gotten the point yet. These other reviewers do not joke around, it really is the chance to see you ever the worst color image. <br /> <br /> When this film is started, I can not believe that the world is really like this. <br /> They do not tell you that they're just a house. It really does. The "Director" took on some other good-looking acting students, such as the family highway camcorder (before DV cameras and computer non-linear editing), and any other devices (lights, sound gear, etc.) attracted and filmed a movie. <br /> When I see, this is in my mono TV, so I'm only one channel of audio (right in the speaker). At first I thought I'd be hooked up wrong. The film is silent until someone speaks within a few minutes. I got up and moved to another channel and suddenly I could not hear music and sound effects but could not hear the dialogue. They recorded the sound in various bloody channels! I mean, there are movies that are funny to watch, so they are good, kind of thing. I'm not sure of one of these. I mean, I'm a bit of a junior filmmaker. And seeing the bad movies you want to go out there and prove you can do it better. <br /> <br /> As a result of these earlier works, I felt chick hot and was disappointed in the breaking of her bathing scene. T and A from her would have raised a score of 3 or 4 from a bit. But alas, no. If you want to make a film, it will remove the garbage, throw in some inappropriate nudity. Worked for Roger Corman.
