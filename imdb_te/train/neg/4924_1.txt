This image is very bad. It's probably hard, but it is. It really is. Poor script, every vampire clich√© in the book was used, and no sympathy for the main character's origin ... ole Dracula. Previously there were some really amazing Dracula / Vampire movies, but it was not even made into the "horrible" slot. <br /> <br /> <br /> Teen slasher move, add a dribble to Dracula lore and mix in a heady tonic of the surreal / surreal day-dreaming ... And you can mess up the mess of a movie - Dracula 2000. If it's not bad enough to make the first place, they seem to have made an English accent with the Johnny Leigh Miller effect ... Can not find any good things to say about this film ... What is the problem /> <br /> You have heard enu English <br, but as he was the one trying to make an English accent. <br /> You can tell your money in everything. ), Or get it rented, see it, and learn about yourself as scary as the telepathis. <br /> <br /> PS Law Law is pretty frightening!
