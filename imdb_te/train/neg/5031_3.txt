The original 1965 Japanese film "Gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ updating of the darker, lowest kid Gogira (Godzilla) for the 1960s consciousness. Gamera, of course, is a big, flying, flame-throwing turtle - some versions of Godzilla are quite large, but in most respects are usually similar. <br /> <br /> This version of the original film is edited and rendered by sensational Sandy Frank. And "gammira invincible" just as the American version of Godzilla ("Godzilla king of the monsters") is more than just spelling mistake. The American scenes are not as ridiculous and addictive to the great Gogira, but they can not be added in the story because they are a bit less. <br /> <br /> There are few scenarios for the development of the film, and there are enough individuals to create some tensions outside the main plot. However, after Gamera's appearance, the film is in the film Kaizu movie. <br /> <br /> This performance is great - the American Add-ons are correct. Directing is great for this period and art, and special effects are not bad at all times at all (all small). Some sets and backdrops are very good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here is, of course, nothing about the film is original. Gaeta, however, develops a more distinct personality in his next films - it's worth watching if you're a very good fan.
