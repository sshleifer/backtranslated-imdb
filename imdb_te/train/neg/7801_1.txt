This piece of crap will keep me as short as just a specified warrants. One of the worst pictures ever made by Znbie 90 - right up there with Schnaas' other terrible zombie entry - Zombie DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). It is very bad that these films are portrayed for everyone involved in their creation. I managed somewhat (just ...) ZOMBIE sit by Doom - but ZOMBIE 90 was so fierce inadequate - compared to Schnaas' other horrible film - that I got the fastest forward through everything first 10 minutes later. ZERO acting skills, useless gore, terrible camcorder-style camera-work, comedy dubbing ... It just goes and goes. I really can not get rid of this trash - and I can get some redemptions about any movie. It's one of the worst films ever made - you've been warned 1/10
