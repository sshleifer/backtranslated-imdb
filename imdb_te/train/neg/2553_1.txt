Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What can I say. Kate Jackson is to be directed. She should go back to acting ... in the second thought she is a bad actress. Who gives money to produce something bad? I like anti-Christ movies and usually have a good laugh and odd scare but this is just bad bad bad. Stars acting is worse than what you see in a soap opera. Special effects, you can call them, where ridiculous. If you are slowly motioned in the motion, I see the shells that go out of the blood. We had to stop the drive after 30 minutes. The original prints of these images should be destroyed, all discs and tapes are destroyed and people pay cinema rented to all people involved in film production. Then those people never have to act, and their own home movies are not allowed either live or movie.
