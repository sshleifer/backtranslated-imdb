The film began with a somewhat similarity, which left it for random characters to move the story and left it for an endless series of encounters. It's impossible to get involved with this film. The film is the worst pile of some people with animation skills, but lacks creativity or storytelling ability. This is a frightening evil attempt from a big studio. The bravery and inspiration issues in Disney are clear, and the lack of oversight and quality control is not known. The film speaks volumes about their inability and frustration, allowing the light to see the day. The movie is on my list of my "worst pictures" list.
