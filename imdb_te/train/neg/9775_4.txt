Good shows and art direction are not a good film. The film is terrible and frustrating, and I am unable to find any happiness at the end of "happy" with the union strike. The humorous efforts of the lake's pregnancy are entirely dangerous, and the film associated with Baldwin's brother has already been a strike against it. In a positive note, Long is still one of the few lowest actors in the United States, and he alone keeps this value on the VCR. I give this a 4.
