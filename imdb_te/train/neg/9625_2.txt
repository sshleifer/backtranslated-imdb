The film does not provide any imagination in its premise or execution but there are only two things in mind after watching the two so-called humorous comedy. One day after the studio in his honeymoon, Scuba Preacher (Hank Azari) is about Nitt-Pixie on the analytical insurance risk manager Rober Pieper (Ben Stiller) who invented the new wife Lisa (Debra Messing), who cheated him. Reuben and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) return home and go to the Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), who went to school with pre-schools. <br /> <br /> * Speller Alert ***** Polly is insane and sloppy and reuben is a neglected lives which is against a man but they start to date and he starts to try new things such as salsa dancing Reuben A The guy starts to change and eating spicy foods. But one day Lisa comes back and wants to marry Reuben but he did not really want to, but Pauli left before being convinced to marry her. <br /> <br /> The film's second directorial venture by John Hamburg has written two typically unfunny screenplays in "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents", but these two films appear to be classics compared to the old part. It's easy to say that this is not funny, but it's also easy to figure out why I think about this movie. The film is entirely and completely imaginable to complete with each sequence as it happens only for the ridiculous reasons of the script. The script says that Hamburg has written this without thinking of trying something different and sometimes he looks "something about Mary" but it looks like the same events are trying to produce the same power that looks very strong. Did anyone really feel a blind ferret? If you do, your easy! These emotional lectures seemed to capture all of the film roles that could not be explained in a few times, but they clearly show everything they've accomplished. Stiller does a lot of work, but he does work less and the film does not work jokingly or romantic as it is awaiting good scripts to come along.
