The only redemption of this film is the true storyline ... otherwise, the movie is terrible. Acting is ridiculously mistaken, and the set design is cheesy and very frivolous. The story is good, but it's very hard to see due to all the terrible acting. I did not recommend watching this movie ... The only ransom quality actors of this film were some attractive ... especially Ryan Bauer, the soap opera actor. Some of the editing has done well, but there are continuity errors at all levels ... I started to watch bad movies sitting sick and tired ... can you get better soon?
