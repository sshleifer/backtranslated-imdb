Band The Camp is awful, Naked Mile is a little better, and this third straight DVD in the American pie franchise is the same quality as before. Eric Stiffler (John White) split off his girlfriend after losing her virginity and now he is joined by Eric's cousin Dwight (Steve Thale) at Mike 'Couz' Cazezion (Jake Sigel) College. With the promise of many parties, booze, and adequate hot chicks promised at Beta House, they only have tasks in the Fifty list to earn official official memberships. But for the Forty Years, the GEK ("Geek" for once and for all to fight for beta and gebe ban, the Edgar (Tyrone Savage) electrically-hungry nitur (the "geek") eder ("geek"), which is bigger and better than the beta, , Defeating Greek games by losing one against each other, the last winner of the games, Noah Leavenstein The Dad (only Regular Eugene Levy) runs on this show, which runs bras looking for people, a gladiator duel floating on water, a greasy pig, a Russian roulette-old horse throat in the mouth, and wife drinking alcohol and drinking (without disallowing).
