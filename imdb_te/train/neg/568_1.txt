This "subtle" in SCIFI channel today and I say "I'm speechless" I have recorded today that I can see tonight after work. I have so much hopes, now I'm spinning the shelves that I'm looking for on the cord stroke, so I'm hanging on myself. Perhaps the worst picture I have ever seen. I wish I could say that it's good to be "fun to make this movie fun" but I do not give me anything to work on this film. I know that I do not want to post spoilers here with the warning before but I will go anyway "This movie sucks" I said there! This image should show the students to show them what they do not want to do! My nine-year-old niece can make a good movie. The only good thing about this film is the sound and / or sound track. OH! I found a rusty C-clump in my old practice box. I placed my left hand on the toe and wiped my memory and wiped my memory until I had pain. I was able to tape this VHS, but I think it would burn in the pit pit. If I can wash with soap, I'm afraid I'll never get clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to people who hate you. -Mike
