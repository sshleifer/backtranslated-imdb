The film is strange ... I saw the sillajeb cubenis (mushrooms) in a quarter. It's really strange. I'm supposed to see you high, but mushrooms are not enough. I can not stop laughing .. maybe lsd will work. This film is a group of things that turn into other things, and dance. It's really cheesy for today's standards but it's really good to release it ... it's one of a kind. Some people thought this film was good, but I was very curious, and I saw mushrooms at that time. If your party or something and the replicas are beautifully lit, you'll get some laughs pop it up.
