<br /> <br /> Well, this film really sucks. Think of "Love Actually" in reverse. Nothing is quite right, nothing is perfect, and absolutely nothing will make you laugh. Love is rare in this movie. <br /> This is a whole flap. <br /> <br /> With Jennifer Love Hewitt's star billing, it will be the group of guys who are kindly present to be viewed. Just catch a glimpse of petite hewat with form fitting dresses. Now the guys say ... there are some good scenes ... but it's really weird eye candy. There are "opportunities" for drinking water. <br /> B) The ultimate romance is positive. It's contrary and "on the top" is related ... yet I still have a positive position. <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott has acted as a fond friend ........ refresh! Thank you! <br /> <br /> The path of 2/3, I was convinced that Jennifer Love Hewitt became the next softest legend. <br /> <br /> Then she will come back again. She is very good in the next film. <br /> Oh, and her sister is stupid. <br /> <br /> She's stupid by her husband ... and what hecks, her way is stupid. <br /> The next time. Do not wait for the next love with JLH!
