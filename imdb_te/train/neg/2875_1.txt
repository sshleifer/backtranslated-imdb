This is always the biggest part of the worst. They seem to have spent more time together, and they seem to have earned money on DVD cover than they did in the original film. I thought the DVD's had been switched off at home at home until I really recognized one of the actors from the cover. The film appears as someone with a hundred bucks and camcorder, and they spend half of rats. The picture is very clear, but if it's a very unfortunate lighting, cinematography, if you call it, producing, acting, what they're doing, and if the script has one, it makes the picture look worse than an old porno. At least the old porno has a point. Some PETA members seem to have met and decided to make a really disturbing, nonsense PSA about animal rights and feelings. This is not the value of money or time. This is nothing but the original BTK serial killer than the killer's name and some of the victims. He should have been happy because the film is still not free, or he may have come after the movie is very bad.
