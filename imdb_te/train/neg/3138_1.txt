I wrote how great this film is. It's terrible! This performance is the best. Leonardo made a lot of money because she went to watch theaters 7 times in theaters. Where did hell get money? Anyway, I wanted to know more about Titanic; Why it drowned, so many people in the minds were running; Maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. Some people know that some people are running on the ship because it is a fire in the fire before it leaves. No, what you see is a poor boy lying in a poor boy and because he is naked in the movie (whether the film is stupid you say stupid the movie?). I cried in a scene. They show the water filled with the ship. It's like pool water! I'm thinking of making this movie and they can not make water out of the sea actually? <br /> <br /> The sunken band on the shipboard .. Just funniest. This is the worst picture until it crosses the Pearl Harbor "Nothing to Do Reality" section.
