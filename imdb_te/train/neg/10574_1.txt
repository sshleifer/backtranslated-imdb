With FAMILY, this new season is worse than the season one. I can not imagine what they are thinking. As a horror fan, most gore and mindless turquoise can survive, but this series is worse with every one. I can not imagine how painful it is for actors and teams to work every day, and I try to do such trash. Story! Much more to ask? Character! How can we sacrifice anyone's fate in these stories? If we are not engaged, if they do anything, do they do anything? Nearly every episode concludes with a bloody blood transfusion, confusion or diagnosis or confusion without any sense. Dante's attempt also included some disturbing sexist violence during this season and dismissed the meaningless end. Ironically, productive values ​​and performances can accelerate, but the content is completely worse. I have great hopes for the weekend of Executive Garris on the summit, but we'll see.
