The film must be nominated for a new style: the perfect mess! With the exception of a few chuckles and gore one or two scenes, this film is full waste of time. I call it "campie". "Campie" refers to this movie is not fun. The first half of the idea of ​​cinema is "good, right?" Finally, at the end of the "Brother / Sister" team and what they ultimately do when they finally explain what it does at the end, but Mr. Onorati & Ms. have already spent the entire second half of the original caretaker film. Pacula make this terribly tick off somebody who screws in such a terrible film.
