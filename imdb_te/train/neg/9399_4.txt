Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Glennson's threesome Coney Island Carnis are competing for Ginger Rogers, a working pals that sell salt water toe. After the outbreak of World War I, the three ginars try to ginger away and away. The first half of this RKO pathie production is difficult, with three males, a liners with sequencing and 'smoker' conversations quickly. This focuses on the sequence of operations in the second half of the US Navy as a German merchant cruiser and a U-boat. These scenes are alive and well-filmed, but overall it's overlapping and unsatisfactory comedy drama with a flat end. Only for fans of the stars.
