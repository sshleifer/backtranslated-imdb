In my life I have seen many great and awesome movies. I am not expert in expert reviews, but in this case I'm sure. First of all, these actors are the worst I've ever seen ... You also want to remove their DVD first in the first 2 minutes of their first acting. I feel that these actors are not interested in quality. <br /> Another dreadful thing about another dialogue is that they are dull. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear them. It seems that your 14 year old son is a good work. <br /> If you do my message, save your time and money.
