When Lassie's Magic started off at the City Music Hall of Magic, I was crazy enough to believe that some of the first Lassi movies will be like heart-warming. <br /> <br /> The story is shaky, the Sherman brothers' songs are below their normal level, the characters are uninterested, and Jamie Stewer and Mickey Rooney have seen very good days. </ p> <p> And then, I was interested in how the cooperation of ALICE Faye was, because she had not been on screen for many years, and had always been in her previous roles in Fox. Alice is very discouraged by superstitious and refusing photography. Another disappointment. <br /> There is nothing original, it's not even remotely interesting for an adult - obviously, there is no magic. You can skip this without missing one thing.
