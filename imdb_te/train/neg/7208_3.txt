I grew up watching an old inspector gadget cartoon as a kid. It's like getting smart for kids. The male cat can not solve in any case and the walking dog's brain and his niece penny walk through all the works. I heard live action movie is good, so I checked it out in the library. I rented this film for free and I thought I would be paid to see it. <br /> <br /> Broderick Dawn Adams is the voice of the gadget somewhere near acting expertise. His voice was wrong. Nothing like the girl cartoon penny played by Penny. The cartoon version is her brunette with beautiful piglets. But doing a good job of doing her work. Dubney Coleman gave good performance as chef quimby. <br /> <br /> He mistakenly concealed any gas in the mobile phone or broke into the suspiciously thrown messages. <br /> Gadget Mobile is wrong. It did not speak in the series and it was fine. Why did they do this? <br /> Gadget is very intelligent in this movie. In the show he is a complete idiot. Here he has half the intellectual intelligence. "Borderick says" Wowser "and it should always be" Wowsers ", it sounds dull with 's'. <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Richard Kyle Aka <br /> <br /> Another penny checks the gadget watch here and tells the brain to say a little bit about it.Don Adams said, "Brain is not now, please let's name your name in Wof's Leave it at noon. "Of course, in this film, Adams is not just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear out loud funny. Let's at least stupid car vice versa. <br /> <br /> These children do not like 13 years of age.
