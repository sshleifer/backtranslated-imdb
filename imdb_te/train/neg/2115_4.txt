Only mucous secretions - and do not ask for more details - The wife of the old amateur plantation of the regular order of young virgins can keep the fresh and youngest deteriorating body and mind in youth. Except for many participants in medical trials, Virgins willingly leave their seams, and Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) arranges them to kidnap and preserve them. He will uncover himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If Corpus Vanishes is not a harer of the horror, it turns out to be a plain limberger, an interesting backdrop. <br /> <br /> An unexpectedly avant-garde can escape the fortune to play in the cave (Angle Rositto, The Man in the Mad Max Beyond Thunderam); A brother, Angel (Frank Moran), his crazed brute, is a great fan of and a virgin of virgin hair; Crazed mother of two (Minerva Eurale); crazed wife (Elizabeth Russell), sleeping in a plush coffin and, of course, the crazed doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> An awesome young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luna Walters) tracks the physician down by a strange orchid wearing the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to live at night, an aggressive storm will soon break. That clue sticks to us some emotional violence. As young girls in Hollywood have known that virgins are known as virgins, there may be some unpleasant surprises to face Pot. They are dark passages, near dead virgin, a basement grave, and then, a direct threat to Patricia's own scribble bones. If she is alive, she should give her the story to any editor. <br /> <br /> If you are not in a model (and why not?) in this moist slice of Moldi Velvet, do not confirm Bela Lugosi by the company he keeps here. He showed great influence in Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie The Black Cat (1934). Doctor. Vita Vardegast is a sad and contradictory person who protects his two young men. He finally takes the scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and the man begins to flay alive, AH, well, it's a great scene.
