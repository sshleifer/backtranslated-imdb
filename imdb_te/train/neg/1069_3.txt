I saw this movie at the AFI Dallas festival. Many viewers, including my wife, enjoyed this comic drama, but I did not. It features Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywood Land) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). Director Matt Bissonat married Molly Parker. These three actors have 3 friends in this film, two in marriage and one with a third person. It all happens at a lake house and it is amazing. The film first wants to play a drama and play the other way around.
