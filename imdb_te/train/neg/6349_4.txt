Woody Allen has done some of the best comedy stories and I think seriously that Annie Hall is a great movie but I really think about it maybe one or both seems better, but it will be harder. Some films that are not very good or bad like Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Loaded are not bad for Melinda and Melinda. Not too tired and unpredictable, his films are usually witty and happy, but how is this good old Woody? This theme runs along with four friends. Two authors of the game and one of the others mentioned the funny story with her friend. It's about a young lady who explodes in a dinner party unexpected. Never listen to the rest of the game because it starts to discuss whether it makes a good comedy or a tragedy. We started looking at two point view. A woman named Melinda is suffering from drugs and her ex-husband. After tragically attempting suicide she is an old family friend who has made a decision to show at the front door of her old friends. Comic about Melinda, slipping at 28 after sleeping pills. Both go to a jungle vortex of events that really are neither true nor fit together nor do you ever make a smile more than once or twice. There are some good performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they do not fit together there. They can not stop it from being drowned by other movies this year.
