I hope to be a viewer who visits 'Dream Machine' as one of Corey Haim's finest and "best of the century's films". Unexpected irony in my episode? <br /> <br /> The 'Dream Machine' is the remaining parts of the career of Corey Hoyam (except for the surprisingly good 'Prayer of the Rollboys'). Here, Hymn Nonphalent College Boy, Bernie, wants a cool car to attract the attention of his dream girl. A slick Porsche turbo: Gift - Bernie - Bernie, Lucky immediately decides to get her loyal piano tuner tuner to get back at her cheating husband. However, without knowing the woman, and unfortunate for Bernie, her dead husband was killed and his body was hidden in the trunk. Now, being in the film, the body has no deterioration or a rather foul funk, Bernie does not know this. In fact, despite the many ominous circumstances I do not know is suspicious something suspicious. <br /> <br /> The lesser-themed action of Hem, which is much less of these films (see The Double O Kid)). Even though part action was part of a romantic comedy, many filmmakers failed to show audiences at least forty-five minutes of excitement that took longer than enough time to show an immediate problem (ie, Bernie seized a car and a dead body, and a hitman Finding out that Porsche is hard to find). After this, and Haim (I also liked this kid, but he is not exactly holy when he does not act well) and poor acting and lack of emergency between Bernie and the villain thanks to poor performance makes many events unbelievable and as a result becomes inappropriate. In order to cause insulting injury, the soundtrack is unbelievable ridiculous, and the group is self-explicit songs you can hear in America (see Date Montez). <br /> <br /> Reliable Corey Hymn fans do not despair to see their boy in abundance. However, others realize that Haim's career has reached the highest level when he was 14 or 15 and others are unable to recover, while 90's B-comedy flourish is enjoyed by the audience.
