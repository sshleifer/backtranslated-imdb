After reading many comments here, I am surprised that no one has identified a remake of the Twilight Zone episode since the 1960s, called Vera Miles starring "Mirror Image". Sean Ellis did a better job of creating a potentially extraordinary story in 24 minutes with Radd Serlinging in a minute of 88 minutes with this dismal eagerness. A small part is effective with a mysterious and unexplained finish, but in a feature film, it has a bit more material and the story should make sense. Unfortunately, both matter and concept are missing from "Broken". Yes, there are few moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some More Observations: Although it is clearly a contemporary story, the film does not have a cellphone in one character! Although a car accident is an event, there is no indication for an insurer, a driver who is driving another car or a police report. My suggestion: skip this cloth and see the original!
