I want to start by saying that I am the first review of the film made on net. I thought it was necessary to warn people about this film because this was one of the worst films I really saw. After reading an interview with the director, he tells me that he respects constructive criticism and so I try to avoid the film retarded and I think it's why I think that's why I feel terrible. 1. Actors. <br /> <br /> I know Budget may not be allowed for great theses, but Nicholson worked for ten years in the industry. Very dull and special effects. <br /> <br /> Once the budget naturally interferes with what originally intended, but after working for many years there is no need to work. <br /> <br /> Hostel clear similarities. Although it does not split properly, it tries to achieve the success of former films. <br /> <br /> "The music is not all sorrowing or haunting, but it's not sickening in general." All the conversations are forced and terrible! <br / <br /> <br /> The subtleties associated with the theater and the person who came to protect them are like weak and almost ignorant. <br /> <br /> WTF is a good way how jarring, and not. <br /> <br /> I listened to the director's ideas in my post I really like him (he often asks his pages on IMDb.) The reason for a friend ... what you're thinking ... At any time during firing or editing you can understand what's in your hands on turkey yo ... sorry I'd love to be strict More talent, good and hopeful learning can achieve progress. Avoid like the plague At. I want my 81 minutes are interested in. (At least I do not need to pay to see it.)
