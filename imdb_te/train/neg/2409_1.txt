It is a painful experience, but I can not go in that role but when the scientist's brother goes to work, the act is really in the beginning, the work, I work with biohazard material means that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab On a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the scene There is a school laboratory that looks like a school laboratory and a scientist actually has breakfast in the laboratory and next to him is called a biohazard jaffer and his owner walks over him and does not say anything about him ... bad acting is too bad Can not get up and I'm nothing more than a house that's dead This compared to the classic films of the boll dhvannanga Uwi felt like Shakespeare!
