Dakota (1988) starred in another opening Lou Diamond Phillips vehicle. The film's next release is similar to Harley. There are some differences but they are the same. I do not know when I came first. I guess I will be one of life's secrets. But both of them are "kids" who are struggling with trouble. In these horses instead of bikes. They are basically the same movie and they're both cheesy as hell. You are serious L.D.P. Fan then I recommend you watch both of them. You L.D.P. Get some serious mugging and pose from. If you're the game then go for it. <br /> L.D.P. Fans !!!
