The movie is on TV and I have to admit, it's a bit surprising. There are many herds, confusion and bad editing that look good to see the old episode of Sesame Street. Acting is correct, but please, you really feel the feeling "straight to the video". Cast / crew made this movie a bad play. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but wait for it to be heard ten minutes before you hear it. Trust me, you can not even tell the difference.
