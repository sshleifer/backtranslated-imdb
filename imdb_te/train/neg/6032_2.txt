The doctrine that I taught in the backward left is usually a believer Christian. <br /> You have to have a well written screenplay to have a good movie. On the left side, this tragedy has fallen short. For one thing, it turns out the book is straightforward. Sometimes this two-hour novel takes place to reduce the 400-page novel, but I've seen no change in the film. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the development of zero character. When the characters in the story saves (I can not say), it makes clear that this book is a long, soul-searching process. It is quick and artificial in the film. The book looks decent enough for people like Rayford Steel, Buick Williams and Hottie Durham to look real, but the picture scenes are consistently given a quick treatment without any substantial. <br /> <br /> I realized that I was a Christian who was unwilling to say that I did not like this movie. , But I can not recommend to feel that I have a horrible movie in a good conscience. Maybe it's good to make 2-3 movies in the first film. Anyway, Christians need to be seriously treated as filmmakers, and we need to start by taking a picture in a fine way. I'll put a lot of effort back to the left, but that's what I see.
