After a long time in space, Superman returns to Earth (Brandon Ruth) looking after the remains of Krypton's planet. He loses Louis Lane (Kate Bosworth), who is married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) plotted a nasty plan, stolen from Fortress of Solitude, creating a new land and drowning in the U.S.. <br /> <br /> The most joyful pictures of Superman show unforgettable Christopher Reeve, or TV "Lewis and Clark" (and Terry Hatcher) or "Smallville", a brilliant expectation for Superman returning to Bryan Singer's version. Unfortunately, the terrible story is too long and boring, many unnecessary parts, lack of emotion and overdrafted in the IMDb. In addition, romance between Lois Lane and Superman is humiliating. Twenty-two-year-old actress Kate Bosworth is incorrectly mistaken, a five-year-old boy plays a mature journalist and veteran mother. Brandon Ruth is two years younger than Tom Welling, he played younger Clark Kent in "Smallville". The character of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowals is actually a crazy satire. Last but not least, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years, so it's older and older than the old cast, though it's an excellent Lex Luthor. The end of the corn is a soap opera and terrible. My vote is four. <br /> Header (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
