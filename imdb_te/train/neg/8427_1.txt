Let me start by saying how much I love TV series. His dreams have been lost despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man, unable to keep his dreams due to the unsettled father, which is easy and pleasurable to see in practice. In my opinion, it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. My 10 ratings in the 10 TV series without reservation. <br/> On the other hand, the spin-off of this movie is a real tragedy in every respect. In fact, the essence of the TV show is successfully transferred in any movie. The film is very discouraging, discouraging, which in most cases shakes me tears. Harold was beaten in a pub (and not joking) Comedy is not my feeling, but why TV series fans do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> The romance between Harold and Zita has not been completely tone and producers have always suffered to watch the movie. In the TV series, Harold always went to the distinguished girls, strippers. <br /> <br /> Albert reactions to the comments made by Harold friends are absolutely priceless in the TV series. <br /> <br /> Most of the British sitcoms spin-offs are very dull, with a significant exception to the Bassie films (some of which are actually better than the TV series!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My advice is - It has a very light tone, the TV series is more reliable, and is actually quite funny.
