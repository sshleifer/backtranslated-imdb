Rating: 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> As far as this short-range line is concerned, the science fiction channel has consistently combined with BG ads for the past six months, and I have learned more, but I felt increasingly dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> <br /> A few cinematic artworks stand up to a few exams and different people go to see different things. In this case, when people think of Battlestar Galactica, they will remember different things. Some are the chromium warriors with red light in their eyes. For others, they are favored with special effects that are very evident for their time. Most people forget the special conditions in the late 70s, especially on special television. Some memories will be solved around the story arc. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I came from the next team. The main component of Battlestar Galactica has been moved to protect one from the evil empire. Yes, bad. Silons were not able to do anything, but they still did the elimination of the human race. When the base stars were surrounding, men and women came together to meet the enemy with virtually unlimited resources and somehow survived until the next show. They do not live because they have good technology or more fire power. <br /> <br /> There are flaws in this show, and sometimes at times ill, but they care about you. <Br /> <br /> The authors of this current edition can never understand this. In some ways he took the most important part of the character's character in the original show and took the story arc and called nothing less than the rebuilding of television science fiction. Because it is their goal, they can decide how much they have achieved: failure. It is a redevelopment. In fact, one of the most productive of science fiction efforts in a very long time. ST from TAR, TST: DS9, Babylon 5, and Battlefield Land is also generous. <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore has contributed to more than a decade of popular science fiction, and has helped you with the most popular television science fiction. One of the difficulties he has is that there is no dispute in Bridge crew of Enterprise D & E, which is the inviolable rule of Roddenberry's ST: TNG. Many people within the scope of others who have had every opportunity to break the rules at the time of that power have not forgotten some of the lessons learned by Gene Rodden Berry, a science fiction master who recognized Ron Moore. Here, instead of writing the best story, he made a weird actress when I ever watched with the intention of creating a very cast dispute. In addition to being absent, some are not reliable. Whenever the soldiers were alert to someone in the security of the "hack" they could not get a few days, they should have the next day. <br /> I remembered the previous work of Ron Moore that he wrote the death of Captain James Kirk. He killed Captain Kirk, and alas, he killed Battlestar Galactica.
