This film is awful. Give me a dentist anytime! Do you believe that you have one of the main TV stations in Arabia here as their Christmas film? I think I'll enjoy these groups rather than Dudley Moore. The last time I saw it in my hot water bottle is that it has more interest, good plot, more play and much more interest than this waste of celluloid. Do not even see if you are drunk!
