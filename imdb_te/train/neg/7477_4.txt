A very dense road movie (although he actually sends his performance in Faulty Towers) with some comical relief from the magnificent John Clies. The top cap will flip from the sharp slash in the drop down on the skip stick and the worst part of the movie Martin and Han they find "someone else", they look your dangerous, etc.
