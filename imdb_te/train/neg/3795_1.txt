I really like this presentation. I honestly have done honestly. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay people get their language as "The Bachelor". His obligatory "Hogg" Andrew, James, is a good looking, well-done thirty something to help do with suitors (or "colleagues" as they are referred to in the show). The only problem is the half of them directly and James does not know this. If James chooses a homosexuality, they will get a tour to New Zealand, and if he chooses a straight, the person gets $ 25,000 straight. How not that fun? <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a very fascinating issue with the show bachelor. James is a nice smile and body, one of your younger young and successful gay guy who'd probably give you two glances towards your local bar before grazing for green pastures. Why did I like to cross the leader of Jacob? <br /> <br /> Unlike his physical appearance, James is curious and enthusiastic as a piece of chalk. Nevertheless, he had this pride and sounded praises about him. However, if James faced a vacancy, he would have a white wall compounding right. I honestly did not recall an interesting or notable thing. He is boring and unforgettable. Of course, one of the colleagues flat out does not advise him. I felt the best part of the show. Also, James speaks an annoying bored deaf. Sound woman or sound masculine, but not in the middle of the sentences **** Ink segue tones do not ... sit so painful. <br /> <br /> "I choose the guy directly and make you and your unfortunate hug" <br /> <br /> We have siites. An extraordinary noise of men who care about what is going to happen. Equally vapid, they seem to be able to escape from a person except, "Guy has brown wheat highlights or oh curly hair" Again, astoundingly tackling casting decisions seem to be the goal of this show. It may be hacked to type cast characters, which make it much more entertaining to watch than these amorphous drones. Whatever it is, they will still be up to James (although it is not difficult to do) in all of their common people, there is quite a bit. Some of the switches are actually warm and you know that there is a problem when it's more interesting than a celebrity. And it seems that the suitors are much more fun than the leading person? Very sad. <br /> <br /> Also, I thought that the IT Point referring to the boards of messages I thought was actually true. Direct men have more people than gay. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I do not say that all the gay boys are ugly and boring, in fact I have some of them very beautiful. <br /> You are just with BLAH when compared to men watching Tilaw Tevilla or The Batchletrett A Shot Shot a Love With. <br /> <br /> I do not know how fast I was in this show. I can accept a major role as interesting as a cardboard box, I can accept the mundane, apocalyptic suitors but pleas for me just a little bit for the love of God. <br /> You are disappointed if you look forward to drama, romance, sexuality or enthusiasm. The biggest "drama" comes from the fact that the suitors may still have a boyfriend in New York (how scandalous!). <br /> <br /> You have no controversy in this regard. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no twist, but if you have any kind of gaidar in it, 'whoever is not difficult, I'm only once wrong.) This program shows that it does not fail in its chips. We can look like James & Co. plod along with such wonderful activities like learning Western dance dance, shopping for gifts, a petting zoo, and gay karate. Yawn. Certainly dancing without you occasionally but who cares when everyone is boring anyway. One of the major problems with the presentation: NO ONE seems to be enjoying themselves - they are just going through the motion trying hardily hard to look a good time. <br /> <br /> You really blame all these events for being unimaginable and slim. <br /> Finally there is no physical aspect. There is no cuddling, no caressing, no kiss (!), No endearment of any sort. It's just a boring date, I'm strangely running CYA Sydney Sydney's Apphoushous dwelling (quick peck on the lips), which is so ridiculous **** is prudish I do not want to play with the perceived nature of homosexual men, but **** People who see reality TV shows need more than standoffish hugs and kurt kisses. <br /> <br /> Sorry, it is Sorry Bravo is to be the first to keep the presentation of this nature, but mind buzzing is an unsatisfactory way of organizing this show: To summarize my three points: Boring + Boring + Boring = Something else You will wait more at the Doctor's Office for an appointment, At least they want to be there Magazines are startling.
