<br /> <br /> Ralph Maker has been filmed by Mike Hammer in the film Climax. <br /> <br /> Mike Hummer is the true Sunopathus of one of the detective fiction. Unlike Marlowe and Spade, those sliced ​​to solve the mystery will break things to get the truth of Hummer. The film transforms Hummer into a grief that surrounds him ... who are bad guys ... well, to stay away from anything else. It is so small that he lost to a popcorn attack. <br /> <br /> Other parts of the film are in the three Stooges play book. Vedic dancing at the bar, for example, or unfortunately the bad guy to cut back his owner back. And the continuity breaks are shameless: Freue Bouture camera is in the middle of the road when she's tight on the lower legs, but when the camera goes back for an elaborate shot she's side by side. The worst break is, however, before the popcorn attack. <br /> <br /> Hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero, except that there are seven minutes behind our hero. <br /> <br /> To be more fun, some interesting camera angles and lighting and grand finale should see it, which only gets two points from 10 points.
