Of course, the setting in Paris is great. The actors are good. The story is a twisted moral drama. If you want someone bad, can it hurt the rest of the way? In a true romance, you're sort of bored with his wife and want to clicher than his family dump-ready, and it's OK to encourage him to be a woman who is OK. So if they are looking good and if Karen Allen shows off her body? The characters are still self-absorbing and objectionable. Perhaps the moral of the story is "How You've Made It". I would give it 4 for a faster scan probability through "male interest" bits.
