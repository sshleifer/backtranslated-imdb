I totally disagree with the comments that say it is a good comment. This is a full-featured picture. I sucked - S.U.C.K.E.D. Storytelling is bizarre. Mia Kirsthner did not convinced all that she had not converted from a innocent girl to a party-fun-seeking kid. In addition, all actresses looked very old to being college students - college students looked like 30 years old - to figure out the rest of you. I have seen about the first ten minutes and have begun forwards to see sex scenes. All sex sequences are dull, soon and, most importantly, no frontal. All sex sequences are modest, considering how many dresses they are. Make yourself a favor - put it and save you some bucks. Conclusion: story - 0, sex - 0, acting - 0, score - from 0 to 10.
