I was insulted by this film, it's not even funny ... and "Mulan" is unbelievable! While Disney's my expectations have become less, I still do something such a stereotypical one. <br /> <br /> I appreciate they try to make silver as a normal young man ... But fortunately, the most common are the young girls - especially Asian Teenage Girls - the shortest of life's stuff. And from a cultural stand point, this is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are wrapped in popularity and fashion, but they are pretty rare. And those who still are still very good scholars. Another Template, maybe, but very real. Because Chinese parents work. How China values ​​work If they want to go for authenticity, they make silver-glasses with a strange girl and love-hate relationship with her family. <br /> This brings us to my frustration with American films. Asian culture is not clear about meditation and vague, instinctive learning sounds. We do not walk around smiling problemfully all the time, and we all know some form of martial arts. I'd appreciate if we were a people, and someone write us an Asian part that did not paint as some sad satire.
