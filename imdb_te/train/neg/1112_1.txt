I enjoyed seeing Western films but this film is biscuit. The script and the dialogue is funnier. Acting was terrible, where did they come from? Music is OK. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I did not buy or rent a movie but now it's disposed of. <br /> <br /> When I started telling my story about the stranger (Martin Sheen), I initially saw it. I agreed to enjoy the clash between Hopalong and Tex, shot off Texas's finger and told him to practice for 40 years to reach his league. But it was all pear shaped after all. I had to watch the whole movie in good amounts, never hoping.
