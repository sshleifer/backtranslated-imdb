"Screaming Skull" opens an offer for free burial services with a warning and if you die watching - now there's a hook! The story contains a very interesting story for the horror film: heart tries to marry a wealthy woman with mental illness, then she tries to convince her that fierce sounds, mysterious knocking and skulls with skulls facing disgrace in the skulls. Adding a formidable garden to the formula, he has the first wife's memory of the dedicated person. Perhaps this is not the technology to remove the scary scenes that the film has to make in the 1950s, where the techniques used are as real and mundane. But once again, when I was nine years old at "The Haunted Hill House", I'm sure this movie was made for the same youthful young audiences. br> Do not get me wrong, the movie is not terrible, sometimes it feels tedious. But there is some great weather tension in the home of the big but not big Whitlock, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. Eric Whitlock (John Hudson), a mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicole is a dual character), scene for the best scenes for me, going to Manny in a pond trying to get the hidden skull. <br /> <br /> In its own best way, perhaps the most surprising thing about the film: How to make Whitlock's first look about the neat road - the door of the gal leaf 1958! At least I made my jump from my seat!
