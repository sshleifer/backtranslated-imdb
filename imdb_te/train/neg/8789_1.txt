If I could easily smile as this horrible movie unfolds, I checked this DVD for a DVD on a DVD. Every time you want to get worse at any time, it makes it inevitable. Acting is absolutely horrific. The plot does not make any sense. The US DVD version is not entirely associated with the title "cold revenge". Action scenes are clearly taken in their first take. There are many mistakes in dialogues, as there is no intention to make another attempt to make this film bearable. I do not remember seeing the worse picture and I have occasionally bad ones - well, except Wesley Snipes unstoppable. No, I deserve the best film awards in the unstoppable Oscar compared to this piece of bad, bad.
