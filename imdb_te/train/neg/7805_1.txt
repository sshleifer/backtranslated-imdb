<br /> <br /> One actor may say that the first film is usually something to miss - not everyone participants have a film experience, and this film is no exception. It's also bad by the 1982 standards, it's funny funny. A cross between the high school and the bad community theater - the tight, woody, and cartoon of the acting by the whole cast in the Chicago area on a clear little budget. Sound from nearby traffic often overwrites the dialogue, and the dialogue is really bad, naturally and organic rather than forcefully and inefficient. <br /> <br /> While the characters have passed years, children or adults are not older. <br /> <br /> A Christian film is a large, secular audience, but often the creators of such films are in 'the message' or in this case, considering their own autobiographical relationship to the project that is lying beside good film production values. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Michael Madsen is very interesting - and believable - look in his next films. Careers like her will not certainly be built into movies like this.
