... This WarSon Bard is not seriously disconnected. This is still a terrible little product, Hamlet's Dutch uncle Spain Yard (which is not a recordo or not subject to the debate), and runs on the Maximilian Scale ever. For the most part of the conversation, it is unrealistic, and the MST3K reform speeches are long drawn to * duh * Mostly it is just bad acting.
