Did Hulk "The Real American" Hogan do the same? Frankly I think so and he was right. I'm in Italy and I can not boast for many reasons because of my reasons, but I'm in love with Juliet Binooc because I'm not in line for another team (French, for example). Along with the heroine, the film does not fall in love with a British girl at the end of the movie, but is a fellow countryman, Why is Yelling Against Yale. As far as the performance is concerned, well, all the players work very little. And, you know, I hate the atmosphere of the "Dead Cavalry". Actually another movie that I hate.
