It's not as much as I expect from this film that people have from the Parkersberg WV, which I live in, acting on it. This town is frustrating and this film is also there. There are some good songs in this movie, but I've been distracted by all the places they show. The original acting in this film is good but nothing is there. Stay away from this movie unless you see from Parkersburg and what you see every day. The dialogue will make you sleek, the acting will come to you and Steven Soderbergh will lose some credibility after such a worst shooting. What a surprise its imaginary image. What you see is a 73-minute tour of Parkerburg West Virginia and Befrera Ohio without an interpreter.
