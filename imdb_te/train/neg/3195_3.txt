I really think Dan Baker would be good or great for the good thing or the right director ("Small Fame" remake, "Goldie", "Small Tale" in "Walking Tall"). He also liked Baker in "Michelle" because he was unlikely to be able to act as an anti-hero. Yes, MST3K's coverage was happy, but they took a lot of the cheapest shots at Baker - he did not deserve - to keep things lively and entertaining - he's fit for film level and tone, and he's the best part <br /> <br /> "The ultimate court" In addition, there is a bit weaker than "Michel", despite the background of exotic locations and "cowboy border justice" background. . And the main reason is Baker's character, written as an idiot. Because Baker embodies the old style boundary machismo, he challenges his rivals with old style mano-a-mano to quickly draw competitions. <br /> If it is too tight and moody, he always wins the injury, wounded, and counting. <br /> It condemns the image of "B" image of many probability (worked for Gary Cooper). But Baker is stupid and obsessive so he takes the bad guy's assistant into a showdown in three public markets, with people in all places. He was simply not the head of the bad guy (he was doing them in the first place) and they would not have noticed. Or he may have gotten drop on them and surrendered them, and gained one of the forces to take him to the headquarters at the gun point. But, he must have a bush league hot dog and a Mao blockhead, so he gets a captive child in the next shootout! <br /> <br /> Is it a man who we think we should worship? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is basically like this. Many of the supporting actors are OK (the bosses) are good for everyone (the main evil guy and his father, two well-known European actors - they are mere moves and are good). But by all means, the barely silly people who get Baker's character killed at least two innocent people and the wrongdoers and mistakes, and a couple of bad people who are alive without using the deadly force. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />> And really, Baker himself might be a huge side and a little disyspeptic, but he's not that bad ... not sure the critics of these movies (including Mike and Bates in their hilarious coverage) Tub o 'livestock <br /> <br /> In short, The image is good for a video wallpaper, but the viewer should not pay any attention to it.
