I have a high tolerance level for the worst, so I'm looking forward to it. It is not disappointing. Based on the classic carmels of Sheridan Le Fan, it follows a father and daughter and chases a girl's bloodbath, luckily with them, traveling with them. Then we have running over random zombies that have Santa Claus (or General, who likes to be called here). Did I mention there is a zombie outbreak? The dead are living back but nobody is very worried. We have construction worker zombies, soldier zombies and even StTrinian school zombies. Apparently Santa Claus is looking for his daughter to become a vampire. Oh no wait for any vampires, girl is a lunatic shelter and her nurse with carmels, or she? Zombies are back and Santa's madness. Lesbian Sex, I like vampires and I like zombies but I especially like lesbian sex. Some simulators are not like cinnellinas that flip juices. Do we want to see the vampires fighting? Is she a vampire or she is a fool? Or both? Carmilla Hot Sexy Lesbian Vampire or Nurse? More garbage, you never have more zeroes. Here come the Saint Tristan zombies. Chainsaw time !! After more lesbian sex, the zombies kill and kill vampires. Did I Win Zombies or Did They Do? Plot? Who needs a plot when you see gay vampires and schoolchildren? And clinking?
