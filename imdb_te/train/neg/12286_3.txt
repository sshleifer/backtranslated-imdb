The fact that my cable TV guide provided was actually much more interesting than this. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is the title of the worst horror film I've ever seen, organized by "Urban Legends: Final Cut". In its opening sequence I was really bad, but I could not work very hard. The film is particularly astounding in my belief, credible stories, and the crappiest music I've heard is incredible, and the likes of Britney Spears dominate the Nsync wind waves. The big problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is not that funny. The film is frustrating and frustrating and not scary, where some of the fun is not just a bit of one-liners. We suffered a guy's self-centered friend trying to be funny, but instead came across as annoying. (Spoiler) and please tell me who is mad and self-hateful to visit a creepy prison in the middle of this silly world night? No one! If you're going to do a horror movie, at least it's reliable. This one but anything.
