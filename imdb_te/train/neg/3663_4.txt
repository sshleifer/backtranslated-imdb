The Spanish horror film Paul Naschick has starred in the film, one of his weak wolves ... but with a moment be with me. Many people have its most common television title, The Wolf Man of Fury, and many home video versions in years. If you want to be tight about giving a fair shot, the most useless edition I've seen is the title The Wolf Man does not do any sleeps, and it has rare scenes and rebuilding scenes in the original Nude shots that are not in the print of the FURY. <br /> <br /> Naschie Waldemar portrays Dance, returns home to Tibet and returns home, finds that he has contracted a wolf curse and that his wife has relationships. He takes care of her and her lover while in animals, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy female doctor and her female assistant. Apparently, the doc tried to "subdue" the fellow, and in her and her original story, there was a very strange saddo-masochistic love scene between her hairy and fanged Danisin under her trance. Finally we'll get two werewolves for a price, Daniski fights with a wolf! <br /> <br /> The big problem for the film is that the director (according to Naschie's claims) is often drunk, and the results are in fact irrelevant. When a WOLF MAN slips a copy, it is not too hard to know what is going on, yet there are scars in the editing. Naschie's sudden stunts are removed from another previous movie (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka "FRANKENSTEIN 'BLOOD TERROR"), there is an infinite number of occasional or inappropriate footage that combines the term without any obvious reason! The wolf's clothes change from the black shirt to white and backward, even in his attitude; A moment wolf walking around tragedy in a hypnotic trance from FURY, then he grows up and running around savagely from BLOODY TERROR. Really hideous.
