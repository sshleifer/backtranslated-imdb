One of the worst films ever. The plot goes as follows. Slag through the jungle areas for 10 minutes. Go somewhere and go to the strip. Slag some more in the forest. There is no need for another strip. Back to the jungle. Oh look! There is a Tarzan looking person! Strip, bow - strip. Kill the safari people. Tarzan is a fight scene. Saves po Bo strips. Run credits. Credits run, execute.
