<br /> <br /> I'm worried about the roller coaster and the rides for the amusement park. <br /> The roller coaster part is just okay - and a 90 second ride is all in 30 seconds. <br /> It is visually dull and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> It tries to look like a mixture of superior Indiana Jones and Space Mountain Rides and Disneyland and fails in every aspect. <br /> It's not so thrilling or exciting.
