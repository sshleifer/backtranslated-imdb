This film is an egg's egg. In contrast to other critics, I found that the major flaw with it could not attract the viewer's interest in the letters and the story. I'm interested in the rock and roll and the bands' fate because I sit through it, but if I have to base it on its source, I should give it thumbs Some exceptions: Jason Behar is a good part of John Livin, and persuaded as a rock singer; The narrative about his childhood injury was unclear, although Lewen's parents were given instructions that were well-liked, but his behavior was eventually strange to the viewer (which should not be). But the idea of ​​using a level of thought to solve inner conflicts is interesting, but the novel is not fully explored in the film. John Lennon's suggestions were bothering me, but I would agree that Beatles is not a fan. Anyway, Livien and his band reminded me more about Oasis than the Beatles, something that was derived from them. Another disappointing feature of the film is that it is a bit of an interesting beginning - though the middle and high level - the philosophical ideas of the main character, but the threads of his ideas, just in the middle of the film, "short of music, before God" (at any time in 1990 Tia Maria's announcement, "Time before, Tia is Maria?" It's an idiotic ending <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his bassist and friend, Dominic Monaghan, effectively played, has found the hallucination of this idea in responding "he does not know". <Br / > In all, the limited strengths of the direction of this plot on future projects, nonsense common or interesting and more Vellagalavu ID's perspective.
