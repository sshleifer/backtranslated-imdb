So the wife and we are both full of it despite many threats from us to turn it off. The worst part of this film is boredom, so much less excitement. This act is very bad, when we are kicked many times during some of the worst scenes (eg, the woman of the church). The dead sister used paranormal ways to contact her surviving couple, but instead sent her useful information when she tried to scare the hell to see it as much as her ring. I'm sure she will have all the DNA of those earplugs that I found out - instead of taking part in the police - She creates a terrible plan for her 'get' person instead of her sister's accidental death cover. Finally, she will call it a terrible plan because she allows me to kill her, which is black in the film. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad end.
