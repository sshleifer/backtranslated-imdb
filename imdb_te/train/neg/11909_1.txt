<br /> <br /> The essence of Lilith's film is Adam's first wife and she is prohibited from the garden of Eden, and she refuses to submit to Adam and to him. Look, I've taken those words directly from the script. Then the movie continues and she is the heroine of her film, only when she's convincing is what time her men will tell her! <br /> <br /> In this film, the film ends with The Faith's control. <br /> <br /> This script is predictable and FX is awful. There is nothing original about the Dark Light, but not the obvious hatred for women who are usually too small in modern film.
