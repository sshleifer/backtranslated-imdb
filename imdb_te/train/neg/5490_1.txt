We always used babysat when I was a kid, and we always used to rent a movie or watch a movie in the movie. This is one of the pictures we have seen. This is one of the first films I have ever seen, and I can be a Walt Disney Pictures movie! A Martian drops to the ground, turns into a human being, friendly with the human being, trying to do everything he can to return home. But he was distracted by the wonders of the earth. Also, the only good acting I can give is Christopher Lloyd Martiney, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumbre's Jeff Daniels Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley, Brace Channing and Daryl Hanna. But it's all from the worst. Poor!
