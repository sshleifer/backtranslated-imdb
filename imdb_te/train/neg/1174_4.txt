Eric Rohmer's 'The Lady and the Duke' is based on the English noblemen who lived through the French Revolution. But it is a stilted affair, with its strange, painted backgrounds and mannered conversational tone. In particular, the age of the tear is almost entirely removed from the original action; There are very few people in the movie who look at the general public, even though they are tortured, out of the drawing rooms of the corrupted and aristocratic sects, confusion, poverty and terror. The result is often dull, and sometimes unenlightening about the forces that bring destruction to communities; It was frustrating from an appreciative director.
