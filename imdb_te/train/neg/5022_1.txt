Oh dear, this film is bad for a variety of reasons. I wanted to see very little score for the film and I was surprised by the over-score. Cheer, but most people rate it as a joke! Once you have a shot / black and white movie to gimmick, this is a good idea, the film will only run for 66 minutes. Initially credits sequences are also very painful! In the van the boys suffer a flat tire and change the wow, wow that's needed in the story! How old were the boys who dropped out to hurt the Campbell? They do not bother to drive him ... sigh .. I'm so glad I got this freedom with a special edition of Evil Dead !!
