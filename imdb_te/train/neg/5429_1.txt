The film starts with a good song, while Arbaz Khan was suspiciously walking but suddenly we forced comedy with the simple stupid idiots like Galmaul with the kids like Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal are the first to watch their scenes are very fun and then get bored of Tanushree's brother's boredom The subdomains belong to the end, the end The movie tries to get serious with the kidnapped villain of our heroes but here also gets stupid then there's a long bashing bashing Climax straight away Hera Pheri and a wait paalal home <br /> <br /> There is a longchamp. Direction is so boring that makes sleeping <br /> (Pritam's first song) <br /> <br /> Cinematography is bad, Rajpal Yadav is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent <br /> <br There is no routine except to take a look across and I am happy that the actor is loud and like other movies, he becomes his normal self and times Tushar The most irritating one should not speak in a film, his dial delivery is terrible shaman saving grace, this film is kuna Lal Khemmu is the only actor who has worked well for his first hard comedy film, but impressive always gets the infinite range of Arbaz Khan and the usual paalai non-actress Murali Sharma is terrible
