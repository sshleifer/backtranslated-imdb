The film was caught on Sunday at Tube. I'm looking good to see what others think of it in IMDb. I'm not surprised at the number of silly people who enjoy this softness. I Hated I Hated I did not have any of them to read the categories they hated. I was amazed. I always hated a movie and they always look how good they always hates. Somehow I hate this movie, I hated this movie proudly! I went into detail about why I hate this movie, but to do that I would give you more respect than this film.
