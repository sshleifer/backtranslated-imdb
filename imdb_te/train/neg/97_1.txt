I have not seen very low budget films, but it's always the worst movie, the main character who speaks to the older man is a 5 year old who has a lobotomy and has lost power over every 5 seconds, one 5 and more. The story has the most awful story, and the army guy is the army he already has, and it went over it, and I saw how bad it was, that's a real picture. I'm not sure if I was under a 2-night rental item at Black Writrass, please get it free and get out of our sight. I think it is a semi-good actor than the woman, I think I make the only thing OK with the budget, but they show every significant scene of the film in the music bit initially. Horror is just horror.
