I hate throwing lines like this, but in this case I feel like: The American remake of GRUDGE is the worst film I've seen in the theaters over the past 5 years. There, I said it. <br /> <br /> Now that I have received from my system, please describe why please explain: "When someone dies with a powerful anger, the curse is born and death will be eaten by its fury." In the premises and I'm secretly acknowledging the sound. Unfortunately, filmmakers do not go ahead with it. Those who face "curse" are actually utilized by its aggression and you will get. Do you want yet Very bad. Some critics and fans point out that Grudge's only purpose is to fear you. The problem is that when there is no plot to talk about, creepy images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu tried to pull the George Sluice and remake his own film (s), trying to build an atmosphere in the first hour? Repeat the same scene and over and over and over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do, <br /> <br /> Before the plot is given to audiences, this exact illustration will be revealed 5 times in the first hour. The first time is actually creepy. Every subsequent use in the film became ridiculous. By the time this movie was over, my friend and I were laughing at the scene, "loudly loud and black knife", I laughed. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a liner story, but it is revealed in a series of compilations of the audience. I do not have a problem with a non-linear story when it's done correctly. The film goes on time, without any poem or reason, based on time. Since I started the theatrical version of Highlighter 2, I did not see a film in such a state. This storytelling technology marks the film may possibly have any mystery. If you already know, how can ghosts kill two characters and how is it shocked when their dead bodies are found in the attic? <br /> <br /> Why should we take care when detective attempts to investigate mysterious disappearances when we know what happened to all of us before? </ P> <p> </ p> <p> Disguised as a genuine image but not calculated. The grudge about GRUDGE is that it is $ 40 million dollars in its first weekend and some have called it a "horrible film so far". Wondering what will happen to those who use the brutality they pay to see the blind?
