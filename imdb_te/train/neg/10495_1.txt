I think Crock Hunter is a beautiful daughter! <br /> <br /> But everything in this film is not bad. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst pictures of all the movies, the people who eat, and the progress of the president. <br /> You have a bad image that you should avoid. All "jokes" are so juvenile so you will find yourself smiling because they are stupid. <br /> <br /> When the story writer is 4 years old, <br /> <br /> I was surprised that Crock Hunter did not ask him to eat and drink.
