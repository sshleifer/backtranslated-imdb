Well, eventually the remake came to be watching last night in London, unexpectedly hilarious, sexless and without any real humor. I did not know where to start with the first time, I was entertained with this strange obedience, which really did not make me move. The acting was screaming, and there was no original music, the costumes were very much 'Disney', and after six months 'burning' nick cage's burning (not enough to my taste), the comedy diverged the various 'badies' on the island. It's a weird remake that I can not believe much of what I've seen, reminding me of something that it's made in eight of the comic strip presents, Miner's Strike bit like their Hollywood description, very strange!
