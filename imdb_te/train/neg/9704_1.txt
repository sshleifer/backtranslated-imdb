Okay, if you're wasting two hours or really hating your life, I'll watch this movie. Anything good for laughing. Apart from obesity and elite locals, in many states, they are probably illegal but also have special effects. Seriuosly, 'PG' rating is pretty funny, once you see Native Porn Extravaganza. I will not give this film to my retard nephew. You can not even show this to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. This plot is sketch and cliche, and dumb, stupid. Acting is terrible, and the end is very painful to see that I am starting to take my eyes out of the idiocy of my TV screen.
