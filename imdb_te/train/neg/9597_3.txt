I love Japanese movies that just do not reduce it ... The film about the rebels and the survival of the royal blood has become a suspicious plot that appears to be very slow. While I'm not convinced of all the good knife fighting scenes, fast cameras and their roles in other Japanese films, the photography is perfect. The soundtrack is very weak, you can not even notice its presence. But the worst plot is emerging. For a while, I am hard to find out who and who and what happened. <br /> <br /> The platonic love between the main character and the other is completely unnecessary and seems to have come from Hollywood influences. <br /> <br /> If you look for your Japanese movie action in all this. Very slow, very little sword fighting scenes and very moody ... in the wrong way ...
