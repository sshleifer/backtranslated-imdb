Recently, I have seen that the documentary "Revolution is not aired", "Chavez: inside the rebellion". The first thing I thought was the events that took place during the Venezuela revolt of April 2002 showed a real inner view. Referring to the tone and correlation of the narrative, and any criticism at any time is Hugo Chavez. It is strange, as there is some part of it because it gives a non-partisan account of what happened to a documentary. After all, Chavez is not exactly a saint. Fortunately, since the age of the documentary many years, there are many additional information available on the Internet and, for example, "The Emergency Investigation of Chavez - Blatant False About Venezuela for a Movie That Revolted by 5 European TV Corporations." It has been a number of bugs and intentional or erroneous mistakes in the documentary suggests. (Use the title as a search string on Google, which you will find). Another interesting document is the video registration of the findings of many of the errors in this documentary, "X-Ray of Lying". It's good for me "Chavez: Inside the Rebellion" which is available at video.google. "Chavez: I'm strongly advised after seeing" within the rebellion "X-Ray of a lie and making your opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donahacha O'Brien (known or not) are part of the Chavez-campaign.
