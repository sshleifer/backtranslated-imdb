I saw this movie in a preview preview screening and I'm glad I did not pay. This film is just frustrating. Its dick and fart jokes are full of fun and action scenes (such as the shootout in "Little Germany"). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what to do. 2. Fart jokes. 3. Pope jokes. 4. The Dude pussy. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. Talibans 7. Again, Bush's entertaining .. We're doing idiot .. go ahead. 8. Dude blonde has hair. 9. Plot. 10. Murder of Minors 11. Uwe Boll It is. <br /> <br /> Most cast is merely turbulent. <br /> <br /> In the game, Dude uses a cat as a silencer. 2. Lots of action. 3. Crowach returned (Guest maker's guest role) 4. OM .. I do not have to pay. 5. There are some "FAF" moments <br /> <br /> Boll has done it again. He created a game made with another trash as a film adaptation. Kudos to you, Mr. Bol. 2/10
