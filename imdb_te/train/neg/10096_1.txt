This film should be the worst I have ever seen. The title of the film can trick viewers into audiences. The storyline of the film is highly ridiculous, acting is very poor. In fact, the name 'Zombie Nation' refers to the status of zombies when the whole six. It is not classified as 'horror movie' because the music of the cheesy's 80 was attacked by zombies. The zombies really speak and act like humans in the movie with only the difference which looks something out of a la roux video. If you ever buy this movie, then copy it.
