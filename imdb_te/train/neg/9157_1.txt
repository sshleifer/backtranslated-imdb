It's a cheesy picture that your first source was filmed in the video, not the movie. The story revolves, and the product is wonderfully sloppy. For example, when the title is on a flight in Vermont, where they go to celebrate their relationship at the Civil Society Ceremony, the plane is shown to be coming to an airport around the palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - palms that are not five minutes in the New England climate, take place in a tropical plant garden. On another flight expedition, the establishment Shot FedEx cargo plane is off. Perhaps they were able to travel to steerage. For the plot, you believe that Victor, the faithful Christian brother of Arthur, was removed from his church when his brother realized that he was homosexual. Moreover, the pastor ultimately hit Victor and Ben and Arthur murdered "to purge the spirits of sin". There is no one in this church about the Ten Commandments. The film does not have any ransom features for Jamie Brett Gabel, surprisingly influential like Arthur.
