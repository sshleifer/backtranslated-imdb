It's about 50. The American Film Institute has chosen the film for one of the best 100 American films ever. I practically saw all the images in that list, and one of the most frustrating of these. Musical numbers (many of them, many) are too long and frustrating, and are not perfectly associated with the story. The film has a long lasting ballet sequel, which is naturally not true to the story's story. The music is okay, dance is done with the highest professional standards - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the film. <br /> <br /> The main character of this film behaves so much childlike and unlabelled and unpolluted. His mental age is about 14. See "Ringing in the Rain" if you want to see good music made on "Golden Age" concerts.
