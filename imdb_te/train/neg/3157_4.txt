Sure, it has some structures of good image. If the storyline is good, if it is a bit blunt, acting is good, I do not know why Olivia D'Abo's such a pronounced Australian voice could be raised in the US. But my big problem is in the wardrobe. I find myself ruled that the average American is regarded as the five dealer for any self-respecting European, but this has exceeded. Anna color combinations are undoubtedly! And like that potato thief, I did not need to be sad for a coat that wore across the film had broken me in the hives. I suppose the idea should be as realistic as possible (how many school teachers walk in Prada?) But that's not an absolute lack of common taste. Wise word ...
