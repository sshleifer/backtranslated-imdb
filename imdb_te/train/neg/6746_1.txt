<br /> <br /> With the title "Bleed", you know that the puppy has not made much of creative juices when it emerges. The film is your basic run-of-the-mill low budget slasher image. Oh sure, it tries to be creative in the "murder club" campus, but we learn that it's just a joke anyway. Well, for those who really care about these things, the new girl in the basic plot town begins to start dating her colleague. He invites himself to his circle of friends and tells her that at a party, they have a "murders club" and that they will kill people. Well, we learn that it is a joke, but not before our heroine kill a woman in a parking garage. Now, "members" of the Murder Club have been killed each other. Oh, and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a downer. At that time, you really care. <br /> In the revision, the first 10 minutes or so of this film will not be understood. At the beginning of the film there is no motivation for murders. I'm saying this is a way to remove this movie from the director, but there are deleted scenes on DVD! Someone want to see more than the feature length version of "Bleed", but obviously the people behind the DVD are not sure why viewers felt clamoring for more. The box says that there are easter eggs, but why hell is beyond what I would want to waste my time looking for extra on this film. <br /> <br /> "It's not a bad movie, but it's nice to see everyone in the movie and there's plenty of nudity" My favorite character is a guy who ends up being a killer ... I think he is funny and amusing, but he's just going to come off as a tool.I am in the parking garage The heroine shoves women into the parking garage cement pole, and she just mocks the thing, and her blood spits out of a mouthful, and "dies". <br /> <br /> Filmmakers For those who think it's a complicated, creative process, check "Bleed." It changes your mind, and can get any hack Yavaccu. <br /> <br /> If not, do not waste your time or money.
