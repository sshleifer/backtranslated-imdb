Borgess's short story is the willful bizarre follow simple cox. His strong visual sense, as always, is canceled by the most horror half-baked acting of the cast. The film is in the surreal tradition of Bunuel's Mexican period, and Lars von Triers sees the poor man on the Elements of Crime. The clear priority of Cox's single take, jump quotes, and ambient sound recording is against the image of all the work. Worth a look but ultimately disappointed.
