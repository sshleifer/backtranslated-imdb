It was the same old, "If I can not get funds for my project, I will inject myself" is a monster movie. There's nothing new here. This is like the Jeff Gold Blum "Fly" movie. Man tries to have some sympathy but ultimately surrenders to the effects of his experiments. Acting is very bad. People are dealing with intelligence, and their lives are being put in danger without obvious reason. He is the man who goes back to the laboratory forbidden to enter. Then there is a relationship with a young woman and her son. He was looking good, but he had a lot of trouble. It's just a big big waste of time. It also appears in his tyrannosaurus suit as it came from the rock at a Star Trek Convention.
