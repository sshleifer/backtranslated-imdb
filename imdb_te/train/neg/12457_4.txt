It seems that Salvatorees has not been determined with the film: this is a very weak thriller (and I'm very weak), which attempts to analyze the relationships between some of the main characters. Both of the mental thrillers have tried, but in this case the film can not be combined due to poor, surface scripting, bad acting, and very dark, very obscure cinematography. I told Salvatores her best in other genres and other settings, where it was free to look at the plot without thinking about the plot. Overall, a B-movie, your money is rarely worth it ... Vote: 4/10
