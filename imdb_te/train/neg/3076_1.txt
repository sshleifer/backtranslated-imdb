You can not watch this movie until you try to kill it. I think this film actually causes serious brain damage. How to dress a Horny Girl, how to wear Horny Girl, and her overseas boyfriend Nick, an army recruiter, is a fictitious figure that can be seen as the main characters Kenin, Amy, his brithe, devilish conservative girlfriend Kyle, phone sex, Daphne, "cool" Out of it. No, I do not make a mistake, it really goes to the cinema. The film is over-sized rip-off of the Gremlins of 1986, and you will never see Gizmo's trace anytime. No, this is Hoggoblins, Whippy Man (I'm sorry, Kevin), someone's bad dreams are fulfilled, and then kill the victims. Yeah, you guessed-in the end, they shut down in the strip club, where Amy reveals the great dream of Amy - she needs a woman's coffee! See, I've seen this film by MST3K, and also Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot is a smiling stack out of this movie train flashes and still bleeding me out of both eyes. Not really, but I want to have it. I have never given the theme because this great inspiration to run a pitchfork through my brain. Besides, worth mentioning is not like a plot. They put a surgeon general warning in the film.
