This is also a writer who hates the writer because he hates it. They gave it 'happy ending' and the conversation changed a lot, and it's just a big pile. 'Stage Manager' is very good, I believe he believes in the role, but everyone is casting in the casting style of 40 years. A great feature - music. This is one of the best scores ever recorded, and it is valuable for a record store. Overall, I think the 1989 Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller version is very high.
