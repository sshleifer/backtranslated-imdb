I'm sorry to say that this movie is very bad. It reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with a big margin: no romance. <br /> <br /> There is a complete need for story and dialogue. Probably bad acting is not noticeable. <br /> <br /> "I have a low budget and I agree that the director has done a good job and gave me less resources. And get someone else to write more and better in the story. Many action scenes are not just pointless. <br /> My time is completely ruined.
