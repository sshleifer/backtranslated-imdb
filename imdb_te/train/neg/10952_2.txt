I hate that film is not any kind of input. I know they're going for reality, but I'm not realizing that being frank is real. The reality is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I will spit. Tell me an interesting story and we will talk. I can deal with less productive values, hell I'm less productive, but at least some good ideas work. The direction goes not only as a camcorder holds and walking around a bit, but obviously I'm supposed to dig that because stuff makes it very realistic. Hitchcock used to tell the play, dull bits cut out. I'm not through a long shot, it's not a play. Rosetta, Rosetta Eau de Roceta, Rosetta, who works in Rosetta Bakery, go back to Rosetta's house, Rosetta to walk in the evening ... It's not entertaining. There really is not a deep understanding. I started looking for some reflections in life in this movie but it's plain realism, the highest quality of business in business. I'll love you, but come, there is nothing there.
