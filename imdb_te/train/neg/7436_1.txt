This film is time and money waste. The entire hour and a half amount, I waited for getting better and it never did. It slowly moved, surrounded the plot, it was not horrendous or interesting, and never really finished. The credits are long and out of contact, primarily the rest (length and drawn). Many parts of the plot could not be understood. Several times in this film I thought it was "zoned out" because the inability of the plot had the same problem as my problem and assured me that I did not "get out" from boredom. I have never posted here about ever a movie and have been actively looking at movies on IMDb for many years. So I'm actually taking time to write some of the volumes of how this film is bad and you should not waste your time or money.
