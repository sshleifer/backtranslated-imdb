I hate kissing on myth? Pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from mainstream / director Joe Swanburg They are not afraid to show the truth to daily "private" events. Unfortunately, the film 'The Bunny Bunny' comes down to the kingdom, although there is a slightly more advanced plot being jealous. Yes, would it be too much to see what's going to be 'Bunny' or quite cinematic scenes (or fascinated by the heart)? Feet, hands or genes. Again, unfortunately, why this movie can be released and why people are renting: true sexual scenes and full frontal (equal, male and female) nudity. In addition, it is time completely ruined. We quickly learn about a former college male / female roommate, in which manpiele has sex with his former boyfriend and has a clear feel for a woman who looks like a girlfriend. In addition, we are subject to everyday events of their boring lives: she works for her parents; He works on the most unpleasant sexual perceptions of his computer. For all of this, the conversation should be interesting and acting true. It's not boring as to what work and drive it to the hour, that is, the 'The Bunny Bunny.' Kate Winterich is the only acting actor, and she does some questionable acting. (Mike is really watching / listening to her before DVD.) Again, I enjoyed filmmakers, especially Swanburg, not afraid to be a bargain to everyone and to reveal themselves or their shower habits, but the whole movie is flat. It's incredible acting stories that act as you stunned you, rather than scenes, very boring everyday events and the soft profane factor, why you rent this.
