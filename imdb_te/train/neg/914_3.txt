<br /> <br /> I saw this film with very little expectations and I can tell you that this film has been lost. <br /> <br /> If I again loved Janne "Loffe" Karlsson on the big screen, the authors should be realized in the scriptwriting process of seven people who fall into the water, not original or funny. The story is very thin and the jokes are used and are not predictable, they are just boring. <br /> <br /> Swedish placement products placement (unexpectedly) funny, why not a big sign? "Findus has happened!" <br /> <br /> Gota Kanal 2 does not need to look at the movie or on the DVD, it waits for broadcast on TV, it gets accustomed to be too long.
