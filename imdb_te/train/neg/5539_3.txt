Wimbled stuffed shirt Armand Lough (played by a prominent character actor Dean Jagger in the rare lead) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technologies that make zombies. Armand comes for the lovely Claire Duval (blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses wealthy SAP to get Armond's colleague Clifford Grayson (desperate wooden Robert Noland) to marry her. When Claire uses and cries, Armand uses his knowledge of Voodoo to get his revenge. Exciting sound? Well, that's not sure. For starters, Viktor Halperin's static (non) direction drops slowly and makes it impossible for the talked ridden story to make a slow slowing down. Far worse, Harperin boosted any tension, climate and momentum's unfortunate inquiries. Most of the acting from the deceptive cast does not help in any matters; Hearty General Duval and E. Only George Cliveland as Alain Warren. Dr. Trevisast makes their welcome and refreshing hammy histories a bit stimulated. Drippy stock movie library score, painfully clear stagebound sets, and raw cinematography is pretty lousy and unimpressive as well. In fact, this is not the weakest requirement for a frightening feature that is the crummy that can not be relieved by Bella Lugosi's uncredited starkly eyes and even the brain-numbing boredom.
