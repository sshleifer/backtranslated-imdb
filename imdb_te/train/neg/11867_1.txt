I did not think it was possible, but I found the movie to be false than the 'body melt'. This image is very bad! <br /> <br /> The way it looks like the VHS, and it's hard to believe with a terrible 80-rock band that continues to be worse and worse <br /> <br /> Why are their voices changing? <br /> Why are their voices changing? From the bad New York draw, prissy English, then pure Aussie! <br /> <br /> The film has also won some film festivals (I believe that it is the Uta Film Festival). This is a lie, because nobody in the right mind will nominate this stuff (perhaps Golden Raspberries, but bad for it). <br /> The guys on the earth! The picture must be 1 in 100! <br /> You must be ten times as bad as the ones already in there. <br /> Complete "worst" filmmakers to prove that there is no reason to watch movies. 0/10
