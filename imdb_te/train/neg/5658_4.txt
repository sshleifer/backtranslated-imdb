"Laugh, Clown Laugh", released in 1928, plays the legendary Looney Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito raised a foundation (young and beautiful Loretta Young) to a mature teenager and named her Symanteca. Tito has grown up in the circus's life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. Although Chaney gave her a simple spectacle, Tito was now very well at the middle age, and I could not find the fact that she had hats for a young simontet. Although he was not his biological father, she grew up as a daughter. That kind of "Ik" factor spread throughout the film. Tito is a young and beautiful 'Count' Luigi (Niels Aster) competing with Simontetta's love. Simontetta falls to the young man clearly, but feels guilty for leaving Tito (not from loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I realize that nobody in the film is wonderful to tell Tito that he is a stupid old fool (until he finally left). This film is great because Lauretta Young has a great career. When I admire Chaney's brilliance as an actor, this whole movie is clear and clear.
