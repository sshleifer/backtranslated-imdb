Why did I waste my money on Sundays on the last day? I want to pay back ... can I get my $ 16 back? When I look at this movie, I waited to make something happen, nothing happened. I think this is really true for reading this story, it really is not like the movie. Why did the director zoom in with the camera and zoom away? It's not too artistic. Why does director Lulu file his nails for fifteen minutes? Why did the actors try to speak as they read? Or that point? I thought FANTAM LOVE is not anybody and I have my friends' vacation videos to be honest and have more entertainment value than this film.
