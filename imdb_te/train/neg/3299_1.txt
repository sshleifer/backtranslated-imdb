This should be one of the worst films I've seen. I'm actually expecting a bad movie but I believe it or not to be caught by surprise. The storyline is traditional, all clips are included. <br /> <br /> The conversation is very small, and you're really laughing when half the genres are trying to actually sound the sounds. The photo is not very good, the music has really made me angry, the actors do not even try, the script makes it almost impossible for 30 years to act and people expect more from the people that do not actually have "action". <br /> Why is this kind of bad movies coming up? Where is the screening? <br /> <br /> In addition to the desire to reach theaters, there are millions of Hollywood movies in this genre, but they should look directly at video material. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you do not know what you want,
