There are a few things to save from the film, but bad acting, plot holes, Deus Ex Machina Inside Ins, Stupid Dialogues, Weaker Script and Pretentious Cliche ... What we have here is a horror film with the storyline that has not gone over for a long time. For the first time (yes, that clich√© is still alive in Finland) a group of unlikely leaders including a black guy seems to be trying to exit a mysterious blank hospital. The demons suffering from ghosts (the most imaginative), zombies (at a time I did not use zombies at all, but they arrived), and with the fancy glam-rock band going along with the crew. There is some time schedule doodle, but if it does not have any storyline. It seems to have a more in-depth understanding of the autistic girl and a hobby situation, but they do not describe it as a viewer or their chaotic friend. There are deep-life lesson ideas like their lines only: "What will happen will happen ..." or "Light will not live in darkness ..." or ominous "I need a red wax piece ... red crayon." So these characters (including the suffering deaf and sweet doctor) are running around dark floors on them, and from or mistaken demons. Occasionally a ghost or group of zombies can be found, and if a ghost keyboard expert appears, a six-person group appears to be moving towards it, moving the flashlight and talking about it. And apparently this troll is broken down by walls, but the elevator door is open and beyond its capabilities. <br /> Finally, we are called "all dreams." Or it's not. Oh, boy I wish this film, and that type of time will move so fast that it plays in just 10 minutes or so ...
