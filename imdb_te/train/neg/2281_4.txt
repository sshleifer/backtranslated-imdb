Think of "theater game". It is worth watching once for Lionel Atvil and Dwight Fray's performances. To build Melvin Dowuglass in "Ghost Story" with Melvin Dooglas of the film. Is this 'Bavarian' village a loose vampire, or more natural, even if it is equally bad? Dwight Fryy Hermann, a red herring, played the role of a special moron. It is really fun to see different facial expressions of herself. Not long after that, but we recognize that Atwick's pipe smoking is a true assassin. There is a lot of 'comic relief' but it is related to this era. Faye is really cool.
