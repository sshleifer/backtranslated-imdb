'Maladolassenza' has a dark fairy tale, its child leaders, deforestation, and the discovery of the ruins of the fort. Yet its main, film is particularly trivial psychological study of adolescents. The film, which began with a dream sequence of Fabrizio Wrestling's horrific hound with her horrible hound, is a detailed description of Lara's mental cleanness, a girl who pledged her affection for her and her ultimately harmful analogy with Silvia. The psychological complexities of the film provide the film merit, although it is no doubt that this is unnecessary exploitation of nudity and sexual depiction. The image's image depends on its beautiful locations rather than the special cinematic skill, and the film's ultimate asset is not a creepy, child-singing-enhancing soundtrack. With its odd dream quality, the film is the best one, and it will be visible from the same era next to Luis Mallley's surreal and bright 'Black Moon'. Unlike most of the Western films 'Salo' or Larry Clark's 'Ken Park', it is unmatched from the artistic perspective. Film shock seems to be gradually losing its ability, so we have to praise the 'Maladolassenzhen' release after thirty years. But the reason for the shock's value is that the film is memorable. <br /> <br /> The film has its patrons. And yet Nazism.
