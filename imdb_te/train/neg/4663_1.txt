This image is not correct. I love war films and usually come from movies too and find something I liked, but this is not one of them. The film does not have material and intensity. I've got it, Finn has put a hell in a fight and it's great, but this story is not right. You do not have a genuine connection with any of the letters and there is no real storyline to follow. You move from one random view to another, nothing will flow to create the story. If you want a battleground that you do not have to fight scenes, then I will refer to "Downfall" (WWII German film). Or if you want a great plot and a lot of action, I would refer to "Brotherhood of War" (Korea War / Korea film). These two movies do not let you down like Winter War.
