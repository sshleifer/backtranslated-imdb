This image is endless. And not as good as some say. The first major character is the most unattractive gingerman. Second - This van is in love with WTF. The plot, mainly, is: Boy wants sex so buy a van (which is pretty good). Unbelievable he has given us a newt he scores with lots of chicks! And he failed with some. Then he realizes that he scores with a really hot chick and loves this half bird that he played harder to get. Then he pull the races with hot chicks boyfriend. And he is his van. At any time Danny Devito saves the day. The Ginger Kid crossed the first line in buying van though he was not required. I have some sort of Vanning subculture of some 70 offered as of this 2 * as I'm ready to think of because I'm getting some 70's because I'm getting and not.
