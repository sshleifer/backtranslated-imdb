This is just a bit of a fire that sits through the image that is viewable. None of the sections are good, but at least the first is a little fun, and somewhat imaginative in the middle. The last one is just plain, and after sitting in two weak comedy stories, the third is really sad to see. Even by the low standards of the National Lampoon movie, it looks very boring and pleasurable.
