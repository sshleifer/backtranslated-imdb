First, there was not much where in some other trash produced by science fiction channel; Not to say that Grendel is a good movie, in fact it's very bad, but it's pretty good. <br /> <br /> The character's design, character, story, visual effects, music, and much more absurd additions are the flaws of the film. <br /> <br /> When talking about designing the character, of course, understand the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and other Danes appear as wild vikings, rather than brute force's warriors - our helmet's main character wearing is very silly. Grendel looks like Hulk, but looks like strange chest-add-ons for his cheaters. <br /> <br /> The characters are very limited. Beowulf will be from the beginning to the end but Finn - a useless sidewalk - has gained two-dimensional gratitude thanks to his two sexy subplot, and Unfeth gets some feeling because he becomes less vocal. /> Like Finn, when the original story still holds, there are useful attachments to this story to be right for this story. Beauvef's gross crossbow was very ridiculous, and I was surprised at that cast. In addition, the underlying themes of Christianity and Paganism, as well as the consequences of lying are errors. <br /> <br /> Special effects are terrible. <br /> <br /> Grendel and his mother Hogg emerged poorly, and such ones would be reliable to portray the screen. <br /> <p> <p> <p> All in all, this date is not the worst image of science fiction. No. It's one of the best movies, yet it is still the worst, it's a good deal, which makes it a good offense. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />]
