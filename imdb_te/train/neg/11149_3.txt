Recap: full moon. A creature, a huge wolf, is in the hunt. Not for meat, not for blood (it does not seem to mind to take a bite on the way though), but for a member. He is hunting for a girl. No girl is not. That girl. Pure girl (and still wolf, yet she does not yet know). Three, well-checked, two cops (after the first scene) and an old bag lady is all that it can stop, or killing a thing and eating a lot of folks around the full moon know that it's a werewolf. This special powerful wolf, Dark Wolf, closes the girl. If he comes to her, then mankind is sad. Now police have to find a girl, she is someone, a wolf wants to rape him, and perhaps want to kill him, but she convinces her that she is a wolf. And then they came to stop him <br /> <br /> Comments: This is one of the boys and youngsters. Plots are more or less important semi-nude girls scenes. Very little. Expect the need to do something to fill some time because the plan is well thin (as expected). And unfortunately there is a little bit along with the girls helping the plot from breaking. Usually changes to two main themes. Nudity. Check. And then special effects. Hmm ... there are a few things that you can call the effects. They are not very special. In fact, as blunt, they are very bad. The film seems to be suffering from a shortage of funding. They can not buy clothes for some girls;), and the effects are low. Some changes between real wolf and human form of the computer are really bad. You can ignore such things. But Dark Wolf himself is very raw, and you can not see any murders. Some of the dead are followed. <br /> <br /> It's a little surprising about a movie that honestly drenched in blood. <br /> I'm not sure what to say about the actors and the characters. Many times they do well, but unfortunately the characters (or actors) have lost their errors. Some of these errors may be connected to the above issues. Poor influences, or poor budget (?). The characters explain why precious little shooting, even in a simple sight (and does not move) as a small army of weapons and aimed at targeting. <br /> <br /> Hey, when you are in real danger, you can save your life as a good life liner. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Cop, Steve, a man who knows how to deal with a problem, wolves, flees, he can be sure at any time, and now he is coming with two children next to him, let it be her. <br /> <br /> But I will see that none of the main actors / actresses can see another attempt at another film. <br /> <well. To give a little conclusion: I'm not a film that I do not recommend
