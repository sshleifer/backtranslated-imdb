Another sign of Hollywood ideas outside. Charlie Hudson is a former police officer who has been a writer. When Charlie's fianc√©e arrives in town, the wedding planning gets caught up with everything. He spends a week at a fancy hotel and adds Anna Penny as a teacher. Both of them quickly became friends and planned their special weddings together. When the plot becomes boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and she needs to choose between a safe life or Charlie. The film has removed every romantic comedy and you are waiting for the cinematic end so you can do something else. Michael Wurtan and Natasha Hainstridge are really casual performances.
