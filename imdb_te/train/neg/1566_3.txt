For the intellectual Beatles fan, the main value in this movie is merely errors, bugs, combined events, discarded events, extreme exaggerated events, ignored people, timeline errors, wrong-attribute coats, wrong clothing, space songs, and (shame shyness) wrong practice and other boners I should not think right now. <br /> <br /> Let me give it all to Liverpool and actors ("1" is not given by the fact that the film is shot in the film). (Lennon's character is reliable and does a good job). Also, the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at the same time and is counted for something. <br /> <br /> So, be fun, but please do not take this as historically accurate.
