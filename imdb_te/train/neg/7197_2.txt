As well. I think the kind of TV show is kind of beautiful and it is always kind of lesson involved. So, my kids decided to watch this film, I decided to tag it together. <br /> <br /> The fact that humor is foolish and unreal is not a problem with this film. The plot is non-existent, the characters appear in a vacuum and are not much worse, the gadget does not take any lesson. It took all the things that worked on the Inspector Gadget on Disney TV and threw them all out. To be fun, my little boy (at the age of 8) liked the movie, but the old man (at the age of 10) thought it stupid (he was very ridiculous for the younger, but the youngest of the grown youngsters). <br /> <br /> In general, I love Disney movies, but it's a mile. Very narrow band of band (7 to 9), but not everyone has to miss.
