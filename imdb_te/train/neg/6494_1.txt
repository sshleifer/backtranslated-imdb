I loved Anthony Hopkins as an actor and I was very interested to see how he would make a writer / director. I was disappointed by this move. The film was very confusing and I wanted to remove the image from the wall. Actors are very good but it's not worth the talent. All actors are authors or directors, and clearly Mr. Hopkins will fall into this category. The film is always the worst film of all the movies I've seen in my 50 years. All of us are in favor of Mr. Hopkins and acting stick in a favor, which is excellent for you, and directing those who are skilled in areas that leave writing. I'll definitely do if I'm less than a rating this film.
