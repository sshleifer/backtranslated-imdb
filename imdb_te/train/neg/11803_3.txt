When someone remakes a classic movie, the remake is negative as compared to the original remake. <br /> <br /> The 1973 TV version of "double indemnity" was almost identical to scenes and dialogues of 1944. . The main difference is that the remake does not have any power. Fred McMarray is the original combinator agent Walter Nefflo Lecher, the greatest of Li√®rere; Richard Creanna is just tired and tired of the world. Edward G. Robinson's owner, Macarelli's owner, brought great manic power to Barton Keys; Lee jet cab, the best actor, is almost bored with trials. Samantha Goodkar Cunning, Back Stabbed Phyllis Dietrichson; While Barbara Stanwick is just awesome in this nasty role, the Gooder is overly respectful and manful and just does not get out of place. <br /> <br /> Robert Porter Hall, Robert Robber, Robinson's Boss Norton, and John Fideler played a crucial role in the film. <br /> <br /> However, after the film begins, without life or electricity, the whole thing is just lying.
