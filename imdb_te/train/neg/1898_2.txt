H.B. Halicki's classic seventies chase movie is just horrible. In addition to the vanishing point, Gangtle Car Chase is represented in 60 seconds. The remake takes on the original and is on its head. Hulik gave us 75% car chase and 25% assistive play, GISS 2000 we have a 25% car chase and 75% supporting play. Cage like super man saves his brother, kiss the girl. MTV edits, tits and ass. Save your money, actually rent it. At least Halley did not see her child (he wrote, produced, directed and starred in '74').
