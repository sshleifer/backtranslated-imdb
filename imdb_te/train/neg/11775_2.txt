Watching "Crowco" for the first time in my life I left a lot of movies. I would recommend to watch this movie: Flat Main Roles - Definitely not Developed eg. The Kroco Rupert German Problem Child is a pure metaphor without any potential of positive ability despite the many plots-wise opportunities. Uninspired actors, evolutionary plots. I tried to make this film an environmental survey but did not succeed: the camera is moving rather than induction. The pictures are shorter, gray and dark - I'm definitely deliberate, but parts do not add to the precise idea of ​​social environments. However, the story has some probabilities that may have a good story.
