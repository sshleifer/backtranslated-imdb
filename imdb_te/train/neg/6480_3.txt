It's nice to see all the familiar characters again, but the story bothered me. We loved Ariel in the first movie, so why is she the second one around her daughter? The new characters are annoying and I do not like this plot. All the worst, Christopher Daniel Burns did not return as Eric's voice! Disney, please stop remaking classic movies with these inconsistent simulations.
