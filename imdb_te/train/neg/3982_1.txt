Please do not see this movie for God's love! Undetectable waste plot like romantic scenes is imaginable. Trying to build a lot less, this film and its bad predictable villain are just lazy. These roles have not been developed and most of the film is much more interesting than the original film, with the shots of Rome. For all, acting is insulting. I know everyone tries to find their niche, but this is really a disaster. I can not believe that someone has paid millions pounds to keep the movie in the film. This film does not waste time or money, go instead see your grandma or something worthwhile.
