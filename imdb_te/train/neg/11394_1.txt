Oh, for crying out loud, this has got the LAMEST movie I've seen all year, and I'm sorry that generally excited John Cusack is also involved in this brilliant, unwise narrow piece. Serendipity distributes it with a heavy weight hammer, then subsequent to the tedious hour and a half or earlier in your mind (and an hour and a half in my life I'll be back again and again, even if the Sleep Plus delivered the same message in Seattle, even more subtle, Forever, thank you so much!). The film's main characters are bad enough except for Jeremy Pienne, who is inadequate to the emotional maturity of fourteen-year-olds (in fact I am fourteen years old ...). The first 15-minute film that plays Kate Beckinsale is my best friend and I'm so upset about the game's bizarre silliness about winding all sensibility (literally) to wind. My husband Rockstar is more intelligent and at least Rockstar characters idiots are not half as much as this "Serendipitus" confused. It is anxious to see those who have no clues about their choice of life, and they feel that there is nothing more than leather tiles for fate and decline. How thoroughly tiresome. I'm sure the film will be more enjoyable with those who do not want to engage in a chaotic chaos that I create more complex life choices and then the consequent consequence. After all, here is a picture of our hero and heroine who live happily after the loss and sorrow in the lives of two other people (their future husbands), not just about other relatives and friends. <br />
