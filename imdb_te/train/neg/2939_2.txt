As others have said, "No, Luciano" is more appropriate title or response to this movie title. For fun, the great opera singer must adhere to singing ..... he is not a terrible actor. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were made - a nice family picture, it was - but later it was not a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> The singer plays Pavarotti as "Giorgio Fini", loses his voice a few times and comes to the rescue of the "Pamela Taylor" (Catherine Harold). The singer then comes for the doctor, the doctor slowly comes for the singer, both argue all the time and go on and on and on. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti is the smile of the winner and the guy who likes it. It's spoiled things and after seeing her here's Harrold I'm not surprised she's not a star. <br /> <br /> The film has a good view to enjoy the good shots of San Francisco and Italy in the first half of the film. I was frustrated and do not remember too much about the second half.
