I've changed the goals..trees .... and always the same feeling ... you see the Olsen twins make the same film ... they'd play different sports and then the boys would fall in love .. Now about the movie .... Such little boys And girls do not first play such big goals ... 2.Football does not play in Time Out ... At the end of the game 3. The referee gives overtime, Day or more) ... and the end is so early ... I think this movie is not bad because football is lacking in knowledge ... it's good if it's done by European producers. Ok they played in a few seasons at home but did not make them big stars .... you had to show your talent. ... and that's not what the Olsen twins do
