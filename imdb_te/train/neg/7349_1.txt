Polyester was the first John Water film I had ever seen, and I should say it was a "worst" film I had seen at the time. <br /> <br /> The water team of "Talent" will work for many people and I'm ready to say the lines written by Waters. Every thing about the film is horrific, acting, camera, editing and the story about a woman who played the divine in 300 lb is totally absurd. That said I have to recommend this film because <br /> <br /> Very funny, and you do not believe the worst that will happen to the poor Francis. At the grocery store her son suppresses the feet of undesirable women. Her daughter is a righteous man in the town. Her husband suffers everything in his power and poor people Francis. <br /> <br /> Francis's only friend, Edith Massey, is a cackling A-hole with a pornographer who is probably the most worst performer ever ever played. Edith looks and sounds like she has read the cues off the lines of a cue card and has not seen the script before filming. /> <br /> Despite all of Francine's travails, Waters is an incredible Hollywood survivor who survives and everyone lives after ever (cooks <br) happy.
