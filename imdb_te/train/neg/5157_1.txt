Robin Williams was a huge fan and I saw this movie at the age of 6 or 7 because he could not do anything. Until this. For a long time this robbery has ruined me. I only recovered recently in his funny but intense part of Father's Day but then he has created another mistake, Bicenntinial Man I think I have called but point. Robin now needs to get better jobs, now he returns to the mud show that started with this 'classic'.
