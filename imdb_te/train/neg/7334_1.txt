<br /> <br /> I would consider Stuart Bliss the worst movie ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible and the plot is ridiculous. The fact that I was motivated by the mental breakdown of the main character's wife, but I got so crazy and frustrated, although I might have cared less about any characters. <br /> <br /> The film keeps going on the same ideas and over-freshness or surprisingly to include the plot. <br /> <br /> The whole thing with the Gear counter then began to look at what was behind Stuart shortly after opening his wall. <br /> <br /> Then repeating scenes flyer, he has confusing chaos. <br /> <br /> When I do not recognize the actors, I guess the film is a flop. When you get this movie, love you and read a book! You're fine.
