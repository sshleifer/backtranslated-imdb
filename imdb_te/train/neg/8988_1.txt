Until now, the worst movie Ben and Arthur ever seen. Instead of the film, reviews should really be checked. The review statistics for the film have been distorted by a relentless and unsuccessful push, and some people joining it are very easy to find online. <br /> <br /> People who have been Ben and Arthur are at least dignified to stand on their own moving legs instead of encouraging them to buy it at least. <br /> <br /> What's worse about this movie, script, story, cast, acting, direction, photography, compilation, music ... What goes into a movie? Whatever it is, here it is as bad as it gets. It's ridiculous if it is unpleasant. <br /> I did not recognize that it was not good reviews, because I was thinking that this is good. <br /> <br /> It does not take much money to make a great movie, or a low budget movie is bad. My favorite example of a shoestring-budget masterpiece is by Gors van Sant's wonderful Mala, but there are many others. Sideline Secrets? Directors cut or original? It's not bad because they have no money, but they have great friends and talents for anyone other than self-promotion.
