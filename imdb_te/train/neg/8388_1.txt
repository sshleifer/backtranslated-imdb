This heartfelt story of hope comes. I hope you will ever get back to this terrible accident. * Cough * Razzie Award * Cough <br /> <br /> I do not like this film because it is ill, predictable and untrue. I saw that I was in a psychology experiment to determine how to get low standards before people complained. When I asked my money at the end of the film, I saw the whole thing because 'I have no right to pay back'. <br /> <br /> The Assistant Manager told me that many people have complained and paid a refund. <br /> <br /> Film essence is very fundamental. Midgett thief steals a diamond and throws it as a baby to escape the police. But under this intellectual border, there is a concert of original, fresh and hilarious skits. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following: Do you want people to see that people are pans? Do you like frolic jokes? Do you look at the midgets as you threaten the thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired jokes? Did you think the kids were 'Goo Goo Goo Goo Gaya Gaya'? <br /> If you answered 'yes' any of the above, the film is perfect for you. In some places, even though it is called 'the worst cinema of decade', somewhere a picture or 2 movie is worse. I can not say for sure. We gave 2 stars for this movie, because only a review of the review can only be reviewed and biased, and the review is not taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This lobby comedy is intended for a less intellectual audience and I can not recommend anyone to a good conscience. <br /> Honorable
