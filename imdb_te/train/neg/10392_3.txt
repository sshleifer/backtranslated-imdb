I know about the film and whatever the platform is, I'm not suffering from a plot compilation. Many critics have called the ISOYG a 'anti-rape' film or a feminist statement, and I need to strangle the impugned hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> First, do we look at the cover of this film? That's right: a shaped woman is behind. Even if it was Zarchi's attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and I certainly do not believe it - the point is completely next to it. The film is sex and sexual abuse triangle and material such a graphic (everything but actually spread out) NO ONE but hard core exploiting spectators enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Rape) The image is uncomfortable, cruel and hard to watch. There is something to show a terrible crime in such a brutal light, but there is no reason why this scene will not be visible for 30 minutes and nothing. The victim also has little role in development and one of the rarests has developed slightly (he is just moments before the murder), the scene does not involve everything at an emotional level. Really, it is intended to show serious sexual violence and attracts exploitative audience only through movies filmed on IMEb (Caligula, Cunningham Feroax, etc.). <p> Finally, some critics praised Zarchi's documentary style and lack of soundtrack. But any inefficiency (acting, script, etc.) for everything in the film I suspect that this is a financial decision, and this film is seen as a documentary because let's literally put a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their work. /> <br /> I'm not talking about ISOYG content and I can not get everything on my high horse. I'm for all the extortion / horror and love video nasties. In fact, the film will give three stars because it really increases more than some other images. However, it did not even correct and after a rape, wait for more boring and roll credits to the rest of the characters, looking more gorgeous with a group of hi-hum. <br /> <br /> If you're a Hardcore 70 exploitative fan this is probably worth watching once you're telling me, the image is pretty bad and really not worth its groundbreaking glory.
