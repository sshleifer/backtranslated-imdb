The movie is a bad movie. If you create an image of costarring the person who plays Lars in Heavyweights than performing Damon film. Before I watch the trailer for the POS of this film, I have to say that I can see the leprechaun in space 6 times. Adam Sandler should be limited to any movie after this disgrace. Seeing this movie is like listening to Cher and willingly putting your dick in blender. Anyone with a brain cell can find that this movie is not worth it. If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it, I would give it to the Lorraine BoBit Foundation, which supported me before buying the movie.
