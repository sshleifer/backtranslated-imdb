The creature says it's right for this movie. Or it should be called the unknown movie. The right trash piece from the beginning of this film. It's really stupid "plot," really tragic "acting" and therefore has "special effects". <br /> <br /> Some 30-year-old "post-teens" are trapped around the forest and surrounded by Raptin-Wright-Zeit. What you get with this picture is talk and valuable little action. Girls walking through the woods you speak, and you have walking through the woods talking guys (with huge mascara on). <br /> <br /> Most of the film is rarely seen. When it is shown, it is a distorted film to portray a rubber suit and the movement shows that it is a suit, causing the image's opacity and distortion. <br /> <br /> There are not any good movies from this word and they are here, who have been removed from the street to "act" in this original stupefying film! Skip some!
