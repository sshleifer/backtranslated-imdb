The film is intentionally not related to types of beauty (sexually and sexually), which can not clearly prevent basic sexual needs. Although some spectacular players, including Jon Tenny, Timothy Olifent and Cynthia Nixon, do not participate, they rely on an active script based on complete communication; It's not. Nixon's role has the best lines, but she often has them very quickly, which increases the burden on the director with time defect. The grotesque climax uses every available clich√©, cost or not, and concludes this drab attempt to comedy.
