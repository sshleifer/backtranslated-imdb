I enjoyed the "American Movie", so I rented Chris Smith's first film, which I thought was very documentary. <br /> <br /> I saw that it was not the first minute, but I left it. If you're just going to observe tediousness, esp, being in real life can hardly work for you. <br /> <br /> "I'm sorry but it will come back to anyone, 1) I have a lot of jobs to stroke and 2) I've seen jobs in the field of service." Real "(handheld camera, music, etc.) It really does not matter, it does not occur in "real world". <br /> <br /> When Randy chooses his inspection, the owner has spent 3 days When the owner is going to be very happy randiki? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ". This guy is losing. He is not involved in these jobs, or has an apartment apartment or looks like one. He's a dope. He does not pay attention or even really tries to do these jobs. He is zero individual. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to what Chris Smith is doing, but the guys, "this-important film" thing. "American job" does not work.
