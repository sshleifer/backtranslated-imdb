<br /> <br /> This movie sucks big time. It reminded me of the resurrection (Christopher Lambert), and I found it very boring. <br /> <br /> "Semana Santa" is a poor movie in every respect. <br /> <br /> Alice Valli is the only one in the cast for this film. Alida is one of the Grand Old Ladies in Europa film history. I love "Manchester" in "Suspiria" and "Inferno" (Dario Argento). I spend more time with this movie. I said another good thing about this movie ... If you're sleeping too quickly use it ...
