That's right! An average of less than 9, but some may be less than 12 years old! When I first saw in this video, I was 11 years old and I was not able to find the fact that I was shocked by the shadow cartoon-quality or the classic characters of such a youth. Just everything here is 2D here! Belle is, I agree, even the most beautiful but pale skin is just plain-looking woman, she is wearing all the bright blue dresses with a bright dress, the wardrobe is at least say, annoying - my ears are bleeding if I come to her every day! The Lumiere, both original and Christmas edition is both happy and elegant, but here he is a womanizing, unfunny twit! Coxsworth is a no-nonsense housekeeper but he is well-known, full-shirt and the most inexpensive role I have to say! He has always find this very difficult difficult pear hole shut down and its clock face really should have been used for the return of two film time in the series! Poor and poor Mrs Patts did not live through Angela Lansbury (one of my favorite classics actresses), but she did not have an offense by Anne Rogers, who did not take the role of Mrs Pots! She's not the best! When the beast roars it sounds so terribly fake with obviously no extra roars, snarls or microphone growls through. It's not so good that I know that these two other films are only the third feature afterwards but I'm sure not to hurt the Disney artists who have achieved such a great deal, indeed, such a great deal of animation styles over the years. This is fine, I guess, and sometimes I see it when it suits me correctly. It's very hard to make a recommendation to read this because it depends on how old you are, but remember that this is not what you can expect after all of the fantastic movies at all! And it's going to be "boasting intelligent animation" on the back cover on my video! It's a nice little picture but for a thing it's also very poor and, for another, those 3 words must be saved for the next re-release of the original!
