Devil Hunter is actually in the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it really does not. There are many movies in the list of reasons known only by God (and DPP), and this is not a bunch of frustration; There's no prohibition here ... it's insulting because I'm not in where I'm in the shopping center. The plot is indeed a good foundation for the film - or a better place than most cannibal movies - it follows the kidnap and an actress dragged into the Amazon forest. A hunter was then employed to meet her, but he would lead the man by the so-called "The Devil" (hence the title) to dare locals. The film is basically just eighty five minutes, and many scenes are not interesting. Jess Franco concludes making films like this is a real shame because it is obvious; The Diablical Doctor Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless and She Kills in Excelsi, but unfortunately his good films are gems between rubbish piles and Devil Hunter are part of the worst. I want to say that I have seen everything in the DPP list (just two more!) Because I have seen this movie thoroughly, and many others that I see are just as I have seen. But if you're not on the ground for the Nestles; There really is no reason for this one to bother.
