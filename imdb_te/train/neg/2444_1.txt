Two houses, a street, a phone booth, a car, a girl-next door, a boy's next door and a zombie. This list of materials fits for a great horror movie. All you need is some blue light, ambient music and ... complete. Not in the hands of the Dutch director Van Rouveroy! <br /> <br /> I would like to maintain "bad movie evenings" from time to time. The concept is really simple: get some booze, get some movie-loving friends, and immerse yourself in the cinematic movie. The peace of this wickedness is the best for such a evening. <br /> <br /> The fact that Von Ruერიy still seems to have made his film a great success. As a witness you will listen to the commentary of the DVD. Again: An unbeliever and smiles guarantee!
