Normally, I take the attack of the local Hollywood video into the B-horror movies. The basic principles in the B-horror film are that it contains camp value, heavy gore, unnecessary nudity and exclusive effects, somebody with a pack of corn syrup and rubber. I rented the Fear Cradle because they were the band's fan because they released the first demo in 1995. The film opened on a very interesting note and I later laughed in a very clear rubber mask when I saw Danny's filth stamp. I'm losing when I see Lesbian sex scene for a lesbian sex scene. I spent pretty much the whole movie smiling and when I was laughing I was shaking my head thinking about how multi-million dollar rock star would make it a movie that seemed to be in the multi-billion dollar budget. The whole thing of the film is that "the great thing that the hardcore goth children found from the Lava Lamps seemed to attract deaths, destruction, sexuality, blood, and Satan. And is really a real good movie but ultimately this "movie" is really about Filth Video Extended swing.
