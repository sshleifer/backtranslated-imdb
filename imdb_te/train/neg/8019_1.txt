I read about half a dozen other users comment on this board and it looks like views are very high. I agree with those who find this movie awful. I hoped it would be very painful for me, or it did not bother to see the other day. If I support gay music, especially if it is homosexual, the film is almost uncomfortable. As I did three minutes later, those who went out could not possibly strike $ 11.00 or it was nowhere near, fast, and improved. <br /> I'm a little more hopeful than they are, or they have not paid for the first place. <br /> <br /> Logan is bored. He is a klutz. He's gay. I'm okay. The problem is that the main character in a movie does not necessarily mean that the image about him should also be boring! The final scenes of this kid are like a laundry load, you have already set the first scene, the second scene, and so on and so forth again ... Nothing or anyone else will not go anywhere. NO said anything remotely wise or funny or something interesting. Perhaps all too alarmed that I do not feel slight bit of empathy for Logan. It is a great achievement. He did not change, he did not change, he did not learn (he did not teach anything), he did not do anything, did not make a movie! After the same scenery, the scenery is not a movie. <br /> In addition, the title does not mean at all. 1/10.
