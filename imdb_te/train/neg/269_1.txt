After watching the first ten episodes, I will make this presentation suck. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br I'm cheap, but they should have shot in California, so we can have scenes in the desert. That's more real to the movie. The first scene outside of another world is in the mountains, which has cooler pneumonia. It does not feel too much Egyptian. You worked well in the film and thought you were in ancient Egypt. It feels like they're running around the fight against aliens in a Canadian forest. And it's too lame, on other planets, the fall comes along. You can see leaves on the floor of the forts that look like the forearer outside Vancouver. It makes the show more unreliable and dumb. <br /> And then there is Richard Dean Anderson. He is not Kurt Russell. Certainly he does a good job and he tries to copy a little of the racals performance, but he's just not as cool as Russell. And not as good actor as Russell. And Russell's way of playing O'Neill, he deteriorated. Anderson O'Neill is very soft. I did not give Russell's version just s' *** and likes it to have no trouble erupting the bomb until the very end of the film. <br /> <br /> Michael Jackson is a good job as Michael Shanks is taken from James Spider. <br /> <br /> Teal is a really bizarre character. He is Jaffa. No jaffa. Just jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! The former bodyguard of an enthusiastic Raw character, appeared only in the pilot and so far in another episode. Teal's speaks of talks and actions like a robot. I saw good performance from Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> And the role of Teal and Raw and the people they saved in the movie can also speak in English, mute. They made an extremely scary aliens in the movie and they spoke an ancient language and there are real monsters. <br /> <br /> For special effects, they are good at the pilot. But very rare effects on the original program are bad and appear cheap. Especially they planets with crystals. It is evident that they can run in soundstage with bad painting in the background. This is a disgrace for viewers, they seem very cheap. Especially they were able to make cgi backgrounds blues screen. <br /> <br /> X-Files had better effects when broadcasting their first episodes in 1993. This happened four years before the SG-1 started. And they do not have a clear two million dollar budget for the episode, the SG-1 is suspicious. They should spend all the money on catering. Because I can not see on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a nice and nonsense show if they have a big budget, good writer and good character in Hollywood.
