Extraordinary horrible story that rarely keeps words. The best part of the film is when one of the victims is finally killed, alive and well, and again mass murder. Since I was in a little coma at the time of this baby, I was able to choose some important plot. The scenes never featured in the movie box in the film. I've been through the crude images of slavery torture and 'euro worst, sexy horror flick.' I got this concept of budget reform and I got a piece of the film. All good things are more than likely. Finally, in the most recent sense of the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie, I got the PG-13 addition. A friend and a bottle of hard stuff look at this one. You need it.
