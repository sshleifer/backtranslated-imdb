<br /> Film Madness of National Lampoon: <br /> 1. The film is poor, the standard of the lampune. 2. It's not funny. <br /> When I finish watching, I'm worried about why I'm going to the 'National lampoon movies' on Earth, much less actually made. It goes to Austin Powers' an American Guy films. How lame He is not an American, and he does not go to the movies. None of the most famous 'satirical' films of the lampune are funny, and no one will see the images that cause the slightest reason. <br /> <br /> I thought that there would be something in the vein of mystery science theater 3000, but it was not. <br /> <br /> In this movie you will be the first movie of the National Lampoon, after the Animal House. What kind of stimulus, strict, bizarre, badly developed, stimulates headache? <br /> I saw a pattern. Really bad movies are commonly renamed? And this small disaster comes under that category. There are two separate titles for people to try and publicly stupid to remember how bad the Pan is to get out of home video critics in 1982/83. 'Oops, Movie Madness ?? I never heard of this film before! Rent! <br /> <br /> In this movie, hey, wait a minute, it just goes to national lampoon movies! <br /> It is released by MGM / UA, should not be released in theaters or on DVD; It occasionally pop on the television for a decade, which is the only place you can find. <br /> <br /> Is it divided into three stories ?? Self-deployment videos, butter and corporate ruthlessness and police brutality / cam-buddy imagery (I guess). The first segment was Peter Rigurt (Animal House) who was a bored man who divorced his wife and made some other things. I'm not sure because I started boring my mind drift. <br /> <br /> Part II is about exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter that decides to be Margarein's queen, so she can reduce the supply of dairy products. Ouch! The film has only a funny line: 'Only my son can make love!' If you do not have a very funny sound, you're right ?? That's not. And imagine <br /> Part III follows a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd), who only loses his nerves and shoots the person to shoot. It has a funny scene but is it too much work? Only Lloyd really shows his humorous, compassionate, yet fantastically surreal play of his character. He could breathe his victim's breath and look at it by looking at the wealthy cap, at least inspiring a laugh or two. <br /> <br /> It is an insult to see the cast of semi-famous names. Low standards. Are the authors of each department apparently being so contradictory and clever by spoofing so-called stereotypes? This film is a huge contrast, which is suitable for standard T & A rather than platform; Raw humor instead of intriguing conversation; Instead of being inspired, it is disappointing. <br /> <br /> No one of those actors is able to switch to those items, repulsive of their songs, and often find it difficult to observe the eye with the camera. <br /> <br /> Before this movie is not funny. I only laughed once, and then it was a half-hearted. Two chuckles, a smile, and a very weak grin. I like the National Lampoon Vacation Series (or, at least in four installments), and their classic Animal House recently, live-video-video bombs like Gulf Punks (with the great comic intellectual Tom Arnold) The good example is that the blows went to their printing more than a decade ago. <br /> It's really old and very fast. <br /> <br /> Grief to see a new film called Gold Diggers is released with their 'stamp approval'. It's like a film condemning before touching the theaters? <br /> Distributor: 'This movie is great. It will acquire a national lamp stamp of approval. <br /> Forget the death penalty. <br /> <br /> In a room, put a group of criminals and make them see them every day for a month. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will give it.
