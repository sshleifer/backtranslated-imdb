After hearing a lot about the movie, I can not wait to get the DVD. No disappointment! This is one of the most confusing films I've ever seen. It was impossible to follow the stories, it introduced many characters, some of which were similar. In the first half of the film, at least he did not understand how he got an acting award for George Clooney. My wife left me after an hour and stopped the DVD. I think fast forwarding to see if the end is anything ahead but after a lot of confusion I decided that the prospects of improvement are slim. The last brother told me that the last minute or less the film would "come together". I waited and did not waste another hour. The next day I gave the DVD.
