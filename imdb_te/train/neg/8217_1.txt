Five young men are starting to drive home for their curfew, and they decide to stop in a shop & accidentally hit another car & just run it & leave it. The other car came out of a crazy woman with the gun & shake them & shouts them, makes them off their clothes & pee on them and randomly drives off. <br /> <br /> Girl intends to end their ordeal, but the crazy woman who wants to kill her lost girls comes back for seconds. I tell you that Grin Swinson & Ryan Thyssen is one of the worst films I've ever painted with Thysen's Writing & Thyssen & Ryan Thyssen, and think about what I've seen. Now that I have said that the cinematic resolution here is intended to encourage many atmospheric, tension, realism & suspense, but it is hateful to be honest in five things for five, and it's still embarrassing and 90 minutes of helpless waste is my 90 minutes At the time I was Dragging out my fingernails with pliers that can be kinda entertaining and fun. Reviews on the Web are very positive but IMDb (which is a total of 1 star comments & they are not all right, is not it right?) & This is what the board averages on the person who just used the phrase & the phrase 'the bad picture I've seen' sometimes and these negative comments To specify the same things & I agree with them Feel completely trash by This story is terrible, I think it's small, but is this a minimum? There is never any reason or explanation for events that happen, & it's completely coincidental. It goes to the ages, where the whole plot fights to fill a thirty minute for the tele-show with the full length feature. Dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who do not seem to have a brain cell between random things and throwing. Oh shocked and shouted, these girls rarely shake the endless sequences or prevent any kind of frustration that does not make crying, broken or boring, and boring & any sensed audience any more, they are almost impossible to hear. Then there's a real killer, the whole film set & a small van burns inside the limits, the camera leaves the car & this is just a person's low body count screen and five across the ice as I imagine you're really boring, a movie that I hate a hobby. <br /> At the technical level I can see that the filmmaking is a deliberate choice but I must be honest again. I've seen it five times and have seen the worst ever since I saw it. I would like my films to look like a visual spectacle, as the fan of the film is my visual medium and I do not want to look worse than the average YouTube video or my home movies on camcorder when I'm drunk. It really looks amateur & bad, it has a full spectacle & I hated every second every second. Just looking at the Blair Witch Project (1999) is ten times worse & noisy & you will be almost there. There are times during five across times when you can not literally say what's going on or what's going on the camera work & almost the pitch block & tight contrast levels. <br /> <br /> It is easy to see this budget, estimated at about $ 4,000, when the low budget begins to depict nearly five acres the ice. This is one of the lowest budget films that gave a wider release. The two vans of the film are owned by the producers, and this is especially beautiful in the overall budget. Acting was very bad by the main cast, and I was laughing at all the fake laughs and all the cases convincingly and irritating. <br /> <br /> Five Across the Eyes I've seen the worst films I have ever seen and I've seen some pictures, and whenever I ask someone, I see what's worse than the five eyes in five eyes. I hate it, every aspect & violent moment.
