I can not believe I will waste my money to rent this movie. When it started I thought it was a romantic movie and it was never better. Acting, music actors drowning out. Horrible. Save your money! You should read it as you read this movie. I have never come to think of slaughtering slaughter or cow and pigs. What to do with "real" BTK killer? I understand that there are no prominent actors in this movie. The script can be read on the front page. It's nice to look at the paint powder.
