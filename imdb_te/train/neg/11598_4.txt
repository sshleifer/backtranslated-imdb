When you look back at another bad nightmare sequel like Freddy Revenge, you have to give at least some credit for trying new things. And while Dream Child is more enjoyable, it's nothing new to the series. Yes, there are simple deaths, such as a kid being part of a comic book and as a "superfreddy", as well as simply not frustrating parts of their non-fittings. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to be relieved, "Freddy seems funny humor ... but what about? <br /> My rating: 4/10
