The "fallen ones" comes into the category of life's waste (WOL). I'm sad because I'm now two hours old. My other family members also saw the film and threw comments that were embarrassing on the screen. I'm sorry for actors (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and nothing else can be reduced to 25 minutes, so it can take a 30-minute slot on TV without plot damage. I recall the recipe that contains many good ingredients but does not have any taste when working. In my humble opinion, 42 feet mummy should have 8-10 feet and take spirituality and replace many people with DNA designs for nasty reasons to improve the plot. The leaders corrupted the ear of their colleges and threw them in the ear. Everything is gripped by evil people. Leaders will save the day and prove everyone is wrong.
