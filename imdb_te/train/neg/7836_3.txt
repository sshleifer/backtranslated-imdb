The first episode has set a lot of bar that I think. It played William as a successful man, who made a deal to kill a turmeric. There is little information on his role or he is paid to kill him, and in reality this episode does not have any conversations. Returning to his modern penthouse, he distributes a package containing toy soldiers, which gives him smile, but he will remove it and go about his business. But he's about flying a jeep, shooting machine guns and bazookas and helicopters, for a night of hell, soldiers are alive and fighting! Special effects are good on a TV show and Dodgas around the apartment will be too late, sometimes at the top and at other times to stay alive using his agility. I'm accustomed to ruin the end but it's enough to say that it's a clever little twist. I hope for the rest of the series but I'm disappointed, the remaining parts are all the worse and I've lost interest in the fourth one. Stephen King's adaptations are always a mixed bag and are not exempt
