This was recently AMC's zealous film in classics and I had to laugh. I have so much hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of "Adventure of the Earth Core" and "Mysterious Island". I was very disappointed with the acting credentials but a five year old comic book that was disappointed in the silly story line. Make sure to catch the wires holding the wings of Pterdactyl when they realized the modern man before a half idiot who made friends with "Oger" lost. The end was "opened up to the time that the people forgot" to keep the same effects more open. Do not waste your time.
