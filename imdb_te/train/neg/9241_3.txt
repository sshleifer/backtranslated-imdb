<br /> <br /> Germany Broadcasting "SAT1" aired a few weeks ago as the "TV-Event of the Year" - sorry, but I saw good things on TV this year. "The heroine" (if I can really call her) and two of her "loved ones" beside her - Pearl Harbor, someone? I recall about two other horrible movies when the movie was very familiar but because the film was very familiar, In fact, a poor man's version of Pearl Harbor and one of the stories in love is poor! <br /> <br /> I decided to look at the movies and analyze their designs and finally to see that trash. The film will begin with a doctor who will leave his family for a military strike against Russia, promising to return to his wife in the end of the Third Reich. Spring in the spring of 1948: German war and allies lost & Russia captured and they both seek to expel each other in world power and their ideology: the communism of capitalist classes. Well, because I guess the story you already know - this film really does not quite bother and literally takes a dump of historical facts. The film seeks to portray the American government as angels and bombings their country in the northwestern Great Britain, even though they are helping out of their country, completely abandon the cooperation of other nations in Great Britain, which is responsible for nearly four. <br /> <br /> When Hollywood mother Germany told her daughter, "This is impossible!" It is clear that the film's historic comments in the film are also pretty painful. Or Stalin (the director thought we were looking at the actor for a month) and to stop "Coca Cola" from spreading in Germany. Correctly, if Stalin had said this before. Or a bread in the meat and everything possible in it tells this fellow this is a US pilot - please! <br /> <br /> In this film you will once see a flyer on the map, from the laser printer '48 - directly from the flare printer. American General Lucius Clay, who thought he wanted to stay in Berlin, was portrayed as an average and scandalous man and he has historically been interested in Air Traffic and all the ideas on the idea came from the romance of the fictional character Philip Turner. The main actress's interest leads me to other elements: enough African American soldiers in the film, Total ch There are two in the ram-like! Relations between US soldiers and German citizens were not even allowed and the US soldier exposed such a relationship that was sent home. I do not want to say that there is no relationship but there is a couple who has almost got married in this film, if it is not the death of his fake CGI plane pilot that is terribly airy, especially CGI. <br /> <br /> While all Americans in this film are small enough in Germany, See that they are in my whole Germany in Germany. Life and I also have a little tone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All the children are good acting - the children have two expressions on their faces: "Simple-I-look-uniform-one-robot" and laughing <br /> The moving motion from the beginning of all the films is very slow Love Story in Pearl Harbor is just half of the conversation. The film was a lucky episode - 8.97 lakh first and 7.83 lakh people saw the second successive success of SAT1 in a row, winning two successive consecutive successes in a commercial group. But I always feel like: The biggest pile of bulls is where the more flies go.
