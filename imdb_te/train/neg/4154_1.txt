Vampires Vs. Zombies are not the original title. It's actually ... <br /> <br /> Nasty lesbian semi-vampires and two zombies are hit by cars: Bob's lesbian geepse-witch and her dog special rides and special Catholic schools Random Woman Girl Short Skirt Zombie Choir. <br /> <br /> Also in the box: Warning: No Plot - Author and Director At the end or anyone else in the picture understand. <br /> But seriously, though. I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I also enjoy the lesbians. The film is unclear and confusing (or non-existent) plot, horror (I mean really bad) dialogue and random stuff and people do not know anything (or can not) what's happening in the world. Oh, and I can not forget in green oatmeal "zombies" in the lows gloves (yes, film makers are cheap for they could even cover the hands of their zombies with oatmeal and paint). As a result, this aggressive bad movie, if you call it. <br /> <br /> Does not the end make sense? Is Vampire Really Nurse and the Other Girl Really A Mental Patient? Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, there are vampires at all ... you could really call any of the girls vampires. Whatever. <br /> <br /> Do not rent or buy this movie. If you're really curious ... ok, I'll understand. Seriously, BAD movie lovers can not even retain this subject. It should be number 1 in the bottom 100.
