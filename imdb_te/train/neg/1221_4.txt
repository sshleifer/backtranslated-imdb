I recall that Kim Basinger is nothing more than a beautiful face, decorating films with characters like Blondie, romantic interest or childhoods. But everything changed after the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in her role. Amazing film is LA Confidential, and I think it's not just a surprise for her performance. However, after that moment, she does not follow the career path of the career.Alrightly, thanks to that movie she made her (people like me no or the door of the door) mediocre prestigious movies To get involved, but she never saw her ever. Shiz was out of the film and she could not do anything; And her character is not very tasty, but the picture is really crappy. Screenplay from this movie is more empty and not basic. However, Basinger brings some confidence to her character, and this poor film is full of movie clips and generic villains. Director Susan Montfort's work is really dangerous for many reasons, but the film does not get a very good rhythm and tone. Darkly. I did not recommend her when I got her out.
