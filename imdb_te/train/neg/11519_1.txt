This is the movie that I have seen so far. The wastes of a wonderful cast. It was James Krammel, a playwright playing deputy. I can go and go, but I have spent more time in this review than I did in the script anytime. This film is only versus us and how delightful it is in the profane slapstick beyond any compassionate human's tolerance. This is one of the 10 worst films I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
