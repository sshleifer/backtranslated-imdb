This film really got a great start. It has the ability to truly turn into a heartfelt, romantic love story with a cinematography recorded in long-standing, poetic and substantive scenes of "Harlan" and Tob. It really does not need anything more than that, and there is a moment there I was someone excited by making a beautiful movie, yet another timeless classic, a modern myth for its own. Why, oh why, then the main character (Norton) mess up it half by making another emotional one? Maybe I do not have the point, but do we really need another film about psychos? Or is it a more common illness in the film industry to portray the illness of human health in the Hollywood film? Just a moment there, I'm going to make a mental note of the Director's name; Now I'm just different. It must be added at least in the film's defense to ensure that all actors invest in their roles. Also, Ivan Rachel Wood is a really good actress with really lovely and potential lots to watch.
