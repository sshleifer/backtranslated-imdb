I loved the first season. The quality of the second season was low, but it was a great mediocre (Pegasus!). The third season is very novel and original and okay. The fourth season began to go with deep pace, never giving us any explanations, now we have really started them. What is a sail plan? Why are two Sylvan factions? Did the Angel-Kara's vessel be destroyed by land 1? What kind of past five cylons has past, and how are they alive, or are they reincarnations? Questions everywhere, somewhere answers. <br /> <br /> And then comes the end. Earth-2 (our land) in the past. OK, okay. But the army is destroying? Giving technology and giving any kind of urban life, and spreading thousands of papers - across the planet! It is not anti-science, it is anti-life and anti-life. And the philosophy of the exhibition is devastating from nature fictional A.I. It seems that in a decadent capitalist society that has been invented forever in a cycle. Everything will be lost. Human vision is not a hope for a great future, it is without attention, and it is the opposite of proper science fiction. And do not start me on the angels! The worst kind of religious confrontation! The ultimate disappointment <br/> The whole "This has happened and will happen again" should be about the previous incarnation of the series, rather than the Earth we know. It was the perfect stroke of intellectual creation of some new show with an older performance. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 1.
