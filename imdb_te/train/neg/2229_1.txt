Perhaps this was not a movie, I did only half of the film. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible, camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole picture is simply unrealistic and not cheesy. For example, during a coke deal, Coke is loosely placed in a brief case - I'm not an expert, but I think people are usually in a bag. <br /> <br /> When a punch is thrown (it is on top 'crunching' sound and they use toy guns with dubbing in sound effects. The worst image ever.
