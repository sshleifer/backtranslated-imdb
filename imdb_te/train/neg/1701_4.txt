David Lynch's crude and wildly drawn in South Park causes the riot of riots from the suburban middle class family. The father is a three-teeth and unevenly large-circular mouth-hole horror monster, which is a terrible creature's way of life, fearful creatures, the son and the mother forever fearing. <br /> <br /> Lynch is famous for his comics (ie The Air, Heart of Wild at Heart), and I generally do not like comedy. However, there are some scenes in Diamond, which made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> Lynch lends a wide range of responses through the syntax of the shots against facial expressions (which is not really different in Dumbland). <br /> <br /> If I'm trying to give audiences a straightforward audience, there's an animated comedy here that's interrupted. Interestingly, he chose ultra-low-brown humor (ie, most of Will Farrell's films) in the footsteps of recent waves, adding to extreme social criticism and classic cartoon violence and macro-out humor. Although the mixture does not work really well, it is not a linchine. <br /> <br /> Lynch is valuable by fans.
