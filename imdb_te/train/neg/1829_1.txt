Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not retain Ben Stiller anymore. It's beyond me how this man is still allowed to make movies. I can not understand how I acted in the way he worked, and I had a company in which I shot and shot ... to shoot me. God! This film is just plain, steaming, POO's cutting pile, if it is possible to make mistakes. I am guiding about the text lesson in a comment idiot. What's wrong to tell some things about the movie? I never understand why a short novel written by sites sometimes requires a brief comment.
