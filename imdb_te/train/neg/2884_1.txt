When I was working in a video store, I found it to be my most serious responsibility to talk about the worst films I ever saw, which warn my friends and colleagues. The worst picture is that when one day a hot talk was taking place, my friend B.T.K killed me to see. Killer, if I can see the whole movie and even say that my previous choice is always the worst film, he'll see it. I lost it. I believe that I've done better videos in high school and that it is the greatest success of a youthful genius. The film's value (though it's a surprise, it seems to have shot a bad camcorder) does not appear in the movie, but acting (wood, hollow, and curiosity does not have surface lines), as well as bad cinema concept. I remember a scene that suddenly heard a glass smash, some bad high school drama (I mention here very often high school, but the film feels very fraught), the set was pretty fake, but people would not know what would happen if they read their ways from the script. My review does not do justice to this, because I explained how scary I spent watching. It's almost ridiculous that I would do a curious job of describing it as a sad trick.
