Do not waste your time at this time. As shown, the letters are not redeeming values ​​and looking to interact with them is just torture. "Gothic" is at least fun, it's the worst. If you like to see serious and spoiled poets, you may be fine. Lord Byron is a complete jerk, and why others choose to spend more than five minutes with him, really memorable. Mary Shelley appears to be the only character of any backbone, but she takes out the whole fire without an ounce of respect. What time is vain? Look gothic instead. I remember seeing another superior film based on the same stuff, but did not catch the title. I am not this ambition, but such luck. Not recommended.
