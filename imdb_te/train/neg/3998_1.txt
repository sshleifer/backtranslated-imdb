Are you "all shock, what a plot?" There are many unexplored orders in this movie. There is no history of death apart from death. * Why is it bad? What did that do? Why "hour" countdown? Then, unexplained things have been suggested; For example we saw a camera * in the air space. <br /> <br /> What about the fact that all ghosts are "digital" and constant sound "sound" before hitting the ground? Hmmm ... when you put all that * up, it will be like the 1408 high tech spooky house. <br /> <br /> Oh, the electronics do not work in 1408. Well, except for TV ... cell phone signal, but wireless internet works fine. How many incorrect words can you add? Sorry, but this film is not "shock after shock". It happened before. Mirrors in the mirror. Things just from the site. Change the paintings. Bleeding walls. "Oh, it's just a dream ... not what's it." And, if the room is "bad", why would our main character come to terms with the death of his daughter, if he's going to keep him there forever? <br /> In addition, there is no background information about the "first book" he wrote. There is some vague information about "father's jerk" and so forth. Talking about Dodds, what about Bit with his father? "You are in my place". <br /> <br /> Overall, the true Harvey image. It is 100% adrenaline shock factor without any new or innovative effects, and definitely behind the story, character development, etc. <br /> <br /> My complete impression is that the whole movie "Cheap" is pretty much just one of a set and the location shots, and recycled, cheesy, "seeing-that-before" effects is not just an effect film.
