Haunting. A remake of course. The original is a creepy psychological thriller, and one of the time has improved. Compared to this 1999 remake, it's a classic. There is no role in development here, just caricatures (the old, the power of mind, "I'm here to go", oh so gentle bookworm). But, I guess the role that you have to associate with the second concept, looking at banking on the special effects of "star". Unfortunately, the effects are ridiculous. Merging Cherubs, Stretching Doors, Embarrassing Dead Children ... and an idiot tight, you give a new age of butterflies and rainbows. I'm grateful to my skittles and thanks. I liked you from Bruce Dern, "Cowboys". Stop it.
