A thought comes soon to be remembered, "My God looks like this really bad sitcom." <br /> <br /> Canada (Shirley Nig) and Janet (Natalie Sky) are the first to start the series in Canada, in Vancouver. Janet is already out to his mother but Kara's parents are in the dark about their daughter's homosexuality. When her parents came from Malaysia to marry her brother, she escaped. That same week British Columbia legalized same-sex marriage. Janet wants to marry, and she has to decide whether she should tell her conservative china parents that Kara is her gay. Is she Is she Can she do it? Cara contrasts with Jesse (Trent Meyer). Jessie just announced her homosexual age at the age of fourteen. His biological father Daniel (Andrew McIlroy) is coming to visit soon. His stepfather Norman (Michael Robinson) is finally convinced by Jesse that he is afraid that Daniel is homosexual and is not his. Do 1-800-Makeover Help Dial? <br /> <br /> This dialogue and delivery comes along with physical emoting directly from the 1950s program. Full house-style play is enough to make you wince from time to time and fail most of comedy efforts. McIlroy, Miller and Sky were the only performers who reached this wrong fit, but they were given the task to do, and it was not surprising that nothing was impressive. The possibility of camping is possible. Performers are not really bad, they are trying to imitate the low-level sitcoms of the past days. This is actually more repetitive than this review. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Royalty / just enough time to mark the screen while having an outdoor gay character. That's gone. Today we need quality.
