Okay, the story - a simple turn-back death young chick and her kid brother enters the life of boredom and wreaks havoc in their lives - is a little interesting one. <br /> <br /> There are no thoughts (some for everyone ...) - everything is execution. <br /> I am suffering from this film. And it's very difficult for me. The rhythm (directing, editing) is slow, pace is unequal and climax predicted. We saw those friguing highways five, six and seven times - why? The difficulties of the character of Norton appear to be a boy's play, not to understand his problems / soul / block and to fight against him or against him. Is he a coward, a manipulator or a sweet guy? The references to "Taxi Driver" are ridiculous and unnecessary and some for the film (or E.N. <br /> And IMHO, it's shy and is finally running. Cheap emotional tricks for young lovers somewhere in mid America. This man murdered the boy and cursed his father and created a real ruin. Or the kid should have killed his father at the end of the child, but the children can not miss the dead, and finally the father kills and loses his or her relationship with them and dies alone. <br /> <br /> We are unhappy, safe and happy bored in a happy family, so our pop-corns are not happy. <br /> And when that drama enters the film, Oh my God, I have to think of it to find the stupider than something tall and difficult! You do not shoot a scene with hidden camera and hidden crew. The creators of the film thought it was probably a good idea but more than annoying. Once again, if you're a 16-year-old girl somewhere in Kansas and have a crazy person double-sized, you can enjoy this movie and its "message".
