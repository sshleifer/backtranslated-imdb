<br /> It may be one of the worst movies ever made to make the product ever. <br /> <br /> The most exciting part is the beginning, where the guy walking ... and walking ... and walking (spoiler). It's just 15 minutes running. How? <br /> <br /> There is a lot of lighting issues, and they are almost like shooting at night scenes during the day. <br /> Acting Terrible. <br /> They seem to have found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then they've taken people back. <br /> <br /> Please do not rent this movie for the love of sacred everything. If you know who the owner is, apologize to them. The director should be subjected to punishment by war crime tribunal for pushing people.
