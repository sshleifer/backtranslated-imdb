In the movie Charles Dance character's words, "Bolaws!" <br /> <br /> In the real world (since British police inspectors have been armed with hand guns on their shoulders halves), all the things that are not entirely complete. Complete the mistakes (Bulgarian trains in London?). Full of dull and artificial dialogue. And directed / editing is awful - the wobbly hand-picked camera shots combine nothing except the vague concept of voyage; Confused jump cuts; There is no structure. <br /> <br /> The Wesley Snipes' character is completely impartial - what should happen to him? Direct to video Direct to Dabbin!
