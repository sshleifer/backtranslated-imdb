Semana Santa is jaw-falling bad. In many ways, where I started, was very wrong. So, let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose judge's husband has been shot at her when she saves, goes to Madrid from Severail for her workshop. In the Holy Week (see, Samanta, see, ... everyone starts to sleep, it is very early in the day), a killer drives his victims into the bulls in the bull's arena. Olivier Martinez of the male jacket and connects her team with Nice Fiodorate Atkins. She soon learns that she is the next target of the killer (he is wearing a red robe). <br /> <br /> "Why?" "He said. <br /> Why? Mira Sorvino (I'm sorry for the first intelligence) <br /> <br /> Why are the 8 at theater this Saturday at the end of the first week? A: ah-ah-ah. Spider-Man relaxed on the same day. <br /> Why is this movie taken? A: Money I guess. But boy Mira does not need money. <br /> Why why ... ??????????????? First of all, there is something wrong with European co-structures. Here you get French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Trans-production production. <br /> <br /> Then US wants to play thrillers / slashers / whodunit / secrets / same playgroup. <br /> <br /> To give some credit to the story, the hero wanted to add some political attention to the story. . Wrong: A flash is made in flash-backs in photography, which is definitely the most interesting thing I like. It may have a stick, it can not sit through the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Then, for the homosexuals, Guillermo del Troas's The Devil's Backbone (El Espinosa del Diablo) is good. Bull's Eye! The first victims were S & M drug traffickers. The annoying Olivier Martinez goes with a sleek platinum wig and goes to a dating company that slows down heavily. The Mira Sorvino character is called a big dike for all time. Do we need this kind of stuff? Nah. <br /> Then the suspense. Yipee. There is no clear motive. The first murders are plain illusion because they represent representation of a famous painting. But not. And when the end of the film appears, the killer (a horrific fascist, of course) will begin the discovery, I guess, it's time to tell the director it's time, "he asked," why does it kill a full-time murderer and why? " <br /> The director thinks that the director is the director. FALSE: The concept of suspense, no understanding of directing actors, lack of understanding of pace change. A giant, mega-bore. The scenes of Holy Week are unnecessary (perhaps a co-production rule: Okay, shoot in the Sevilla but this beautiful and historic town shows some credits with celebrations of Easter. Here are a picture of a mystery for tourists!) /> <br /> Then actors . All the mistakes. Mira Sorvino dies: she does not do anything practically unless she is stabbed in the right hand. Everything she did best (replacement killers, Mighty Aphrodite ...) were like they never existed. Oliver Martinez ... Hello, is anyone here? When the producers find that the producers are not an actor, but he may not speak or feel any sense? Fedor Atkin, Blonde and Transparent. We will only pay great honor to Alida Valli, who is the great actress of the last century (and I hope for some more role in the present role). She is the only major attraction in her poor ways of life. <br /> The absurd direction, the inconsistent actors, the intimidating plot. <br /> <br /> The superdenderscope says: <br /> <br />
