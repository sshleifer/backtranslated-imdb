The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, is not a good movie, but I can not really say I'm worried about watching. When I look for negative aspects of the film, acting and looking for a girl in the long sequences, there is a fantasy, another hallucination, then a dream scene-a fantasy, etc., but it's just not worth it when it comes to this movie. <br /> <br /> There are five reasons why you look bad. It's hard to deny having some genuinely creepy ideas, the only problem is in its cheesy, unexpectedly funny execution. <br /> <br /> If you have nothing else, it can also read a movie that is inspired to see the original 1973 film or a short story based on it. <br /> <br /> For a cheesy horror / thriller, it is really lovely pleasing. It is portrayed in the city instead of using green screen or extensive settings, so it is very beautiful to see a very great view. There are also many well-composed shots. <br /> This is a very good movie. Nicholas Cage is not a very actor, he has the power of nature. Whether you're his fan or not, Cage feels impossible to play a "normal guy". There is always some kind of disaster or mood that he plays in drama characters, and personally, I'm always fascinated by what he sees in any film. Even if Nicolas Cage is great or terrible, he always brings his only strength into play, and he's never boring to see. <br /> <br /> He's awesome at The Whacker Man, but the most wonderful way. <br /> <br /> In this film, a student may write a paper hell, which is the strongest anti-feminist film ever made. "See?" You can write, "This happens when women are allowed to run this community!" <br /> <br /> The similarities between the "Summersillay" community and a bee colony are very interesting and noticeable. <br /> <br /> If you read it, you have a good chance of seeing a well-liked YouTube video: a collection of "highlights" from the movie, along with Cage running in bear suit, "Aghh !! Beats !! ! " Line. <br /> I bought a DVD that I used at a blockbuster for 5 dollars ... When you do that, it's about every dollar. This is a pretty good deal. <br /> <br /> The unrated version of the film is best to watch and see the theatrical version, a guest role from James, for its shortest addition.
