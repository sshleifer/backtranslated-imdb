It's easily the worst Ridley Scott film. Ridley Scott is an excellent director. But this film is a black sign in his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, totally evil in the film that is overly refusing a girl going to the army. Very insane. And there is not a scene that can persuade anyway. It's not really difficult to make a similar image. The staff everyone can just be an idea to anyone. The authors do not have much inspiration; Many silly words that do not mean anything; And some bleak reaction. I strongly recommend that you stay away from this trash. Many talented people involved in this project realize that this type of image is not appropriate for their attention and I feel that in the future they will act on more respectful and more intelligent images than this useless mess.
