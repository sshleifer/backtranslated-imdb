I first saw this movie and I never heard of it before, perhaps it could cause a poor message. <br /> <br /> All of the directing is good, the actors are doing well and the CGI (I'm not a CGI fan) is amazing. But there is not a single film alone. <br /> <br /> If I need to remember people, I need to make sure that the director's art is not only for your attention but also how to tell the story. <br /> <br /> It's lost in a total of 7 minutes.
