I'm one of the few additions to this big bomb. I am A.I.R. At the right place for the safety of race sequences. That's backwards. Thanks to the goodness of my scene in the first few minutes and I do not sit through the whole thing. It's bigger than movie set, but hey, payment is good. Details are not a strong point in detail, but who wants to know. The funny thing is that in the film to speed up slowly speed and speed up the picture speed up then at normal speed. Many scenes have changed as they are depicted I suppose I spend time and time shaving. But each one has a good time who cared!
