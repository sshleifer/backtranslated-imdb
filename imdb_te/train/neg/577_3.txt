For all, John Bon Jovi does not appear in a vampire movie. Together with the other interesting characters and poor storyline together the whole picture becomes predictable. If you remember it and you're the whole vampire movie fan, you can enjoy some scenes with some scenes. Do not expect any Tarantino-style chapters and an Anne Rice plot here. (I believe tomorrow the entire movie is forgotten;)
