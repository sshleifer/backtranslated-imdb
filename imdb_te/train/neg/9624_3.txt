Considering the ability to make this move, the reality is frustrating. It's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, but it does not turn around. Many actions are predictable. The jokes are fun fun. And the characters are not very interesting. I wanted to like this movie, but it did not. Ben Stiller is hilarious in "There Is Something About Mary". He looks like he's just going through moves. If they lift plot points from "friends", they should know that something is wrong. Toilet humor should be in the room :-). <br /> See "50 First Dates".
