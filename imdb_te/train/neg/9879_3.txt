After watching this film, I was really surprised to see a superior rating on IMDb. <br /> <br /> 'The Fantastic Mister Fox' is a parody of the beloved children's classic, the protagonist Mr. Fox (or 'Foxy') who tries to make a 'last' heist to steal from the terrible bogies, buns and beans. <br /> <br /> "I'm in my late teens and I'm never a friend of the Roald Dahl, but I've got some of his book As I read it, I read it again and see Matilda and Charlie and Chocolate Factory, but the film is aiming for audiences .Should I still be sure of it? For example, Mr. Fox is an example 'Jokes' is a kid who looks like a lawyer or complains about poverty, and the audience (as I predict) steals the chickens and sympatheticly with a role that kills me.I am all for the food chain, but see what you actually see on the fox's neck! Is there a bit too much? And also, the plot ... b <br /> <br /> I'm just getting angry at Fox and his son Ash to take ridiculous decisions. <br /> <br /> Humor, at the same time, comes flat. I laughed only once or twice. I think that acting voice on its part is so incredibly flat and monotoned. Voice actors do not have a ridiculous time, instead it is intended for the subtlety of humor working with some media. George Clooney aims to paint Mr. Fox as charming and elegant, but his voice does not play any role. <br /> <br /> Meril Streep did not show any emotion at all, and at Murray's end, I could not understand that Bill Murray had a role until the previous credits. The animation, especially the motion to stop, but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit. The characters are long, spinley and design lack of warmth. They move very lightly and often have an animation jerk and fantastic. There is also a typical 'mixed medium' feel, because 2D parts are added occasionally and incorrectly. The characters directly looked at the camera and discussed; It's very awkward. When Kylie appeared directly in the camera, one or two moves were made, and his eyes were not moving. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Mr. Fox has a very high probability. Many people seem to like it - see reviews. Maybe it's not me.
