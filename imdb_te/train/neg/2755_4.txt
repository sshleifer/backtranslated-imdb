This is a very simple storyline collection of scenes, any notable story or any of the best way I acted in a long time. Sightseeing scenes from Star Wars, Fire of Rain, Godzilla, The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter are a full-fledged war on intellectual intelligence. Is this movie good? <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it is not funny but has not yet achieved the level of comedy as a comedy, the film has made some laughs. Duplicate scenes should be placed in the context of original images. The Gandalf talking may be funny, the basilisk snake is fun if you compare it to a kitten and played and may be fun or something else between Soron and Zaza-Bing. <br /> Bottom Line: Any joy that is derived from this movie is not the director / writer, but completely dependent on the state of the viewer's perception and imagination. Shim!
