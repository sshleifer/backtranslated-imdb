It has its merit; Morveron Colar is both in greatness and in discouragement. She's so original, so uneven. Is it her way of dealing with a lost pain in her distant and incomplete? Or is she calling her a critic as a revolutionary? Personally I call her unaware. <br /> <br /> Morven is completely separating herself. Not thinking of leaving his friend, telling the family or using the money she gave to the funeral, she was selfish at the Spanish tour. It seems to be the case with relative human barbarism. The only thing that triggers audiences is that her friend is her friend who is leaving her with her. Eventually her friend was dumped and Mourner did not have anything to do with her. </ Span> <br /> This is nothing but a shame that the film is interested in, it's less than 90 minutes, but Morvann may feel that they will be interesting to attract your attention, but do not do anything with her, you can distance her away from you until you care about her characters or movies.
