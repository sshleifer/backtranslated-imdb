Lumi, clear superhero action movie drewwell. I have great hopes for the film, and I do not hate the style of HK Buddy Cop Action Artists, but I rarely see the most ridiculous story as this hero. It's always a forgery, when it's always in the movies, when the action is over, unfortunately it did not. This action is based on the trademark and the best nature of the HK action, but it is not quite offensive, in fact it is not totally irrelevant (perhaps it is due to re-editing of the American release, which is a lot of space places). I was very disappointed.
