This early Pia Jadar vehicle follows Harold Robbins' law: in this case the prestigious main character walls decline when the road to the top of the glamorous but attractive world in the film industry. But in principle to be totally imaginative, the film is performed at the same time as absolutely unbelievable. Zadora (as actress volunteered to be called a veteran) was not convinced as a storyteller. One is about a film that has some insights into the film structure and in its own industry and creative process. But the script did not give her any of the features that the writers did with interesting portraits: the ability to walk, the words with love, and the love-hate relationship with her own creative abilities. Her character is empty as a donut hole. And here's the taste of inefficiency in the show. Cinematography is rare and sometimes difficult to see what's going on. And the scenes really never hang together, so everything seems like a legacy of random moments at bad Hollywood parties. Avoid.
