When I looked in the cast list, I was attracted to the film, but after seeing I should confess that I was disappointed. The main problem for the film is that the actors do not have the ability to take the film back. Why? Due to bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones are trying hard to take this film to another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is quite simple. So the fans of this lovely Diane Lane for Matt Dillon fans. Legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but it's not a movie for him; Very low for his level. If you are hooked by these great actors, do not expect it to be big or unusual. The only thing you remember about the film is Diane Lane scenes; The rest are very memorable.
