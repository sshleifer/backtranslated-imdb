I have a lot of hopes for this film, so I saw a lot of expectations. Mainly because of Kamal Haasan. An amazing actor who always recognized his footsteps in the sand. But this film has proven to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. After watching this movie, cruelty and violence in clockworks and clockworks are very good. <br /> <br /> The hero, Raghavan is a very courageous police officer. Who appoints the cruel serial killings. Raghavan has found the thread in the case and finds murders and psycho-killers but psychologically disturbed but intelligent medical students are behind the bars but they run away and kill again. Finally Raghavan kills many innocent lives and then kills them. <br /> <br /> These two psycho killers are going to continue to the audience going to theaters. The murders and sexual assaults and rapes have been shown very clearly, and the film is out of the film. <br /> <br /> "Gautam is directing to know that there is some responsibility for society and his audience too." I can never see movies under the name of Gautam as producer.
