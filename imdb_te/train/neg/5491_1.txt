It should be suspicious to know that only two minutes are light. Only five people have joined before the film starts. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to redeem this movie. The acting is terrible (especially Ms Harley). The script is unobtrusive. The effects we've seen a million times The movie's direction is the worst we've ever seen. Mounting and disarray. <br /> <br /> After 25 minutes, we gave up. <br /> <br /> If this was the case for my wife's hot dog, it would be soon. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money in this movie. If there is nothing else to see in your movie, then buy some drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and some people should watch. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have a very enjoyable time <br /> <br />
