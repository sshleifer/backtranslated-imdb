Whenever a Columbo story is confused with the familiar storyline (the colorful killer becomes a pest in the Columbo process, who commits the crime, smokes out the Columbo killer), the authors are always able to match the quality and interest of most traditional parts. This episode deviates acutely, and the result is a major flop <br /> <br /> Do you believe? Columbo frankly never endures <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I was tempted to turn it off by two-thirds. <br /> Oh, sacrifice We make self-appointed reviewers !!!
