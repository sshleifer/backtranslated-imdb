I've found an interesting study on the cause and effect of this film but a little more than that. The basic plot follows some people's lives and their actions (deliberately and not otherwise) affect the lives of others. The premise of the film is a great promise but I feel it failed to deliver its promise. The chaos has spent a lot of time on the theory about the theory and it shows very little time. As a result, I could not get any real feel for any of the characters and did not make a good connection with them mentally. By the end of the film, I have a "So What" attitude about all of them. The film is a good direction in character development, but this is just as good as it stands out
