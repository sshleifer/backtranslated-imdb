In 1925, childhood friends Marie Scheckler (as Maggie Warren) and Pauli Moran (as Lizzie Proskins) were married to their children, Anita Page (as Helen) and Norman Foster (as John). Before the ceremony, Ms. Dresler turns her small town bank's successes to her son, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brings many bank closures, and financial insecurity. Banker Foster can be alive, due to the clever plan of Mother Scheerler. But, Ms. Moran fears his fortune and asks for a complete withdrawal. Other "Warren Bank" customers start to hear Moron's speech, and start questioning their own solutions. <br /> <br /> Dragler, who initially released the film "Emma," released a massive critical and financial film initially and MGM wanted to get a new dresser soon. As far as possible. Dresler's 1931 hits, "Reducing" and "Politics" are still making money; According to industry standard list compiled by Quigley Publications, Dreler became the US # 1 box office star of 1932. "Prosperity" is definitely a dressler's status, but the product looks unusually tired, and moved immediately. The cast is well thought out. Directing and editing helps and some more attention to some intervals. <br /> <br /> Sam Wood - Mary Shaker, Pauli Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
