... or audiences. <br /> You got this doctor who experimented with parts of the body that were stolen for some vague reasons. He wants to transform the perfect, but he feels he needs to do it in his basement. WTF ??? And suddenly, unfortunately, and conveniently, his fiancée gets cut off in a traffic accident that is responsible for her head. He is suffering from mourning and puts his head in a lasagna pan (or studded?) And completes the "adreno-serum" (sick) to keep it alive. And then when her neck is stuck at her vocal nostrils, she speaks on her head (to talk), and she can not speak if she is an ML, she does not have any lungs. The grateful b * tch his fiancé does not appreciate all that she has done. <br /> <br /> Then he sees the opportunity to get out of the street on the first confusing Bimbo's body on the head of his beloved head. Meanwhile, the doctor's assistant, a conscious shop, gets into the philosophical arguments of Igor, the head who struck a teleconic friendship with "the monster in the room" (one of every mad scientist). Eventually, the screenwriter realizes that he is unable to sustain fears of intimacy on infinity and hence kill everyone else, so the film's financial supporters go to the bank to pay the check before being able to stop paying. <br /> <br /> When you see an assistant with his hands, it is very valuable to pirate around the house without too much blood.
