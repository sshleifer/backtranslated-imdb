The original is a good picture. I bought it on the tape and saw it many times. And even though I know, the sequels are not usually the best of the original, and I do not expect such a bomb. Romance is flat, focus nails old, speaking humor just is not. This is not the worst movie I have ever seen but it comes closer.
