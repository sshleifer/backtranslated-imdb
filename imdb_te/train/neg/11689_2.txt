I never saw Spike Lee's earlier movies, because their trailers did not attract my interest. I have seen, and Denzel Washington, and Jody Foster's work, and many of their DVDs. But I was totally disappointed with this movie. If the film is a reference to Spike Lee's potential as a director, my suggestion is to "get a job" and stop wasting the time and talent of others. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised if some of the other IMDb commentators see the same picture I've seen. I can only imagine that Spike Lee's worship has prohibited them from setting up this work, and from their delicate love reviews. <br /> <br /> "IMDb" trivia page tells it all ....... <br /> <br /> "Filmed in 39 days" - a small budget "blockbuster" ), How can you shoot at a short time? <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard is going to direct the film first ..." - He did some justice to this project, so of course, that's why. Though the writing was miserable, there was some benefit in the campus. <br /> Okay! Maybe not. I'm sorry! This film was a pitiful clich√©, unsustainable scenes, and lousy characters, so perhaps he was so stupid that he could not have done it too much. (Hen Ron! Thank you to Russell ... good call!) <br /> * "Jody Foster filmed her role in three weeks." - It has shown! Her role of "Fixer", which loses people's problems, is unbelievable as the script she gave. <br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** ***** The bank is stealing, and he'd put it away ... or else? <br /> <br /> * Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) confirms that there are no corpses in the bank, how many bank robbers, without a gun, a police "take the lead" (the Police Officer went back to the front door, allowing him to walk behind him? <br /> * Dette Frazier later stated that the thief had given "every reason to shoot me", but in their small fight Why did he not find a response that he was looking for ... A thief had shot him to prevent identity afterwards, and why "Steve, Steve, Steve-O" (co-owner of the robbery), why come and took a long time to help <br /> <br /> I understand that these are not your common bank robbers Ibhinna is on the agenda, and did not want to do harm to anyone. But the cops do not have reason to think they will not. It's a frustrating them. Why, two bad guys "to pick up a pizza," Outside the US, they will be removed. (First of all, how many thieves came out without being used as captive as a shield? It was NY City, or SNL 's Spike Lee version? Removing them could have reduced the numbers of the bad man, scraped their plans, and the rest could be longer. <br /> <br /> There is no police force in this country, Madeline White, (Jody Foster ), Only allowed Waltz to enter the bank, and allowed to discuss.The thieves are one thing that she can not reveal first? She has no power, no government credentials. <br /> Bank CEO, (Christopher Plummer) <br /> <br /> "Schmuck", with the voice of the jersey (not the character, not the actor), who, conveniently, volunteers, and <br /> <br /> He is the recording "100% Albanian", but still he does not speak to himself ..... SIR! When questioning the suspects, why did the dot. Frazier, is not a part of the Hest continuously harassing people? (I.e. telling the elderly woman she can, and then she can not, then couldn?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> When the bank looters demanded that the hostages be placed in suit jumps, did some of the expediters withdraw their plan of escape from the bank that acted as hostages? <br /> When the film ends, a room is built on the door wall and Clive Owens hides for "a week". From? (Drywall & studs). They also thought that they would be cut in the sewage, so he relieved himself. Do not bank employees complain about smell for weeks? <br /> After such a defeat; Since the documents are "dropped" into the hands of the thief, what kind of "suggestions" Mrs. White, who wants to withdraw from the bank's CEO, seems to have been targeted for blackmail since she is now failing? <br /> <br /> * Last but not sure, what's with Denzel's "Electric Glide"? How stupid! Should these guys refer to the "fix" of justice? When trying to prevent a bowel movement, he saw a ride on a shopping cart as a surprise! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Besides the usual plot; lousy script; Bad acting; And the whole pitiful directing ...... is that, yes, it is. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
