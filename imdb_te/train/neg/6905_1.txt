Clich√© Polynesian makes males drink, fight and make a sexist, stupid and inappropriate speech flow. The real life Polynesians are more ridiculous than these tattoos and cardboard characters. Unexpectedly, Samoan girl did not see or acted, and was seen as a stocky white girl who had sex with someone. You can not say anything about acting because the heroes are weak with water - most brilliant actors can not do anything with this script. It is sad to see Polynesian actors who like to play such vicious practices in a film with only a good scene, and only two or three jokes. Kiwi taxpayers have no chance of losing what to make a great image about any waste, powerful community of money. It is not good to make movies if they are so bad and mindless.
