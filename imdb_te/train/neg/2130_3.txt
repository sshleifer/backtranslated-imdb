I'm coming late to party. I saw this 1995 version by Bye Bye Birdie's Sky TV. <br /> I've played Albert a long time ago and I'm thinking about making an amateur product. I'm so much fun to do because to show it. I did not impress with this new version. It's just not enough fun. It's not colorful. It does not surpass youth. Lighting is bad. Nobody mentioned this fact. This is not a moody music, it is bright and beat. Lighting decision is poor creative choice. <br /> <br /> Bye Bye Bird is a mistake, a comedy of errors. I do not have any understanding in this version. The lighting is awful and it dulled the whole shows. Dance numbers also seemed anemic. We have music videos today. At least dance numbers should either measure some of them, or some of the best in Broadway. <br /> <br /> All actors are very talented, but there are some bad actors choices. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and there are many talented Latin artists who do not have one of them in the role of Rossi. Vanessa African American, fascinating and talented, but bad cast. Jason Alexander's work is very confusing, he always does the brilliant work, but he's not Albert. I think it's apparent to many people who are unfortunate and see this version. <br /> <br /> Film is not a medium of platform. Must be translated from one medium to another. Exaggeration and filmmaking of the stage music must be translated to the film. It is not a loyalty to a state script when filmed. The spirit, the essence of the product is brought forward. For me the 1963 film By Baidy Birdy is bright and smart for production, but 1995 is as soft as dawn and dancing numbers as production lighting. It has become an unfortunate unfortunate attempt by many talented people.
