After seeing this, I thought of my opinion, and there are many good writers and directors or producers. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible picture. It's terrible that it's not fun, but you grid your teeth and teeth. You shouted "It's wrong" in the movie. Immersion zero. Most of you have probably been used for horrible bugs / strange-rats in movies like hackers in most computers. This image is similar to each item. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this film is the little girl Emily playing Eliza Bennett. <br /> <br /> "I'll help you, do not look at it, it's not even right, time is total waste.
