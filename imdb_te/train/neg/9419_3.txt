I can never hear this thing, and then I recognize the person with the dead lens. Canary's existence motivated me to buy it, it's not good. It wants to be a sort of cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but it's not just funny unless you find the funny General Wombat (?) Funny. It's like a flat 70 thriller for the last ten minutes, which progresses to life. There are many flat scenes in the White House that do not work for the president and his assistants. It's too early to cut, and the first half is edited down to suicide bomber attacks, which is considered to be the total nuclear atomic bombardment story and I meant to play for laughs, but again, that's funny. The location filming is amazing but the studio stuff looks cheap TV. I can not believe the one who was responsible for the key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Craneury. Only laugh: Canary puts on his helmet and throws his wig away before jumping from a plane. Never Never Never Never Never Become Never Again
