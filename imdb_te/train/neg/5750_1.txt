In fact, it's pretty funny ... a "god, how hell did this movie" is the kind of way. If you're doing all the cinema movies, it's hard ... go ahead and look ... but if you're really thinking "is it a good movie?" <br /> <br /> The film initially sucked out of the scene, and I saw in any movie. "But what about you, you know the bat, talk about Edgar Allen Poe ... for the people who do not remember Poe's life story, but did not even try to explain ... I do not know what's true of what this said << br /> <br> The film is about a writer "Ethan Poe" Hookin with his cousin "Anne" ... they are descendants of Edgar Allan Poe ... or are they ?! Obviously, what people do with their ancestors Ethan Poe is Ethan "Usher", who thinks he is inherited from the story of "Usher of House" by Ether Allen Poe, and sometimes the brother of the brother shows her to be raped ... Ain is also concerned about the time at the same time by three different people in the movie (Seriously, three ... they are behind her and she does not even realize). Everything is murdered   పాత్రలు, చివరి రోజున సేవ్ చేయటానికి ప్రయత్నిస్తాయి .... కాని వారు కాదు. చివరలో, అతడు తన స్నేహితుడిని చంపడానికి ప్రయత్నిస్తున్న సమయంలో ఏటా కాలుస్తాడు ఈత. కోర్సు యొక్క, ఆమె అతనిని కాలుస్తాడు ముందు ఆమె "ఎప్పుడూ కాదు!" ఈ చిత్రం నిరంతరం చూడాలి!
