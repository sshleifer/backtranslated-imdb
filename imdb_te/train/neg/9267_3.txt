After already disappointing "Final Conflict", the series rock-bottom hits with a weak fourth entry. At least Third film (attempted to continue Damian's story) while continuing the story of Damian, but it is only from the "Omen" (fearing "animals", the fear of the Antichrist, the death of a person in the first film photographer). But the exciting and creative look are just mute here. And the little girl just looks like a spoiled kid.
