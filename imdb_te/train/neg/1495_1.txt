Starting with Childs Play I'm looking at horror movies from the age of 5. Since then, I have seen a lot of horror movies and evils, but this is a dumba movie I have never seen! Actors were able to do this. The plot is just idiot. Plus, it's all gore. I can make too much blood stomach, but it's just ridiculous! In one scene, one character is stuck in the back of the character and squeezed with his intestines! Plain stupid! Another issue with this film is its boring and perhaps slow film. Its end is just dumb. But again, it goes the rest remaining! Finally, when the girl is away from the cannibal / ancestor, she receives help from an elderly woman. The old woman is preparing tea, but when she turns around to talk to the girl, the girl attacked her! She is a cannabiser! Depleted image.
