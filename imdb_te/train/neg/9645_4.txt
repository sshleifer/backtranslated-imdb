It's a bad season for Bollywood with all the big releases with a huge hype around the duds proof at the box office. London dreams are no exception. Let's disassemble it ... It's about chasing your dreams and how far you have to go to achieve. Nice but unfortunately not the movie. <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is a big musician. His dream was to make his name at Wembley Stadium before inspiring 90,000 spectators. He was joined by two brothers, Zoheeb & Waseem (Aditya Rai & RanaVijay) and a ravishing Priya (Asin). Together their dream band is made up of "London Dreams". After the record company chief was impressed, they became sensational overnight. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya, and should not be exposed until he achieves his goal. Arjun brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla Mak (Salman Khan), a carefree lender to join their band despite their intentions of life. Manu is a trained musician and has a real talent, then Arjun enhanced Manu's improved skills and jealousy for his affair with Priya. With the help of johab, Arjun is planning to sideline. <br /> <br /> When we come to technology, Vipul Amrailal Shah Shada is the only one we have liked in London. He just thought of the screenplay. It's small, to cut a glorified cameraman. Suresh Nair's screenplay also disappoints despite its movements. Defined in predictable fashion, the screenplay is tightly burdened you. Camera work is amazing in capturing London's beauties. <br /> <br /> Some songs are hummable when others charge a sound sound. Ajay steals programs with his negative character. Salman is unchanged and he is the one who kills you. Asin is memorable and I will play a big role in Bollywood. Aditya Roy was impressed, and Ranavijay is definitely okay. Brinda is bitch We've seen many movies. Continuing with OMP proceedings <br /> <br /> Finally, if it is simple and simplistic, London Dreams is the closest film you will be enjoying on DVD.
