In the first five minutes, everything happens to get to know about this film: it's great, it has a solid real soundtrack reflected in the late 60s and not all of its two characters. <br /> <br /> Davis's character is his beautiful girlfriend, who cares about him and ignores one of the few in his life. Then he takes her advice to join her in the real world - instead of living a fantasy movie of which he dreamed - he pushes next to her and then he adds an actress that is ideal beyond reason. <br /> <br /> The film is also interesting about the fall of Jason Schwartzmann from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, there is something to surpass Schwartzman's annoying Brightness, but here it is the unique quality of his character. Schwartzman's family ties were evident in this role; Here's hoping to improve his options.
