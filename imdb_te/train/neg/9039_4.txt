A great effort, I guess, but ultimately the poor one. Before seeing this film, I thought "Bartleby, the scrivener" was ineffective. After seeing it, I'll still do it. Unfortunately, I understand that only those who read the story are understandable, and they are upset with the film's unwanted versions (updating from New York to London from 1850 to 1970). Paul Schofield's excellent talent did not make me appreciate as Melville's metaphysical classics were well understood.
