Brook Shields is a fantasy and horror of any film that goes out of a Fonda. Shields is only bad, because she is younger, inexperienced, and clearly does not direct her co-star. Because Peter Fonda was wrong, well, because he was bad. Years later, I liked Ulee's Gold him, but on the Lord above, he was awful here. Not good for anyone. There is also a show (outside of Henry Fonda's exhilarating kami) which is also passable. I have never seen these very bad shows. In the case of Lucas Ask's main villain, it became clear due to poor speech and direction because it was doing good work in the past. But his partner, Ted Markland, was embarrassing ham. The writing is just bloody, and the actors can not be misled in the terrible things they say. But they say very bad! Editing and directing are worse than pedestrians. The shots can take a long time for any dramatic reason, or cut off off before the scene's effect is realized. The film was much worse than I expected and the two famous names were completely forgotten (and never could). A bright spot: Cinematography in the Grand Canyon is sensitive, and the beauty of the area is not very well done for big-screen Imax productions. Finally: The Wrong Release of Paper Moon, which is a loving pair of father-daughter types, or the bad version of Pretty Baby, a forty-something and a 13-year-old. It represents the next one than the former, and therefore pretty upset.
