Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of all 4 movies, where there are plenty of plot, bad acting, pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes. But. And it's not that big, a good actor, a good repetitive joke and a good start. A good actor Tim Curry, a good repetitive joke creepy, weird butler always with a handy disgusting hand, but loses valuable items. <br /> <br /> Scary Movie 2 Plots The main building from the original and the new roster along the route is invited to stay at night at a creepy old building, but they will survive the night? This image is great but you can even see if your bored!
