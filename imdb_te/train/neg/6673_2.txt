The video case was my first clue about how bad this was going when it was told from people who brought us a Blair Witch project compared to this piece of rubbish. The performance was similar to the skill and plot of Oklahoma's 6th grade product, speculative, boring and bizarre. 85% of the script are four letter words and countless variations. Mother F "writer" is a favorite because of continuous use. It should take all 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at the last call. Thanks to God I've rented it and can go much ahead of it. Do not waste your time or money.
