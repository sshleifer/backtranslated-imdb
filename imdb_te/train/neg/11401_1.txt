The script is odd enough to make a bit of attention to the weakest w / o characters or what happens to them. The script speaks a lot of the way and does not call it slow or slow to slow down the action. The story speaks of this very muted, tight conversation you do not listen to them so you get the point that everyone wants to shut up and die as quickly as possible. In technical note, the music mix makes the way to understand the high way and the most difficult times. Then again, it is called a blessing. Overall, the same story is better at a short film w / running at a 30-minute interval. Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead" were tangible in the clear "your face", they were more subtle, but here they seem to be bald. C'mon, is this kind of 35mm budget and is it best that this can be done? However, cinematography, lighting design and shots made very well.
