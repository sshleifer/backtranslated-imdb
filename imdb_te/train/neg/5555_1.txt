Normally, I like low budget gonzo images, but Darkman III is very hazardous, and I'm not defiant for it. <br /> It looks and feels like a TV show, and especially the grotesque one at that. The sets are low, lighting flat, scoring and effects diskged, and camera film 101. There is no plot to talk about, the characters are one dimensional and the actors are sleeping. Most cast to do soft core pornography ... In fact, the prize I received from this mess is that of Rockson Biggs-Dawson (Voyager from Star Trek) without the makeup of her Klingon uneven head. Her skin tone is two shades easier than Voyager; But she was blacked for this role or blackened for Voyager. Very strange way.
