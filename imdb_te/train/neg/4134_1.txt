I honestly have to say I can not stop watching this movie from the second that I started. How bad it is! It is very difficult to look at the most confusing paint powder. It is true that if you sit there and wait for something happening, it will actually make sense of the whole film! At the end of the film I would miss out on the first hour that I described everyday or at any time in the movie I accidentally deleted and the plot (if any) was actually together! The main thing that really confuses me about this film is that the main girl (in fact a major girl) is in a sort of alternative reality, what am I going to do this time? Suddenly she woke up, was in a psychiatric institution, physicians or some of the bed was hit, which was faster than I washed my wrist, it was back and she was eaten by some random vampire! This made sense of sodding! I'm emailing the manufacturers and searching to demand my time back, I mean watching this rubbish will waste 2 hours of my life! I'm so keen if the filmmakers know that they are all about reality! Just seemed edited out of all the bits that I could have made sense though I think it would have been 4 hours long to make that movie happen! I'm completely on the other side with other reviewers who have written other review, with the film I will sing it alone, and alone. I am grateful, I have not actually purchased the movie and have seen how many times in the local pound shop. You thought that the film gave me a full pile of film mache, but I thought you had given me Â£ 1 more money to spend on this film to be honest! No time sodding huge waste and a good razor blade, I mean i want to od'ed, less painful than watching this movie !!!!
