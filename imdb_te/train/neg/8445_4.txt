Every part of the art should be judged by these standards: form, function and meaning. Guernsey seems to be dedicated to forms: nice shots and sometimes interesting acting. The long close ups indicate a function that the viewer can fill up with himself. The story quizzes due to lack of lessons. An inner person suggests that he has a depth, but sometimes he has nothing to say. This film works as an internal person. If you do not read the summary, it's a suicide (and unanswered question?) Anna changes the view of life and you can not see her suspicious. 'Why do not you talk to me?' Sebastian asks. Anna does not answer, she is looking at him a long time without saying a word. What is the function of that shot? What does it mean? My question is like Sebastians: What does this picture say? What is this picture? Answer me: This is a glass of water that shows us with the interests of water. The story of their lives is simple and boring. The motives behind their actions are not shown. The rest is: skins, residences, landscapes. Nice and artistic tasks, but without 'references' for use without meaning. In my opinion, this film is not for fellow artists, not for ordinary viewers.
