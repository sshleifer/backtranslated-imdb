I can enjoy the flawless pleasure vulgar film, but it's just bad. And it's not bad that you enjoy watching MST3K its pleasure. You do not have anything to enjoy about how hard you try. I will waste 2 hours of life in this trash. No one was asked to act, and you know that everyone is buried only by their careers. Apparently "Walking Tall" has earned enough revenue that someone decided they could not make the buck off their investment. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, which wiped out the worst films from my memory.
