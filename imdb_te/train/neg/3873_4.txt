Alicia Silverstone (formerly "Clueless") plays a modern criminal-child young man trying to solve a local girl's brutal murder. Pat Burden wrote and directed this B-film, which did not make it particularly good but was surprisingly intense in its lead role. Silverstone is an interesting young girl here that is appealing and successful to portray, even though the film's kits have been reduced. The supporting cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not a bad thing, and the violence goes up in the final action. Not a cheesy camp-fest, but what is not remarkable remembrance. **** from * 1/2
