I did not think whether the "Malibu Express" would be able to repeat his success with the success of Andy Cedaris. With his film Fit to Kill, he proved that Cideris was not a filmmaker and a shot director. Cedaris's story unfairly accepted by the academy is a complex screenplay that includes many extraordinary twists and turns. The main characters compose the work for a sex based radio station known as KSXY. Cleverly, KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. In "Fit to Kill" they face their long-term neemesis, trying to steal one of Russia's most prized diamonds. Not all of a well-written screenplay is a wonderful performance by the cast, which helps to make this film a cult classic. Critically acclaimed by critics and box offices, the film will be appreciated in the coming years. This is the same as the Clockwork Orange and the Taxi Driver, but it is undoubtedly in the future. I was disappointed by any critics of Andy Cedaris's trademark filmmaking. Costumes, special effects, help to appreciate the beautiful part of the film before. You can do the best to ignore the tedious 3 ratings and go out for yourself and rent it. My personal rating is 10/10. The play blockbuster runaway is as thick as the Bride, and Action is the best movie action action action hero. Andy, keep up the good work.
