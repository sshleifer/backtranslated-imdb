If you are reading Wells and want to see how he is behind Citizen Kane, the movie proves. There is no need to make a self-confessed fake to explain how to fall into such a half-burned trail, eventually failing to explain the twists of absurd judicial theatrics and ludicrous stories. I took this film's high rating in DB; All I guess were very hard old Wells and there were die diehard fans there.
