I can not believe that this film is also made for video and those video rental shops are ready to keep in their shelves. I asked for subsidy. The film is not a historical truth, it is still a worst picture ever found in the video store. It's not good to be called a B rating rate. Do not waste your money or your time in this movie. Only voice list and terrible music made me sick. Anyone involved in the film should be removed from the union, giving the industry a black mark, but I do not think anyone really involved is a member of the union after seeing most of this movie.
