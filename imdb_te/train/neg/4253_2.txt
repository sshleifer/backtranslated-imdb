It is one of the worst of vampires who have emerged in males. How can I change such an enchanting story into a completely unpleasant story? It's not such a difficult task .. First of all, a dark and dark atmosphere with a good sexy touch without any sensation of vampirefilm, these things do not have all these things. Every time Dracula arrived, he was the only scene in the near end of the film (the weakest for the record, the weakest for the record: the weakest for the record) to the end of the film (Thalassi Danucings and his new success with Dracula). I really enjoyed the first one, Judas-Twist was obviously the original, but it's just not good, no way. Third of the Vampire-Signature I would like to be among the other classics, such as Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or the Face of the Face.
