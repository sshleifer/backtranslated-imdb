... at least in the first half. If it started three buddies in the Navy and focused on naval action scenes, it was a better and harder film. The second half of the film's value, especially the action sequences and 20th-century early ships, is the closing petrol. Also, do not watch this movie because Ginger Rogers is in it. <br /> <br /> The film works for three New York City buddies for tourism trade, and the film begins in a good-looking competition for Sally (Ginger Rogers). , A lyric candy vendor along the street. While World War I break up, the three buddies are totally different from this fight and can be reached anytime in the Navy. Three of the minimum industry (known as Bill Boytmour) is commanding officer for two others (Dutch and James Glesson as sketches Robert Amar Strong). To make things more complicated, Sally fell in love with one of the three, but went out three before the war. </ P> <p> On the ship cruise, mainly because we have the ship's own, and also because chemistry between three buddies is believable. However, at the age of 49, James Glesson looks a bit long in the boat, especially in the encyclopedia office, between 17 and 35. Everything outside the naval scenes was thought to have been killed with minimal care, it was not a dramatic shape or I could not say. Everybody wearing 1931 dresses in New York has 1931 cars - no attempt to bring the film. <br /> <br /> In the end, you can see some of the scenes with Ginger Rogers and Navy Suicide aimed at the last 45 minutes, you can see everything you can see here. The rest is padding.
