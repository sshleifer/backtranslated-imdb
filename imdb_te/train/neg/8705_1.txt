This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen ... It's bad that it's all about the time I'm looking for half the music starts and the dancing begins .. (I have a good plot with porno) When I'm trying to stay in the raptor door I'm throwing a plastic toy against 2 feet from the door think. I say it is very bad, so if you can see how good it is, you can not do anything compared to what you see. I do not recommend renting it on TV I understand what I mean for just 30min. I can not see more than 30min but if you sit through the whole thing then you have some very good will
