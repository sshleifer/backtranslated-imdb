It's kind of a lot of reviewers would like me to consider this a masterpiece. I am going to quality films, and I admit that the film is an award-worthy class, with the role of a technological shooter, as well as played by many roles in the characters. But in fact there is no place for it (for me). I mean, taking the viewer anywhere. It's a range of mood scenes, it's probably great, but I want more from the movie. For story and motion, and I'm looking for a future fulfillment, I can not find anything in this movie. Yes, this poetry can be considered in the picture. . . But most poetry I can not live with the same reason: painting pictures without you. </ p> <p> A century old English childhood is essentially limited to its universality. I was personally scared when a young British boy was living at that time and place. I can officially say that in just a decade America has grown and contradicted. I think there is some influence on what this review of the film has done. In other words, can the film be completely judgmental in its 'movie magic' (and I recognize) and can completely ignore it with regard to the nature of the experience that someone else has brought to mind?
