Ahicic comedy-drama, a happy, seemingly rushful affair, as a housewife with a worst housewife, is slowly making friends with her husband who hired her to kill her. Chazz Pammini has adopted the screenplay from his own play as a tactical rental gun, quickly twists the eye and ear with constant set-ups and back-and-back conversations. Dark air is hanging over the entire project, and director Paul Mazzurki can not get Cher from his permanent funk (she is blindly). The best talent (including one of the producers, Robert De Niro), "faithful" is fraudulent, rarely lived without any substance for the story and the characters. **** from * 1/2
