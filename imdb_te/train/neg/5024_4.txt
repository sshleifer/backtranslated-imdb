There is not much to say about this. Gumera type of fire breathing turtle. He breaks through a nuclear explosion. He heads the earth and begins to destroy the building and tanks and other waste (Oh, the power lines I almost forgot). At one point, at the beginning of the film, he is making friends with a little kid, instead throwing him away or hitting him, he falls on the floor. Safe. Since then we have to face this chubby little twerp show and run away, show up and run away, show and run away. For some reasons, this kid can be heard from a distance of 20,000 feet. Oh, well, the plot Gammera is to get to the place where he put on board a rocket and shot into space. As always, the monster is deteriorating and unexpected (a guy in a gamer suit). Japanese Army (with the help of the Americans) uses ammunition and fire power to solve national debt, and this is not good. They should know this matter anyway. In Tokyo we saw a lot of stamp monsters. They are not fun to come down because they are fun, but this is not good.
