I'm not a big fan of horror films and I have seen only some of them (and "Halloween" or "Friday thirteen") but I can congratulate the horror film scary, rather than Gore. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about the small plastic skull that comes out everywhere? The shawls shots set up for its performances, so there is no surprise in the film. <br /> <br /> The plot is married to Claus von BÃ¼low's third cousin (John Hudson), Donna-Read's Look-A. (Peggy Weber, gave one of the worst performances) who saw the skulls and began to hear the secret shouts of a group of pyramids in her husband's building. Did I say that my husband lost his first wife in mysterious sinking incident? Ooooh !!!! <br /> <br /> This is the old plots when this is a great boy killing and / or trying to run their wife frankly. If you want to see the full version of these items, try "Fortune Riversal". And BTW, Jeremy Irons is a hundred times more talented than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> MSTing is ok but nothing special; <br /> <br /> "The Screaming Skull" is two stars; <br /> Now, Mr. Van Boo himself says: "How bad is this movie?" "You do not know!"
