This is, without a doubt, a very risky "chick flick" I've seen over the years, if ever. This is because the writing & the characters are humorous in the film. Before going out for an hour and five minutes in the disaster, we were subject to the following themes: Your baby will solve all your problems, "Actual Types" Painful doubts & musicians should not be good mothers and they want their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What a talented cast is a waste & some great-looking sets & costumes. If Natasha Richardson spent more mainstream life with Tony Colelt, she was unhappy - "lonely!", I thought it was quasi. I believe this movie is theatrical release. This is a farewell way from the "women's" cable channels I always pass by channel surfing. I am female and 35 years old, so I have to be part of the target audience of this film, but the boy, "evening" makes its goal miss.
