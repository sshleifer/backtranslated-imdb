Wow-this one sucks. I'll finish it as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No group is taking place for a long time. Some lame and un-erotic soft-core sex scenes occur. <br /> <br /> The two girls cut their heads. And some brief nudie shots. And believe me - it's not enough to redeem 90 minutes of the film. The fact-the best part is tacked initially from the distributor having some slutty Goth chicks covered with blood and their tits- and again-this is certainly not worth the entry price for this rubbish. As everyone knows - the title of the film is totally nonsense - because there is absolutely no bleeding, or no dancing in the film. It is also called 'Got-Ryper Circle-Jerk Leeds'-and at least it has a better title that does not have a film. The exact title was '90 Minutes of Torture' - another impressive title, which is at least honest ... for the viewer. I honestly show all the best parts of the trailer in the disc (and I say the word 'best' too loose) ... I suggest most of you looking at that instead of you yet interesting. I can not imagine anyone liking this movie's interest, please take my advice and leave it on this shelf. 2/10
