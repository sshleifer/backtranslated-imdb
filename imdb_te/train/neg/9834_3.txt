One of the high literacy loan stars is characterized by character development and interaction, dialogue and acting business. The opening scene was a gambler, Kansas Charlie (Eddie Chandler) and his girlfriend, John Scott (John Wayne) as the venue for the rodeo (Row Row-de-Oh) stars. The film follows their adventures, who try to make each other better in the Mexican Juventa pursuit, and later in their efforts of the inevitable evil brother Perkie Mary Cornman (he is a real villain, and wants to repent). And oh, actually, they are falsely accused of two crimes and will be imprisoned before the escape and are expelled at the end. <br /> <br /> Scott constantly and intentionally marries her grocery store, and strikes her standing ladder, so he can hold her and catch her and catch her. It looks synonymous for all 30s Western, but it's actually better than that. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are not many exciting activities that we have found in many other Lone Stars. Not Yokima Canon. Cheap and bad uses of stock footage of the fallen riders on horses. No George Hays. A bumpy stooge-like twin-play between Scott and Charlie, Scott at Scott, Scott, cutting his foot and punching him (repeat twice again!). A talented Paul Fix is ​​used. Eddy Chandler is not really believable as his big star turn here, kick a Randy side. The villain looks very old and fat. So Chandler spent one of the 300 movies he spent in his next career as a worthless meat lounge. Mary Cornman of Twentieth "Our Gang" (see 'Mary, Toys Queen' in 1925) is beautiful in her scenes with John Wayne, but it's about it. Here the seeds of Western lying are buried here. <br /> <br /> Ultra-small colorized version, it's great, it moves very fast, it will end when you glow more than once. Thankfully, Eddie Chandler had cut scenes with difficulties.
