A shameful scientist girlfriend decapitates and brings her back to her head. This is a cinematic plot. By the town's sleaze area for the perfect body he will try to get her another body. For some reason he had a ugly looking monster in the room at his cabin. The sleaze style of the film is ridiculous. No one in the movie can actually work with the head. The room monster is a man with a mask and you really tell. The plot is slow, weak, and the end is so bad. See the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this action. I did not own this folktini.
