My score for this trash is 1/10 for 1 technology only. Everything else is very bad. <br /> <br /> Another picture that no one ever understood. Apparently it seems that creating a good script for movie or television is almost an impossible mission. <br /> <br /> Even if politicians find it difficult to understand why they do not tell the truth, they are in the biggest slander on this planet and it is hard to understand how exciting the movies are. <br /> <br /> "Perhaps it is because 99% of the films are worst because they are stupid and funny and very bad scenes. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It ' t to the super fast forward button (at least 20X).
