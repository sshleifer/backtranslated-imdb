I read every book on the left side of the series, the film does not do anything for them. Sure, I've seen movies badly, but this is very frustrating. The film has a good MST3K episode. The script was a terrible adaptation of the book, and the actors thought they had read their sentences, instead they actually said it. The characters are tight and unlikeable. The effects looked cheesy, and terribly fake. The end is awful. First, it did not even go in the first book. Second, it does not make sense. If you read the book, you do not know what's going on. It was a lot of film, and I had never seen a movie student in the movie. I actually worried that money paid for this movie. By some miracle, this has received a wider release, they must completely change it and take over Hollywood. The two film producers, and Vanbebi's director, should make a film for professionals.
