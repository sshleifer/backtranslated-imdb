On Friday night SF Frameline warned the audience at the Film Festival, we are going to see a "experimental" film. Experimental? Leave the video camera on the back of the car, edit the tape roll and eye-sight in all the nonsense frame. Somewhere starts and a sharp bird road showman who takes the viewers to the place. The unwanted violence that opens the film has led more than one patrons from the Castro Theater. I also gave up, but my cinematographer needs a ride home and this is a matter of worrying for the last time. By the time the lights came and the audience was significantly reduced. Teapid applause. The Pro Form of questions that looked happy with the product. Avoid this picture!
