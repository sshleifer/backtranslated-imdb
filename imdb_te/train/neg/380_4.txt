I am surprised if the film is half-hearted. Its big joke. Good .. its entertaining .. You have to look at the plot of the movie which is very foolish. Audience group is mainly aimed at this film. <br /> <br />) A surrogate mother plays for Salman / Queen, but the boy is not wanted. <br /> <br /> I am surprised if this play takes a real couple from real life in real life. <br /> <br /> The Queen looks happy with another beautiful woman in her house, Salman for her. She takes care of Priet and her husband tries to bring her to love, so they may have some love. <br /> <br /> When are the viewers of Salman's Nakhra's audience aired by the audience. <br /> <br /> Last time, this film can not afford. Absurd.
