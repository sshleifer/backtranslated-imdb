There is a problem with the film, which makes it look like a low-budget class project from one of the film school. I have to give it credit on its campiness though. I've laughed many times throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Do you look for a low-quality slasher film with a dash of mental horror twists and campie mocking? , Then pop the bowl of popcorn, invite some friends and have some fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments that the sound is too bad. The soundtrack is just kind of after the dialog is impossible to follow too much time.
