In this promotional film I will probably give it 6 or 7 because it shows how and when the promotional film is successful. If the people who see this piece and think that they "have done some sort of Jewish treatment in WW2," then there are false observations on how people will live in the face of the movie 'why and how' to correctly mix. What can a campaign image do? An American film about the Rothschild family is included, for example, where it is used more actively. The question does not always ask why the Jew keeps away his wealth from the officer. <br /> <br /> The excitement level (or, boredom) in this movie is slowly rising and musts of the movie-fixing solution-end goal and publicity. <br /> <br /> The film has a simplicity to describe the most emotional idea of ​​the audience. The film has a history today, so there is no need for more hype about it. However, in the simplicity of the racist terms, careful observation can relate to the problems of today's cultural hatred, violence, determination and consolidation. Overall, fine garbage.
