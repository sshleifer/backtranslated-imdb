I saw his film at the Arbor Film Festival. I am a film student at the University of Michigan so I know one thing about either movie or two. And the film of Crispin Glover is outrageous. He was basically emotionally challenged. Shirley Temple is not the only opposition (it is a little fun), claiming to be mentally challenged to kill everyone, but there is an invasion of killing snails. Crispin falls in love with one of his actors, all of them mentally challenged. PETA and human rights should be on this issue. Crispin is not a 'robbery-culture' as mentioned on an annual film festival, which exploits.
