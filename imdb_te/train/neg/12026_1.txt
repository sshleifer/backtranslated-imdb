When I was doing comedy, people tried to make it funny. This is a movie you're sitting on, but nothing about it is unique. After seeing it, you say it's late. It's not boring to see, but no jokes to laugh at the audience. Entertainment is actually yours Story. The film wants to be "Tootees", but instead it fails. <br /> <br /> I've given you 10 out of 1.
