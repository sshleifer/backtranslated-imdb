"Santa Claus Conkers The Martians" is generally regarded as one of the worst films ever since 1959, like the Mexican-made film "SCCM", "It's a fantastic life". You wonder what people are doing this movie. Perhaps they were considered a third-world allegation of capitalist greed and apparent use. Nah. . . They were not good enough. The same production company made a more disturbing version of the "Little Red Riding Hood", in which there are clear signs of pedophilia with the wolf's invasion with our heroine. (Maybe it's inspiration for "Freeway.") Back to "Santa Claus": Instead of North Pole, Jolly lives in Geosyncronos Earth orbit in Old St. Nicholas satellite (shades of "MST3K"); Instead, his toys of elves are made from children all over the world; And he has spy devices just checked who are naughty and cool for kids. The result is an Orwellian outdoor space sweep shop. It's never forever Christmas. These and other low rented Mexican Children 's pictures were dubbed in English and the U.S. was widespread in the early 1960s Distributed; Sixty years of American history became such a turmoil. All of the children are very eager to turn the revolutionary baby boomers forced to endure these "family" films.
