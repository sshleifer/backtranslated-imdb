Tom Wolf's extensive, brilliantly satirical novel novel life in New York Snowball has a glossy look here, but it does not work well. The film does not suffice from Tom Hanks' s faulty gas, like Yuppie, Kevi-doll Melanie Griffith as a manifestive South Belle and Bruce Willis as New York's lyrics darling. The director's chair is the most dangerous. Robert Altman may be eager for these extraordinary characters and make them interesting, but Brian de Palma, his visual appearance is never visible to the glimpses of the short period of human experiences. The resulting movie is good, but the block is the subject of dysplasia. Honestly, if a sarcasm is not angry with the viewer, what is it?
