Psychology of a scenery "Terminator Woman" is beautiful: Karen Sheppard and another woman trying to escape the villain's camp. While Karen is going to his armed forces, she sees her gun, but after a few seconds it throws up and challenges her in the fight. Karen has knocked him off the balls, holding the gun and flees! Again, you know that when a film is directed by martial artist and another member of his family is written / produced, you do not have to worry too much. Karen Sherper and Jerry Trimble are some of the fun entertaining at the beginning, and the film becomes much better if it focuses more on their love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes they break up, and the film slows down to a crawl and does not even have curiosity with occasional fighting scenes. The finale battles with Quiz in a cave and Sheppade goes on a beautiful boat with Ashley Hayden as woman-woman, but fights break their flow and reduce their value. Karen has a splendid climax to give the opportunity to show an amazing cleize across the film! (* 1/2)
