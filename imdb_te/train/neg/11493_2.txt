<br /> <br /> The action is incongruous and the historical background is largely nonsensical: just two examples: Visby has been shown to house three villages. Instead, it was a major city at this time, the best days passed. Secondly, Hamburg does not take the pirate town in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg has no access to the Baltic Sea, at that time the main town of LÃ¼beck. <br /> The worst of all: The Direction! What kind of a dude like this person could allow this film to be directed? Impossible! <br /> <br /> There is no believable sighting, battles are fraudulent and I can not suppress the smile at very solid sightings. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how much of a big television station is ineffective.
