This image is original, I think. It's really sad, because at a deep level, the original name is 'Vanishing Point' original, so contradictory. It was not intended, but was originally filmed in the 1970s, and was released in 1971. REAL 'VANISHING POINT' is the end of an era that ended in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this reorganization, all cultural topics have been eliminated and more PCs are attempting to reach a wider audience. <br /> <br /> The insertion of American Indian scenes was unsatisfactory, and the idea of ​​a 'noble benefit' for the tour was additionally removed. Even though I'm glad to see it, it's more real to me. Original Cult Classic and Golden. This remake is terrible.
