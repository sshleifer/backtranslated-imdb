In fact a couple who are adopted by this second child is about a couple. At the adoptive agency they meet a mouse (Stuart) and they decide to adopt him. <br /> Stuart arrives at his new home where he treats human beings. (Rest me!) Is a normal cliché for everyone else, family problems, jealousy from the big "brother", and finally all the problems are solved and they all have a "happy family". <br /> <br /> The film is boring and worn, which is shown in a very blunt and countless way. <br /> <br /> Director, if he thought he was creative by introducing a mouse in the cliché, or he was trying to fill in minutes, but he upgraded Clevely to hating it from boring. <br /> <br /> Why did I give a 3 and just one zero? Stuart is due to a family cat who loved him as "brother". Stuart has some funny platforms that use his small size. <br /> <br /> All in all, I believe this film works well: a. Stuart is not a PET and a "sibling". B. It kept funny platforms such as trying to hit Stuart Cat and left the boring clocks, which did not match any more.
