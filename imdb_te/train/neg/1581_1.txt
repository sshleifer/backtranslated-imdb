It's 75 minutes in my life. Acting is worse and the plot is ridiculous. Rich married men revolve around the bad lesbians who have sexual relations with her, and then blackmail them for money. One of the victims is the candidate for the DA, which causes problems in his relationship with his wife. Another plastic surgeon, even married, and bad lesbian is going to come with this boys wife too! Meanwhile, the bad lesbian's girlfriend does not really like her around sleeping. It ends with a happy ending. Women are more naked, more likely to develop reality. Bad bad bad.
