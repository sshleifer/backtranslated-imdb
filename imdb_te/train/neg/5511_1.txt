I agree with the very first comment: this movie is very difficult. Despite the much larger B-list cast, the cover of the film (perhaps the film is ever available, which is not just a weekly exposure for those who have not seen in the Comedy Central) is trying to put a blame on Dangerfield, but is actually a cash payment for every single 80s-to-everyone everyday. Randy Quaid? Check. Ed Begley, Jr.? Check. Lisa Simpson's voice? She can now say that Maximum Overdrive is not her only terrible film: double check. <br /> <br /> The sad thing about this film is that it is written with jokes already mentioned. Outside of its existence nothing about this film is not funny. It is best to look at the paint powder. This is definitely a straight-to-video-scrapping-bottom-of-the-barrel stuff believing in an old video instrument: throw the old time star on the cover and you'll get some money back off the rent. Considering the video rental days, the last examples of removing the garbage will be considered. <br /> If you fall asleep, this image will only be used. It will get you there.
