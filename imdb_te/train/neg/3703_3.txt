I did not expect much from this film, but boy-boy, I did not expect this movie to be bad. Chris Rock does not have a good work here, I can not imagine his role as true, if the play or romantic scenes have a bit of the film, I think it's a bit better. It's like making a bad hangover for filmmakers. In "Making" they do not show a smile. This is a bad movie too! I gave up three of the ten because some smiles gave me, but I never laugh!
