I'm never for classic movies. I like Patton, Going My Way, How Green My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Citizen Kane. Nevertheless, I've never seen any of these movies 3,469 times, and in Paris I've seen an American ever in a very luxurious suite. <br /> If I do the last thing, I'll probably sleep all the time. <br /> <br /> Color art direction and music are not of interest to me, Gershwin or Gershwin. Dancing and singing sleeping could help with an insomnia fall. This conversation does not match Singh in the rain. In fact, this film is boring. Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid is the only film I sleep in. But you can not blame me. <br /> 1 star / 10 (zeros we can not give zeroes.)
