Worse honestly ... I love watching severed. <br /> The story / filming / acting / everything. This is a riot to watch the film. <br /> <br /> "It does not really matter, it has somebody who is bald. <br /> <br /> And having a sword <br /> <br /> He has a supernatural twist ... nobody can see him. <br /> <br / > ". <br /> <br /> It breaks off as it is filmed in the video. <br /> <br /> In another home camcorder was shot. <br /> <br /> <br /> The lighting (very thin knowledge) and the knowledge of composition <br /> <br /> Some scenes actually exist together. <br /> <br /> When you leave the pumpkin on the next visit <br /> <br /> Let's go and rent this movie. Supported films like this- they hoot and <br /> <br /> Haller!
