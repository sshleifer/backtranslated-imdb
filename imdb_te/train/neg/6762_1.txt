Everything about this is difficult. The plot that moves with no point except with poor direction, top acting and violence. When I first saw it, it was a satire of the media, but it is not how it shows violence. I'm not sure what the image is getting worse. Oliver's stone is always directed by his worst. From the scenes for the horrific performance of Woody Harrelson's face morals or Robert Downey Joni as a journalist who has been thoroughly bannered, the film is just crazy.
