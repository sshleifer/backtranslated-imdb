I really wanted to like this movie. It's a good jail arrangement, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, an absolutely hideous 80-touch and a bad guy (you guessed) bad actor John Saxon, a directive effort. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. But the direction is very engraved and there is no nightmare / frightening moment. This will only be and will continue on and then (logically) must end. There was more suspense and more chivalrous visuals and seal its fate as a cult classic.
