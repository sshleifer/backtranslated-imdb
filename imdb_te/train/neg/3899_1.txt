Where did I start? I guess I was a bit loyal to the title of the film, and in the end I left. This is not the story of Liley Anderson or the song Lily Marley, it's the story of Hollywood (or your movie making hub) that actually depends on some real life characters. When I heard a huge English voice giving the film intro in German I must have a clue; The blood red text (title, artists) should be 2 clues. Lille was not cheated by Rolfe LeBerman's parents, Germany had no information that Liberman had infringed by the Jews, while the original song was not under the control of the NS regime, while on a lieutenant vacation in Vienna while on the station, but not on the station), the clothes were not bad for the poor and time frames (SS black uniforms border guards From the Bbandi locations were used, after the war, such as daily use, etc.), letters stereo types (SA once they must be from the bullies in a club). Do not waste your time.
