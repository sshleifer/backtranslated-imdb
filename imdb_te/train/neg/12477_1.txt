This is one of the movies you and some friends drinking beer, eating pizza, and laughing at. Unfortunately, I found myself alone. My friends and I never rented a big block of movies and came around seeing this one. It came back and I figured that I would not see it was a waste. <br /> Now, I love a lot of bad images, if not "hero", I probably would like it. So totally unpleasant. I put that stupid knife and hoped that someone could kill him! In this movie he is doing very little heroic things. He is a dull, frustrating, stupid thing. He has fewer redemptions than villains. And what are all naked chicks? Well, anyway, if you love bad movies and a frustrating "stand for the leader, however, the movie went on a tad in the movie." Then I like the song of the movie's favorite.
