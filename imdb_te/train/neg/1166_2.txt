I have high hopes for Alive when seen in the past Versus. The description of the image behind the DVD jacket is guaranteed. Alive did not deliver. Very slow development. Potential loads with cast and cool visuals. The premise is secret but does not build the payment. It may have done so much in the end. The film is very "sitting around". To keep it clear, we sit three of us and amped to watch this film and we are struggling to thrive until the end by 50 minutes. It really needed more shock elements. If you're looking for killer or versus type fights then you yourself have some $ and disappointing loads.
