This really should be a star, but most of the clues, predictable turns, which actually made me laugh at it all actually saw it all before the slasher image parallels to give it an extra star ... it's always free Can not write, they are sensational or really bad in this regard. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I know Jeff Faye that I know that it is poor because I have a special nose to remove the worst films. By the way, maybe MR T's for the hilarious voice, (not relay Mr. T., but I'll do what I mean if you're bothering to see this), if you watch, make sure you do not pay to watch. This might have been the work they put in the intended comedy, but I'm sure you'll see odd laughter here and there at the farce of all ...
