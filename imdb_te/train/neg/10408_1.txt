If the fassbinder made an even worse picture, I definitely do not want to see it! Anyone complaining that his movies are too talky and claustrophobia must be forced to view it, and learn to appreciate his more unique style in the striking films such as "The Bitter Tears of Petra Van Kant". The film is daring, with partial-symbolic images, which appears to be a parody of "Art-Film". Elvira's prostitute's channel surfers are just two of the most vague examples of what makes the real test of endurance of the scene of the slaughterhouse and ten minutes scene. But I'm really angry about some of the scenes featuring Elvis and her ex-wife and / or her daughter. These are the only moments that show any real human emotions, and in the main part of this horrific film, there is a well-to-do fighting film independently. No waste.
