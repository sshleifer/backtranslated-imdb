Welcome to Movie 17 on the cool classic 50 pack. Where we look, that's right. Make sure no sense is another image. Seriously, the film finally made me confused and I thought I would be back at "Don at sleep". The plot is simple enough .... well a girl supposedly killed a cat and then up to 3 seconds into the image ... Um .. explosion? I do not know what happened. And it's in front of TITLE screen. It's really sad when I can not say what happened in the first 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> Anything that's a big goat that you found this girl after dumping his girlfriend on the way to photograph it. So we go there, but someone stole their jeep before being driven to a town 200 miles [200 km] away. Suspicious? nah. So they decide to stay in this desolate village with an elderly woman. And blah blah stuff happens and blah blah talking. The guy with the mustache gets out of fog for some reasons, even though there is no previous reason. <br /> <br /> Oh, I think this is a buggy eye guy Casablanca after 20 minutes after a fantastic nonsense. Then they will leave. There is no point for this scene. It's really just padding. No one has noticed or cared if you cut it down. <br /> <br /> But sadly the best part of that movie. Wait. Let me repeat it again. The best part of that movie is really sad. Because the rest of the mess is to see IMDb to find out what happened. But I'm SOL so no one knows of course. <br /> <br /> Severely, the last 30 minutes in the film are the most appealing moments I have ever seen in the film. They wear, he kidnaps, releases, returns home, and finally witches are at home and ends it? Seriously. I am rarely ever confused in the film. I mean, if the movies like "War of Robots" are bad, at least they make sense. This image does not make ATTEMPT consistent. The conclusion is as confusing as the end of the "end of the end" and the plot is more boring. The film just got a ness for "I do not know what happened in this movie". "Witch Mountain" gets 1 shocking filmmaker in 10 people.
