My children can see on a daily basis. This is a great program for young children. But they should stop re-playing the show and make more realistic performances and get rid of Rooney and Daddy's Elite Teams. Dudel Bop and the kids do not see these things with clean white perlli teeth and do they ever brush their teeth 2? The show always goes to the United States and where we can find its schedule. And another thing is if we can add it. Mo need you to stop hiding too much. Sometimes when you move out of the shore where you can scare the little kids and pull the rope? What does it mean? The other then get wet all the time. They need to add new things for their performance instead of the same Ole. Kids can be loose interest.
