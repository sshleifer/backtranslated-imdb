I'll tell you if there are comments posted by other commentators, this film is currently available on DVD. <br /> <br /> It is worth a DVD label and I paid a plus tax on 98 cents for it. I found a 98 percent store between plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. Now do you have people who shelled Beau Rebellion Bucks for feeling super-duper Swedish import limited edition version like ??? <br /> <br /> This film is really worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I'll start arguing with you. But apparently the value is 98 cents. And remember what you say about getting what you pay. Slasher image is for mavens only.
