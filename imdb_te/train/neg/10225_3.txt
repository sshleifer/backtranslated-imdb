<br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to apologize or unjust in the film and apologize for the fact that I hate this film. <br /> It also provides. I do not like this movie. To be more specific, I did not like this movie. Cinematography is good. The mood is good. <br /> <br /> The story is fraudulent, misleading, misleading and misleading. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> First of all he is a black man. And this is not a racist comment, I swear. White, Hispanic or Native American idea moving around everything that reflects the canana in Cana√±a. Catana refers to the spirit of a samurai, filling with the spirits of his ancestors, guiding and protecting the samurai. The Ghost Dog is also a disgrace for the blade and the souls to use his pistols instead of the catheter, and what heck does he receive? <br /> Also, Ghost Dog has no respect. At the end of the film, he shot a bodyguard by a window and killed a man by shooting him in the face by a faucet. This cowardly path is not the only way to kill the opponent, it is like a ninja path; Silent murderers; <br /> When he tries to kill his boss, he finds his owner bad. Do you know what the real samurai is doing when he realizes that his employer is wrong or disrespectful? <br /> <br /> He wants to kill himself to prove that he will die, to prove himself to his dogs master level. <br /> <br /> All the protagonists are a big contradiction to the true code that is bound to Bushda. <br /> <br /> So we have great cinematography, good weather, and very acting compilation plot and campus (which is unfortunately not the most important), which is an unsatisfactory whole movie and a respectable Bushi (samurai). <br /> <br /> <br
