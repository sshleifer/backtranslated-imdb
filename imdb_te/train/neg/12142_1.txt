Please do not look for God's love. Now tell me, I know what you're thinking, is not it bad? I should see if everyone says bad things! Do not do it! It'll be like watching a horrible accident involving little kids and a gasoline tanker! You'll be scarred for life ... the film will never leave you! I see only this half an hour before I am violently ill. Acting is the worst I have seen so far, and I've seen Barwari !!! If you risk threatening your eyes and rent this movie ... do not say I did not warn you! Cover and storyline a trap !! Zombies? The irony? Shaun of the Dead is great! This image should be the same ... right? NO !! Writing = Worst Direction = Worst Acting = Not Acting Not yet convinced? Then your soul will suffer forever !!!
