<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoenen finally bombed these attacks. He became a joke on his own. <br /> Once again, we have movies featuring lectures between sex and violence, immorality, women's edges and characters and hanging pans. There is no action in this movie. It fudges all set pieces. All actors give presentations the type Verhoeven film arrangement. In words other than acting at almost every level. It was a macho world because the Stars Troopers came out of it because the characters lived. These scientists are acting as well. Sorry Paul but the Soldiers and the scientist did not really make the same impression. <br /> <br /> One major flaw in the plot is the laboratory where we have already spent most of the time watching and talking to this animated mannix (excluding Elizabeth Shue) to Kevin Bacons's role in science for doing bad things. This role in the outside world is not known what can be done. How can they track him if anywhere else ??? Imagine both in terms of all the different things, story and classification that can be accomplished with this concept. <br /> <br /> Let's see what this film is doing and look at how seriously the whole project is and what really shakes the whole. <br /> <br /> Everyone is saying that everyone is a type of Verhoeven Mad Genius and Daco is more insulting on the DVD that everyone claims. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is nothing in the picture. As the title says. <br /> Halo!
