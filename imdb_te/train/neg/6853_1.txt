Another garbage grade Z Seissy from fruitful Albert Pine. From Thom Thomson's 13-inch outpost, the police like Clint Eastwood takes an ugly flying head (!) To land and a gang battle in the South Bronx! 50Ft Mercifully small, but deadeningly dull, with cheeseiest effects from women's attack. They also dropped the sequel: Notice how Thomson's sunglasses appear in every second shot and how it looks again. Profitable bad, but why we do these movies, is not it? Sequel 'DOLMAN Vs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
