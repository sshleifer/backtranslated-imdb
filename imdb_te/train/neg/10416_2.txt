Before watching this film, I told him that I love everything Katie Bethes. Now it's everything-minus one. James Woods is repentant ... His role is not his performance. Anyone who says "poor" can not be dirty, or ignorant, or clich√©. Dito for the generalization of Randy Quaid. Single ransom feature Henry Thomas is not a strong actor to catch this sundered mess. If you enjoy the country, you will enjoy the scene. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of the independent and quirky films, but it's just terrible.
