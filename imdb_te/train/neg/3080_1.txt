Hee Hee Hee. The film is very bad, and it does not even try to hide the big time. I remember the day I first saw in MST. The sun shone, looked like a good day. Then, I saw this product of Rick Sloane, which contains horrible expensive dolls in the ruthless 80s festive land. Kevin, wussy unusual, tries to impress his girlfriend, assisted security guard job, fights with rockets, and manages these more badly plenty stuff in the series. No plot or story is required. Clearly, no action is required. An army guy and his sexy crazed girl will tell you the dorky friend you jump on a cliff, and the phone sex gets his kicks, "he has got some nice red shorts". Plus, I really hated the old security guard and wanted to have an accident on his super cart kart. As it turned out, wait for the club to smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, I advise you to have a good month to recover the senses and sanity. And if you look at Rick Sloane, give a good kick to the groin to show how much you appreciate this creptry called the hugobblins.
