Andrews, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this very moment, and I'm afraid of this movie. Quote from my Chinese Girlfriend, laughing: "They're all doing this for a man!" <br /> <br /> I recognize that there is no understanding of the struggle between these women and the lack of intolerance and tragedy. <br /> <br /> Japanese people have more intensity than the Chinese people, and Geisha is Japanese culture. <br /> <br /> Any conversation is very inappropriate, so American. One European with European orientals, they work very well. <br /> I would like to add: Many Americans who liked the film. Sorry, but no wonder. All written for you, not natural, no excitement. I'm fine with Chinese actresses, but I can not say they are good actors in this film. Yes, cinematography is great, but I can not really see these characters as complicated, deep people. <br /> <br /> I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure it would be wonderful to see.
