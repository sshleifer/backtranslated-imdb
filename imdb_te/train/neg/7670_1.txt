Where did I start my story? <br /> <br /> In this film, I went to the movie for the night, and some friends did not know much more than the actings in it, and it was a horror film. <br /> <br /> I discovered in the first 20 minutes, when I saw the film, I made no mistake. Plot is the worst, and the script. <br /> <br /> These lines were terrifying when people in the audience suddenly smiled. <br /> The cast is not much plastic. Some scenes seem to have been made very fast ... they are just like the ones for special reasons. Very poor editing. <br /> <br /> The big waste of time and money in this film. Boo.
