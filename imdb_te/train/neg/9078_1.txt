If another teen movie does not actually end up stupid, meaningless, do you get more sex than teen movies? In the perfect world, yes. But it is very bad. It is not insulting the stars, it is a disgrace to the distributor. All of the jokes are basically exposed to the topics that college students have probably had any interest in seeing, yet it's "funny." Devon Sawah, the best in the final destination, is plain disappointment in the film. It makes you wonder if it is deliberately bad. Grade: F
