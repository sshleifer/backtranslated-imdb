Until this new season, I'm a big 'little mosque' fan. <br /> <br /> The new Christian Vicar devastated the whole intention. It is always about living together to overcome bias. <br /> <br /> I am not a Christian or a Muslim, I am looking at the show and seeing a comrade between Amar and Reverend. <br /> <br /> You have to cancel this and complete it. <br /> It may still be safe, but you have to make a lot of change. <br /> Get back to the old look.
