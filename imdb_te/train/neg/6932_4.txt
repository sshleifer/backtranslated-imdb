I waited a long time to see DR Tarar's Torrer Dungeon and after I saw it, I was really disappointed. It's not the Baroque film I expected. The trailer is much better than the whole picture (I saw in a somethin wired DVD), which is remarkably memorable. There is almost no way to stand out scenes and look and feel is interesting, but does not come close to other Baroque style films from Felly or Gorozsky. <br /> <br /> The characters were frustrating and almost nothing dramatically happened despite rape, crucifixion, and insanity. <br /> <br /> The main problem with DR Thor's Torrer Dunzone is that it's a talk- more than anything. It is almost like looking at a book. <br /> <br /> We want to have silence or mood or any moments. Instead, listen to / listen to the main characters we are disappointed. <br /> <br /> There is a missing opportunity.
