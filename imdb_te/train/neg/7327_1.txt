Heavy hand morality. Journalists use them as moudes to talk to themselves. Speculative, planting plot (five times faster). Children's simulation of Britney Spears. <br /> The truth is that Jesus Nebott and Julia Montezo confirmed that the idea of ​​an emotional and emotional film was to create a thoughtful, emotional film, not always black and white, that the criminals by definition are not necessarily bad man, and situations can be forgiven, especially a child's well-being when focusing. Nevertheless, their morale shifted to the foregoing dialogue and the tate situations. Interesting use of good product values ​​and documentary-style camera footage is not enough to achieve their goal when the script and acting are down. <br /> <br /> The logic is often compromised to create excitement: instead of trying to escape in the pub, she attempts to take part in the documentary, but not the mainstream in the same breath, because she did not help them out of phobia. Well, duh. Pablo is filled with a very subtle tension to the person running. Christina's well-being is more important for him as he flew to capture and jail or fleeing, but she is willing to risk everything to appease her if she does not want to go to Mexico. Right. Talk on over-permissive parenting. Third, when the owner of the publisher Charlie Detective gave the phone to Bright, she was not very unusual, especially her seniority - did she really feel convinced? Oh, yes, I would have turned in. CCH Pounder's detective Wims could wipe her floor. <br /> <br /> To be more fun, I would like to list things that I like. Um, I liked the midget. And I liked the name of Midget Sexy. Cross-dressing, always plus; Infant cross dressing, less! Harry is infinite than Christina. But my favorite moment should be when Christa detective is not shot-not-bright. I am interesting that the black role is racist in a heavily minority cast (by way of thanks, by way of it). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Every time the main character is in pain, his performance seems to be insufficient: 'If you are not sure, he will be upset, and we have musical instructions to verify it. kind. " <br /> The unsuccessful error of subtext as a result of a closed, cliché conversation; Moreover, even though the body language is present, the conversation has to be mentioned in the conversation, then it is well known. For instance, every speech delivered in the Pablo, and Mrs. Night Knows that Vivek would not fall into the bed with them in the morning. <br /> <br /> 'Pappy and tell Momma' - the blatant description of any shameless, simple dead wife! (She's the best she ever met, the most beautiful lady she ever met, why we can not see a woman like Shakespeare - she's fat, ugly, bad, but her love is <br /> <br /> The police always literally have a step behind them Many scenes give the outside feel of the French farce, the most boring foot ever haunting - Bright Rue lightning was so out-of-shape and easily deceived (he was not exactly as lightning, and she, well, I do not need to spell things out) Some boy pulled a soldier out of a soldier, to fight with a macho biker, when the kid was dropped? Margaret Cho Quote To make it, it's very sad. <br /> <br /> Hacked and over the top <br /> <br /> Many of the above mentioned scenes are sexually threatened: 'I will do this for you. <br /> <br /> The footage shot of Pablo's remorse When parents see, the mourning mother's leak is a very real movie. Unfortunately, the fact that she completely abandoned her through her emotional speech until she goes to ballistic. <br /> <br /> If the mother did not recognize her face, why did she not recognize him when she had flip herself? "<br /> <br />" Do you think that you do not? Tch. <br /> <br /> When talking about the unnecessary features that never went anywhere, the suspicious detective Bright of Detective Lightning shows a scarpio that really knows what the occult is about the occult. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the end, Her character is as absurd as Soid's. Because she said, 'Stop or I'll shoot', what is she doing to shoot her? (So ​​far she has taken _so_much_ about her integrity). She is unarmed. No killing force is required. <br /> Lastly, Dr. Knight on the death of his daughter was childlike acceptance of Christina's acceptance of his mother's death - so forced. And the contribution of the family whose child Kristina was killed to become a new family ... she was angry with me that she was a 'replacement' for their little girl. It is also unrealistic that a white couple of a Latino daughter of a man who killed their own daughter will take a white pair. I'm not saying that I'm not generous, and I love those who love it. <br /> <br /> I find it objectionable that I have told two IMDb critics that she is the woman who made her move. through sappy scenes. <br /> <br /> The co-writer, co-director, co-star Nebott said he had worn a lot of hats. This product. <br /> <br /> At the end, there is little to do with the title story of this film and more. Repentance, helplessness, and loss of lip service that you can never see your money.
