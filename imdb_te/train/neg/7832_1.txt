I just made it through an episode ("Crouch End"). The dialog is valuable and horrified on the bottom right. Acting is tragic. Ion Bailey, despite the best efforts to dramatize, is largely without expression. His eyebrow is indicated in recent botox treatment. Claire Fours is just a silent film. Characters are cartoons, each of which is their random coggling, mostly random, moving plot. Cheesy Special Effects TV Miniseries should not be forgiven for the budget. But the surprise was added to the surprise by creating cinematography without attracting attention and attention. I get the feeling of the ending and the surprise of the end, but it's dirty and the rest of the story is very small. I've put this episode of "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" equal to NBC's Hercules, in comparison to its overall quality.
