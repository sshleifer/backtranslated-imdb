Most people are here, this program is for children only. Hm, when I was a kid (at about 7-9 years old) I first saw this show. It's frustrating for me. I talked to other kids about this, sure, other programs and what to do? Whenever we want to keep some of the emphasis on it (TV or anything else) we say "Oh, Power Rangers" and laughed. <br /> <br /> I really can not imagine MMPR fans before visiting this site. It's so bizarre to me, I try to look again and try to understand why you liked it. I did not enjoy that view. But I do not know: maybe not enough imagination? It could be. But this argument is not enough to rate me more than 1 star.
