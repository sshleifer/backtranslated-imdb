This is very bad. Only half the number of bullets used in this film are rendering half-mastered. There are occasional errors. Acting Kirk is protective and terrible. This story is like a grail, if the film is not already a corpse, the film kills. So in all of your life's waste. There was an option at the rating level I would have given a zero.
