Where there is nobody else green! The only explanation I can say is that I have a house of dead movie. And the whole picture is only a scary part. It's not always bad, you'll ever go to the movies. I wanted to turn this off sharply and turn to the channel drying TV paint but I was committed to my word to suffer the whole thing. <br /> I do not know why I say these things. A group of twenty-societies is a little disappointing for some island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada actually, the Rave of the Century) (which is about 8 people and un-brewing music), after they miss the main ferry and there are some dangerous old fishermen 1000 to pay. That dough is worth some value is some rave gotta! <br /> <br /> The fisherman warned that the island would also be called Dead Island (I thought it was Head on the Dead of Head) and they were all damaging. <br /> The first mistakes here. Why a small little rave (Century is my step!) Why should there be some remote island? Have someone earned money for it? <br /> When they arrived, the Rave (2 tents, a small platform and a port-a-zone) hit the blood and there was no blood. What rational thinking does the person do? Of course run for their lives. But, this clueless, definitely blind people decide to go see them. Outside they will find a large 50-odd old brass house inside. There is no need to kill another half an hour for mistreatment around the forest, and most will come back home after Tadium. <br /> <br /> In this disastrous disaster Jammed is the same name as the famous arcade game of one of the zooions of a grave dialogue, unfortunate acting, mumbo-jumbo exposition and clips. It's a good idea to be universally accepted with filmmakers because I do not know why. Clips do not refer to any scenes and it makes this garbage worse. <br /> It's the lowest cost in the game. It makes the Resident Evil look like movie fame. Hell, even the double-dragon film seems worthy of multiple Oscar compared to this waste. Jurgen Prochko is the only person coming out of this matter with his respect. He could take his money and run, but he made his best effort with a terrible script and brought a little bit of his role. I'm afraid of the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Plus, if you cut a catch-up and nonsense nudity, there's no reason why this film was not shown on TV in the morning of Saturday. It's not too scary. Pirates of the Caribbean is more scary than the skeletal evil guys in this film. And where did those bad guys come from? Only a few people on the island started. I guess this justifies the fact that they chose the footage and back over. <br /> Child WW, W. There is no other than director Wowe Boll. He does not have control over the film. The actors you see clearly do not come up with what they're doing and the zombies are not really taking it seriously. The actors appear to read the queue cards as they continue to talk as soon as they see the next card, continuously interrupting between long sentences. It's all uneasy. <br /> Plus picture is filmed in two-part short-range. I've seen really good TV productions. And does not start me in editing. Thousands of endless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans are unorganized with thousands of people. The original skill or expertise did nothing. It can really be misleading and George Buena Rumski can not take his calls to make boggles the minds that make any worse bad images. <br /> <br /> The House of the Dead is a post-modern that makes some idiotic prediction for Romero in a lazy attempt, but it feels like it will be in the same league as the REAL zombie movie. It's worth the 1.85: 1 inaugural image and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack works to clean but very impressive and only the most widely used ADR. The DVD comes with an extra but why you bully yourself. Not enough this review? Stay away! I examined you all. Doomed! Doomed !!!
