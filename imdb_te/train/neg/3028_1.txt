<br /> <br /> The first image is actually positive because it is shot in this colorful, grainy, post-MTV format. Fast sequences, nice looking angles, hypocritical camera movements - for the moment you look forward to seeing another "snatch". <br /> <br /> When the plot actually unfolds, one starts with a high dose of amphetamine. Things just do not make sense anymore. <br /> <br /> It is better to take the film before. <br /> <br /> First, it describes a crime story in the conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. Wrong. This conversation does not offer any complete story. In contrast, Domino's Lesbian film Lucy Liu makes the audience more confusing in the second part. <br /> <br /> Then I'm about to be rich about a wealthy girl but not a diligent bounty hunter. In any event, this is a message that tells you through the opening scenes. But then the Domino character's question was completely lost to the crime story. So small, it's not about the character of Domino. <br /> When I intend, it's probably a predatory story. A beautiful bloody exploit. 10 million are missing, hunters hunters around the pirates, mafia children run, arms are removed, why Domino is not trying to get any gift certificates, but this view is another U-turn plot. <br /> <br /> We are experiencing the driver's licenses at local modeway and the objection of the Afro-American woman in a obese at the age of 28. Luther stars in the Jerry Springer program try to promote some new, absurd rhetoric, while struggling to earn money for his ill health. <br /> <br /> What do you do with the main plot? URgh, well, no one knows. <br /> <br /> Except the director, the audience will have to pay a fee of 300,000. <br /> Then at some point you should start thinking: "Oh, our society is things". Some of the reality TV crews are shooting violently around the series hunters. Bounty hunters were also housed in a group of Hollywood actors, their noses were broken and their guilt was dragged around a lot of criminals. But this is not a movie about the media, they are occasionally seen throughout the film. <br /> Plus there are many other sub-plots: the crazy Afghan man on freedom of Afghanistan, the romance between Bent, Domino and Choco, the mescaline episode, the operation of the FBI surveillance ... <br /> Can all the stuff be packed into a 2 hour film? Judge for you, but my conclusion is clear - it's a real mess!
