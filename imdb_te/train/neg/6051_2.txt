urgh! A picture requires 3 things: a good script, good plot and good casting. I saw this movie that I thought would be ridiculous scary and was disappointing when unfortunately disappointing. I missed a half to live. The only thing that stopped me from cutting my eyes with a fork is Rose Byrne (the reason I see it in the first place). She has done a good job as rhythmus and her performance has not changed much since 13 years. This is a fantastic first attempt in a movie. The dog is very good. Both have done a great job with such horrors. Sandra Bernhard is the biggest mistake of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p>
