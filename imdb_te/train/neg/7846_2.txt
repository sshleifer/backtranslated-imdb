You know, I wanted to like it "Hills 2 have eyes". I really enjoyed it, and the remake was very entertaining. They obviously got more money throwing around the second time with special effects around Wes Craven. Even though I still prefer the original film, the remake went well, and it's kind of a guilty pleasure for me. Bloody, intense, and great special effects. <br /> "Hills eyes 2" brings us. Man, where did I start? The lack of plot or one paper is narrow. There is no new field right here. The military area decided to supervise the area, all of these people missed. So what do we do now? Send it to the National Guard to look into. In real Hollywood fashion we have to watch them dumbest, and worst soldiers ever. Gee, I've never seen that campus before. To make a short story for a long time, mutants are killing slug soldiers in a graphic manner at one time. Once again, special effects by Nicotero are good, but killing what the graphic is bored and predictable. Honestly it seemed to me that this film just happened to grab a quick buck. It's bloody, and graphic, but I found it predictable, boring, and not scary at all. It would have been nice if this film had an original idea. Wess Craven and his son are sharing duties of writing, and he has a very close relationship with my favorite horror films, but sin is not in these.
