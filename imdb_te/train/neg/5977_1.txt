Wow. <br /> <br /> I do not remember much about this film. <br /> Plots are basically; A girl's parents ignore her, so Pokhman pretends to be her father with this disease. Am I alone confused? Then, pretend this kid's kid kid kid of Weirdore PokeMon Ash. <br /> <br /> I do not care when he tries to please the girl, it just groceries. <br /> <br /> There are no original plots. The girl is a whiny brat who wants to find her own way. <br /> <br /> She has played with Announs, Entei's "daughter" and her "father" help grow and decrease with age. <br /> <br /> This is the most memorable thing I've ever seen, but I think you can take it up and see it. (Or if you look at it, do not expect too much). 1 to 10. <br /> Severely. If you want a PokeMon film, "PokeMon; First Cinema" rent.
