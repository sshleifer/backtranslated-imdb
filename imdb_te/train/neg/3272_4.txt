I said one thing about this film: no folds. You can not get bored of it. The problem is very serious. There is so much action and it needs los! This is a risk you will take in modern action films. You are interesting but not overdone. <br /> <br /> Acting is good and despite having "names" in Gary Bassie and Roy Schicker, it still has the feel of the "B" film. The best part is Schieder's dialogue: "A" part of this "B" movie. <br /> The rest of the story certainly has Rambo mentality but some standout scenes. One of the most innovative views of mining mines in particular. It's memorable. In other scenes it is a long-term keeper.
