I can not believe my eyes when I see this film. Where are these cheerful creatures, the big straight teeth with the worst Muppets where really should be scary? Or they are designed to have a good laugh (I hope sincerely). If you look carefully, you can see the strings that drive them (better, dragging them on the screen). The whole scary was rather funny and I had a good time watching the movie because I had a good time, I was only surprised by its overall inability to have a good part. It's a big joke from beginning to end and I believe this movie belongs to a new category: so unbelievable crappy you'll be finally laughing from the beginning. (I did not even try to comment on the act or all the other stuff)
