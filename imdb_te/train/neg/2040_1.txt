It's a worst picture I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerated, I told the guy on the blockbuster to take them out of the shelves. The interesting thing about this film is the box. "I'm sure it's not at least too bad to direct if it's made recently," This is from the boogeyman director "so I figured out:" But when I saw the film and the "boogeyman" they were talking about, it was early 1980 <br /> <br /> They liked the "Zodiac Killer" name, and the crimes of the original zodiac or His MO, or his active years, are not associated with all the horoscopic crimes, and "stories" take place several years after the actual zodiac crimes, and they compare Zodiac to "Dumeldel's Vampire" in the Fritz Harmon film and Fritz's "son "Zachachra and Harman are identical And the people who killed the people by chewing the necks are more likely to compare him to BTK.Harman is not a factor of facts, a group of unsatisfactory nonsense, and his son also "do not forget to be with his name Fritz Harman 2" ... His real name is just one! I think serial killers are the author / director of the search for Google search and the fastest ones are just a zodiac killer and fritz harman. <br /> <br /> My favorite inequality experts in this movie, as well as teenagers, are suffering from the killer DSM-IV and its cure. "I'm also diagnosed with DSM-IV and has since recovered", etc. DSM-IV is a psychological manual for mental disorders. Someone should have some serious problems because someone is suffering from that book! <br /> <br /> Anyway, my point is that it goes to the bottom of my first 5 worst films in my time list, which is rare. But, if you are interested in looking at a completely non-realistic story about serious killers, I'm checking this movie, not boring, full of full actors, and totally rational. <br /> ... Oh, and how some of his victims of the killer drier liked me "tears of tears". Nice touch ...
