Joel Schumacher directs the script he wrote and the Georgetown graduates face adult life situations. The storyline is a scrambled mess, but some scenes are really good. Here's a lot of wasted talent and time. The cast is more impressive than the cast. Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Zad Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedie and Mary Winnieham. The most important is McCarthy and Moore. Low is very bad. It's not easy to get older.
