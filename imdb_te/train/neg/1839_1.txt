While renting my movie, I did not wait to place this movie on my DVD player. After I started it, I could not get it from my DVD player. Actually I saw the movie. My wife and I kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen, but never forever funny. Read the box as it turns out to be really funny. The motion of the film is good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How could you miss this movie? Well .... do not miss it! What I have never seen is ridiculous. None of the speakers I felt was a bit more fun. This is really a dirty picture. Trust me Avoid it .... stay away!
