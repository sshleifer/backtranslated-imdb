<br /> <br /> If you ignore daddy accents, low product values ​​and frightening camera work, the film is absolutely nothing for it. I only go to look as I read the book and they're going to see how complicated plot work into a 2-hour movie <br /> <br /> There is no simple answer -. They are not. Characters appear as little as any description and then continue to play any valuable article. Even the main characters work out without reason so that it's through the reaches of the climax time you do not care what happens to them any more. <br /> <br /> I agree that books need to re-write that fits occasionally and it's probably unfair to judge this film against the book adopted from it. But what I would say is that my friends and I / I came out of the movie and that they were going on a return journey home that can also change the true meaning of the title of the books. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br> Allowing more than half the meaning of voice over.
