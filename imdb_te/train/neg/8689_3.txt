The main problem with "Power" is that there are absolutely no subplots for characters and movies that do not. This is a little bit bored afterwards, waiting through the scenes that do not connect to finding the movie that takes you forward. You may probably go through all of the development of the character, but they all are recycled from previous sequences in the film or are only flat and inexpensive. Lumet never gives enough support to let any cast support bud appear. He should cut some of the characters (hackman, wife) and make it difficult for others (billing). It may be a great hard political thriller instead of losing a fact that it is astonishingly thinking about casting the bad writing and acting in the sea. Even Jean Hackman is not equal to the show. Denzel Washington is the only actor to be noted here. Gere and others all played well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It has not worked yet, and it will never be. Leave ensemble plays for Altman. <br /> <br /> <br /> "
