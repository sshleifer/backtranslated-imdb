The film begins with a very serious relationship with a woman and her mental torture. Male full frontal nudity, dead animal parts, dogs licking dogs, she is woman's loosing control of the bladder. All the shot in a gray cool color. Effective, but very little. We then proceed to seeing the BTK killer's youth as well as the history of today and his crimes. Tension is full of mental and intimate to enter into the homes of his victims and talk to them for a long time and it is crazy. We do not see fancy or good images here, it looks like you baked your home camera. It does not look terrible, but it is quite unusual and chilling as it is seen by some of his victims engaged in a short time before killing a criminal. No movie really any play, really. Some cop scenes are only once, but there is no excitement in terms of the killer. There is not much arc for this story. It's an effective psychological thriller, mad study. Unfortunately, the film is filled with real bathroom footage. It is scattered throughout the movie and suddenly comes back again. Sometimes you do not know what's coming up and there is not enough time to stay away. And I should reject it. I'm all for low budget horror movies but I do not tease the animal suffering. It's unnecessary, superior, and without warning. I am happy to release the Lionsgate no matter what, but they have passed this film or the animal gore has been edited. Stay away from this trash.
