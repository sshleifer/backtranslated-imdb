The picture sucks, it's not funny, it's not exciting. It tried to be very bad, but it was good, but failed. And it's nice to like this film, next to the hype, the only reasons for the film's success. 50% 10 to 10 at this time, the film is very relevant to me, the film is publicly departed, or the vote is untrue, it has many causes and needs to be maintained. However, it is less than the average image of the mouth through the mouth. It is only the success of the marketing marvel.
