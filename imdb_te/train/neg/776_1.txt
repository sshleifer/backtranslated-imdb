When I was 6 or 7 years old, I saw this carton. My grandfather took a free video at the mall. Remember that it really sucks. The plot no sense. I hated Kasper's friend fox. He is stupid! If Kasper can not find his friend, he shouts his head. What is that? Get on with it! Fox shot and finally died only a good part and I do not want to sound an average excited. I laughed off my head in revival because this cartoon sucked too much. Fox revives bad news and becomes a ghost. I want him to be dead. I gave it to the film because I hate it. No wonder they offer free at the mall. Do not let a kid see you. They accept me.
