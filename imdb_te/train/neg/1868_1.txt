This film is terrible. Each line is stolen from 8MM (Italian dubbing version, at least). If you like trash ... try a real trash, try it out; But beware: This movie is not good movie. In its degradation, it can really look like a porno, if you're looking for "moll", s & m, hardcore, soft ... or a simple romantic thriller, go find something in the store! I just say, "I have been told, as I said earlier, after the announcement of" the eyes of the victim ", completely acting and incredible shooting, acting, plot, dialogue (just good lines, they were stolen from Joel Schumacher 's 8MM! (Stolen from 8MM) and for mom & daughter's sexy bodies (not properly maintained) Half for the scene after an accidental shot, and I will be a star, however, to keep the turkey slowly while watching me!)
