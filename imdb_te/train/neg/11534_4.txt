* Caution * Has a lot of spoilers <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I have great respect for Gillian Anderson's incredible talent as a distinct and versatile actress - I do not understand these reasons when I see the movie script (or lack of). <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is, in my opinion, a good idea and there are some true thought-provoking themes but it is downed souffl√©. That's why I hate 99% of the British movie. It's too long, it's tedious, for the most part, and the very first twenty minutes. Pala Radcliffe is disappointed that a marathon is running when you can get a little bit of speed. With a little more imaginative direction and a little bit of storyline, it is not necessary to leave the audience in their popcorn. Alice: F *** OFF! I'm only Surmise (Alice Alice: ADAM! ADAM! "I say the word for the word, the actors probably paid more than made to his Virgin mobile advertisements for Kate Moss (Adams! Adam sees off into Adam Woods) The friend of Bridget Jones, the frequent use of the F-word that Shazza feels priceless There are not many different ways. <br /> <br /> Alice is less likely to be the main characters before the main sardhed event that leaves a lot of sympathetic audience for the characters in line with the 'terrible' reaction. <br /> <br /> Alice and the courts are sympathetic. A great career, a costly London apartment located on the roof of the dying room, comes up to her, her life is worse She was bitter and frustrated before she was attacked, and she describes how to explain how to start it, raising her with a tough-old-old-booted soldier who feels her love is the ultimate expression of how to burn her gun, Instead she followed her footsteps as her big city That the value of his life to treat her. Instead she found a group of stereotypical middle class Toffs who will see a Lexus Drive and someone who is not rich enough to drive luxurious luxury into a Wanna-cockney width boy electrician (ie a Wanna-cockney wide boy electrician) goes out of tissue. A protective grace of the character is that she has been portrayed by Gillian Anderson. In a lesser actress she is a three-dimensional image of her illusions, but when Miss Anderson actually heartily apologizes for her road rage in this effortless attempt, he introduces some of the silly moments of humanity as this lifeless human being. <br /> <br /> I do not say Adam is better. Danny Dyer played well as a fish outdoors Jack Jack, but a good show was not a screenshot of him and he could not save him from the lack of any character background. <br /> <br /> The film is heavily dependent on the value of shock but the timing is over and it is considered to be very engineered from the beginning to the end. For shock, the most surprising thing about this film is the unashamed performance of the painfully thin how Ms Anderson has become; It is almost no more to see the brutal attack scenes. On one hand note, the only violent sexual assaults in a British film take the time to give each other a pregnancy before the gang can encourage their colleagues - speak strongly with the high-lip grab! If there is a movie donated to make this national lottery money, I'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pounds each week. <br /> <br /> When I say that I hate this movie, giving it a lot of credit and I do not care enough about the characters that guarantee those strong emotions. I need one-bit hours back for my whole life, please!
