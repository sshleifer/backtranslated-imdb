First of all, this is a low-budget movie, so my expectations are very low. <br /> <br /> I think most people looking for information on this film want bloodshed. There really is no one. It's basically in Saa but in China and very bad overall hell. To air? Nothing, as long. Special hangouts? In my opinion absolutely awful ... flames and blood are often unbelievable due to overall, belief, color, texture etc. <br /> <br /> The intention of this movie is a brutal, shock movie. Now it has great potential for big budgets, such as poor scripting, poor dialogue, awful acting, camcorder video shots, and plain unreliable "gore". Some reviews, some of the possibilities for "B-Rate" movies (for example, I've recently seen the blood trails against valuable reviews), but it's very scary. <br /> <br /> I'm for cruelty and shock, but for total awkwardness and really awful acting for an awful experience. Save your time / money and the opportunity to something, you will not be disappointed.
