If you've seen other movies like this, they're probably better. Omega Man comes to mind. For the studio's credit, they escaped a vast, unnecessary, big budget techno describing the images of these films. In addition, the set-up and the premise are excellent: its past trying to get away from an overwhelming deadly disease of the four people almost irrelevant to us. Nothing else is bad! I'm tired of endlessly stupid, careless, wimpy, ineffective, proud characters in a film. Pretty much describes everyone at the picture. I rented, and repeatedly told on TV, "No, do not do that!", "Why are you stupid", "see!", Etc. The actual disparity in character development is clear within half. Give a film a strong personal connection with at least some characters, so let's see what happened to you. This is not one. In addition, the film must have so much time.
