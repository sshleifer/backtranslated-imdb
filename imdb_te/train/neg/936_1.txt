I do not understand people. Why this film is getting a 8.3 !!!!!! ??? I am very hopeful for this film, but I left the theater once a half hour. They say that most of the reviews on this site are one of the best action films ever seen (or summer, year, etc.). WTF !!!!!!!!!! ?????? What's out there (Bourne motorcycles, shoot, and along with the fact that he will fight better than anyone who comes across)? What do you learn about Bourne's role in this movie ??????? Absolutely no f ****** !!!!!!! Okay, there are so many actions, but what's the great deal about the action in this film? I do not like cinematography and film editing. The moving camera effect and rapidly changing shots are used very much and they get older fast (I still do not take advantage of it because it is not yet easy and did not use a large number) and made me very dizzy. <br /> <br /> There are no plots for this movie. The movie was a total 115 minutes hunt. Bourne, you've learned absolutely nothing in the entire 115 minutes, perfect for everything he's trying to do. There is no role in the film, you do not know anything, and there are a wide range of new characters introduced in this installment. Some people say that the film is excellent writing and suspense. !!!!!!!! ??????????? No writing ???? No suspense ??? No suspense. Bourne is absolutely perfect in every work he does, and I do not think he has any concerns about him. If this year's 2007 film is the best movie I might have been completely watching the movies !!!! <br /> <br /> Many said that Matt Damon's performance in the film is the best of his career (not the best). Which show ?? How many lines does he have in this picture ??? I have played a variety of roles in movies and characters that I liked because Damon has some respect, but a good actor can identify you from one movie to another, choosing a variety of characters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this film made me feel a big disappointment. I do not recommend this film but I would recommend the first two (Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy) and I recommend reading three books (which are very different for the movies).
