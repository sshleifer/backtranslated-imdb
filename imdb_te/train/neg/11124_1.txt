I generally do not worry about violence in movies, or philosophy, symbolism, or mentality in large quantities. It's all right with me and this movie brings us a lot of stuff. Beautiful pictures of the lake and nature, especially the characters are in good direction, good setting. This film has been cast as a good film. However, two reasons are spoiled and for these two reasons the film is just frustrating. <br /> <br /> First, there is violence on the creatures to make this film. The movie is not torture, I'm talking about REAL violence. Although this violence is not the only one, it can cause both. The film's message describes the relationship of women with directors. We have no real twists. (Men in a row). But the end of the film will ruin it all. <br /> The spoiler * Our "heroine" will finally die (I've seen it before these films and it angered me, the guy just can not watch the new movie witch) and now the more obviously portrayed natural demon, the nature is growing on her Nature, especially her sex .. of course it's female heroine "kills" director. Women are particularly fascinated by their sexuality, especially in death. The final conclusion is that. ** End spoiler * <br /> If the director could save his opinion of himself, it would be better. But men use fear of men to frighten men, and to use the big images and skeletons of brutality to say that men are cruel to women. Not just enough. I know when I see this movie, it is "philosophical, eastern and artistic" and can have any good criticism. But this film is just totally damaged.
