I do not think I was bowled by the absurdity of an image in my entire life, I walked out of this rubbish. None of this is understandable. Which one is wise or not. They do not really have any suspicious moves, but they use the entire cap-out trick, where the character does not build up the music or put it off the backstairs before opening the door, and then nothing. Okay to do it once, but I counted it three times. There are obvious reasons, characters and half-story heroes who have thrown things out .... All of the characters are not well developed. End .. bad. Evil, evil, bad, everything, every part, this picture is terrible. And I'm here to warn you all.
