Another British movie flag waver. Offer real garbage is here once again. I can not understand (and I'm British) why this above, patriotic nonsense never made. For eight years you remember, since the Second World War actually ends! Other commenter's commenting on the editing and the clear seamless use of archive footage here. It has been observed very little. The archive footage is plentiful. Model aircraft swing from strings in 'action scenes' like most children's cats in the air. The usual map room sequences can make the green film bring us into the Malta program. Guinness should always have his worst performance. The shocking back of the dog fight scenes are ridiculous. The map room area Hawkins has all of us death. Eling made many great movies. This is clearly not one of them. They should stay away from such an incredible rock!
