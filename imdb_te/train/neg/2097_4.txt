I'm looking forward to the Battlestar Galactica franchise. The main series is very boring prequel. After the first 30 minutes, I was waiting for it to finish. The characters make a lot of talking about religion, computers, programming, vengeance, etc. ... gangsters, mafia types, hits. <br /> <br /> When looking at movies, give some useful suggestions: general rule, if there is a lot more wrong flawless titillation, then you know the image will be a worst. Capricorn This is very much. The director / writer usually attempts to dismiss some naked bodies for his tedious abilities. It never works and all of it has a lot of young actresses and I'm sorry for them. <br /> If you want to get bored at an hour and a half, you have to rent a capsico. If you really want to see the naked body is' net (free) romance. Otherwise, moving here is not looking at here.
