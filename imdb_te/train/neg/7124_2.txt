A man takes his new wife home, where his ex-wife "accident" dies. His new wife was just released from a company and was so great! Suddenly she heard her sounds and starts looking at the skulls all over the place. Will she go back crazy or come back from the first wife's death? <br /> You can not really imagine it, so I can not spell it out. I saw this many times on TV on Saturday afternoon as a kid. I still liked it but I was young. If I look at it now, I realize how bad it is. It's terrible, badly written, very dull (even in one hour) and the huge cast of the FIVE people (a director)! There are still some good things about it. <br /> <br /> Music is a great creepy and large housing with a paved house and a nice atmosphere. There are also some horrifying moments (when I first saw the skull and I jumped off) somewhat effective end. All in all is definitely not a good image ... but the whole disaster either. It is a small cult following. <br /> <br /> You are also trying to avoid elite DVD drive-in edition (attached to "Attack of the Giant Leaches"). It is a high jumps and scratched terrorillated shapes. It's not even bad on TV!
