I am looking forward to great things from David Mammoth's big fan of movies and dramas, especially his first film House of Games, starring Joe Montegna. Instead, I was angry with the film's surface and lack of credibility. With the hope of establishing racial tensions that did not delay me, they were throwing racist rhetoric without any sense or meaning. Identity is clearly repeating and men are not clear as "heroes". Due to the standards taken as a cop, the main character has undoubtedly denied a minor act that could harm and possibly save lives, and yet another act which is very violent and very illegal, but then refuses to act as minor. In addition, the most reliable subplot for a person killed by his family was intended for a plot point, which was promoted with skiing and the response of the incident extended the guards' way to all reasonable limits. Needless to say, after expecting another exciting thriller from David Mamet, I was disappointed to say much less. 3 in 10.
