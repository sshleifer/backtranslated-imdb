Have spoilers ... I am surprised to be honest with this movie's high rating. What I say is a slow-moving promotional film. (Self-note note should check the rating for the platoon) This image is so black and white ... good for the Americans ... either someone is bad or useless. I took the British troops to SAS (one of the world's elite segments), they lost 3 people, and the rest fled, and the elite soldiers in the fight remained on the ground and the evil of the evil Iraqis cut down. Remember the dead-strings. Sniper SAS man has taken ... the muzzle flash from the distance, the good noise used ... the bit really good but the rest ... The only good thing I have to say about this film is in this sense ... Spare I am here at the age of 10? !! <br /> Speaker ... oye oye and the main crazy, the wild man can not stay in the house. His wife and child .. He must sign another year to fight the confused commitment of a war! Why ... young people need clear thrills or something. <br /> <br /> I am really surprised at the high rating of this film. I'm not hating America as I hate to hate the message of the film that seems to be fierce, but obviously people are there, because the reason is for confusing (something she wants to say or censor), but hey. But one side like black and white so churn a picture ... good v evil lazy and treat me like a child. The war was very gray and believed that it was fighting two (sometimes more) sides. Star Wars something with some good side verses goodies on the dark side. F 'in Hollywood you really take people for lops ... then again 7.8 .... well you have the right but I will not buy it. Happy to tell you all for nothing I downloaded this movie. ;)
