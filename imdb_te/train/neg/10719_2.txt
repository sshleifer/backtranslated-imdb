I can not say this thoroughly sucks, but I would not even have this in my house if it was not for Netflix. The eccentric president of Steve Martin's chain of health food stores becomes flat. He is not funny. Another of SNL's long-term deaths is that they can only get the job done for the next SNL movie. The birth trainer with Elmer Fudd Lisp is original. Amy Poehler goes through the same moves for a 7-minute SNL skirt which is just as funny as her SNL is late. The only thing that goes to the film is that it's easy on Tina Fay's eyes. The conclusion is immediately predictable that you heard her character could not get pregnant. This topic may be open to other comic efforts, but it's fun, not really entertaining or laughing.
