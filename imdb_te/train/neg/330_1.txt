I want to punch the TV. Watching this is violence. I hate it. Never see this movie. The terrorists are suffering. Adam Sandler was annoyed. I usually like him but that's not the case. I want to break the DVD. This is the most irritating movie in the world. The comedian is jealous. The racer is just a remotely funny piece of black teeth getting all the girls. I wanted to punch to the TV. This film should not be unexpected. If you like Adam Sandler just a little, do not buy it. It hates him. If you see in the store, be it in harmony with you and hide everyone from the risk of buying it. I lost $ 1.99 for its waste.
