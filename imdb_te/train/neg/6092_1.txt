<br /> <br /> The film was a perfectly unlikely event in 1993. These fashions and music indicate these 80 songs. <br /> <br /> A strange loner meets a random guy with a beard, while he is following his favorite song I think to suggest that I'm going to fall down on London's bridge as a single favorite song this time, why is this his favorite song? Because he is an idiot. She is the only one and this movie has gone to folly ... <br /> <br /> There are two scenes in this movie, because he chose his nose to clear the title, and he decides to be a girl to be close to other girls. Kill them, it's more or less. <br /> <br /> Acting universally Actually, I'm going to say that acting is the standard of pornography, and this is really terrible, as nasal poker as a niche picar. The characters in the film see him as a falling down girl by singing London Bridge. Man, I also type the feel of idiot. However, a middle-aged Werdado hanging with school age children is fantastic. And that's not a good way. There is also a wide range of scenes in the school with the nasal type of girls. This is the greatest song ever recorded. I'm not going to explain it. You will know when you hear it. You agree with me. <br /> There are some violent scenes. And the Benny Hill style chase sequence involving a transformation. Nastyl Pickler tells a prostitute, 'If you've got a gash I've got cash', from where Shakespeare or John Milton, can be taken or the conversation is an immortal bit. Lovely, I'm sure you'll agree <br /> <br /> The meaning is nonsense.
