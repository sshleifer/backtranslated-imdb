This film is terrible. You do not need to read this review more. <br /> If you plan on watching, it is enough to say - do not (if you do not learn how to do a good movie). <br /> Acting is horrendous ... serious enthusiasm hour. I thought it was interesting to see that the movie was all about Michael Madsen and I found a person who found it, only to find out if it was true! <br /> <br /> Plots are awful. People who claim to be original or good have never seen a good image before. By the standards of Hollywood Action Flax, this is a horrible film. <br /> Do not look at it! Go for a jog instead - at least you will not feel like killing yourself.
