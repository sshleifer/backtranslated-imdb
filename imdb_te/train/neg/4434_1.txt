I rented the movie thinking that I was a wonderfully happy historic piece. I've got a pure trash piece. The film is obscure at most places, almost all of them are obscure and terrible in all places. Mira Sorvino's filming of a queen was greatly frustrating to play the young male maestro. Ben Kingsley should remove his knighthood to consider the movie as one of his projects. Fiona Shah must comply to play Petunia Dursely; <br /> <br /> All the Harry Potter films have called a drama in the film. <br /> <br /> Cinematography Some college boy was brought to class in cinematography 101 and failed miserably. Almost every scene in the film is cut for influence; As a result of the end of the course being the cheesiest bit of compilation I've seen so far. Jay Rodon is good like Aagis; He was a bad writer to work very badly. Rachel Stirling gives her the best work as an almost labeled lady anticipated. In the end, I really wish the blockbuster video returned. I'm so glad I did not spend 10 bucks seeing this flop in the theater. If they are performing this marivox drama since the 18th century, I am surprised that many people in this work have good folks at the age group. If I were there, they would not listen to the game on the snoring. Thanks to the goodness for the modern convenience of DVD players; You can skip past boring or awful scenes. That means I only watched the start and finish!
