Oh, why do people take good things? After reading the book based on the film two years ago, I can not say anything in the original book. <br /> <br /> In this movie, I have low expectations - I know that it will have a garbage televised-but it is not even able to meet. <br /> It's not the prequel - the actual name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, the story of a completely different character given the same name. They were just spat out there in the face of each carlitose way fan; The role played by Luis Guzman played a crucial role in a different role was added to injury as injury. <br /> <br /> Very frustrating is that this film has not been made, to speak on the original, untouched thing of Carlito's Way - that I really appreciate seeing. I thought it was the same thing as the Chopper - they have four books as well as the fantastic fantasy of literature and can have the most breathtaking underworld figure's amazing biography, Even though). <br /> <br /> If three stars are completely stand-alone, it's not too scary - there are some good performances. (Jay Hernandez Carlito, but he is better off in other roles) and the story is not too bad. Puffy Kumble also fits his role. But they totally misunderstood the underworld at the time (I'm a bit of a crime-fiction-fiction buff) - the original film and books are correct (as the lawyer and now Judge Edwin Torres wrote) It can not stand alone - it's the most disappointing prequel ever shot.
