It's not a bad movie; It was only four of the "best" Mexican filmmakers; And this is not only the script is terrible. It's just ... this movie sucks ... big time. These people are wasting money on terrible scripts. It is necessary to criticize the Mexican community but we are frustrated with these kind of films. Is bad language funny? I can not get it. <br /> <br /> Do not think that these films are well-received in Mexico: we hate them and they do not reflect us.
