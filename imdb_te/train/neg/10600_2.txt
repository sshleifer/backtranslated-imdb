I'm honest. The only reason I watched this one on TV is in IMDB bottom 100. And right now, I am wondering if the hour and half of my life is really another 'check' value in the same list <br /> <br /> Van Damme Lock Devore, in a huge fight with Universal Soldiers after taking 'HAL' to protect the main computer computer involved. And yes, after all the explosions explosions, shootout and chase he is standing in the last. Terrible acting and a bit of a boring set makes it just the point of it in the infamous list. <br /> <br /> The idiots like me, who want to see the full list. 2/10.
