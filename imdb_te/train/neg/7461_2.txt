*** Spoirs *** *** Spoirs *** sets itself straight to record this fantastic image from its very early credits: it is an instant classic. It is not long enough to realize that the film is bigger than 'Kindergarten Cop' or 'Police Academy 7'. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Looking at the first strangely "huh? The story is fine for us.The story of the FBI intruders is a simple story of an idiot, an anecdote that works at many levels and teaches us about the most important things in our life I do not start with the secret secret of Corky Romano's until my sixth or seventh view, and the FBI agent Brick Davies is not the FBI's most wanted criminal, the true FBI agent of the FBI. If not otherwise you will eventually look for an unexpected twist, otherwise you're done Pope's Romano's innocent, Peter Romano he is illiterate and Pyle Romano comes out of a homosexual room. <br /> <br /> Chris Cotton's comic talent did not match his role as Carki's Romano through the maze of unexpected circumstances . The memories of the performance of John Reynolds in Manaus, Hands of Fate, Cutton takes on numerous innumerable personalities and solves all the scenes with perfect comedies. However, Cotton is not about comedy. He is the greatest of the play because he controls the viewer's feelings with the slightest moves of his face. His facial expressions reflect life. For example, in the scene where he goes to his brothers' faces, you can see the social injustice and alienation that clearly reflect on his unhealthy face. At this time, it is difficult to find a dry eye at home. <br /> <br /> Screenwriters David Garrett and Jason Ward are the true leaders of Corky Romano. With the story of such ratios, it is easy to understand why two experienced writers work to complete this prestigious project. Their skillful hero and traditional architecture, 'Pulp Fiction', looks like a typical Saturday Night Live Skit. The story of Garrett and Ward is very compelling and attractive, it captures your hair, takes you completely, shakes around you and spits it right for you. <br /> At the end of this world experience outside the so-called "Corky Romano" you will find another person with different world attitudes and different ideas, and with a single question in your mind: <br /> God? Why?!?
