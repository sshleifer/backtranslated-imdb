** SPOILERS ** Slasher film Redicules that wears a black cloth and a killer running around wearing a pull-over Peter Lorry rubber mask makes no sense at all. <br /> <br /> In the film, Tenson Collage, who was murdered by a boyfriend after the murder of young boy Beth Morgan, has been rehabilitated by heavy drug use, which began in the very first scene. The daughter of FBI Agent Soccer (Jeff Kanney), who was persuaded to catch the killer, was murdered at Tennyson at the same time. What is it connected to the time "Do You Wanna Know Secret" that connects some half dozen collage students to Florida in just two years? The killer, at least in the murder of Beth's boyfriend, wore the same crazy Halloween costumes. <br /> <br /> Six out of the six students in a spring break in Sunshine State spend their vacation at a beach house, and they break one at a time. The computer geek began with Brad Clighton, Chad Allen, killing the town itself, police officer Gavin, Jack McGee, opened up with many unrelated students with targeted students. <br /> <br /> The masked assassin saves the last Beth in this weird ceremony at a deserted church, as the Florida Ever looks like glades. He is finally in the end, he's with no purpose, it's nothing in the movie. Trying to intimidate all the audience will not be confused with all the pictures and are very difficult with very unacceptable slazer scenes. Victim Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones, with the hero in the movie Agent Sacker, in survival and ending at least three attempts at life of the most influential ones. <br /> <br /> Oz also had a vicious cut, almost cut it, cut out half and cut out of the bigger glass, but later he was surprised by the fact that he spent two more time with the killer, with little limb in his walk do not! Without a cell phone with Oz and Beth Os, this did not even mean that the police went to their own to capture and capture the killer instead of calling them. <br /> <br /> The film is also very astounding at Beth Beach's boyfriend, Beach House, who lost his head over Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence. They collaborated with Beth Oz together with the killer sufferers and somehow disappear from sight! You do not know whether they really were killed if there were some kind of illusion in the moment of the local police. <br /> <br /> While we had a previous relationship between Tina and Hanc as she was bad with alcohol and acting, Hank and Tina also walked without noticeing her with Hank. The film initially seemed to have hurt Beth more since she was murdered!
