The dirty, dirty Western from the director Richard Brooks, all the usual clicks drowned in the genre intact as well. The horse race in the early 1900s attracts a low-key cowboy (Jane Hackman), a robbery gambler (James Coburn), a hard kid (John Michael Vincent) and a female (a surprisingly game Candice Bergen). Once the presidents (after speculative arguments on the fact that a woman is not able to participate), this would be an entrance to the right, although the new land (something similar to the Gary Cooper period). On the good side, if the Mac has a verve and good performances, the mechanism of the plot is quickly tiresome. ** from **
