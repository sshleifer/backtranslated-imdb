Fred Olen Ray is a producer director, until B film directors have gone, but 'The Hunting Fear' is perhaps one of his best films. Yes, this is a great po story 'the earlier cemetery' and it is very bad and uneven, but it's very fun. Scream Queen Brink Stevens is a pretty, brittle housewife Its negligent husband (Jay Richardson) is better than usual as she is in a conspiracy to do away because she needs money to pay for a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a celebrity of the soft-core movies of the early 1990s, is actually a legitimate mistress of the film. The little characters you played in the role of Karen Black in the role of Merrok, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Bererman played a good role in good scenes. The end does not make much sense!
