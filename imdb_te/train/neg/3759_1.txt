Oh where to start. Cinematography is good. Early visual scenes began at the beginning and I thought I was for a good movie. Then came cgi Bigfoot .It looked like a cartoon drawing of the Lion King and King Kong 's romantic baby. It totally took away from the character's confidence. Now I have no clear reason to know that hiking a Bigfoot hiking around the woods for a while but a cheesy cgi cartoon.So then baked me in the whole picture. Roger Patterson dressed as cgi baked money for the toilet. He is the best Bigfoot cloth. He's a hardcore cheesy Bigfoot film fan and I warned about this film but my compulsion led me to see the film and I was disappointed that previous reviews warned me about. Once you read this review I know, "I have to watch the Saskwalk hunters and watch the saucchi hunters." Then I will say why I wasted my good hard earned money such an unfortunate bad boring movie!
