It's very ridiculous, the fast moving story, an underdog character that closes all loudmots etc. Because of the funny thing, you can not make a film with this title because you are a substitute for anyone but "white" is no more considered racist by PC policemen. <br /> <br /> Woody HarleySon is as interesting as his main character, Wesley Snippets, though it is better than a black basketball player. <br /> <br /> Snaps have a lot of down lines to put funny, offering a lot of humor. The bad part of the film - it does not bother many - it's the extreme deeperness and the stagnation of all the characters. Woody's girlfriend played by Rossi Perez. The film is really good and not good people. Because of that, I can not honestly recommend this film, at least with allies or those who are offended by very obscene
