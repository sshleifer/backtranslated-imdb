<br /> <br /> My father and I are terrified of the film, with absolutely no redeeming features. <br /> <br /> I thought this British effort was ill and morbid. <br /> <br /> I am totally incompetent to those who enjoy the film: for enjoying the performance of deep vulgarism and swearing. <br /> <br /> The producers are ashamed of themselves.
