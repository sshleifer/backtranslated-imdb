<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you want to be a part of the game, <br /> <br /> "I'm Hamlet, Prince van denmark" <br /> <br / > I heard a radio drama of "Hamlet" with Maximilian Shield. Hamlet and I were disappointed. I thought the version of the shot was improved, and shell had at least body language to underline what he said - nothing. Then set ... The minimum design is not everyone's taste, but I usually like when setting on the stage to do what setting and nothing more clearly. Oops, it's in a stage, in a stage. It does not work in the film based on a play that has really reliable settings. I thought that the idea for the set was already copied from the theatrical production of the Hamlet, which is only a complaint ... Shell Hamlet is the place where the first episode is available anywhere and how anyone can play Hamlet for the second time. If you choose to view about sixty films based on "hamlet", you can not see it unless you're a Moscow, or really hardcore, or a lively cheerful actress.
