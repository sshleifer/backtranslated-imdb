It's not bad, is it (Hooper's work is so bad)? I was more disappointed. Such a hypothetical concept, Hooper in his financial direction and less smoky (pus exemption), did not collapse. It goes bad and very serious in the dead voices, becomes fraudulent and unpredictable, the entire pessimistic mystery / conspiracy-woven narrative is easily compounded. Hence, the course is dull and Brad Dourrup (it is good to see him in the lead role) struggles with a balanced performance, without hampering a hugely aggressive intimacy to his off-of-the-world role. Though cheap, it has an effective technique. However, its idea is not out of the ordinary and is used in the evil jalts (some work) and special effects (flames, flames everywhere). Hooper displays some beautiful fiery images (ultimately in the end), and the camera-work is fast driven and the beaming score is closed. The exhibitions are a bit in the shop with performances by Williams Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dee Young, Jon Saifer and Melinda Dillon. Even the Zerog Buck Flower and John Landis are small, but fun comos ?? Especially Landis. Nothing is surprising, but it is engaging majestically.
