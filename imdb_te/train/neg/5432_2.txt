A warship sinks ... its survivors are hanging on nearby arms, and nothing can be done when they go into their minds for long-lasting rows. <br /> <br /> The name of Noel Covered is the only thing you will notice during credits, because it is in the movie because it is lean. And in terms of technology, its very good. David Lean is just KNEW movies from Get Go. Coward's study takes the second seat of dialogue and there are several moments where Leann's visual concept reaches the central stage. At the end of the end, try the whole scene of the soldiers who overthrow the ship; <br /> <br /> Novel Coward is one of the worst actors ever seen. He is not displaying fully wood, emotion, character or humanity. <br /> <br /> You can see in his eyes, he does not tell what the other player says, he just waits for him to rush his own song. <br /> <br /> /> <br /> Its episodic, a bit repetitive, and overwhelm the last stories: they give any simple central story, just simple ideas into characters. Still, its a curious picture worth a watch - and a good debut of lean. It's not a deep or penetrating film and its perfectly a promotional film, but it's about how a slice of pieces is put together for lean editing skills.
