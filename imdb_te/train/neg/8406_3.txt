A memorable line from a short lived scene. After watching the episode, my brother began to use the line to break our hoodles on the offensive flag football team. Instead of a break / break, our quarterback is back with football and in the rest of the team you responded BET! A fun way to break the hoods that our opponents are holding tightly on their heads, only a few of them have seen the show. This line has added a special topic to our season that I will never forget. We had our best season at college in that year and we used this line in a short way. The show is pretty stinker, but the West Virginia Tech 1977 Pip Kappa sees the mutual flag football team memories.
