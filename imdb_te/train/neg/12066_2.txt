Okay, this is for the original - the great old geezer left his estate to his adult children, losing all of them grateful, and two creepy servants, provided they spent the week at his scary old home. Only those who have not seen a movie or television show that night before may be surprised. After a string of murders for victims that they are biting the restaurant ketchup, we will have a thicker twist to the end. The cast plays a major role once the honorable actors have to be upset for their payments. There were also some second-level actors who were growing at the time, but have long forgotten. As a result, the movie produces all the play and mystery of an episode of "Matlock". Where I give credit, the closing scene is clever and fun, if you're still awake.
