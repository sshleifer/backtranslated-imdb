I found the DVD of "I Dream of Genie" in $ 1.00 bin at Wal-Mart. When I saw "Stephen Foster's Story", being a musician and musicologist, I had to see it. Although it is a reconstruction of 1939's "Sevani River", I do not know what it is for the year when it does not cover it. The character of Bill Shirley's composer is sometimes sometimes painful, sometimes ridiculous. The man is all the way through no testosterone and a WIMP! I thought Stephen Foster was making him one by publishing his songs with a difficult time music publishers ... without paying him for them! Along with that ludicrous, Ray Middleton has a nearly 20-minute episode and his black-face "Christie Minstrals", which is hard to present by Stephen Foster's songs, to say the least. We can not imagine that this image is appropriate for our time to be resurrected. It should be a trouble and be forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs should not be forgotten ... Also, Eine Christie's Zeney's role is the lowest point in Hollywood history.
