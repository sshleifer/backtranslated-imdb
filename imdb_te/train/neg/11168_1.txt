- A Mexican priest becomes the wrestler to save an orphan or something - <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie because it was about WWF and wrestling and so it was funny. It's not. It's painful to see. Embarrassing. Any chance for any comedy is relentless. <br /> I do not like Jack Black. After that, my brain was prevented to think of a good role I played. I can come from where he is. The foil for the role of John Cusack in 'High Fidelity'. Jack Black is a terrifically relentless flat-out ham-it-up-up-up-up-at-knockabout girl (which is just like Abbot & Costello or a little fat in Jerry Lewis). <br /> It's not even a slap stick. It's just irritating. <br /> <br /> I also heard good about Napoleon Dynamite, but in this case I would do it on DVD.
