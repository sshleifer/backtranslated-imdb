Everything orange tone is just yucky. Oh, the main character is orange-tinted people live in a ghetto that is all orange-tinted. Meanwhile, this shortage of the body sucks out of poverty, she sucks in a full immersion video game (no rules are clear and no logic follows the gameplay). She earned a game playing but did not know that the game is not an employee of the company? The story of the later interruptions is slowly running. <br /> Meanwhile, I'm audiences, mainly why she waste her precious time, using a glitchy orange computer interface with an apparently annoying operating interface. When her life's needs are just a few moronic game? Yes, playing games is fun, but what's the point when you're almost hungry? While she spends her life, her dog runs her dog (probably at least for a moment to look for the owner and feed it regularly) while playing a very sharp-hot, dirty full-immersion video game. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, -The playing team has lost an all-inaccessible film. Yawn. So she wants to be the best of all, take them to Ash Catchchem (all of us). Goli, the main character also embraces the human being and does not have the evasive features of her physical beauty (she can transfer her in some ways to avoid her subdued poverty). <br /> <br /> She is a "real" level and it is, at least, sent to kill the former comatos mate who lives mentally on terrible sucks and her "real" level. Finally the Sickie Boring Blonde orange-tinted film is no longer a tedious task to watch, but there is the ability to say something along the lines of "The main character is trapped by imaginative computer poverty and she is now in the real world". Perhaps she made a murdered document and now lives in a real world? Well, she kills her and he disappears in a digital influence. Wow! Thank you idiotic director. <br /> <br /> Here's the director of this lousy bloated dirty cruddy movie with a philosophical twist by the director of the iota of the possibility to redeem himself by the cemetery. <br /> <The director said, "If there is REAL WORLD and you contribute to it and improve it, it's not some crude orange-tinted poverty land." This is a brilliant way to make a peek-takler movie of primary civic pride (watching this time or 1% of the film-masochists that somehow does not appear). <br /> Director. The director came to nail all of this by destroying all the chances of flipping out of some cruddy digital effects and all the money freed for this awful lousy movie which is waste of waste, time waste, and viewer trust. br> After that, it ends. Good luck. I hope the director dares to do it. I've put this hack in the list of "all expenses" in any other movie with my name.
