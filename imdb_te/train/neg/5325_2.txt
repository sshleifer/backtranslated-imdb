Critic from Poland should be a feminine, because she recognizes that "Young Catherine" is a great film and historically accurate. There is nothing more out of truth. Over the years, I have been exempt from YC at almost every turn while practicing as a Russian historian for years, and specifically for her politically correctly portrayed Russia in the direction of dominance. The truth? She was brought to St Petersburg as a wife and mother, and found that she had "bond" to survive Dvorion, fools and the army. Although she did not challenge them, she was able to drown her cultural cravings (filling hermetically with art funding). She has many standards that she is "not great", but this modern-day modern revision is not very popular in the verification area. YC 1986 was like "Peter the Great", an example of how Russia was portrayed in the West, from Ted Turner to a fluffy blob.
