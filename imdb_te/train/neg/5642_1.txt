The title appears to be filmed rather than a film released to be released by the public. It was fun to work with Duffy and his wife for the first time in a film, without feeling that people could see it. <br /> <br /> "This film is enough to fit in the film" <br /> <br /> When I first saw 'arti' movies and it does not come as artificial, abstract or original, it seems to me to be fully understood, the film is only 18 people ages 10. We have to keep in mind that this film is throwing in to the romantic scenes If you can call it romantic, it certainly does not taste.
