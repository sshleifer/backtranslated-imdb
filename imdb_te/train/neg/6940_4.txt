When you have two towers filled with one another, you can imagine it as an amazing cameraderie and we are in love at the age of 64 at the age of 64, Amitabh Bachchan. Wait! In fact, it is the name of the plot instead of "cheena", the writer-director R. Balkie's virgin attempt to write "Come" to this commander. <br /> <br /> Two senior actors with their wise-fractures and bitter-sweet moves The house is in love with this exceptional couple, and it is all that you will find in the first half of the slow but refreshing. The London area captured during monsoons is attractive. By the end of the first half, the romance is complete and the mission is accomplished. There is not much left to say. A strange opposition in the second half comes to a test of patience in the form of the girl's father to the extent that he goes for a satire. There is an equally strange climax on how he is given. As a result, the second half is dry, flat, with no force. A girl who dies with cancer does not relieve her child. However, the film is recommended for its latest approach and performances.
