The film is named Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who play for Speed ​​For Speed, most people do not mention hot cars and beautiful women and almost the plot. This applies exactly to Redline. A-Level There are only cars about this film. Acting seemed to be forced and scripted, the best of the premises, and the plot is not nearly the same. It's very bad when I see how bad it really is and how bad it is. And at least it was fun. I showed Eddie Griffin Enzo crashed somewhere in the film. All in all, do not pay it, do not go out of your way to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there's nothing, it's a good distraction.
