The film is a computational attempt to earn money in City and Four Weddings and a Funeral in Sex Victory. In fact, they might have done a good job at the box office, in a graveyard called sex. <br /> <br /> The film fell between two wrist. The characters have a vague bright dialogue, but do not take any actions that are remotely recognizable as human form. <br /> <br /> Andy McDowell has received acting for his little heart consciousness, but the performances honors all things, a police detective (they do not need the height there?), stolen by Imelda Staunton. Ms Staunton seems unable to make a false move. <br /> If Notting Hill suffers you as a bogus, stay away from it. Phonas bolognas on half shell.
