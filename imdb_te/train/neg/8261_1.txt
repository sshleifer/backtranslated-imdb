I waited for watching this movie and realized that any hope of coherent dialogue among the actors was a booster of unnecessary swearing. Now I am not ashamed of any kind, but it is not a good movie to look at each other. Ivan Bremerner is one of the worst actors of this time (his performance in Stuff's divine life) and his "cockney" voice is almost as bad as his Edinburgh tone. Avoid. "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" and "Beautiful Creatures" are never bothered before filmmakers realize that the fay-word, c-word, etc., do not replace the correct conversation.
