The film was produced by Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Hoon is a fascinating factor, giving spectacular entertainment. But this is a very predictable reason for the movie. Everything we've seen before. I did not read the book A Mother's Gift, but it is different for the Britney and Linny Spears. If you do not necessarily consider a music video to close a movie with an original idea, the whole picture brings to mind the words.
