French film critics (especially snobbish khayers audiences), which I saw a long time ago, was pretty disappointed (I have read in about years how great this film was, and expectations are sky high). In saturated black and white films, this was intentionally stated in the form of dialogue between the artists of the Cerebral Film (made for TV, and compassionally, just over an hour) and they saw a series of films (shown in Table of Voids style) and some of the hidden political offenses Try to find them if they have credentials. (This is the same argument that Kate Beckinsale has uncovered). Borgesian is one of the most read reviews of the film, but it is interesting with almost any Bourgeon story than the film.
