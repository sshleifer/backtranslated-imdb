The spectacular "Z" channel in Los Angeles showed the Pia Zadora movie about six months or "Butterfly". <br /> Again, at the age of 80, I said that Harold Robin's writing was cleverly concealed by the writers. . Jacqueline Susan (hated her way of writing her women) holds Irvin Shawn's work with many women, and at the end of 70 years Sydney Sheldon had her empire at the end of the 80s and later women became strong and equal to Jackie Collins. In her books, , More and more. Why this work is damaged. In 80's, Harold Robin's work did not just catch the audience. Pia Jodora, who played one of Robin's work, was to throw a gun on a volcano. The supporting cast did not help. <br /> Ohoh ... look it up and it's even worse 20 years later. I have a hope for Pia as an actress, and when it's finished, it's all over. <br /> <br /> Hey, Pia, it's hard for me to release her wife as she is (but John Waters has her in her "hasspr√®s"), where you come to go! Join the show. <br /> <br /> I would like you to burn this movie earlier.
