Sakura Killers (1+ out of 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this movie would seem nice ... if you do not see * good * ninja movie ever. Cheesy '80s music ... cheesy dialog ... cheesy acting ... and way-out cheesy martial arts scenes. The coolest scene is in the start ... An elderly Chuck Connors is playing golf on a beach ... Nenjas, wearing a lot of black, tries to inspire him and he has a great purpose to watch his ball ... Suddenly he reached his golf bag and ... I can not spoil it for you ... if you're unfortunate to see this movie Thank you. The story has a lot of nonsense about some stolen video tape or something. A group of dime-bulb Caucasian leaders is trained in ninja routes because "a ninja can only fight a ninja" or something like that. Strangely, these guys do not seem to fight any better after their training than before ... oh well, the picture will move along pretty briskly. Combat sequences are not great .. but they are plentiful ... and some chuckles are good for overdone sound effects.
