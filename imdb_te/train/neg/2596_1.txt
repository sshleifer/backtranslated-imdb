Dear God! I'm looking forward to "launching" for this movie ... I'm waiting for it to redeem itself ... and I'm sitting when it's done, it's frustrating: 1) It's probably this bad and 2) I'm just just a couple of hours on perfect stupidity That's wasted. I'm confident that Drew did not make this movie bad ... and boy, I've always lost my faith! Do not worry about this! Drew tried, but the film was poorly written, poorly acted, and just poorly emerged! I can not believe this script is always a sublime script! It just puffled! Other reviewer got the idea that it was not the worst, baffles me! Because I believe, no worse I'd love to have my wrist split before I finished!
