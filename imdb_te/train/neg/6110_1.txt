Bo Jane Parker, whose long-lost anthropologist is father (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very staggering career) has some or another study in Africa. She leads him down (how?) And he can hear stories of his monster's monsters in the forest at night. Anne Man himself (Miles O'Keefe, Miles O'Keeff), who protects her from the evil man, and she falls in love with her horny monkey and cheers. Generally I am very open-minded for different opinions about any movie, but this is the only exception. This is a picture taken so far. If you do not agree, you do not see. (Notes: Newsday called it "inseparable", which is one of the best word that I think is that it is thought that the Multiin Movie Guide will have a lower rating than BOMB.)
