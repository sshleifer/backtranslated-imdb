You can see that you are playing in two scenes by chemist and Stephen King. The standard thing to say "do not give your day job", but it's not fair. The King makes him objective: he is worse than the other members of the cast, and far better than that. The story, on the other hand, is pure garbage. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a lot of embarrassing performances from my father - the main actor (Led Gary's!) is probably the worst - one has joined together in the film. Everyone is acting brutally, but not entertaining; Manage to go over the top without having to spend somehow, or even power. I blamed the story writer / director Tom Holland. It's not that the actors really are this bad. What is the odds against that? When I tried, I could walk into a talent agency and walk with these many bad performers, although I've never heard of them before, but my actor, despite my best efforts, must have the talent. So what's possible - is Tom Holand rolled up a serpentine serpent eyes, or he wrote a lousy script and that it was poorly directed? It also explains why the actors are inaccurate to their importance in the script. The actor is more and more, his worst. <br /> "Speaking from the back of my throat, talking from behind my throat, showing all my teeth and getting bored, at the same time everything?" The theory confirmed that the fact that Holland managed to co-write a lousy script is irrevocable. There are many writers here commenting on the fact that Billy Halek is not a preferred character, but this is a misleading way. He is not a notable character. Before all of the supernatural things happen he finds all about him that he is fat, and that he is all about food to think about. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think it will be a good thing for you. Yes, perhaps it's probably not "unpredictable" by "bad" - it's not as bad as the socially undesirable suspension of the common man's psychology, at any time, his actions do not mean at all, no actions are meaningless, and <br /> <br /> Here is the hammiest line / delivery My nominee: "In the fact that I do not think you like ..." [big dramatic break] ". I do not think you like it at all. "
