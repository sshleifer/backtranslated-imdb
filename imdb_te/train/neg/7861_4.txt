The epicenter of this awaited sequel is good and I think most of the time after the remake's huge success. <br /> <br /> This tragic fact is that the film is truly absurd and ineffective. <br /> <br /> This time, there are no characters or violinists who love to be remade. <br /> <br /> Except violence, it is not really bad. <br /> <br /> Violence is very low and it is very insulting because there are a number of arguments that you think are facing serious violence. I mean, there is a SWAT team with a family hunt for cannibals. You expect something else! <br /> <br /> This is a clear example of how the films are shocking and demonstrate poor quality on all aspects. <br /> A mess that leaves the remake fans like me. That's why sequels are not welcomed; At least this film is not as horrible as the original 1985 sequel.
