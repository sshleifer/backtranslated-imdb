How did it become blockbuster? I do not know why God has done this to the beloved God. The film is speculative & realistic. The only thing I admire is the acting of some characters. The picture is very bright, they should have done something with lighting, eg. The environment becomes more dark. Some dead roles design The film was a 1970s horror film. It's 2006! Other people who wear heavily are not afraid of other people. There are lots of horror scenes we've taken from Hollywood or Asian horror movies. Rip off the whole! I do not see Taglag films. The reason why many "shouts" are the reason why they are watching this movie. How many times do we copy the scenes from the ring and see what comes out of the window instead of the girl coming from the TV? Even if you keep doing it, it's still a ripe off.
