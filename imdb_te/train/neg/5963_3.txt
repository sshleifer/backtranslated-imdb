The film starts with the implementation of witchcraft and his mistress. His head is cut into pieces and buried separately from his body ... Did not say "dead"? Well do not play as little as that, but once the body is back on the head, all the interesting and gruesome deaths are complete and the picture moves very slowly. I am only 88 minutes of the movie and I'm thinking "when will not the end"? Most of the characters in the film are highly desirable for idiots and they die for being very stupid. When he moves slowly, the villain is also very bad and really thinks he is afraid of jewelry. The only thing you see after reaching the head is the fact that there are so many flubs that are flashed that you really begin to lose track. Still I want to see a horror movie, like a soft core porn movie and a horror movie it's somewhat enjoyable slow way of moving with a very slow stretch path. Do not read the back of the box as it did as there were zombies eating the meat that was attacking the town ... Three or four zombies attacked a house and a small scene where they could easily be repulsed is not an item in the film and their scene is rather meaningless. So for the most part I say you should avoid this film unless you come across it really cheap.
