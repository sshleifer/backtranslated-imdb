Thomas Clay is mixing with false types. <br /> <br /> These days young people are getting into trouble and they do not respect them. <br /> <br /> The film must avoid all costs. The action in the main part of the film is ambles of crazed drugs with the ending as the slower and stodgy and it's director, it has to go better where the action is. We're introducing the main title role of the outer guy, not having a difficult feeling in most adolescents and at home in school. Robert struggled with bad franchises and started missing school and started taking medications and he was mentally depressed before you knew it. <br /> <br /> The film is about Clay's complete failure to understand the relationship between violent and violent acts. Clay seems to be bad for the brutal youth generation of war on our TV shows. He was also the most frustrated in the violence he played. <br /> <br /> If Clay does not see YouTube, is he innocent and did nothing with the scene of his cruel climax in his film? I'm sure someone needs to see a very soft scene from the end of the film and sticks with people. <br /> <br /> In the rest of the film, the violence is not enough to clay. To destroy only the young people who are actively involved in fighting the war, to insult all those who are seriously and indiscriminate violence.
