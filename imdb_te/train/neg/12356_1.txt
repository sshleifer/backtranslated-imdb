Watching this movie is wasting time. I was searched to go out in the middle of the film, but I refused. I do not know what Ridley Scott intended, but I realized that in the army, women would get stupid as men. They learn to laugh, insult and fight in battle, and it will also waste time (in my opinion). And, of course, what is the last scene in Libya? Is it easy for everyone to fight Gaddafi or believe that it is always dangerous for all the people of Islam?
