Michael Rooker is a good actor, but he does not have a business except for a low budget film. He is not really very attractive. Ryo Ishibashi has a very screen presence, and sadly he is not really the main character. <br /> <br /> Daniel Harris (from Hollywood 4 and 5 movies) plays his daughter, and she is beautiful and fun but she gets one of the main characters killed and one of her mute mistakes. Comedians Fred Willard, Bob Coldwid and Stephen Furst are in the lead roles. It is precious to see what happens to these characters. <br /> <br /> Vincent Shiavelli plays the role of conigliamer for the local mafia godfather, and it's hard to say whether it's acting as a comedy. Tim Thomson is also in the film. He is in every low-budget live-video-video action movie. Thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. Many comedians and comedians see it in the film and it feels like a hypocrite. Is this a simulator of Yakuza movie? It is difficult to say at some points. There is definitely very little Yakuza action. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast of Thugs and Goons is scary and well cast. Some of these films include Thugs, such as those working as stock boys at the local comic book store or Pigley-Wiggle. Overall, the film is very uneven. At some points it is comedy or ridiculous. Then it acts as a good action movie in other matters. Then spray it to the end. Without the works of Daniel Harris and Rio Isabii, the film will rate Zero in my humble opinion.
