I saw that all other reviews in the film were "wholesome" and "entertaining". These people often come out of the house. I do not know why they're sharing for these vapid, odorless, fascinating pieces. Pat Boon does not have any acting talent, and his disadvantage is his co-star Pamela Austin, a former model (unluckily a day of unlawful practice for a fraudulent practice of conquering unskilled protagonists on a legitimate moving public). A good assistant cast (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortian, among others) tries to make some sense in this regard, but does not use it. "Credit" is not the word I used (not the director) but I saw that two directors shared credit. "Entertainment for Entertainment" does not need to bring all of these films without being tortured to them, find one of those pictures, and skip it.
