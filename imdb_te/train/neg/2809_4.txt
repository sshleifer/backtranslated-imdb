When I look back at my college days at the University of Ohio there is an event that always remembers the fanatical memories. Channel 23 is the local access channel of the OU and for the last few years, they have played a very good role. <br /> <br /> The king is, in my opinion, the Channel 23 line-up is Midnight Skater. The first time I saw it was around 2AM. I have to study. Or sleep. Or looking at the regular TV. But that is all for those pussies. My roommate and I saw a midnight skater, and when this was done, I believe that any of us have done a movie. <br /> <br /> This is what happened in the last few nights. In fact, we had to catch that film. <br /> <br /> What a terrible thing I have, a life-saving lifestyle. The plot is confusing, the acting is terrible, everything is the soul spots, but god, if you are watching others, it is impossible to have a good time watching it. Chak Pahalakshak "Guts" is the first time you listen. You listen and move, and five minutes later, getting the horror horror experience you endure for whatever you want and desire. <br /> <br /> Long story short, Midnight Skater makes all of its epic disorders, too late night fun. Plus, I desperately want a midnight skater theme. Whoever wrote it, sang it. Sweet God I love that song.
