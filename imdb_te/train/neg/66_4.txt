I thought that I was impressed by the story and the leading actor in the film, so I gave a chance from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Solzers). Mainly, Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) police specially set up Superintendent Francis Herr (Geoffrey Rush), who is going to set up a gang and attack them to clear his own and his family names. This is really about the story because I do not care to be honest to be honest. Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts, Laurence Kynlin, Steve Hart, Don Kelly, Philip Bourtini Stein Hart, Joel Edgerton, Constable Fitzpatrick, Kieri Pyormor, Kate Kelly, Emily Browning, Grace Kelly Susan Scott Rachel Griffiths. Ledger has a very good performance, it is valuable and the film has moments of eye catching, especially at the end of the gun battle, but I can not say I enjoyed it because I can not see it. OK!
