I said again: This film is totally dull. Kids will be sure of it, but adults ... skeptical. The whole thing is that they have explored pretty much the whole concept in the first film, but still, is it a rehash, originally expected, because they got the whole movie completely rehash? I mean, everything will be returned from the little mermaid. The worst part is that Morgana "Ursula's Crazy Sister" looks out of nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous since Triton has been with her magic trident. Why did Triton do nothing about it? Because the plot does not need to do anything to him. I have gone, but I'm not. The whole thing is a shameless attempt to earn more money from the little mermaid, and knowing that it was sold, clearly thrown together without any thought. Overall, this is a time of horrible waste.
