The film is based on history and believes that it is such a painful bad movie. Last night I was in the European premier and one of the executive producers. He is still surprised by the boy and still watching the movie. I do not read this book and I do not know whether it is well rated or appreciated, but I've read "Captain Corellis Mandolin" and how it got on screen and I gave the movie how bad it is, here's something to expect here. Acting is not as bad as having a couple of far-fetched eyebrows from the farm. Honestly, I can not believe that I have played a role in this film. At the same time the empty sequence appears on the screen on the screen. Donald Sutherland's part is that he has some scenes that open some doors, tells something and closes it again. I was watching my watch when sharpening the conversation on the screen. I never went to a movie but I was searching for this time. I gave the '2' score for the film, but it's because I'm afraid of it, but it's the best thing to say about this film. For the first time I experienced a whole lot of earthquake scene, and Salma Hayek became nude and looked beautiful. I can say a little bit about this movie. Do not ask dust, it can not talk!
