OK, I liked the idea of ​​this movie. I'm in the age group, and I've found some stories. <br /> <br /> Sometimes in a frivolous and meaningful conversation there is semi realism, and there is a forgery in another movie. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to make this movie worse like others. It's not easy when filmmakers are trying everything. <br /> The editing of the film is terrible! Probably the worst editing ever seen in a movie! <br /> You do not have to go to a movie school you have to learn, good editing is not one of them, but a bad guy. Shots are god, just awful! I can not even go into the details, but we can sometimes just create random things, and that, along with editing, gives you a very painful image view experience. <br /> <br /> There is no need for a cast or a band with a cast of 4 or any budget. I saw small images on YouTube with a lot of artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what you're thinking, but this film is not just a handy experiment of your allies. You must be shy! In conclusion, this is like what would be a really lazy amateur romantic movie if the film is filled with long boring conversations and 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by a disgusting masturbation. If it's not your kind, avoid it with all the costs!
