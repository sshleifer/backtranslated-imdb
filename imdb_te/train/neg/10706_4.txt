Wow and I thought that any Steven Segal movie is bad. Every time I thought the movie was not bad, it proved to be wrong. This story is good but the actors could not stop it. Moreover, they made a lot of mistakes about how the correct archeological zones took place. For example, you do not have to handle the artkonds untill that are catologed and counted. The biggest offense in casting is the Archaeologist Girl. I thought she was a weak actress and her acting was really less realistic. The whole concept of the Knights Templer Underground in these years seemed very stupid to me. I love the idea that they are disappearing, and that is so discouraging. I think the characters are not correctly explained. You could not find a lot of background and made it hard for them.
