DVD 666 (POSSESSED aka UK) is another sub-par slasher that has a simple DVD movie look. <br /> <br /> When writing, each comment on the first page contains negative rating and negative review. . Each of these people hit the nail on the head. <br /> <br /> There are two people who have commented 10 out of 10 people (at the time of writing) should not be considered seriously. Apparently they have seen a few slasher movies and have more limited perception of horror. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can do about this film is that it is CHOKE and better than one of them. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film has taken thousands of times, but must have never been. The general expectations in this film are only slightly twist (and badly maintained). The depressed singer committed suicide. A few days later, her soul has one of her survivors. The friend who said this would go in the case of killing. The rest of the plot is really overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Most of the performance in this film is very poor. This exception is the actress who plays Dora. Her character was always interesting and sophisticated when she was on the screen. She helps to build a picture above contemporary trials. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, some of the lines she gave were written to keep it bad and prevented her from preserving the film. <br /> The direction is poorly equipped. The villains are at least bit menacing, every killing suspense or tension is not completely, the atmosphere does not exist and the camera work is very basic. Some of the special effects (if you can call them) TV series, GHOST stories remind me. Unfortunately for the film's producers, GHOST stories have sophisticated scripts, credible displays, and make amazing use of camera angles. <br /> <br /> If the producers look closely to the TV series, they have chosen a few other techniques that are not required for this film! <br /> <br /> The film tone is not completely music. It's not just rock music and the best examples of this type. <br /> <br /> Some of the elements of this film, particularly the dialogue, are unexpectedly funny. Unfortunately they are not good at the movie (or it should be down). It's very bad-good level. <br /> <br /> Overall, Studio 666 is a little less noteworthy worldly slasser. I have a desire to watch every single slasher I've ever been a fan of DVD movies and so far.
