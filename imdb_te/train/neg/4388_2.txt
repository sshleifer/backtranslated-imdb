Oh man, I know your idea: "With this title, I can not do it wrong!" Yes you can. I also liked the title, but man hated the stupid kid I played "even the Satan's little helper" I hate too mom, and sister / daughter, and her boyfriend - I hated those people! Man, this is sometimes looking agony! The only reason this 1/10 can not get is because the less budget condsidering becuz, they did OK. But Oh man I hated those actors, so stupid! I know I'm bad, I guess they've saved a lot of money on using Halloween masks for the killer, even if the dress of Jesus is very stupid. Oh torture, do not look!
