There are some stallone movies I like, but this film does not correspond to my low expectations. I believe this movie was hard. For example, a group of terrorists crashing land in the jungle is ready for survival for at least two days. In addition, Stallone and the company are running across bridges and ladders that provide comfortable cuts or plots in the woods. Also, the Treasury cops do not seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When I was younger, <br /> <br /> The price of a rental is not valuable, it does not disregard the time.
