I was supposed to be so bad that this movie was so funny, I went into it with the hope of that. I found that I was boring to be boring is very bad. The whiny theme song is about 10 seconds funny until you know that it is intentionally intuitive, and there is nothing intelligent about it. Tomatoes get old in about 30 seconds. There is nothing clever or funny about this film except for the campus. It can last a 3-4 minute comedy sketch, but this is not just a movie by speculation.
