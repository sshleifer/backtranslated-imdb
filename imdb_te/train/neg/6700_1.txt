Hollywood's teachings are often fragmented and confusing. <br /> <br /> Here you will learn the art of your finger with someone without losing your trademark smirk. You will learn how to shrug the logic and science with the powerful arguments of fear. <br /> <br /> When you find the gateway to the planet Armageddon you will learn how to stop any human activity that is not of interest to you. <br /> <br /> Let's learn how to lie with a straight face. Look forward to the allegations that you are not clear about your way. <br /> If you are Amish you can use force like Al Gore. <br /> <br /> We have visited other Hollywood deities, your names are pure, and the audit - that is, the judge - their lifestyle.
