After reading comments on the site I was forced to write for the first time. The film is similar to the marmet. I agree that I do not want movies to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they're still engaged in the characters. Now when I fully understood the lesbian affair that killed in Lynch's writing, I said I would not be working hard on this greenhouse or other cardboard gangsters living in the world today. <br /> Also, many people try and say that you can not enjoy it, but I do not agree - I'm frustrated because I did not enjoy it. I wanted to finish the film and never listened to those quotes and did not help again. <br /> <br /> However, my other main reason for my other writers asked me is that there is no end to the film print that I have seen. . Only music on black. Did I see a rubbish print or this evidence of GR's nakedness? Or, everyone involved in the film did not watch the tough cut and removed their name ???
