I have found some interesting things about this movie - I saw a 4-hour roadshow version, how weirdly weird. Castro and Che, for an image of 2 attractive men engaged in a predominantly political struggle, this is not nearly the emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio del Toro and Demian Bicher (who are the second-highest-pitched voice with a slightly pitch voice) do not have any drama or depth, and Basic Castro has to say: Go to here, no explanation, no explanation, no explanation. Contrary to the still cast Castro - casting star that has the power needed to play Joaquim de Almeddaa, but he is the second half of shunted next to a small part. Without tension or passion that you would like to fire these men and their followers, the film turns into a red tape film, hair and bearded men walk in different jungles, with no specific intention or ending. Many reviews of the full praise of director Steven Soderbergh's work are virtually ignored by almost all actors. (It actually took a long time to talk about Soderbergh's new digital film camera in the plot or actors or English subtitles completely in Spanish). A Soderbog in a rented gun film and b) New York's black and white cut-up camera-work in Oliver Stone To the JFK's competence of work that is unacceptable Not more than ogam. If you can guess the Reds directed by Andrew McLaughlin instead of Warren Betty, you will know about the film's dull merit.
