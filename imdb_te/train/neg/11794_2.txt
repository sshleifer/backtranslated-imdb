Average Size-Finn Channel Original Image. A small subscription, but a lot. Nuclear-based submarine U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is located on a mission below the icy snow near the North Pole. A member of the crew (Simone Jade McManon) created a way to communicate with her monsters, but did not give much vulnerability to vague reasons. The staff include David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Valen. If the Eales / Demons were not cartoony, the film was somehow better.
