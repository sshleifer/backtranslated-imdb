Historically accurate? Oops ... maybe ... if you're getting squashed and the light comes on this topic. But core accuracy is not a tedious, disorganized and unstable plot, cardboard dialogue and compensation for unsatisfactory resolution. The main characters are just characters; Embarrassing stereotypes are 'troublesome and elite' from American Indians to 'physical but vile' to British officers. The wretched and inefficient composition of a lovely period in American history. I need my money back.
