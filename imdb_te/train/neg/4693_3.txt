This film is very difficult for me. Great cast, great director, great storytelling potential, then they destroy all with a screenplay that goes somewhere ... and go there and say nothing! There is no depth here. The characters are not depth, the plot is not any depth, surprise, suspense, or common sense. We know what happened, we have told you how to solve the problem, they will solve the problem, at the end of us we can not be surprised, fail to produce the suspense and then they will end up in the picture. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the cast of Glenn Ford's UK (and a French) cast is all fantastic, so they do a great job with a dimensional work. One of the hugely favorite Harbert Walton "Old Charlie", offers some amazing bits humor and warmth in a dark and intense film. <br /> <br /> Even though the actors are the best, the director is very happy, it is not enough for me to spend time watching the movie. Glenn Ford films are very well: The Big Heat, Gilda, Trinidad Affair, etc.
