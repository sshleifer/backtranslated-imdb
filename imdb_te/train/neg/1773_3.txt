Oh dear! Rarely a "horror" film bored me, or made me laugh a lot like this. After getting a thrilling start with an exciting arcade, it is more than just a psychic and sexy, more than a slazer picture. Usually the wonderful Alice Craig is ruined in this, and the plot turns are ridiculous. Do not bother until you're really disappointed. Rating: 3/10.
