First, the actors who have big names need money ... the surgical scenes are ridiculous ... and surely they have little understanding that this is totally absurd .... Do not leave the room when the anesthesiologists do not leave the heart .... or practice, heart Do you have surgery in a small room without lung equipment and cleaning methods ... just a joke All the stupid surgical scenes ... any blood, no staff, and then the hero doc and take it ... This is not a film thinking of adults ... Budget must be limited ... street scenes are ok but Who is the technical advisor .... It seems that the whole idiot is directed .. Wait for your money and wait until the DVD is out and Deku take ..
