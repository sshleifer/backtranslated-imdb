I ended watching this movie and Wow is bad. The original was watching me, though it was kind of fun but it was bad. They're fun, from the dramatic way to the dungeon, to their inexorable actions (as they enter you are going to try and shoot anyone through a door If, sure thing shoot straight at doorknob !!). <br /> <br /> The camera work is also very bad - you can not see what's going on in the scenes of the fight due to switching to camera angles and shakiness. /> <br /> I am just entertaining with some scenes, not just like Chiba and Sidekick Sue Shimmy. 1) The king came out of the bone skin by breaking the villain's arm 2) a drug kingpin eating a brown-sliced ​​animal (a monkey ??) by hacking away at the dead with a meat cleber 3) Sony Chiba had some impromptu eye on his fingers Surgical performance. <br /> <br /> I'm actually a big fan of Sony Chiba but it's not worth anybody. I have seen about 7 or 8 of his films and are worth only to see them (and they are great!) Street Fighter series, and The Killing Machine. I'm also excited and 13 who have heard Golgo are good. I recommend that sticking them out.
