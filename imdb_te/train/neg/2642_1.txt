Slowly, slowly, slowly ... there is no mystery or excitement in this film. If you do not recognize the "mole" in the first ten minutes you will die brain. To get it together they took the whole picture because the secret service should be very much. There are no compelling roles in the film (not the movie). The speed of the film is slow, there is no tension. The hired killer is an excellent shot unless all he seems to be able to hit big big pans of glass unless he is targeting Michael Douglas. The ridiculous scene in the movie is when the code terminates at the end of the president's wife's all-out. It's loud ridiculous. At least six people got up and opened the film. When I was not in the middle of the row, I joined them. I do not recommend this picture to anyone.
