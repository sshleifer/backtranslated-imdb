The film is like a thousand "cat and mouse" films. The intriguing, intellectual and intellectual character is the first and the opposite of his first attempt with ridiculous commentary, but soon the inevitable "chance" love story, the captive of the loved ones, and of course his brutal servicemen Gorgeous Lady Moth inducing careless evil rival So. Everyone has already seen tons of these films, and the "National Treasure" is like one of them, only slightly edited. Each turn of the story is easily assessed (and I can assure you that I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed). I'm so tired of feeling fraudulent for money after I leave the Hollywood movie theater, and if you ever feel like that, try my warning; Stay miles away from this movie.
