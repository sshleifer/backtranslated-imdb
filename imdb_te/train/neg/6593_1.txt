Even if it is remotely funny, the model wax of this film is still obscene. Turning the boy's corpses and restoring the weekend at Bernie is just short But only one? Producer Larry Harman and Fergin 'Ernest' director of the film uses a copyrights copyright to suppress Stan and Olly's legacy. Gailard Sartain makes a fair Ali impersonation, but Branson Pinchot can not reach the tenth place in a Stan LookLike contest; If they were two places on the film, it would be less hateful. Less is less about the environmental disaster. 'Utopia' makes it an honorable swan song.
