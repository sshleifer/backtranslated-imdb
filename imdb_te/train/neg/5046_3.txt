The bridge directed the magnificent constructive Zhang Ziyani, in a fantastic role in a terrorist group in China in 1928, for the Japanese in a magnificent role with Manchuria before the Japanese invasion, and now working with a former lover. The play's drama and early mobility each bit director sings a sommulist directorial style of a loue. The characters stand at each other for longer, even if the characters do not exist, and the hand-held cameras are never in the face of reactions leading to reactions, while repeating the reaction is triple redundancy. The story starts and the story does not know anything about the stories that begin with, the only lovers who talk not only interact with silence and static shots, silent dances but share a clear emotional intimacy. Very sleep-inspiring image.
