2007 Comedies: Superb, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades of Glory <br /> <br /> 2007 comedies I hate: Ivan Almighty, The Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck <br /> <br / > I followed my first nature and took a "hot rod" with a 20 minute mark. I know that this film has never made me laugh. The script is utterly cruel - does not know how this monstrosity cracks managed IMDb 6. <br /> It's clear that Andy does not come close to Will Farell, Andy does not take longer than Samberg. 5 to 10 minutes sketch on YouTube or SNL. I do not know why Ian McShane and Isla Fisher come into this film ... they have to pay off or something. I got to know that it was a dumb picture, but I thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> I usually comment on movies in IMDb, but it's terrible, I warned people. The 4th film I saw was thought to be forcing me to rate 1/10.
