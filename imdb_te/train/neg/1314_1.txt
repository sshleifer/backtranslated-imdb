This is the worst piece of garbage I have seen lately. Nothing is good about this movie. This plot does not make any sense of silly stupid, dialogues, humorous scenes never heard of true humor. Actors just do not play, they may not even try. This script is also somewhat similar, and is in the same league with Ed Wood and Uva Boll. There is only one good thing in the film, fighting. They dance very well to expect people from Hong Kong, and the only reason for watching the Sun Prince. I think the fighters just fill in a blank space because the hero does not bother about the story writer. However, this weak and absurd plot can prevent you from seeing it eventually. Avoid it if you're a fan of Dragon Lady Cynthia Rothrock.
