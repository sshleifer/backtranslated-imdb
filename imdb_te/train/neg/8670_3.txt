Imagine making all the actions and suspense of filmmakers to make children friendly, as a James Bond novel was to be converted into a movie. Or a televised producer, Chris Rock, said that he had his own unique PG. Similarly, the director of the movie director "Is Wing This Way Comes" took on the excitement and gore for the young audience. It created a monotonous plot without the issue of the book. When filmmakers attempted to create a story of "Some Wicked This Way" to follow the children, filmmakers eliminated both the good and the bad in all, and the good always prevailed over evil. Will's character's transformation, protecting Jim's of Charles Hallowe and this is clearly visible in Carnival's defeat. <br /> Vil's variant muted in a more adventurous boy. The scene from which Dust Witch visits Will's house in a balloon is cut from the movie. Instead, a green fog follows the gym and will give the same bad dream about Will and the Witch and her spiders. The balloon attack shows us that our own assignments began to conquer our fear. He casts a balloon tear with a witch on the roof of a neighbor and witch. "Sorry, Dad, he thought, was smiling and laughing." This time he wants me to be alone. "(147.) The scene from Will is to be remade from the Will, which shows a lot of examples of what we are afraid of following the gym, but his friend does not get interested in. In the book, Will is on a good, silent side and" Nasty, "chivalrous, like his gym. <br /> <br /> In this film, every boy has a broadband background that has both good and bad for each individual <br /> <br /> In the book, they save Jim because of their friendship, in the film, Charles Hallowe saves Jim to pay Jim's father back, because he does not want his best friend to grow up because of the carousel in the Bradbury novel It's good in Will, he cares about his friend Jim saves Jim from the evil curse of Carnival, Carmello, Jim "On the other hand, in the air, a part of his, small, white, special part recalls their friendship" (269), which is still able to defeat the gym. Charles Halloway saves the gym in the movie, where he will have to pay the loan to Jim's father, who will save Will when he is a little boy. By changing the impulse to save Jim, filmmakers split Bradbury's original idea to be a good success. <br /> <br /> At the end, carnival will be defeated by a tornado and lightning. Smile and laugh. When the book ends, Mr. Dark turns himself into a little boy and smiles Charles Halloway and he laughs so much that it does not stand up and evaporate. In the world of Bradbury, bad people lose fear and lose only by joy and love. His message is always good on evil, but the courtesy is exposed. Charles Halloway says that Mr Drek, who is dying, feels "good for bad is bad". "I'll do better for you, Zed, I'll take you and see you'll see you" (275.), in the picture, Mr. Dark sparks only on the carousel when he strikes. By removing the weapons of laughter and smiles, filmmakers suggest that the crafty man is the most effective way to hit the bad and destroy the evil. <br /> This removes the main theme of Badbury's book, "better" for others, and pushes others to the side. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ In the film, "This Trouble Occurs," Will Will Not Be Changed, Will's Friendship Will Not Save The Gym, And Smiles And Laughter Carnival Will Not Win. As a result, filmmakers are far from Bradbury's mainstream themes. The process of converting a book to a movie will most often destroy the world of the author's founding. In this story, Broadbury's frightening world of rival forces of good and evil has been reduced to a simplified version.
