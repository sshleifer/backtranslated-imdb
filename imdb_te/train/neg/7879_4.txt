First, I loved the book Animal Animals. I read with my 9th grade class, it's great. We have decided that it is good to see this film. This film was very disappointing to me. The film reduces some of the characters, and misses the main feelings of the book. It revolves around a lot, and does not explain anything in detail. If anyone is watching the movie without reading the book first, they will be confused. The most disappointing thing in this film is that I ended up. The ending in the book is the most powerful, and in the picture they changed it! It is necessary to have pigs and men in an alliance and some sort of "melting", but instead the animals appear to be rebellious against pigs. In total, I captured the original meaning of the film portraying the film Orwell in his book.
