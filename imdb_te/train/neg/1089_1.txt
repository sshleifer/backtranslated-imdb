What's with Robert "Pretenseous" Altman? Was he saved on lighting? Everything is so dark in this boring movie. <br /> Have you ever seen a lawyer's office that works by candlelight everyone? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. In fact, Altman does not waste your time on it: it's all a pretentious waste of film.
