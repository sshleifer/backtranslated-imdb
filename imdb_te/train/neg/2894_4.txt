I agree with the problem with eeling images that I have seen very high. For my taste, they are black and inexplicably funny, or tone with ease of humor or stories. <br /> <br /> The self-important way of saying "I'm a man in the white suit", but it's hard for me to sit in its short period of time. <br /> <br /> Textile worker Sidney Straatton (Alec Guinness) is humble, but he is committed to progress in his efforts to find a piece of fabric that can not be broken or dirty. By using a factory laboratory for his latest experiment, he has to struggle on physical and human limitations - the latter does not understand what he is, and does not recognize it, and is more committed to stop him. <br /> <br /> "The man in white suit" is the focus of Sydney's progress, rather than the heroes or workers who are unhappy with his work Think too little. My problem is more material: for the comedy, the "white suit" is not funny. <br /> <br /> It tries to weaken weak humor from spit-takes, double-takes, triple-teaks, and dizzy take. <br /> <br /> The sound of the best joke machine takes Sydney's sidewalks, "Bleep-Blob-Bleep-Bop", ending up Sydney, extracting its echo or trying to quire each visitor until it throws up. The functions decently decently in this picture, it's too long. <br /> <br /> I think that Guinness is less likely to be influenced in a movie, even though he looks impregnable young and ecstatic (but never actually seen in his 30th). He looks more aggressive than wax faces are the same cold fish, despite the fact that he's ignoring the sad love of the mill mill girl who presents him to give her life savings when he loses his job. It's the same cold fish (Vine Hoop Bertha as Fawn) or young Daphne Birnely (Jon Greenwood), more grievous mantras, her "soap Photos and dust "in the fight against his true friend, she said, the words /> <br /> The supporting players seem sexy <br" White Suit "will work as well. Ernest Thessinger of the "Bride of Frankenstein" fame plays a nasty Capture character of the industry that looks like Nasferatu and makes fun of death rattles. Another industry leader, Howard Marion-Crawford, is remembered as "Here he is playing for the eyes of a blindfold in" Laurence of Arabia ". Miller's unforgettable mood is stealing a few moments in camera than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Many scenes director Alexander Mackendrick has always worked on a comedy (his previous eeling comedy "Whiskey Glory", a seal reverse). Roger McDougall's play is confident as a potential disaster for scientific progress, but fails to present Sydney to any other dull than the lights too soft and pleasant. Eeling comedy is reminiscent of capturing the human side /> <br <br. And I've seen that the eclings I've never done, and they work only when they speak aggressively for our sympathy. "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and "The LadyKillers" (MacCentie again, go figure). On the other hand, "white suit" is a foul suit, which must fall apart when it is essential.
