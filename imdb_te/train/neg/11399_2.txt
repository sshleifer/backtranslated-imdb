I was not hoping to waste 80 minutes of my life watching this horrible film I kept hoping I was finally going to get better but boy I was wrong. The plot is dotty, acting is very weak and special effects are awful. Even 2 cute girls could restore my interest in this boring and bloody mess. <br /> <br /> Some lines of the film are not very sharp for me, when the Asian boy said, "I lost my niece to father **** stereotypes. <br /> Do not waste your time with this crash unless u have made or have a good laugh .. maybe u some mates can see it rip this picture
