Swayze was not too incredible, but Alan Quartermine did not. Compared to Stewart Granger; It was my ultimate leader in films such as the 1952 "Scoracio", 1952 "Prisoner of Flag" and the 1950s "King Solomon Mines"; Patrick Swayze completely failed. In the "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" is not too big to play the role of aging Alan Quatermine by Sean Connery. Even Alison Doody does not have Deborah Kerr's grace in the role of the leading lady, and the last but least impressive Siriaque in the role of the Umpa will make anyone fill his hard (shoes) too! For Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version of disappointment, I would recommend it if you can not get your hand in a grander version.
