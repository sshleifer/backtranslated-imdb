- I plan to write something explaining what this film does not like, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I can not remember much about it. I saw just three days ago and it did not make any impression on me. This is usually a symbol of a true stinker. Most bored about the thing I remember. Detective is a novel that looks like Humphrey Bogart as wearing it from a real refresh. This is different if he can act, but he is a note entertainer. The killing scenes were enthusiastic and there was no susceptibility to them. If you do not recognize the killer for five minutes in the film, you have to see more euro horror. Dead prize for the identity of the actors killer.
