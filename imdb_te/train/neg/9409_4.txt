I loved this show! I think nothing with wrong! Even though it does not punch anyone to spidy, the program is not just fun! Some people think that's bad because of this program. The story is great and it's great fun when other heroes look like X-Men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! The bad Sandman will not appear but I like it very much! The best spidey show ever !! My favorite episodes: 1. Turning point 2. Spider Wars 3. Hobgoblin 4. Alien costume 5. Mutant agenda <br /> But there are some parts that really are really bad: the rocket racer and the spot which is intolerable to watch. And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. Morbius is the first to absorb blood instead of blood and I do not like vampires. And he bothers me that Season 2 is almost the main villain. Of course I will mention the Heiden Man! He is terrible! I saw the sandwich! His last appearance was terrible. <br /> <br /> I do not like Spidy as Man spider.
