There is no doubt about the beautifully portrayed image of a Geisha. <br /> <br /> However, the ones that are too small and big are very small, it can be very difficult for me. Fully enjoy. A scene of Mameha Rings performing an hour hanging at the entrance of Surrey's ice whirlwind (which does not spoil it) is a small story. Ringing for the hour is Furyin or Wind Chime - just hanging out of houses in Japan in the summer! In traditional Japanese homes there were no doorbells - they just opened the door and announced themselves. (You may think it's such a trivial detail, but in a Christmas wreath on the hanging door in July, I'll compare this picture and nobody thinks about it.) It's unclear about Miyako and Geisha's entirely wrong hairdresser, which is unclear of Pan-Asian / Chinese / Kung- Fu-Ish and not the real thing. This rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray is really coming out of the perspectives and imagery of people and circumstances. <br /> <br /> I think you know Japanese culture, you know about Geisha and Mico in Kyoto (what is "Miyako"), then you will enjoy it more. I honestly think this movie might be very good ... this is just another Hollywood version of "Exotic Japan".
