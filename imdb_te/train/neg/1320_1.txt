I thought this film was the first time I read casting. I might have probably written a more exciting story, which was a great way to go to the pink monkey's pockets. Alberto Tomba is definitely a good skier, but he does not need to rely on his acting skills to earn his life (and we too) to thank God. He can not play, he can not talk, he can not even move on the mainland without his skis ... Michelle Hunziker is pretty blonde girl, that's it. She apparently opted for her incredible skill in dramatic roles but most probably not picked for her nice legs. However she must confess that she may be Tambah's acting teacher, because she is also a bad actor, and it is fun, especially when it comes to Italy. I looked at this film and laughed at all times. I made it really laugh, loud, loud, and it found it very ridiculous and meaningless.
