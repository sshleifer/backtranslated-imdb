Bob Clumpet's 'Porky's Poor Fish' is a scary pan and a cartoon with one or two good movements. Set in Porki's Fish Shopper, 'Porky's Poor Fish' occupies an uncomfortable place in a classic black 'n' white porky cartoon and associates of the popular Merrie Melodies. Porky is generally less common in Porky cartoons, which is only seen in the stilted opening musical number and climax of the film. The rest of the starfish shop will be looking for a free meal, but he gets more than usual. Unfortunately, the audience is much less than bargaining. In the case of the sometimes-books-come-to-life series, the spotlight is thrown out just fine ping-marks in non-animated media. Loughs are scarce and when the cartoon is saved in the powerful direction of Climplet, the lower park is far less to recommend 'pork's puree' than any of the early park cartoons.
