OK, I saw this movie in Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which is a huge fan of it), but I'm not one of the MST3K movie 1/10 ratings. Although I hate many of the movies they play, and some are the worst movies I've ever seen, I have been able to actually enjoy some MST3K movies. It is said, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> "This is a good example of what can not be done in filmmaking, it is very bad, acting is very bad, cinematography <br /> <br /> The film is the worst part of the film, and sometimes the waiter had to wait a minute for the viewer to do something for a long time. <br /> <br /> "Suspension of Infidelity" means "almost falling asleep in a movie", which means it is in a movie.I'm sure it was intended to create a mood, but I was very frustrated. But sculping SKLELE is terrible, no matter how much I really can get any interest in the movie , So the "disloyalty retention" is not in fact exist. <br /> <<br /> <br /> I've ever seen one of the most boring movie. <br /> 1/10
