The first time Alone was a good film ... the sequel was a beautiful new look. This is an original effort, and somewhat successful ... Of course, the formula is basically the same, so it's like watching the same movie for the third time with a slight change plot. The new score is very bad (although the new "arrangement of the nets" piece, compared to the previous maximum, but not particularly interesting and different), and almost-not-as-good-score second. It was created by using some pretty good non-genre music, but it's not the same. The plot is fair, and some of the franchises are original, but it is still a less impressive example of the first two films, as well as the worst acting and the 'horror character becomes good'. Acting is unlikely. Characters are mostly caricature. The new thieves are less entertaining than older (and they make fun of spy things, which are almost criminals, there are a limited number of good spies, and some of them are good). Most of them (and thus more loops) are just a weak effort when trying to go over the first two films ... it does not work. The idea behind thieves and their mission is a tad too ... adult and serious for a child's image (and is sex joke or both, not the first time in that series). Simple plot, which is also unnecessarily complicated. I'll follow it, but I doubt the kid. Some of the descriptive are also clearly distributed so children can find stupid. Animal stuff is not generally fun. There are fewer siblings, namely that they have grown more, but they have lesser personality than the first two films. Cartoon-y is not good or good looking unless you really like the criminals who are suffering from torture. I recommend only to fans in this series. 3/10
