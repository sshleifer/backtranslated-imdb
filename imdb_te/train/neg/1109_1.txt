It's the worst Western I have ever seen. The story is especially common for western and martial arts films - the hero learns that the hero / friends are murdered, so the hero gets a perfect revenge, defeats the inappropriate lawyer, kidnapped the beloved damsell and slays an expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula is often successful - otherwise it's not a formula - but the most serious death penalty ever you see is Gun Fighter. Scripting is a formidable and insulting one; It seems like a high-tech speaker has written since it lacks deep, mature, and realistic. The sound is bad; It looks dubbing sometimes. Cinematography is dull, and the sets sometimes have just the facades. Acting pitiful; Certainly, some performers blame the script, but others can not use that. I hope Chris Libert never saw him in the role of speaking. Every time he tells a line of anger or understanding, he does not do more than hit his voice and he sounds like a kid trying to take action. And talking about Chris Liberte, who plays the role of Hawlong, check his dust (if you dare to watch this movie): he wears a brand new outfit, he works harder as Roy Rogers, down and dirty cowboy. If you enjoy the assignment cinematic offer to perform the hologon cassidy, then get this, but if you have more than two particles, see a different watch.
