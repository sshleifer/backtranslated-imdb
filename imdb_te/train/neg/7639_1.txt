I saw this film at the NY Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and I thought it was pretty bad. The first and most eye-drawing was most painted; It's very slow moves and excessive close-ups to any point the story is knowledgeable or beautiful - rather than to show the cinematographer's skills (I believe it is also the director). This film is what a proud film looks like. The main actor (Sam Levine) is certainly very beautiful, but the best actor. The rest of the cast is bad and bad. The story is also very angry. Most of the audience I agree to enjoy this movie. Laughing and sighing constantly, but I did not like the great deal.
