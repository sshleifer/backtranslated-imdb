It is a tremendous plea of ​​how the writers are crazy. I'm an American citizen, but other Americans do not need to look at each other for an hour and a half to enjoy a movie. I am very surprised at how much the dialogues, sentiments, moods and myths of the film are so small. The historic bugs of the film are not as dangerous and "U-571" (which converts the British submarine to the Americans), but you still have a slightly softer feel. Really, the Americans do not admire the war between the Germans war scenes in this film! How sad, unnecessary! I want to say to the writers: Many of us are clear to you that you can not hold real people with real issues with real issues and you have taken the very good shortcuts. Your wishes always include nationalist accents to congratulate your sugar-plated tripe.
