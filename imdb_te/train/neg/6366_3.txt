This image does not have a single readme factor. Girlfriend and I love action movies. Particularly combat scenes (the Bloodpops and Kickboxer are awesome), but this film is not entertaining. Twenty minutes on a five-minute interval, "angry" followed facial expressions. The main hero is a troubled character who has seen the war and appears to be severely folded at all times. The army improves the movement of his bowels and his fighting technique. Music is not good. They fight with the streets rap and hip-hop style, 'These guys do thugs. The remaining soundtrack is a general background noise for low-budget dramas. <br /> <br /> Everything related to this film is classic B-style. The actors make their lines read from their queue cards and make the lines on themselves and burn them in some rotten Hollywood lakes. The film is called "honorable", but does not respect the film. It's just waste money, and the smarter cost is something I think is respectable <br /> <br /> Go instead see Felon. Fighting scenes and conditions are more real.
