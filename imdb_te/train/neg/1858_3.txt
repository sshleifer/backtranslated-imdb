A serial killer dies in a blizzard and transforms into snowman's nasty couple of frosts. Then the killing will go to the spree. Interesting plot. Sounds scary. And it's scary. If you're five years old. Otherwise, it's kind of cheesy. I saw the cable and I am so happy that I did not pay the money to see. It has all the charm and style in a low budget movie, which can become a cult film. I have a loyal fan base somewhere. I'm not in it. Although I do not like the whole movie, there are some entertaining scenes. Picasso's scene with the bathtub scene and the post-blast scene. It is also enjoyable to see the many ways the heroes try to kill Jack and he does not seem to want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low-budget B-movie comedy, but a low-budget B-movie horror.
