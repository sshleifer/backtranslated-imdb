Short hatched with June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from an electric chair after "Black Angel" was found guilty of killing a small acquaintance. Don Durry (husband of the murderous woman) helps Vincent find a real criminal. Peter Lorrey has a singular role as suspect. This movie noir looks like a low programmer and does not achieve anything specially. It is very pleasant, however, at some point, it will stop in the sense and the solution to mystery stimulates "give me a break" action. The ending of the film alone is complete, but not the best before. Vincent is a wimpy heroine and dude good guy playing good guys. I love the movie noirs, but this one is a real disappointment.
