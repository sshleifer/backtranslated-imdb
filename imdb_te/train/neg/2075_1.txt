I have to confess when I went to watch this movie, I do not really have high expectations. <br /> Usually Luke Wilson is a hot shot that goes out with little crazy friends. There is a little mention of a girl who hunts him but that is pretty much for the character. <br /> <br /> He agrees to talk to Subway Rain Wilson (the person I really liked before this film). A "hot" girl, Uma Thurman. <br /> <br /> It is strange to say that this is very low if everyone knows that Woman Thurman does not belong to the "Hot" category. <br /> <br /> Rain Wilson's performance is also "hot". Usually I'm all for his acting, but he can not save this movie. His character is jumpy, unrealistic and rather annoying. You can not tell when the authors try to make him gay guy, or disappointing the funny token room. It's almost painful. <br /> <br /> She sticks her purse when she leaves the subway, and is a lovely savior running after Luke Wilson's thieves. Now we know Uma Thurman is a super hero or "G-Girl" as he wants to call him in this movie. It still disrupts what "G" is, but we leave the message for discussion on the board. <br /> <br /> I think romantic scenes are fun, but who am I asking for sex like that? Because they tell Uma Thurman's "hobby" they almost go through bed by bed. <br /> <br /> When Anna Furis insulted the Uma, she called her "prostitute" and I had no discussion with it. <br /> <br /> She has not acted in films, and she does not act well and she does not reliably relate to her being pretty and distinct. <br /> <br /> Overall, I went out of the theater and did not pay $ 8.75 to see it. The characters are distinctive and specifically Uma Thurman, certainly not chemistry. <br /> Also, the script and storyline can work a lot or use a match and some lighter fluid. I actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors, their dying careers. Overall, you're not worth your money, and waste your time trying this curiosity at an image of your self esteem.
