Dick Forn and Peggy Moran, who are good at Mummies' hands, come back for submission to this small Universal Horror. But at this time, we do not get Wallace Ford as a "Babe" comedian, and we get a masude knight changing a crazy friend called "Stuff". <br /> <br /> Dick is a businessman who has the idea of ​​launching a treasure hunt on a remote island in a terrible old castle. One of the gangs for the Peggy ride. But there is a long and skinny John Caradin lookalike in a black cape and big hat "Phantom" who crashed party in the pursuit of good luck. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's always nice to see perky Moran, but you can chalk this up as one of Universal's instant unforgettable misfires.
