Acting horror is as well as screen play. It's poorly put together and you want to laugh at the scene of almost all the horrific murder scenes. The end is much worse. Everyone kept dying, but something went out and everything was done exactly like OK! They do not provide enough history about the teacher's siege, which requires more time to develop a good story. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I kind of think young actors are bad. They need good coaching. They could not really make an OK movie, but screenplay and acting failed miserably.
