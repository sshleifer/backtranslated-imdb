I can not believe I've spent $ 14.00 on this. Only the redemption quality is the worst gore. The dubbing is worse than I have ever experienced. It seems to have been shot with a VHS camcorder. The amount of blood and body parts is very much everywhere because I think I have spent every pfennig special effects. It's one of the worst movies I've seen so far but I do not recognize the enormous gore that's not as disgusting as it was because the whole movie is very crazy and unbelievable
