What a crappy image! Worst trash! The film is entertaining as dead slug. No-talent-a-so-still-actors, stupid plots. Who wrote this script? Is the script for this goofy film ever or is the director just accidentally hit the record button on his camera and they went along and decided to pick up the movie? What is meant by children or a comedy or what? My friend's brother is in the 6th class and his classmates made an amateur-film for their school-project, which surpassed this geek movie .. It's the worst movie I have seen in my life! There is no need for this film!
