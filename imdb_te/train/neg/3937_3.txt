It is hard to mention his reputation as one of the X-Files, one of the best science fiction series, in 1997, in David Dukov. Nine years later he was almost forgotten, and his deaths failed to make a big screen. Angelina Jolie was very much at the same time, but she was also a good judge, and she was really lucky for her film like 'Playing God' brought her career dead-end. Fortunately for her, the 'Bone Collector' and 'Girl, Interrupted' are looking forward to the corner, and her career began when Lara Croft arrived. <br /> You do not have much to say about this. It is Andy Wilson's only big screen film, and there's a reason. Most of the screen on this story is a former physician who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar that is all common and working for the mob. Off-screen voice is particularly bad, with a moral text that kills any shadow of cinematographic experience in the movie. You're probably not in the movie, but at DVD rental stores or TV. Try to look for something better.
