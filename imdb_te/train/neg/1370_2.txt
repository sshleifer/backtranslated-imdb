**** WARNING: Be spoiler here **** Do not waste my immediate fleeing years looking at the worst like this? The film clips, poor writing, worse direction, and we have not yet come to act. <br /> <br /> In fact, you can expect the whole story from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One avalanche goes off all kinds of cliffhanger dangers, going through all kinds of dangers and manage to get alive. The corrupt partner that causes the whole thing comes alive with his payment of money. Second sudden devastation to Regalenzeli through the courageous experiment of the reelgerge professionals. Ultimately, evil powers have a heart. After the troublesome young man saves her, she falls in the hands of a damaged stepmother. Etc, etc, etc, etc., and it goes. <br /> Of course, there is some reason to warn for spoilers. You can probably work on the entire plot if you give the basic ingredients. <br /> After that, what would I do? <br /> <br /> "I agree with a previous commentator, even with a bad image and some of the zealous qualities." It did not.
