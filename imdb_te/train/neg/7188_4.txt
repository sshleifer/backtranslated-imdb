I was going to get another try-hard hip slasher, but in fact I found a "7eventy 5ive" to be a little passable, and nearly 80's throwback, which was a tedious slow mid-story story after an upturn in the final hour, which ended up being outrageous when it came to an end Leading to climax and clear police. You can not win awards for realism because you steal and steal its thunderstorm by inspiring from thrillers (general cheap jump panic), position (serene building) and other films. This book is in the gleaming direction and there is a lot of hacknot with red herring that is poorly recognized in its widespread plot and weak script. Sometimes it's ridiculous, yet I am seriously concerned about some violent acts of violent acts of college students suffering from some moral violence with a psychic killer with an anesthetic killer. The performances are not as bad as a spunky young cast, but the characters they play are not particularly appealing. The most appealing Rutger Howher is a detective trapped in a small assistant role. A slickly made, but fold in a shallow and unforgettable addition.
