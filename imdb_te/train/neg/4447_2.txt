Yes, there are worst films. Most of them have fun, a shoe string budget, or a t.v. The image of the week, but it is 'the image of the week', but it does not exceed two stars. It is a poor movie about a serious subject of an abusive woman who fled the king of the mud people for the king's defensive weapons of evil people. (If she is trying to show that the man does not need to act in this film, it should not be superfluos to the movie, but should not be). It is a heroine that does not have any suspense, no character development, and outsmarted by a rottone onion. (I think she was strapping her wedding ring on a boat in a boat, where it was in the ocean (wherever her body was) and when her husband discovered her, she was a moron, and the murders of child murders almost killed.) I'm always surprised when looking at it and it's still challenging Dr. Shoes I know that there is a huge unupposed market for the people of the world. By his work. When I finish laughing at mankind I will not cry.
