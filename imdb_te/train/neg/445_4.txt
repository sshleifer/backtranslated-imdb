One thing that surprised me about the film (and not good) is that Nastan Stoltzufz is considered as the pragmatic historian of Rosenstress, one of the historians working in the film, which has been modified or ignored in the actual events. <br /> Another critic Van V. Trotta said that she did not intend to lie to Lena Goebbels, but in that case, why did she give each episode what happened? Why not show other reasons for the release of mens like Nazi fears about Stalingrad, or the international newspaper protests in Berlin? <br /> <br /> Why is the whole storyline playing second fiddle with a weak family bonding storyline that takes place over and over again? Definitely something like this has its own history! In the places this movie seemed to have two stories, which seemed to be very low. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film has failed with its objective, resistance, an insult, because it's good, it may have a big impact.
