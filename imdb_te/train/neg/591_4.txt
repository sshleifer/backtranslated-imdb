I was disappointed with this film. It started very well, and built some great weather and suspense, but finally came the round of "monster" ... the skin problems turned out just a few mental ...... again. Playing Dish <br /> If you want to be simple, "creep" is virtually undisturbed to see, and his moving way and strange sounds makes him pretty creepy, but I realize that the only monster that's sick of the movie like this is a human, a twisted, demented, freakish a. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the movie, Why is this hell killed a security guard? What is the point, a great honking signing up to sign up "Hi I'm a Psycho and I Live Here!" <br /> There is only one thing that does not help Franco Potente out there. <br /> What are the hells he eats there? I got the reputation, and only the unexpected screens in the tunnel had made him lose ... when he was killing the rats anytime and why would they hang him? Why is he so scary to kill? He is not thin, nutritionist and not exactly at the peak performance. .. but it seems to be going on even though there are very similar injuries <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the film, you will not be able to emphasize it.
