Recently they are trying to get the film late in the cable TV commercials. Hype does not believe. I am among the unfortunate people to see this stinker in theaters. In my opinion, the 3rd worst movie of all time, Mac & Me (# 1 Worst), and Jack Frost (# 2 Worst), but I must admit, they're all close and all terrific! Actually, nothing of this film is not funny or disturbing, or it tells you not to waste your money. It's nice to give your worst enemy only. I'm not lying about it. Anyone who wants you to kill or torture will be the main candidate in the film. It's terrible. If you do not believe me, you need to be bothered by the difficulties of looking at this. Two cool looking cheer up.
