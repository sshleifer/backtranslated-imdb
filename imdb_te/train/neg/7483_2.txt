Steve Martin, Goldie Hahn, and John Keece, a film must be at least fair, good, I think (as I did). These actors (mainly Martin and Cleves) have produced some comical comedy of all time. <br /> <br /> Well, I was clearly mistaken - it never looked at one of the most horrific films. It covers my mind as to how seriously a joke is for someone else. I've seen these talented actors hurt me, and I'm running very lag scripts that have the misfortune I face. I have been hoping for a long time based film on the big names, but I have failed to provide any entertainment. <br /> <br /> In general, movies and life I try to stay away from biased comments and broader stereotypes. But with this picture, it's hard not to let loose. I can count a hand, perhaps two or three fingers, major Hollywood productions, which is more bitter than me. <br /> <br /> But if you want time to be effective, take your money and dismiss the toilet when it's out of town. Please shake fast. Please do not watch this movie.
