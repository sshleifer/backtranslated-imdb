<br /> <br /> Preston Waters, the luckiest ancestors of the film, seems to have little family and money. These changes are paid to him as compensation when the bank thief runs on Preston's bike. Preston checks to withdraw $ 1 million from the bank (ridiculously, that money belongs to the bank who gave him bank). Preston purchases a building and is working as a mysterious and wealthy assistant assistant named Mr. McKintosh (named after his computer). After that, he goes crazy with money. <br /> <br /> This is a great idea on paper. However, on the screen, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. For one thing, this is very unbelievable. I know that some parts of the film can be wonderful, but I'm going with a thirty-year-old woman at the age of twelve, and I am responsible for the small wealth of an imaginary person. In addition, it is a shallow film with weak acting, imaginative storyline and less character than the memorable. The characters are cheesy, overwhelming, or undeveloped. <br /> <br /> Looking for a good image to see you together with your family?
