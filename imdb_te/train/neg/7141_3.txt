Well I went to this movie, I did not expect the action really fast and the action-fix like The Furious. A good plot of some good girls with some good cars is somewhat better. Unfortunately I would probably have to say that this year is the worst movie I have ever seen. The cars are not good and do not misunderstand me that the girls are right but it's just as simple to keep the way they put together the picture. The story ignored about the cast and the film seemed just pieced together. So this movie is not the worst thing so far but if you are looking for a movie to go this weekend I will pass on this one now.
