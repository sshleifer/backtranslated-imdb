A crazy, boring British science fiction film starts with that line. The Great Worliyli teleportation machine from "Devil Doll" was produced by Blanchard, only for cutting the bow with bows and big eye eyebrows. If his experiment fails, good Dr. Lembacock, the person who controls all the grants in the world, finds that he is staying in London for a few days. With the help of his famous laboratory assistant Sheila, he attempts to make himself into Blanchard's home. Needless to say that something went wrong and he sees a rat model. The rest of the film was dedicated to a surprisingly hand-oriented doctor in London and wearing a diaper on his face. There are some murders, some modest paper work, and in the end, the physician always disappears where the doctors who are facing the rat go there. Thankfully no one decided to make a sequel.
