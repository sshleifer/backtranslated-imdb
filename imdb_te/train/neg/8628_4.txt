I loved my 7-year-old daughter, and Disney has been confusing her. It's a problem with "air buddies". It is a child image of numbers by carefully studied cuteness, a couple politically correct morals, and sure enough humorous humor to avoid the terrible G rating. A parent, or a 10-year-old, has seen all of you before, and has done better before. Think "101 dalmatians home meets alone" and you get simple idea. I am saying that the good story of a child is a good story. "Air Buddies", which is as real-time as recycling paper, failed to meet that standard. This is not the most terrible video your child can see, but megatons are good.
