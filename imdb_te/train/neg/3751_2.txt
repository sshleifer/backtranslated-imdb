I'm a fan of David Lynch. But the film was very disappointing. Besides surrounding background music? Does it really set the movie mood? It does not have nearly all the features I came to connect with Lynch's work. Visuals are too low to say, and the conversation is obscure and unilaterally. <br /> <br /> The film is an experience director who seeks more than embarrassing works of films than this film. I have seen a lot of amateur films with very high camera-work, scenery, sound and scripts. This film does not have nearly all the artistic features. I think I'm looking for one of the Davids home videos produced on a weekend trip with some friends.
