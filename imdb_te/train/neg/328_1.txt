I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan, and one day I saw 'Going Overboard', looking at the Cost & Crew featured on one of its DVDs, and decided to go out and rent. I went out with some of my relatives and rented it. We put it and we were amazed to see Adam Sandler yet did not hit puberty when he came out of this film, he looks like 12. I can not even see the 30 minutes of this rubbish, when I saw how horrific this film was, the only time I smirked was, not at this film laugh, chuckle, or smirk. I can not believe how hard he tried to laugh the viewers in the film ... it did not work once. From scratching the terrifying camera angles and listening to the frustrating script I learned why I never heard of this movie ... because it sucks more than anything because it sucks earlier. This film, in my opinion, ever word never, EVER!
