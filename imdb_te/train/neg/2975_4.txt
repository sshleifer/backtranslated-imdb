I saw it soon after seeing it better than these mountains. On top of that it will stop me from comparing ZOMBI 3 to 28 to 28 days later and its sequel. Unfortunately the more I saw how well I made Danny Boyle's original and how much this effect affects after 28 WEEKS <br /> <br /> The 28 franchise is not the Italian horror film that can not help just how much of this type is dated.

Not only that, but the idea that the 28th Franchise average horror film is less interested in, appeals to the audience. ZOMBI 3 does not appeal to anyone but a hardcore audience audience will stimulate
