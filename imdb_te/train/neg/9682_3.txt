To overcome his wife's death, an elderly man makes his place naturally (at least in the film of Peter Greenaway): he and his son leave for eight and half a half (not having a leg) women and sexual odyssey. As it is a green picture, there is very serious and unpleasant bluffing and unnecessary male nudity. In fact, the father and son are sleeping naked sleeping bed. Gross. Besides, who wants to see the old man full frontal? In homo-romantic scene, one of the women likes to dirty with horses. No story - a random collection of dull scenes.
