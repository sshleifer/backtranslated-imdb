I was very surprised to see that the film was a good rating, when it was checked after seeing it in IMDb. It really was one of the worst films I've ever seen and I've seen very bad movies. It seems to be a good movie initially, but when he came out of the surgery he did not believe how bad it was. Over this voice will destroy everything! Just imagine that you are open and listen to what he says. I saw the movie in German so he did not know what he said in English, but the contradictory thing is, "Yes, yes, it does not hurt ..." Think of yourself "think about something" and then forget your pain while thinking about your girlfriend ... stupid. And his mother ... how hell can she figure something like that? If someone comes to tell her, her son died in surgery (she should have any kind of assessment). Plus she found some letters in the Jessica Albas bag. Plus "she knows the hospital" stuff ... and does she take her "a second" to identify her? What hell? ^ And the end ... why does the police fall in them? The patient died in surgery, it was done. That drunk doctor did not know anything either ... and then they all bust them, even girlfriend ??? Why ??? All I think is that Christensen did a bad job, but really did not count me ... The above mentioned mistakes and stupid things were a problem. I've seen this movie with some friends and we all are very disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... Just do not watch;)
