I saw this film in DVD format. Despite the impact of my copy, I was disappointed with the lack of a menu screen for the DVD. I will say that this is my starting point for Claire Fours. While watching fun, I feel that I have not lived up to my estimates so far from her other films. I enjoyed the comic performance of Arkin. The other two actors did not know me well, so I could not compare their performance, but they were very enjoyable. In my opinion, the film's performance is lovely. The story line, some say little forcefully, is no direction. The main problem I got from the script and this film is not directed. If any of these actors are funny, I would recommend this film.
