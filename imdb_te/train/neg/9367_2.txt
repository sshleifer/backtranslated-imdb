This plot is unclear ... A scientist (Bateman) learns how to exchange animals like the human eyes and optic nerves in other animals. A young man (monteight) works without a colleague at work - a scientist calls for a doctor who is a good candidate as the first human recipient of the young. The recipient becomes more and wolves, but the effect is more than "strange eyes" and runs with dogs at night! (For the whole movie) The budget is very low, the conversation is very discouraged (I laughed some loud in the ridiculous debate), and acting was quite useless. Long segments of the film are not more than dreams of dreamy, instrumental music and wolves in the forest. The route is not too long, 90 minutes, boring, and without ideas. <br /> <br Wounded soldiers are expected to use the eye exchange to resurrect their eyesight and think of technology to be used militarily. There is a silly subplot about a beautiful Indian girl (Corey) who wants to help her with Indian knowledge about wolves. Music on drums and Indian reading is strong - silly, man! This turkey is made by love after a gruesome murder that has been edited. <br /> <br /> There are two ridiculous scenes here. A worker in a research laboratory leaves the animal room and leaves the monkey. She feared, the monkeys left it, the right wandered, the left wandering, the right, the left to the left .. It will last a while (who is this album ??). Damn Lob Run Out! Stupid so I started laughing. Another ridiculous scene - our hero is in the house, when a heavily armed militia escapes a window - he leaves the window open, go to the open window and see the window, "they seem to be here", and leave! He went out of the open window, guys !! <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, soldiers are shooting guns at trees, and I can easily keep the queens that I expect. They cut off 6 machine guns, but decide to fight with our hero with a knife! Shoot the guy! Who wrote this trash? Eventually there is a meaningless confrontation, and I'm not stolen for you - there is not enough plot to spoil it. <br /> <br /> I realized that I was a tax write or rush job for the whole thing. Using budget that does not use some improved film.
