Alan Alda plays the "sports illustrated" writer George Plimpton in real life, who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. Wan, however, was uninterested in fantasy with drama fantasy. Director Alex Mark takes on an interesting talk on this topic, which is a partial-documentary manner of shooting (with Macau commentary) and yet this story gives Touch of Capraicue madness; Still, through the cinema mess in this set-up, he becomes a confusing main story. Alla's confident, anchorismatic performance is another handicap, but the supporting cast is filled with real-life pro-athletes (and is preparing Lauren Hutton as Alla's sweetheart - how is it for a fantasy?). **** from * 1/2
