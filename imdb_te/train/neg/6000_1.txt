Johnhana Frakes is a good actor and he is a good director when he is not directing a family film. But, he really should not direct this film, and should've been rejected by the screenplay. The director and writers should really understand the actual TV show, as well as the characters and how they work. అసలు సంభాషణలు రేజర్-పదునైన రాతతో అనేక సంభాషణలు కలిగివున్నాయి, మంచి సంభాషణలు మరియు అమెరికన్ ప్రొడ్యూసర్స్ పిల్లల ప్రోగ్రామింగ్లో ఎన్నడూ పరిగణించని పరిస్థితులతో ఎన్నడూ లేని విధంగా, ఎన్నో సినిమాలు, అసలు సిరీస్ బాగా పెద్దలు అందుకున్నది. I mean, tracey college graduate and some of them smoked tobacco and drinking tobacco! Despite many bad guys, there are untold characters. They finished first vrasinatlayite, poor communication, kindergarten humor and a weak plot, the Universal / Studio Canal, the joint venture will not have bad things. <br /> <br /> This film is almost pure blasphemy. If you've seen the original Supermarionation series, then I'll know what I'm talking about! /> <br /> The company continues to suggest that the Fed Motors <br, suffer, Penelope Lady Penelope's FAB-1 instead of the station (the original can not be more accurate), ROLLS-ROYCE FAB-1, is to take into consideration. She is considered to be a special member of the British Society, preferring to make England's finest motorcrafts in the original series. One reviewer suggested that Penelope Ford could not die. He's pretty much right in the event that her riding idea in a Ford does not work. At least in the Jaguar FAB 1 may have a Penelope ride because Jaguar is a British card owned by Ford, NO! They had to use FORD directly! But Ford production placement does not end there. Every car you see is a Ford! The news flash shown on TV sets in this film was also sponsored by Ford. Ford, Ford, Ford! The Ford Motor is a clear marketing vehicle for Ford. <br /> <br /> "But, the future in the original series design work because the practical and functional look to make the effort. this kind of treatment in the film there, where everything else is styled, performance and practical sense to be defeated. the film Chitra has been designed with a lot of things for the style certainly are, most often a function of the sense of not giving. <Ref> < br> <br /> <br /> S series of good performance is based. Voice Talent shows, puppet limited senses to overcome them, the episodes of life brought. Barry Gray through the stunning and exciting music for the audience, the story, the characters, and the super goal (stanislasviski words, part of a) to achieve all together with more about the audience find Kt more to help. On the other hand, the film some overly smiley gallery. Anthony Edward's mind, a false guricesadu, Bill Paxton, Jeff Tracy good work (sometimes), though, Ben Kingsley, and many others over the hood of the better options, though, it's a very long time take). More simply, puppets are more reliable! The second is the most common and overwhelming music score by Hans Zimmer, "Days of Thunder" and "Apollo 13." <br /> And, of course, the hood. Hood in the original series has the ability to communicate with carrot with caron, which is an outlet for the introduction of ESP. But his extraordinary ability ended. He is the owner of disguise and hypocrisy, allowing him to incorporate around (most part, anyway) that he does not recognize the Thunderbirds vehicle information for his own means. Although the 1960s United States Artists "Thunderbird 6" (Thunderbird 6) (who tried to steal Thunderbird 1 and 2 released in Thunderbird 6, he uses weapons for his own defense, including firearms, the Superminion and the Second Thunderbirds Theater). But, even though he is the enemy of the International Rescue, every Thunder is not a villain in the Birds episode and attempts to prevent a counter attack directly with the International Risk. ఈ చిత్రంలో, అతను స్పష్టంగా ప్రధాన ప్రతినాయకుడిగా ఉన్నాడు, కానీ అతను మరియు అతని సహచరులు మరింత హృదయ ధ్వనుల వలె వ్యవహరించేట్లు కనిపిస్తారు, అంతేకాక వస్తువులను కదిలిస్తూ స్వల్ప కాలానికి పారిపోయే సామర్థ్యంతో సహా హుడ్ మెదడు నియంత్రణ సామర్థ్యాన్ని విస్తరించింది. It differs from the hood as a character in the original series, the people who know the people who laugh at the children and leave the theater in confusion or confusing their heads. <br /> <br /> Even more criticisms, but the 1000 term limit for IMDb reviews does not allow me to list all. So, I will close the movie and I can not enjoy this movie. Of course, I feel good! <br /> <br /> After seeing the original series and supermerion movies (Thunderbirds or Go, Thunderbird 6), I wanted to be better than that. <br /> <br /> This super conglomerate is much more sophisticated and elegant farce than this live action. (And telling that nicely.) - Kip Wells
