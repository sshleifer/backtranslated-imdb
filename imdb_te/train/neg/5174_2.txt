This movie is very bad, I do not know whether I laugh or talk. The first year of the horror fest that I attended to the horror fest was the year's great hopes, and I will take false advertisements on the horror fest and all of its movies. Mad Doctors to Advertisers Because I'm sure that people who spend a lot of money have seen those movies that year. The hamidones were the worst of what I saw (the other things I saw was unhappiness, dark ride and rebirth). The film was covered and the trailer seemed like a family of cannibals scare neighbors who thought it was a rather interesting plot, and it was only a handful of disappointing vampire at the end when it realized that it was age 'coming' story about a boy's transformation. In this film, what does drama think about the horror of the horror? And to make the plot more ridiculous, they do not have to wait to get out of one 'bite', and some deadly creatures locked in the basement, what I find. <br /> <br /> The secret is not revealed at the end of the film. I would leave the theater in the movie. <br /> <br /> Money, time spent waste Cut out forty minutes from the film, making it an episode of some of the smaller ones, such as Smallville or Charmed or Superman, and it has received more praise. Perfect trash! Two years later, I'll come back to IMDb and write a review about it because it's one of the worst films I've ever seen in my memory. Also, when you're reading this, learn from the horror fest movies in the future. Most of what you can do can rent them from blackbusters or look somewhere online. The horror fest has movies from independent filmmakers who can not make it on the big screen and all the shorts about the things they do not show up in theaters are not referring to blood or guts or horror ... the films themselves. Because they're horrific. <br /> <br /> Think of Horror Fest as the less popular version of the Sundance Film Festival, but horror movies <br /> Sorry, you forgive me for 'hate' before you lose their money.
