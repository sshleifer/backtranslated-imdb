As a Film Studies graduate, I have seen many different images, some good and some bad, but I say 'summer rain' is the worst film I have ever seen! I chose to be a great British classics like 'Secrets and Lies' or 'Lockstock', but Oh these are my flat mates and I am laughing and laughable in acting and cheesy script (reminding me of a bad theater in school education in education). The main characters started to disturb us at the start of Michael and Gary. The main character who lives with two friends, 'Michel', will never lose your tiredness and Gary is too wet (he's fed up every 5 minutes with tears) and does not give one of them. I do not think I've paid Â£ 3 for this pile. I wrote a review earlier, but after seeing this film, it encouraged me to warn people of this gruesome product. So avoid at all costs. Thank you for reading.
