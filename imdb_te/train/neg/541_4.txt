I found this film very strange. Since I got so much I found this film very hard to like, and now after a little thought about it I can pretty much pinpoint the reason why. Jean Marc Bar, although I love bits (I think one of the best movies I've ever made), and although I can not figure out for my life that it is better, I've taken his place very easily and made the film. Everything else is fine, except we have a weak comedy (Parents Joke is not really necessary, filmmakers!) And I really like British Major Richard E. Grant. This is just a matter of trouble .. Jean-Marc.
