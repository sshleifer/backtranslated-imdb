I do not know how much positive reviews I received on this site! I'm a big Wanggang fan and this showtime is very familiar with the story of the original film, but I'm poor, acting, very poor actors (Sean Austin, Clever, Athletic and All Personal, Harrison!)! Standard writing This trip is simply worth watching. Someone pointed out how the Macaulay Kulkin line was. If you read that and you feel that pure comedic brightness (sadly, possibly the most intrinsically funny part of the film), you probably like this movie. But if you are not a fool, you can not see it. Please.
