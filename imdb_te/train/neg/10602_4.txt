The film was much worse, and Jean-Claude Wam Damme starred in the film because the film was the only reason for watching this film. There are some good action scenes in the film and the film is the best of the end. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film is very bad and the worst performance I have ever seen and 2 actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Joy White do not work at all. So far Jean-Claude Dam Dammes is the worst he did U watch movies / u blood sport, KickBoxer or sudden death if you watch him in his great films u <br /> <br /> All in this movie is worst / OK and my rating 4 of 10 in the quarter.
