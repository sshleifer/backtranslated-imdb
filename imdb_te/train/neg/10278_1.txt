The only worst movie I have ever seen in a theater. I saw this film at the Sastin Film Festival in 2004 and covered my mind as the film agreed to a festival. It was an interesting premise, it seemed to be somewhere, but every time it tried to do nothing. First of all, if you want to make a musical, find the musical talent. Music has the sound of piano music that they hear they are playing in a stereo in the movie. The lyrics are in terrible writing, and when they do not have a rhyme, they are poems that inspire the movie, showing how far the film is doing. And you think you'd find a musical, rightful people doing the right thing? This is not the case. Luckily they are in half a time talking halfway / half, but when they are singing it made me cracked with fear. Especially when they try to sing in harmony. And just music addresses. Some acting is very beautiful, but the dialogue is very terrible, as well as a lot of scenes. They clearly have a bad editor, because the scenes do not have enough coverage, or they consistently jumped in the line and used horrible options while cutting the image. At least one director admitted that he did not want the script, until it added a musical hook. I think anyone can write music before investors make the same mistake again.
