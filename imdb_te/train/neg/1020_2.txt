Enter the second part of this image for a second, so you can better understand the type of movie we're dealing with here. <br /> <br /> One of the truly stupid movies that Edison was a bad guy and his Guyans had to shoot at 50,000 bullets at the good man behind the walls and columns, and finally killing him instead of killing him and killing him ... ... very grief .... instead of just walking and POP! ..... what do you do Bad man ..... talk with him. When he seizes his gun he speaks to the good man and talking to him. They have nothing to say! Shoot him! Shoot him now! But he speaks to him anyway. Another thing is oh. At the end, a newspaper "PULITZER PRI Winner Strike Ride is Here" or the right of the first page of a paper, the first time it printed the story. So who has achieved a polyester in Hasti? Yeah, do you know those kinds of stupid movies? <br /> <br /> If you want Mr. Cool Morgan Freeman and Shifty Eyes to play tough Kevin spacesy in their roles, LL Cool J is literally motion picture every moment, making his girlfriend in a damn night club of all the places, and the last line "Duck" is a deadly weapon ever made ... and Justin Timberlake listen and every Ari nonsense, /> <br /> That's the bright spot gold hardened by a crazy bastard Dylan <br mcdermot his best "denjel from Training Day" and the image, which is pretty fun. <br /> <br /> Oh, what about the movie? Anything about the scandals involving City Edison's fictional special unit police force, known as FRAT (I'm making this stuff) which is supposed to turn off a clear play of SWAT, a small journalist super singer Boy Justin Timberlake smelled something from the FRAT 2 fraternity cops involved Then in the form of fouls, and they both p Goes along the way and scurrying off looking for a story, getting his boss' (freeman) trust along the way. blah.It meets a halfassed training day like a bootleg Pelican shortening. The play is slow and off, the script is terrible, and the acting is very unhealthy. Everywhere people grow up everywhere without you go anywhere and you forget about them Everybody in this movie will not think No stupid film.Whatever review was harder to write, because this film Second, out of mind ... do not waste your time!
