Julia Styles is a talented young actress, who has a very powerful guidance from a famous agent. Obviously, the man who led her to this mockery is not the one who cares about her career. When I discovered another movie in the movie that I would like to appeal to this film, I sat in the theater around the teenagers who left the rooks. It was poorly written, casting director only could not put the effort into characters 1 or 2 minutes and the director did not care.
