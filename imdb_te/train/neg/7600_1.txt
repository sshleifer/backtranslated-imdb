The film is from good acting and comes in good direction and does not happen at Ask The Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a fine actor, but he is in childhood. Donald Sutherland is an enthusiasm. Why? Because the script is awful, adaptation is awful and the actors feel bored and half heart. The atmosphere of the film is bad - I can only think of it when it's done and I've stopped half way. The director did a very poor job and even though I read the novel it was definitely a missed opportunity. The atmosphere seeks to stimulate the film and the message and storyline never reach the audience. In a word, this is a terrible image.
