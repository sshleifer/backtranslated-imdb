The movie is o.k. Score and Doctor Heckenstein are not bad performers by David Muir. The opening and closing credits are shown along with the actors and the "Best Special Effects" along with a low budget movie. There is nothing in this movie that you can not find in other psychedelic, horror / comedy, or low-budget movies. No naked scene is not special for either buffs or bad movie lovers. This image is just here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller have nothing to do with the same. If I am interested in you and actually find it, you can perceive the truth of a line summary.
