College student Alex Gardner (Nicolas Selogizi) suffers from the ghosts of ghosts living in a room in Alcottas. He dreams of cutting his hands, spitting the mite, opening his shy chest and burning open fire. After seeing his friends put "6 feet" on his bed, a useful, occult-engaging teacher (Dona Denton) suggested that he be inserted into alcatraz to face his fears. <br /> When the band became alone, Alex's brother Richard (Tom Reilly) was captured and everyone started killing. . Tony Basil group "Body of the" Mickey "fame appears as the lead singer of the" Bodybuag "Sammy Mitchell's assistant ghost. She teaches Alex to come out of her body and performs a rock musical dance with repeat nightmare footage to paddle time. All victims appear in the role of the Griffin Dunge in AN AMERICAN WERWOLL in Landon as the knowledgeable Deias. The script completed the funniest plot, cheesy dialogue and slum effort. Good FX work and cool opening credits (both by Ernest D. Farino) are the only things to get any merit. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") make some songs in the soundtrack. <br /> Score: 10 out of 10
