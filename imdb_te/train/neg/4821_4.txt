Fiction movie (although it is based on a story "A Credit is Enrolled", but is based on an article) is a wildfoot to go to Canada's forests and find a Bigfoot (they catch one and then a tracking device). A lot of the scientific mumbo jumbo that combines what is a dull image for some people who are really messy around. There are some attempts at creating tension and fears, but there is nothing worth seeing outside of some great watch shots to be absolutely honest. The exact definition of this exploitative image, which most of you would take a look at the bigfood, but actually it offers much less. Recommended for insomniacs only
