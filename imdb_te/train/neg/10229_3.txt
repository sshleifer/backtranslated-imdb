I saw last night (9/27/06) I am relying on my observations in one episode. I do not think I'll see again. Acting is completely wooden, plot is completely predictable, and ultimately unrealistic - who believes in a $ 30 million judgment for a drug addict killer with terminal cancer? The mainstream actor (Victor Garber) seems impatient and uncomfortable in his role - how bad the writing is! I realized that this season's drama was pretty poor, but they will find good writers. Perhaps they are outsourcing writing for India or China! I'll wager I will not see this next season!
