I always choose a movie 2 is the type of guy going to the horror department, so I chose five of the eyes, I hate the movie and there is no story, I think people want to see movies that promote violence only for hell. My skin is crawl and there's a lot of rubbish! I think I can do better work. The worst image I've ever seen in my life and the camera is terrible as the camera is terrible and it's a bit like a cheap split off the ballet off I think it's a little bit to look terrible, it's not a little bit to watch the sound, and it does not work at all, it's foul.
