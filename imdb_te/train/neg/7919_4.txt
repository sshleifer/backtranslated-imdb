I found myself very initially caught up in this film, and I have no credit to give this film, Lacey Chabert, she is amazing !! But it ends. I'm a killer, and I seem to be pretty good when I can baffel an image completely, but I thought and lied, they were the whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they were. <br /> <br /> <br /> Why did Jen (Maria) burn the professor's house? <br /> <br /> It's great, I started as a very good movie.
