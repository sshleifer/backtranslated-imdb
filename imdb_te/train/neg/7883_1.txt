<br /> <br /> It started very well and pulled me off. I really liked it. Between 1/3 and 3/4, the film was not made and did not understand. My first thought is, "It's not written by those who know how to tell a story." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When I reached the final 1/5 of the cinema, it is all the boring, spokesman, Reichan the Thamping dialogue no sense, nothing is said, and it is annoying to hear; <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this image. <br /> <br /> Wilt-in Films and Level Path Productions <br /> I am practicing Catholic.
