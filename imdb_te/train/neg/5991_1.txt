ba ba ba ba boring ...... This science fiction is beside the Battlefield Earth in Fiction. Jenny Frances (Lara of the General Hospital) plays a minor role as a journalist and the film must say ... Some of the stunchers are Ben Kingsley (an Academy Award-winning actor). You have to wonder what to do to make this awful movie. The music goes dramatically and this is a major dramatic story. The plot can not be followed if you care. The effects are also routine and are really dating. All of the actors speak in the same tone and there is no realism for their conversation. How bad I was this movie This is good at least with the Battlefield Earth, but it is just BRNN. Exclude if you want to sleep.
