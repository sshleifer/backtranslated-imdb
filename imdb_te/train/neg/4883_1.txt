I was surprised if it was the same film in the cover when it was the cheapest in the video premieres of Crazy Fat ETHEL II. Unfortunately, it does. The story is unclear. Ethhel, a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder, was released to half the house due to a rebellion in the hospital. She is a very sane residential looking lot while a person keeps the dead flies into a different soup. After hitting the residents' cost of food-consuming cost measurement, Athel chased a chocolate bar by half of home workers. Ethel struck him with a wire nose on the steps and then the vengeance .... Well, you get the idea. If all of this is fun, it is not. The film has done poorly and with less serious acting. The characters are so wood when they distribute their lines to be standing in front of a cigar store. To make matters worse, the first half of the film will be much better for Criminal Insain in the film. Very poor effort.
