I rented the movie because I had browsed through the horror movie section for those films because no one listened and could be a possible gem. I saw it, because I was a fan of violence and gore, I got it. It means it's got EM's rating: very mature. This rare and high rating is totally meant for violence and everything else, it comes to me. Warning in the box: Extreme Violence, Extreme Tongue, and Nudity. The "extreme violence" hit my fancy. The film ended with a beautifully flopped picture. It has one or two gory scenes, but I saw in a PG-13 movie. Of course the gore in an image of course is not that amount, right? You have the plot too. Well, the plot is boring and there is nothing really special about it. Do not rent it. I speak the truth. I can not imagine that someone can really enjoy someone where they say "I'm going to rent again". It's having moments which you're going to keep going but I'm never going to see that image again.
