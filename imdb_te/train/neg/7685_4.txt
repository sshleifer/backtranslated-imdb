The tumultuous drama from William Gibson's story was directed by John Hossein and directed by Vincent Minnelly! Richard Widmerck civilization, the elite rural nervous shelter, struggles with his self-appointed queen Be Lillian Gish and wandered to the staff-nurses Lauren Buckle who brought his life back to life after her death, her husband and child. Rigid and muddled, set in a indiscriminate time and space, and a "David and Lisa" love story hidden in expensive morass. Widmark and Bacall have some good chemistry together, but this script gives them nothing to build on. Exactly one hour, what should the conversation do about the hanging drapes in the library (this thread is not symbolism, instead it is a red herring in a mystery!). The film is unparalleled when people work in the same profession and think their opinion is correct, but unfortunately the roundabout way Minnely explains that this recipe is not information, enlightenment or entertaining. ** from **
