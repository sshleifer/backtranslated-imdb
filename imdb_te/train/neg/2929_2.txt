It's not funny - how can this be able to link to the monty python? It's certainly ridiculous - no smile. It's not funny. Above, but ugly, weird just for the sake of impatience and this is something me all the time. Unfortunately they are not funny. </ P> <br /> It should give a few points for any effort. Actually it is a laugh track - or is it there? <br /> I'm doing injustice - perhaps this is sort of exercise. In some ways of art - never go and do not care about that. <br /> <br /> But these guys play with women with high-pitched voices, turned noses. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> Monty Pythons has only one successor to intellectual intellect, Stephen Colbert and perhaps Jon Stewart.
