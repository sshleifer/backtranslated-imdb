I was surprised by the horror film Slim Slam Slum that I saw on this date. I did not think that bad bad b-movies were possible on my list but this gold deserves. It's not funny. It is bad acting, it is bad and filmed is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it has three girls. I really believe that this movie has the ability to hover over the other adventure movie "Stern Over Hodger" is a bad movie! And that's really something. Congrats in advance!
