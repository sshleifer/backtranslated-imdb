I'm in the second class 12 years ago. I need to remember clearly. We learned about the place. All the little kids want to go to space, right? After I watched, I was dead, and I accidentally entered into space with a track brain with some mental robot. I do not know this is the film. I thought it was some news program or something. I guess that is my own version when I am freeing people through the radio program 'War of the Worlds'. So, recently, I get to know my favorite actor and watch this movie, Jacquine Phoenix (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I tell you, I'm laughing at dramatic episodes, and I'm very hard in acting. I mean, when Andy was in space, she slowly moves in motion, have you ever noticed? <br /> <br /> When Andy lost consciousness through the Oxygen Tank, the security doors would be closed backwards. . Suddenly, Max's face (in slow motion) rarely gets a bigger song on Max's face. "Whaaaaattttssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I did not get it.
