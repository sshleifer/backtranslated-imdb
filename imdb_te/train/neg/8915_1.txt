My comments in this film have been deleted twice, and I find it pretty violation, because I am trying to judge this film for other people. Please resist others' feedback. <br /> <br /> "You have to be very careful in the movie between philosophers and colleagues who do not understand people today." Nietzsche is a great thinker If philosophers agree, take a picture of his life, which certainly does have his 'thoughts', should not be too careful or preferable. But the film is not about a hypothetical character, it's about the life of anyone who really lived and / had a great impact on the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow, if someone tells a story about a tomato, the story I can express my opinions about it, but the choice is about, tomato While the film is about the realities of stavika responsible for them. Such is the case in particular did not take this responsibility. <br /> <br /> Screenplay: One of the first things I noticed was the funniest voices. Why? It's about what's manifest; Nietzsche and his discoveries. It does not help to keep things in the right geographic perspective or at times! Come, make it right English or better; German! <br /> <br /> Mel Gibson also received the piece ... his characters allowed some bizarre Aram to speak in passion. <br /> <br /> Second, it works well. <br /> <br /> 3rd, not an actor to paint Assante Nietzsche. <br /> <br /> 4th, the facts are off. It is a celluloid waste.
