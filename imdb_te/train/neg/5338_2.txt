Elvis Presley plays the role of a "half ethnic" native American ("Indian") who will defend his reservation from Muslim business leaders. Everyone likes to drink, fight, and have children. <br /> Though he is made up, Elvis feels healthier than he was before in the movies. ; Perhaps, he is getting ready for his famous "back". This is not because it's something to get excited about this script's script. <br /> <br /> Jon Blondel Elvis, and Burgess Meredith, should try to get involved in "war paint" and be ashamed. <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (actually "Green Sleeves" with different lyrics). The most embarrassing song is Elvis's bull's love for "Damnik". There are some surreal scenes, but it does not turn out to be enough to succeed in that genre; <br /> If you're in the right "mood", "Stay Away, Joe" may offer some laughs. <br /> If not, stay away. <br /> <br /> Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter Takesbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Jon Blondel
