It's worse than the rating given. A typical sculpture of these days is: awful acting, poorly written script, and bad for the chaotic direction. From the premiere of Demilale's scene to the scene, the film is terrible. In the beginning, the film was directed by Moses (Charloton Heston in the movie Demille), Feroara (Yule Brunner) and Nefreri (Anne Buckstor) opposite a boy in the sand. Characters reflecting the three above-mentioned symbols are bad and they are comparable to the people who are "devious". The fact that this has come out of civilization in the desert is when someone is injured and they are falling for an ambulance. The screenwriter clearly did not care about the ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was very disappointed, Morena Baccarin decided to do such a low quality film.
