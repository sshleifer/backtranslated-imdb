This film is not based on the Bible. It is completely out of the picture that Christ leaves. They do not show a second or second coming of the Rapture or Christ. Allow only to talk about it. It does not quote from the Scriptures. Last time is called the great labor. This movie does not show bad times. Seven bowls, seven voices, and seven trump judgments were cast in 15 seconds news, which was changing the ocean structure. For 3 1/2 years against Christ, the event ended. Only the two prophets were right. Because names are so close to the truth of the Scriptures, there are no names of names. This was a very bad part and I really wanted a good picture of it. I wanted to take people who did not save me. I think this movie is bad. It is a fake like everything else ghost. <br /> <br /> The second problem in the film is just bad. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and poor character development. I saw the good parts of the Miami Vice.
