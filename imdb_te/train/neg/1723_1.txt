Man, this is a scam turned out! Since it's not good (I do not really expect anything from it), I'm mistaken by the DVD sleeve, explaining Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill to its "Stars" innocently. Sure enough, their names did not appear in the early credits of the film, the rest of them are much less !! By the end of it, the Las Vegas Lady (1975), the same film with the same movie mixed with the three actors ?? But what about anyone who has a relationship with a CRATER LAKE monster ?? However, after I paid $ 1.50 for its rent, I'm in a monster-movie mood, I've chosen to watch the movie, a clear one from a mile distance, rather than the fact that it has a non-nan cast and an anonymous worker Seeing the inadequate air and what I can do with most of the laughs like JAWS and laughing and intentionally, often killing Sharif thanika themselves confused with the antics of the two aid-boat-boat owners. The creature itself ?? What is a plesiosaur half dinosaurs / half a fish ?? I naturally realized (naturally) but, even in the case of Giant CLAW (1957), I did not bother filmmakers, especially during the second half of the film!
