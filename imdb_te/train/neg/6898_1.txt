Avoid this waste of all costs. Bad script, bad direction, bad acting, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. Get the idea This film tries to be a Western taste, not that. It tries to get hard core violent, it's not. It tries to display a fresh look at an old style, it does not. Actors try to be the best, and my heart will be revealed to them. But it's hard to work with such inner material. It seems to me that the first world effort is to see a "latest outing movie school". Freshmen filmmakers are often more likely to chew their budget or chewing. The best thing they can do is to get some steps back, do what they think, and work in the next work in their limited budget.
