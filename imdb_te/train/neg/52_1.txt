I'm glad to see a picture of the cartoon in the Berlin competition. But after the show I was total disappointment and angry. Too much blood, too much time, too many themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every battle, is terrible. Revenge, many human behavior, not beautiful, countless movies and plays, as well as relationships between gay and Catholicism in Spain are shown. But the villa's effort is a fake tragedy in the history of cinema. It really is a pity to see Angela Molina in this film. I do not advise anybody to see this movie.
