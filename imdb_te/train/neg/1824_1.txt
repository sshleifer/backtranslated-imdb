Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Blocks do not need to be jealous for the film. It's, in a word, boring. Perhaps it is speculation, that Ben Stiller is too much to make this movie to forget the lost character or all the funny scenes. Even Christopher Walken's appearance is also full of a curiosity. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's performance. I loved it in his films too, it was not the last and that bad I had seen before Duplex with Drew Barrymore. About Jack Black ... Well, I have never seen a good fidelity from what I'm doing something good. What About School of Rock? Alas, scary.
