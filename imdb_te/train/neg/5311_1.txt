This is the worst picture you'll ever see! 2012 Doomsday is currently pulling the rug from under this one, me. The evidence for Frank Zappa's references to 'cheifis' is a good example. Space scenes took place in the 1950s power station, just before the demolition. The music really sucks. This work is wood and ham. The characters they portray are shallow and incredible. The plot is predictable. It is immediately and frankly clear when they copy techniques and ideas from other pictures. Quality of belief of beggars. <br /> <br /> But as you can see, only what is to be one of the biggest waste of a small budget. This is an invaluable example of stupid image!
