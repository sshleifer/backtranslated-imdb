SWING! It is one of the remaining black-producing and starred films since the 1930s because it is an important film. These pictures are very small, they are undesirable, but it is in very good shape. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even if the film is historically important, it is also a good chance to see talented black performers after the old era of the old Cotton Club. And there are some lovely performances, which is also a mess. The main plot is quite similar to the Hollywood music of the era - it is not surprising to see from where to save the day, along with the first primer to destroy the show. However, the writing is just awful of God and sometimes a little worse - and the pictures of Black America can make some of the images seem a bit deceptive. Before the plot really goes, you'll be treated with a no-brain that lives on his hard-working wife (a simple sketching form of time) and when he is caught with Hussey (who, totally, criticized this role), they have a fight from WWE SmackDown are! And, a lady wants to cut the other woman with a straight razor - actually a trashy scene! In the next film, when the first Donna was acting abruptly, her husband knocked on her face and everyone praised him! This is like a movie, they want the audience to appeal to those who have the lowest common denominator in PLUS - I have seen in a long time some of the worst acting. <br /> If you can see a lousy product just like every way (with bad characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), it might be worth a peek so you can see the amazing singing and tap dance - one of the forgotten black culture Hold the glimpse. Just do not say I did not warn you about acting - it's so bad!
