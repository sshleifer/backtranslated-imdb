Greenaway's films are intelligent, experimental and innovative. Yet his style and grammar began with a movie viewer made in the making of the film world of filmmaking, feature film motion, use of mid-shot, fixed camera. It is better suited to manipulate this style from mainstream movies, but this is not new. <br /> Maybe, like TS Eliot, the creator of the other "new", he spent longer than ever to be seen as an authentic novelist. <br /> <br /> Heine's biggest failure is yet to come. His dialogue and plot structure is also another dramatic logician, not mechanical and logical, without the power of Brett. It is in his humor that this weakness is clear, it is assured and reasonable, so the joke will die before it is delivered. As a result, it is not funny: it is not funny: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their action if the audience does not react. <br /> In the end, as Woody Allen, Greenway monitored his actresses for years as Clones. <br /> <br /> Despite the design and lighting of this film, it is a meristissous.
