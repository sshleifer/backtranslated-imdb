This is a miracle: the plot is totally unreliable, the characters (the unexpected lonely Cop is very intuitive, very attracted to the young man) is quite imaginative, totally understood and impossible but you have to have a masochistic trend for it, which you can fully understand what you read And act Ddadi. Is there a fundamental idea for Americans as well as Americans in the genre of "seven" and "silence of sheep"? If so, it's a total failure. It was very successful (and the cult-status as the first French serial killer feature) and was considered a good product for export. Strange.
