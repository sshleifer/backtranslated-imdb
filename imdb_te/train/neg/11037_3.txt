I love the episode as Jim Greenman. It's great! When Jim touches the little man through the window, the value found on his face is valuable. When he started praying to the Bride on behalf of his wife, is it only to know that she is a pei-woman? In addition to great acting, great writing and great actors must see. I'm trying to find a specific photo from that episode. I want to use the message board as my avatar because I think Greenman is happy. Who knows who can download a photo of Jim as Greenman? Can anyone suggest me in the right direction to find such a photo?
