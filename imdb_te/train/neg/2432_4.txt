This is not a lot to say. In the first ten minutes, you can say that it is a very fine twig. Very little mistake with this movie, very little action for action movie. Occasional characters are more likely to explore emotions. An action movie called it the right genre, I'm still undecided. Sniper is one of the easiest pictures to watch without being completely careful, with little twists and straight lines. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br
