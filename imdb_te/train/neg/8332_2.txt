Shinor, chaired by Christian Kalson, is based on three "couples" and their relationship and surrounding it with siege and violence. I am very worried. Interesting. Couples break into a Gaisur, raised by a heterosexual couple, two heterogeneous friends and "dangerous" to a gay man. <br /> <br /> "Hut" is a movie that really does not have much roles in the role. There are some scenarios showing how to have a sexual relationship or to play together. My feeling is that they represent more on the day that sex / violence is merged into any couple's life. The couple is not too aggressive and it does not even portray any kind of romantic way. Characters, they do not add a lot of theme or plot. <br /> <br /> Two friends make a huge amount of plot. Some people are engaged in homosexuality by having sexual relations with one of their homosexuals. This leads to violence. And violence changes them. This will change the way of sexual satisfaction. And as the progress of the film increases their need for the T release of violence. The main problem I faced is not violence. At any time, the characters do not seem to be in any real danger. It does not work. The overall background of the film is about the relationships of characters with violence, which is a big problem. Unfortunately, makeup does not help. Sometimes, it's okay, other times too bad. In a scene, I really think why Rouge is on the face of one of the characters. <br /> <br /> Interesting couple of characters "Anonymous Couple." Here Colson said that he was able to develop more coherent story lines. Perhaps this is because the characters have more development and clarity at the end. <br /> <br /> I congratulate Kalson on the scene with this movie. It's admirable. Very low budget flicks do not aspire too much. I do not think Callson achieved what he has targeted. For me, I found nothing specifically controversial or unsettling. Sainar is incredible. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the director does not have something to do with his next film.
