I'm very dissatisfied with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but it's far worse than these two titles. First of all, I do not like Saturday-morning-cartoon animation, and some scenes are the worst. I like some of the characters, they are lightning and patch, but other characters such as Cruelella are mediocre. Cruel was actually the villain, but she lost her quality in her sequel. There is nothing to write to her house and her animation is rare. Joke to be honest with her artist Lars Me, and Roger seemed to have left smoking on the night. Voice Talent is great, despite the exception of Jody Benson, especially Barry Bostwick Thunderblog, that voice is ruined for me. There were some good moments, but the entire plot seemed bumpy for me, and suggested a broader TV episode. In all, the Jungle Book is a highly disappointing sequel to the most memorable of 60s Disney movies. Sorry, I can only give this 3/10, this is not my tea cup. Bethany Cox
