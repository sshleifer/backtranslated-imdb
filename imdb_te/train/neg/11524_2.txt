Pretty abusive movie about a man who hipped religious culture in the late 1960s, when sixteen years later struggled with them. This man has one of the other cultures, who was hidden during the attack by the police, and took another man named Hawk, who lives in a small cabin in the river. This practice kills some people in some or some of its followers. It's hard to know who the characters are, or at what time the scenes are going on. The leader gets paroled after sixteen years (I came from the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie). <br /> <br /> The large circular logging evidence for a murder, others being made with swords or a crossbow. <br /> <br /> I have never heard the name of the title character in the film, but he is very much like hoating and hooling. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty poorly divided, to explain what is going on. Some of the sound effects are very bad. One man falls to the punch, and we hear the sound of whip cracking. A woman shoots a gun, and we do not hear firing, but instead listen to a shovel! It does not seem to be made for a comical effect.
