I'm a huge Steven Siegel fan. Hell, I'm probably not frizzy-mullet-ponytail sport street credit while he grows weight like I'm. After telling me that my own bias and affection for America's favorite beloved platform and screen heroes, I have a huge heart that I should say is the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the main issues with this film seem to be visible in post production. It is painful to have a different storyline. As a result, Steve's voice does not synchronize almost all with a voice dubbing voice. Editing pisspoor and overall this bad starts, gets worse, and in the end you'll want to rewat the man instead of Da Da Vinci Code. <br /> I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at me to listen to their CDs. Did I start checking some of Van Damme's live lads directly into DVDs? If you are tempted to watch this movie, tear down your eyeballs and discard them in the toilet. Dark life is better than 89 minutes.
