Sorry, it's very bad - but it's definitely one of the fewest movies I've ever seen ... I have a low budget, but anyway: Actors behave like playing in soap, dialogues are definitely crappy and last time I've seen such odd pictures ten years ago Trash Night at the Young Video Festival. I really appreciate that people will sit together and shoot cheap movies, but at least some quality quality is needed. But at least a good thing: the first three minutes of the film looked interesting and okay - and the score is really worth listening. The DVD cover has been very promise, but so far this film is best to offer ...
