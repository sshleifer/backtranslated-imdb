One of the greatest ratings I have given this film is not to allow zero and negative numbers. Pew Yu, a great movie written and directed by a 12 year old man, has been made by a great deal of older actors who have worked on the B-list actors and have a lot of spikes and giggles in the nonsense stupid puns of a movie, and the Pope and Fart jokes. For example, Jean Stapleton (all-in-the-family ding-bot) role for Marieu Hannar, she is sexually "moving in two ways", a cheerful attempt to represent the humor of the humor of the film ... Are you a good cheeky comedy? An End House, American Pie (Part One Only), Old School or Office Space.
