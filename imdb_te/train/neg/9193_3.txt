Okay, I'm not a big video game buff, but is the game's Dead of Dead really famous enough to make a movie? Sure, there are dozens of games that do not actually dozens and look at exactly the same, although no specific scene of violence is justified, but actually there are no weapons and aliens or spy walks or snipers The case may be. The college children (which call college children ladded, while some fisherman pay $ 1,500 for their ride after they lost their boat) are trying to get to this island. After thinking about the house of the Dead, the first thing to do is to become more clear about modern horror movies than absolutely no exercise. Same conditions. At least in this case, the fact that they're on their way to a rave excuses the way girls dress up. <br /> <br /> They look bad at the beautiful little hulster tops around the woods at the tops, but at least they dressed on that occasion. <br /> <br /> Clint Howard, the most interesting character in the movie so far, is an absolutely awful appearance, the film provides the richness of each other actor overshadows. I can not stand when the famous actors change their voices in movies, it is rarely effective, and here shows that Howard is flat evenly familiar to the well-known actor, who is the hardest fisherman in the cold air breathing years. He wrote well. He was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally alerted it like some powdered sugar or inhale. Real tough, Clint! <br /> When we come to this island, the film is temporarily placed at Camp Crystal Lake on Friday 13th of the films. Most young people played by actors were naked and later killed. Nudity is impressive, I guess, but let's take a minute to see something. These children pay nearly two grandparents to leave the island for the year to come, find NO ONE and good beer! There were hundreds of people who brought the stock in his villages and they could not find a single person in the entire band and in sight. Here you have the input from the director uve boll - is alcohol! <br /> <br /> They do not notice that they have taken themselves out of the party they came from. <br /> They do not start drinking, the whole party leaves the island and goes out of the dark woods to find out where everyone is (where the other one is dragging with one another and two people). Now that they are alone, to get out of a hurry. They feel that the island is empty, and some of those who have come now have gone for some time, so they have some privacy because there is nobody else. <br /> <br /> Now, for the things that everyone hates, I have judged by reviews I read about the film. Yes, shots that highlight videos from the video game, to show more, yes, the image is directly copy / direct to the video game. Sure, it's a stupid idea. I can not imagine who thought that little nugget, but the matrix-style bullet time scenes that are worse than that and over and over and thrown. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the things that you can get on the edge is the speed after slow but relentless lifestyle But are tired of the feast, to run out of places to go, and the lack of an awful fight with jampings push it. Right in the first two films, the children are terrified and do not have much space to run because they are on an island, but because they hold a ride with a smuggler, they have heavily armed. I'm very strong. I mean, these people get everything from machine guns to grenades, which will most likely remove the tensions of the upcoming walking dead. <br /> Then I called the techno-slaser scene. The procession has never happened, and I think that any techno music in your bell is disappointing without listening to music, killing all the dead and killing the dead and there is a scene in the center of the music video. The shots are techno-music explosion, such as the speed and speed of it, but the speed techno is around 5 frames (which is up to 1/6 in seconds) across the screen at times. Music. I'm guessing, but it's not a horror movie, because it completely removes any feeling of macro-effect effect because you can not see anything more than a response to it. <br /> <br /> You are thinking about what the director is thinking about when you decide that these shots are jumping up and putting something in the picture in this way. Many people have compared the film to Resident Evil, which is largely copied to its campus, and they are right. I'm at least here, because it is not a Resident Evil case, it is not a virus that is made of a man, others have changed people who have been harmful to others, vampires and others become vampires. The 28 Days Later is also an inspiration for the film, the House of the Dead is so bad that it did not do the same thing, except for some of the mayonic idea of ​​putting in quick shots of any video game, you forgot. I really think this is a better image. Clearly I can not say that I know a lot about the game based, the title and the movie poster need a better image, but unfortunately I often feel it's not the case with horror films. When a movie comes out, it is promoted as a film of horrific horror film, and the horrific thing in the whole movie is the closure shot, which suggests the possibility of a sequel.
