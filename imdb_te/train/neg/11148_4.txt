This is a prime example of a low budget, a good storyline that has succeeded. Armstrong samaiyir <br /> <br /> (I saw her, she can do better work in the OC I know) tisukuradam back, then find a good script and a budget. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very bad, and it almost lost in the wolf screen for the first time. And she also begins to change in front of the (Final Fantasy of the human beings, as well as Pixar's ridiculous, in which a naked Barbie as a person think of the front and a Samwick Armstrong's (Alert!) For a werewolf changing (warning!) A bad GCIF no at first, She was reduced to the doll). <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting, but bloody thinking in waswolves is nothing new. It is also evil, (maybe) got into the balance between the bad, and to be the kind of man to be the companion to the end of the two lines. కొంతకాలం ఒక స్పెల్ వంటి పద్ధతిలో కొన్ని ఇతర పాత్రలను ప్రభావితం చేసిన "తోడేల్ఫ్ లినజ్ పుస్తకం" యొక్క ఉపపట్టణ సమర్థవంతంగా ఉండేది, అయితే గతం లో ఏమి జరిగిందో వివరిస్తూ మరింత విస్తరించింది. <br /> <br /> In a good script, take the direction, I'll come back again.
