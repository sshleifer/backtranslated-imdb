After seeing it, I missed little respect for Christopher Lee (it over time). This film is completely worse. At first, they tried to rebuild the finish line from the first "hauling", which was made very badly. Then they try to turn to a tragic romance of a wolf porn movie! The plot sucks and the whole picture is just AWFUL !!!! <br /> <br /> It is not worth the money (it's not worth your money and naked money), the sister of Lee's sister Lee and another woman from the first film (from which it is called Deal Vallas Stone) is destroyed by a nude sibyl dawn, You should not waste.). Try to catch in the cable instead. It is so cut, it can actually make sense.
