There is a good thing in this film: donna of Lola Gladys! But sorry but it's true. Not too bad she is naked. It has at least made this mess allowable. We see another chic boobs but she is not anywhere near Lola. And man, what is old or what is it? The man looks rubbish! "The consequence" is the typical B-movie you expected. There is a probability in this story. They have good ideas but do not know how to run them. Cinematography is just plain terrible. Ugly! Directing is unproductive and the final result dries twisted twists and actors. Lola Gaudini is as great as the cheap, slutty way vixen but also she saves "evolution" from just plain old stinking garbage, trash and funny trash.
