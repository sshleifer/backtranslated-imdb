I can not really understand how to give this disgusting film more than 1 star ... How do you like such a retarded movie, where all animal abuse scenes are true? Those innocent and defenseless creatures did not want to feel the pain I experienced in those horrifying movements ... Jesus ... What kind of "human" are they for no reason, or just money? I say, the director is mentally disturbed or he is a monster with a rocky heart. Or both. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are various horrific scenarios of shock, especially sensitive individuals and children. The real frog is alive in the skin, and thrown back into the water, a dog is beaten and the birds will be thrown into the water ... <br /> <br /> This film is more than awful; This is the worst and most retarded film ever made, in addition to the so-called 'Kennyball Holocaust'. I do not see any film that is directed by this heartfelt monster. <br /> <br /> "It's a very bad movie because it's natural, so it's not successful, I hope the retarded director has done a retarded directorate. Some sort of unfair brutality and violent animal violence will never be appreciated and I feel that he will complete animal abuse scenes in his next films. <br /> <br /> If this is the case, you will feel the same pain that has been caused by ill and cruel "human beings". <br /> This is my only "negative" review If I do not like, I usually comment on a movie, but this time I could not shut down because I had to speak the truth because animal abuse should stop!
