<br /> <br /> A very good story is very interesting for a movie that has been done correctly, but where is hell this movie? <br /> <br /> In fact, the feeling of separation from the scene, and the narrative perception that you feel emotionally not part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The performances of the cast are relatively inexorable, though not questionable. <br /> <br /> Do I miss the construction of this film? <br /> We expect that we need to wait for the sequel. <br /> <br />
