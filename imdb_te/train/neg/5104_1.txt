What's wrong with actors involved in that trash? Michael Darn must adhere to Star Trek products. John Dale, who would remind him of the Miami Vice? He liked it there ... well, whatever - what can you expect from a movie with one of the lifestyle styles from basewatch? Nothing, and that's what we get. No characters do not even like, special effects are delightful (but not funny). The story is a (very bad) joke. There is no logic in what happens. Cinema manufacturers came to the conclusion that some are trying to do something like "Killer Tomatoes Attack Attack". <br /> When you watch on TV, change your channels - your TV set is always appreciative.
