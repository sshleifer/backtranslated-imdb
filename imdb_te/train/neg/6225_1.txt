I suspect it will also be a cult film. I would love the village parsons and I did not expect much from this movie and got less. What could have been a clever and moving campy. It does not have music made by Gram and has more filler than a lower dog food. There is no background on the village or colorful of that era. The roles shown are a fan of Gram and all the versions of his "afterlife adventures". Rock and Roll are full of stories, good ones, but they should be taken with salt grain. They may be great stories even though exaggerated. However, the film has taken a good story and became a trip. No body can steal and subsequent implications can not be a dull story but they are somewhat discouraged. I tried to steal every copy of Grand Theft Parsons, go to the desert and shoot them all.
