The film of Ye Lou was hit by the Purple Butterfly Battle of Shanghai, the secretive company of Japanese troops (purple butterfly). Ding Hui (Zhang Ji) and her ex-lover Hadio Itami (Toru Nakamura) are looking forward to controversy after a chance meeting. <br /> <br /> I agree with a critic from Paris. A semi-historical confrontation is a substitute for the film, without giving audiences the same reason to care for the audience or their reasons. It does not help with changing sudden time issues, it is totally unreasonable and nonsense. Usually I do not mind dark films, but lack of light, bone-jarringly camera footage, and generally bad image making techniques really make this a tough image to keep looking and interested in. I also agree with the viewer that this film from Georgia "has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography", but I do not think it will help the film. This is one of the most powerful events in the 20th century. I do not believe you can do any justice by changing the film to Michael Bay. Excessive dramatic movements do not add to its watch. <br /> <br /> Actors suffer from all the attacks. Zhang Ziyi once again shows her whole films have her spectacularly limited acting scope spending the full picture of what she is best doing, breeding and looking irritable generally. However, she adds some kind of attention to the scenes that create the worst love from Linda Hamilton at Michael Bern and The Terminator. <br /> <br /> All of the most disappointing movie is looking at what is coming from the director of Suzhou. 2/10
