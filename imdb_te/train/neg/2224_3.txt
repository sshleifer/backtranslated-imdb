At the age of 7 I saw this first time. I believe in what happened to me in vague shape. 15 years later, now I have recollected everything with accuracy, because the authors never see a boundary for the story. There is no plot for this movie / cartoon. No character has developed, no back story, no character arcs, nothing. The bad guys do only the tasks, because boys are good things because they are bad. Anyone who thinks that you are important to die, no one cares. They eat their shoulders and move on. No dialogue is just. If you cut combat scenes and run scenes, you will lose 70% of the film. <br /> You can see some good animation and do not look for any other reason. Or you want to see the hot cartoon chickens wearing low (or less warm cartooners).
