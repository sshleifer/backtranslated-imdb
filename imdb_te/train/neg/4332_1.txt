This film is a bad effort to complete the original fans. <br /> <br /> The fact is that people have to make sure that the people feel indecent. <br /> <br /> This film is a wash room for me. I'm not the negative type of guy, but man acting in this movie .... no comment. The plot is a bad reflection of the life of Carlito Brigante and my time is two hours and my money is ruined on this waste. I still love the true love and do my best not to let this film ruin my opinion about it.
