** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. Seriously. Absolutely terrible acting, the FX is terrible and the plot is awful down. But hey, its fun watching its fun! The script is bad that it's enjoyable! You just crink and "I guess that's what you call crossing." Because women have touched their chest in crocodiles. The reason for that reason is I am so bad! It is terrible jokes that they are funny! But after a while it becomes worse. I really started to fall asleep. Still believe me, stamping on plastic crock foot leaves and continuous water in a turf tail for a long time you laugh. In Crock's half that dude emerged and he had to say he had a cool chunk when hanging there at one time for what he was supposed to do. Hey Hey is a bleak picture nominated for the MH3K line!
