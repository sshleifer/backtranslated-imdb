It's just like the 6th movie. The movie is very bad. It provides nothing in the death department. One liners are bad and NOES can not be in the picture. Freddie comes as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox still makes this value valuable. The characters are quite evolving. Better than the 6th, but still one of the worst films in this series. My rating is 2/10
