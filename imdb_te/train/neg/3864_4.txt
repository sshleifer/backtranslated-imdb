Just a simple Jason Lee movie, there are some parts of the film that are funny. The effort of this movement is to live a life on the edge I imagined. These are the types of movies I watch at parties that slumber girls 14 years old. That's the right picture. It's kind of one of those movies that you have in the background and every now and then look after something that catches the sight. I think Julia Styles and Selma Blair are a good combination and want to see them in a movie with good story and stories. This is just a kind of girl girl who meets the baby boy. This is the perfect film they show in Comedy Central. I'm glad I did not see this movie in the theater, I was angry. But I guess why I did not see in the theater.
