Hooper is not funny, fast food, sexy and non informative. No original play. If you feel that there is a movie about the great stuntman of the world, there's an attempt, but it does not look like real. No alphabetical reading, lessons learned, no actors have any real pleasure, they are trying to act as fun. There is no reason why you do not have to look to Burt and want to take Sally's occasional glimpse. Horse race is beautiful and what he's doing. Best Actor in this film Smoky and Bandit is such a fun movie that I like the Hooper. This film is a real disappointment and time wasting
