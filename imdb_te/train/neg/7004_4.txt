Many novels, plays, and short stories writer W. Somerset Mougou (1874-1965) were considered one of the greatest writers in the world during his lifetime, and his fame has been criticized for years, but his work is critical respect and large reading public. Published in 1944, RAZOR'S EDGE is a World War I veteran, which flies in the face of quiet western values ​​for spiritual enlightenment. This is Maihagh's last major novel - it's very popular. Because the novel's contradictions contained both spiritual and philosophical issues, it was a very strange choice for the film version - but fell in love with Darrel F. Jannack's book of 20th Century Fox and shortly after the publication of the screen. <br /> <br /> According to the movies, Razor's Edge is directed by legendary George Cukor from a screenplay by Emo - and it feels Maugham wrote a follow up. But when the film came into production, Cooker was replaced by Edmund Goulding, who became known for the artistic touch rather than the director's lesser worker and suddenly changed the mum script. Tyrone Power, recently returned from military service during World War II, was a spiritually controversial Larry Darrel; Jean Tirne, one of the greatest beauties of her era, is a social figure named Isabel Bradley. Supporting actors, including Herbert Marshall, Anne Baxter, Clifton Web, Lucille Watson, and Elsa Launcher are particularly notable. Both budget and shooting schedules are luxurious, and when the film was started in 1946, many people became popular by the public and critics. <br /> <br /> But there is a time to keep time on time. Today Sean, RAZOR's EDGE is actually a pretty productive film - but it's the absolute best one next to it can say that it achieves unbeatable stable mediocrity. In most cases, the main problem is the script. Although the plot is closely related to the mum's novel in terms of plot, it is noteworthy to note the role of the character and it fails to capture the basic issues that drive the story. Larry is said to be in search of enlightenment; He was told that he accepted it; Despite occasional and mostly satellite comment we can not say anything about spiritual, artistic, philosophical, and intellectual processes. We did not mention anything important about the nature of enlightenment particularly. <br /> <br /> We remain with a shell of the mum's plot concentrating on the relationship between Larry and Isabella, although a woman loves Larry, the theoretical reflex that opens between them is growing. Tyrone Power and Jean Tarney were known for physical beauty rather than talent, but they were able to make good performances when they received solid direction and script support. Unfortunately, it does not happen here; They are very mis -cast with one-note and power gray. Fortunately, Herbert Marshall, Clifton Web, and Lucille Watson are particularly good support cast; <br /> <br /> Anne Baxter's famous performance was not worn. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br />] The seemingly cocktail party-style banter, and the entire India sequence ( It was a completely fun cut) - a strange situation, an array of intended as an arsenal of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, the film has not been remade, but the printing is good, and the bonus package is not particularly memorable, but it is no less noticeable. Everyone's views about Power and Tearney fans, left, and spiritual enlightenment are also unclear, but frankly, the film will enjoy for the best stars - all told and done, I give RAZOR 'EDGE four stars for all willingness to take the values ​​and material of production. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon reviewer
