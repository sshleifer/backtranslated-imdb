I enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel 'The Roeber Bride' and I was surprised to watch a movie version. A woman tries to clear her name by capturing her own homicide, and her friend, a former police journalist, checking the dead woman's crazy feminine friends. <br /> <br /> Film script solves Mutt Atwood's monstrous story while considering the story of the two men. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in this book, everyone knows that they are entirely made for the film, and I'll cover my hard copy of dust. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to continue in the film. We can not see that Jeania's manifests are human, and a man's life has been scrapped. Roz, Charis, and Toni tell their stories - a man. <br /> I loved the characters in the book. It hurts to look for a person's story and look at them. I do not usually look feminist in the media, and I tried to enjoy the movie. If I read the book, I enjoyed the film very much. If you like the police and the former police, and you want to read more about them, you're not lucky. If you read the novel, you would like to enjoy sensitive layers and sensitive layers through a plot. This is the same storyline: This film is sprinkled with mining, ironed, and male amputate. It is like a jealous revenge on Margaret Atwood.
