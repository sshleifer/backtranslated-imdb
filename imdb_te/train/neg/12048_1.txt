I have come out of about 6 movies in my entire life. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I do not know how to sit by an hour. That night I should have a coma. When I came 8 years ago, I saw in the theater. I can not even remember the name, but I know Penelope on Miller has acted in it. It really needs to be affected by my comment on today. Yech! Vomit! Barf!
