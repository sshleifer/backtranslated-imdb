This film is a huge disappointment. Especially since Priyadarshan's direction, he expressed regret over such vicious standards. Poor screenplay (almost no longer) and song sequences are every minute and songs are murdered in the movie. Some scenes are funny, but it's only 5 minutes in total time. Editing is tragic. Disappointing! Overall the story is frustrating with disappointment. In fact, only some people were waiting to see the second half of the film after a break. <br /> If you do not see the movie, you will not lose anything. The value of a ticket in this movie is not spent. Wait for the TV to appear ...
