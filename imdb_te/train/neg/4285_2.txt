<br /> <br /> "Timecop 2: Berlin Decision" is an awful movie. Horror product values. Horror acting. Horror script. <br /> <br /> American American perception in Hollywood (no image is available). <br /> <br /> I'm very short. Channel surfing to say that if you ever get across it this film is a passable entertainment on a rainy day. <br /> If you're interested, you'll probably be renting out of Netflix, but this film will not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are one of the few people you are looking for, and I'm disappointed with your Asian American film awareness, then I recommend the following movies for your personal view. These are well written with the talented cast of Asian American actors with high production values: <br /> <br /> Better luck tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
