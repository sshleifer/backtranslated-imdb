I sat down to see a documentary about Puerto Rico, and I ended up watching one of the neoricons. When I went to Puerto Rico, I was unable to see 50% of the living in poverty. When I see people struggling, they are usually the Haitian people, the Dominicans or the Cubans. There's nothing like spaghell ... you speak Spanish, or you will not do it ... and from what I've heard ... you can not. Pedro Albizo Campos is not an MLK for me. MLK is a great man. Campos is a great man for those who want a independence 1%. The rest he looks like Osama bin Laden. A group of patrons fools grouped with independence. Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, South and Central America, and Mexico are all in Independent Puerto Rico to prove to you. Its wonders worked for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, but this documentary is about Nuaricons and their struggles. <br /> <br /> It's not Africa, it's about Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Denzel is preparing for you soon. <br /> <br /> For the innocent white people who want to have green cards in America, they want to know how the Prime Minister works. , It is not a good documentary about the PÃ¼teraric culture. <br /> <br /> *** <br /> * Bocaboniita ... "doc." About Neorocons. She propagated how she feels for everyone. Must be named ... "So soy neuroiracon ... lunch ... Spanish does not speak." PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA, or please stop using Associate Els Associated with PR with this New York History Lesson. They do not leave this role on this island.
