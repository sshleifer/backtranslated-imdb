Duff & Dynamite: After Chaplin made one of his best films, he was one of his worst: Gentlemen of Nerve. In the first year of the movies, Chaplin made one-third of all his films. Many of them are experimental to ad-libing, compilation, costumes, location shooting, etc. This will be held at a racetrack here, without paying Chaplin and his friend. Mabel Narmand is also her friend, and Chaplin organizes her and Mabel's friends to escape. He later took up the maple at the Grand Stand without any clear daily from his behavior. There are a lot of slapsticks here, but it's too little to recommend Chaplin's development. The print I saw deteriorated sharply, which has affected its experience. Charlie Chase can be seen. * 4 stars.
