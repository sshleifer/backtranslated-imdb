I rented and disappointed this movie about 4-5 years ago. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a b-movie slasher movie, but conclude with a perforated material for my eyes. Acting is similar to grass powder. <br /> <br /> A foolish killer has come out of nowhere and no one can stop me. <br /> <br /> The product value of this film is greatly ridiculous. There is no fear. It seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas. If this place existed for everything. If you're bored looking for a bad horror movie for rent, skip this. There are very good movies.
