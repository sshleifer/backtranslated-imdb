The 60s (1999) D: Mark penguin. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Zesto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smithrich, Annie Corlei, Charles S. Dutton. As seen in the eyes of both the White Family and the Blacks, the 1960s saw the NBC mini-series (which later released the video / DVD full-length film) of the 1960s. The first half of the film was directed by Detton's amazing performance as Retired Willy Taylor and expanded the story between families. However, Dutton's character dies by half and the black family is completely forgetful in the disappointing, absurd and apparently awful 2 episode. Rating: 4 in 10. Not rated (PG-13 rate rate for later video / DVD release).
