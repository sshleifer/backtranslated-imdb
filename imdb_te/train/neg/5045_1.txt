Clochstrophic camera angles that do not help the movie: You only see a very short time, where the lower part of the movie (screen is cut) is missing because of important actions, but you can not see them. There is already a lot of confusion in the film, so the viewing angles are worse and do not contribute to artistic scenarios. <br /> <br /> I like artistic made movies and traditional camera work. I can handle films deep and slow. <br /> <br /> This is a very difficult task for the hero. In my opinion repeatedly fail. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this movie, and due to directors or actors. <br /> I'm sure in the future and I will be away from films that have been written and directed by Lee. <br /> <br /> There is also an annoying image for those interested in that part of history and those who have spent their time in Shanghai.
