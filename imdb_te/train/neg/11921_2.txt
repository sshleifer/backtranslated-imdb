I can sum up this whole movie using 20 words or less. A storyline that is likely to be funny is very imaginative, but instead is flat on its face. See, though, 19 words, I totally did not pan this movie with a star but instead decided to bump it out by two stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen provided just enough eye candy to keep me from being hot smoking and unsustainable right out of the machine from the DVD and put it with an M80 blowing. My advice is to take the $ 4.00 rental fee you pay to watch this movie and send me your pretend thank you to saving time and frustration for this trip, or you have your $ 50.00 replacement fee you've taken your twelve gauge to use this piece of garbage practice in skeet shooting Would have been charged.
