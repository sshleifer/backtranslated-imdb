I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After seeing it, I'll come back to the store and try to get my money back! The reason I gave the movie 2 and 1 is that it contains some novel story elements in the story, but it's never really interesting. Ultra-low budget, romance of amateur acting and sexual dose (at the beginning of the 60s) - The film includes all the producers for the drive-in theater market. In fact, I'm probably surprised because the film is made up of the fastest buck and some who use it as some strippers. The film is a wacko doctor who wants to change his girlfriend's severed head into a body of unsuspecting donor. Most potential donors are scannie strippers or models for most people - their only realistic intent in the film is to remove most of their costumes. Nevertheless, it is worth watching the film for naughty bits and the movie is not so terrible to look at the fans of bad films.
