This film seems to be better than it was over. Cinematography is great and the conversation is not too tight ... but for the long sequence with this doctor for twenty minutes you are actually a patient at the shelter that you're playing Doctor - and <br /> <br /> On top of that, Godzilla is found in the Curse of the Devil Demon From the point of view is about Helspan, which looks strong. <br /> <br /> In the end, cinematography failed to save the film. Although the actors have some pretty solid performances, the story does not go anywhere. I think the "hellfire" had a good title for this.
