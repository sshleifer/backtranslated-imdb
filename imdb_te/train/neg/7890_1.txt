There is no regrets to post mark less than 1. I have seen this piece of nonsense and I can not believe what I see. Every part of the picture is awful. Music, acting, direction, story, everything, just everything. In fact, I'm laughing out at various places in the film. I especially liked the bit where our hero soft-eyed dashing in the hospital in slow motion, and, because nurses knocked to the clipboard, well. Just because. Product placement? Crusics (Crucifix?) Everywhere. If you are a Christian inspiration and are very easily satisfied, you may like this movie. If you like this movie, you really need to get more.
