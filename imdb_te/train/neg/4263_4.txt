Disappointing picture. The performance of the actors is weak. Sets are good and good. The story is also weak. Battle scenes are awful. Sounds and movie quality are trashy. The history of Kazak people is very low. The film added more magazines to the lead roles. And also in the Kazakh language. Cuco Becker and Jay Hernandez are Hispanic sources. I can not get it. Since the Hispanic people have played the Turkic-Mongolian people. This film is a shame to the film's film. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the best film producers in the world. The Chez director was forgiven, because he was not a source of origin, he did not know the true spirit and navigational history.
