I never thought that the film was a lot worse, but I was wrong. Terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible effects. The crocodile is awful and all for a stupid sex / killing scene, which is a bad move from the word. It's really awesome and it's not a compliment! People see how this film can be made, and then it looks and then says, "Yes, good movie."
