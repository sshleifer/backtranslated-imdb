Recently I am looking forward to this film, I see the film very early. Well, just seeing it today, 5.8 rating is totally understood. If I look forward to something very much it will be a terrible requirement, it's not worth it. <br /> Definitely, The Hills Ice 2 has its moments. It has a very cool and well-developed storyline that is closely intertwined with actual production, but it is self-styled because the whole thing is very difficult to do. And if it is not the production of Wes Craven in the film, it does not have anything to do with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But the whole thing is that you're "this horror or comedy?" Because the most ridiculous, randomly placed jump moments and the stupid one linier (ie "there is a hand in the sh ** er!" Or "You Mother Foo ** Er: <br /> The story: (This part has spoilers , Be careful!) The film starts (Oh la!), Then fades into black with the title of the film, and a statement. Then we go into this office <br /> <br /> Then, we will go to the team and take part in the military recruitment training in Baghdad, while the captain is "a good job with folly" on their last day in New Mexico, where the family in the last THHE is still in the desert. When in training, in the end wrong, people die, and ... do I have to say more? <br /> I have a goldfish's attention and I'm struggling to sit here and type this. <br /> <br /> The wrong thing with THHE2 is that it does not work, but last, and the end is pretty safe ... With a twist! A stupid, ie. I'm pretty sure the ticket to Ultra Super Directors Cut and Hills Hey Eyes with Holographic Cover 3 will display alternate conclusions, but at this point, I'm not sure if I care. <br /> <br /> If you love the first THHE, it's almost unseen sin. Then look for everything. However, avoid all costs. <br /> This is for your own good. <br /> <br />
