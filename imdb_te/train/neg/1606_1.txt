In this film, Chavez supporters (Venezuela and not-Venezuela) are only dramatic in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say that this confrontation started because many PDVSA fired the best workers for political issues. <br /> They only interrupt the transmission of over 96 TV Chavez in "Kedna Nakional" for 3 days (confiscation of private TV signals). Everyone in the 20-minute period. <br /> <br /> We do not mention anything about the queasy statement of General N. Jeff Lukas Ricon Romero, Inspector General of the Commanders, Chavez's traditional supporter. Even now, despite his announcement, he is Ministro de Interior and Jestia. <br /> <br /> When Chavez returned, Ministro Del DePensa (equivalent to the United States Secretary of Defense) <br /> <br /> They did not mention Chavez's orders against the white people's attentiveness to the election. <br /> They did not say anything about people in this concentration that killed Chavez supporters (civilians and military personnel). <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan civil society does not say anything, and is now arguing for the election to solve the crisis and Chavez's actions to prevent elections. <br /> I'll tell you .... this film is a very big lie or a big lie.
