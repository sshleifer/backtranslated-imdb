The film has no real expectations and I am happy. I was disappointed, I was disappointed. <br /> Where to start? First, 15% of the film has stock footage of fixed fears in a dark forest field. I understand. There are effigies. <br /> Second, a fierce issue has never been described in relation to the gruesome and unusual events. <br /> <br /> Third, the film was very tight. I'm for the B-film with innocent violence that is the result of bloodbags, crying women, and the result of a general mental or ancient curse. But those films often worry about their B-movies and Dead Snow (hilarious Scandanavian Zombie movie) or Evil Dead 2. <br /> Finally, there should be more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said it. If you want to see a garbage horror movie, do it with the killing. <br /> If you have a hot and a semi-hot girl, one of them needs to show at least the next booze. <br /> <br /> As a summary, "scarecos" and just poke your eye. You say thank you.
