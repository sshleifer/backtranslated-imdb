Twilight Zone has achieved a certain epic about it - as far as Star Trek. There are many dedicated lovers on what each episode winner wants. They do not objectively evaluate the 10 people and the exhibition scorers. For this reason, we have reviewed the entire Star Trek episodes (good and bad) for a while, as all ratings and reviews are very positive. Now, this is the time to do the same thing for The Twilight Zone. <br /> I've done many episodes 10. The writing is actually awkward and evil. In a great battle, two people appear to walk through the whole episode from rival sides. Shortly afterwards, it is clear that they are only two people on the ground - you actually learn in a stupid and totally unbelievable resolution. In the end, ultimately the twist makes the episode great - it killed one!
