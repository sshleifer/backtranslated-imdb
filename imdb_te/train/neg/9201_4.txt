This is a picture that portrays D and D scares in the 80s. People who are playing D & D (or any other role-playing game for that matter) will lose "the ability to" and lose the ability to recognize reality from fantasy (and sprays killing, child sacrifice, suicides etc.). It's a great movie for anybody who wants to blame society's problems on lifeless objects, but anyone who plays a role-playing game, video game or a play will also see it as insult to their intellect. What is W & D what D is for the classes. Plus is an image, it just kinda sux.
