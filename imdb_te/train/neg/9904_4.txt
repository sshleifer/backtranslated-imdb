The film 'Gang Ho!': The Story of Carlson's McKin Island Riders was intended to go to the American people's morale during World War II in 1943. This is a good way to have a piece of movie promotion. The value of this film is not just a collection and art. It is directed at the promotional film and useful for the judge of the actors. See how interesting it is to learn how to learn promotional activities in movies or if you have a big role in Robert Mitchem, who has a small role in the film. If you want to see a movie for the Second World War, they are very good and aim. I rated it 4/10.
