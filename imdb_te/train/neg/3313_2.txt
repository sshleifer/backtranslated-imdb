How can anyone say that this movie is comedy? If I went along with me, I slept and asked for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but she's in the wrong set. I like the most chic flicks, but I hated this one. It's been a long time and did not look too lame. That outfit has surpassed. No one is no longer talking that way and I do not even think then they will. Dancing is terrible ... My former said after me ... "Do not you feel that part? Did this mean? I only told her not to leave her feelings. Now I know that we never married. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.
