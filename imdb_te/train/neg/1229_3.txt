Sorry, Kim Beasinger feared a good job acting, this was one of the worst thrillers I had seen for a while. While 4 teenagers were scared of this woman outside a crowded mall, a logic was thrown out to shoot a security guard. Yet no one seems to notice. Then, instead of throwing for help or racing back to the mall, she drives her and ends up in the woods with the boys in hot pursuit. I can not even explain why this 4-year-old woman fleeing the vicious thugs, fleeing the red tool box, screaming to God to help her, and after having killed others badly, one of them has sexual relations. Please believe me, it's bad and bit tastier.
