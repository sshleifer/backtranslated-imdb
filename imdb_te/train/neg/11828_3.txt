A few months ago, I was involved in a discussion with another IMDB poster (Hay, Kimaden) about this film. If the poster gave me a 'flushed away' option, I would like it. <br /> <br /> "Flushed Away" Good intentions (at least in the part of Aardman), but it does not have the strength to combine it all. Its best property is the raw rat / boat captain, Rita (played by Kate Winslet), who is the main character of the IMO, Rodi (Hugh Jackman) film. Rita's cool, rugged, and curiously, Roddy spent much of his screen time sniffing. <br /> <br /> With one of the things that hurt me about 'fa'. When Roddy is hit in the crowds, the film will make him hit five times soon. One of the Rtty brothers, "Then my name is Shaky," then took Roddy at least three times. <br /> I do not spend time on the Pixar side of Katzenberg's Copptonian trends (similar to a random, fifth split). But I'll say I'm disappointed in Aardman. They can do very well (and have done). Try the next guys harder.
