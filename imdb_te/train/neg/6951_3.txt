<br /> <br /> When you are in order to steak you hates it but the restaurant will give you chicken. <br /> I have seen this so-called "Battlestar Galactica". <br /> <br /> Imagine if you sit at this proverb restaurant that I told you. You're waiting for years to bring back the famous New York strip steak you love. When your meal came, they found that the name "New York Strip" was applied to a chicken dish. But the waiter just tells you "But Zhu Chekken, EES is really good Zir"! Is not chicken good? A Steak - You Need a New York Strip! The waiter explains, "You wanted to do Zir Zir, Jee Sheaf, as you zoomzing newly, zezezing.Ze would be more popular with cheeken we gave it the name of our previous tasty dish". If you ever find the original New York strip in the future menu, you can not see the original New York strip as the restaurant now has a dish called "New York strip" in the menu <br /> "Create something new, This is what is named "Battlestar Galactica." <br /> <br /> The original version for all fans of this small series! <br /> <br /> The Responsibility of Resurrecting the Beji is a must-have for the original series and should not be attempted to sell these new episodes by utilizing the name of Battlestar Galaktica, how to improve fans. <br /> <br /> Saifi Channel If you want us to give a new performance, then do it!   ్వండి! వీక్షకులను ఆకర్షించే ప్రయత్నంలో మనం ప్రేమతో ఉన్న పేరును ఉపయోగించవద్దు. <br /> <br /> అసలు మేము అసలు గురించి ఏదో చెప్పాము ఎందుకంటే మేము BG గా తెలుసుకున్నది చూడడానికి మేము 25 సంవత్సరాల పాటు ఎదురు చూస్తున్నాము! We just did not want the residue of NAME and the minimum concept. <br /> Actually, perhaps the best of the original are ignored. Certainly, the original BG is incomplete and may use some updates. However, this small series has not developed in any case, but special effects (which are unusual by today's standards but not exceptional). <br /> <br /> Many viewers will discuss the quality of this <br /> <br /> "I will give you some comments about the merits of this new mini" <br /> <br /> War scenes are the best.
