This is one of the most fascinating, lucid, unnatural and nonsense films ever made! It did not even try to make a glamorous image that everyone in this project feels almost the same. This is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series that attempts to earn money on the success of Smokey and Bandit. For the sake of this waste of the film stock, Burt Reynolds are dull and lifeless than staring at foot a footage, humorless untold, and many scenes for a couple of hours, as the car races do not give too much to do other actors, wasting his way through the whole movie sleepwalks, Jim Nabors. "Stroke Ace" is a silly film that is neither unique nor distinct.
