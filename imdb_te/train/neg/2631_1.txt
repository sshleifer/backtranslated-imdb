A president who plans to kill the president will give a secret service to a Secret Serviceman about a secret service man. Baloney. How do you know the bum? The script then turns to a very detailed test of how the Secret Service works, but who cares. This slows down the image too. All of the tiresome car of several movies follows the version of this film. Then, after a lot of athleticism outruns our hero and guns all his friends, we have a shootout in Toronto City Hall. Canadians are clearly identified with maple leafs, but how do they get? Finally, all work. But it still does not make sense.
