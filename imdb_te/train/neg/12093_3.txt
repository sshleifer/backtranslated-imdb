Isabelle Hubert is an outstanding actor. The "La Pianist" director gives the viewer a long time with Hubert's face, and it is a pleasure to watch. Hubert is not an animated actor - she enters emotion with a little eyebrow or smile's little lift. <br /> <br /> This film, which I would like to recommend, is not just an enjoyable actor who is enjoying her experience. (Self-disability, sado-masochism, and bizarre behaviors, "La pianist" may work for you, but I can not find any value in any other than these symptoms.) <br /> <br /> All this strange matter is buried in the kernel. <br /> <br /> Very rarely people who are competing - musically, athleticly, or whatever - starts as strange people and come into shape with strangers in the competition atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Let me introduce you to a movie theater. <br /> <br />
