I saw this film twice. I can not believe that Pinky is such a fantasy film. I am also a film / drama director and I will talk about what. This is not Romania, but I see the events happening at the same time from September 11th. There is no story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing deep, nothing is hidden. <br /> <br /> Many people in Romania do not know, this film is not for the French audience but for us. They really believe that the reality in Romania. For young people too. Stop pintile films. Even if we call this film, I can not say it's probably a horror. We are wondering why we have earned such a film in Europe. It's true, but it's not longer. A friend from a British embassy said to me a friend: "You do not know where the Romanian people went from the Seujas."
