This film is very awful, it's almost fine ... almost. We like music, but it's not. Despite the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography and many other actors singing or dancing, Anthony Rap was actually able to deliver better performance (especially at the end). Marjorie's character, a drunkard lady, is also happy to see. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unexpected and can be funny without the terrible singing and cheesy piano music. Also, some songs (hypocrites) are pretty impressive (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> The open house is so funny that it is terrible! We think this is a good platform (with wonderful actors).
