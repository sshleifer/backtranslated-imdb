I was surprised at how this film was seen this afternoon. Do not mistake me, George C. Scott is a stunning figure of Schr√∂g, but the rest of the cast has failed very badly. Sometimes I can not stop laughing at the stupid acting and recurring line: "Merry Christmas to all!" <br /> <br /> The film relies on a short book called Charles Dickens, a great man who thinks it's not just a hamburg to Christmas. <br /> <br /> After 30 minutes, Rich Guy visits through three demons, convincing him to celebrate Christmas. <br /> <br /> This script is very bad, minutes, so it can be rated well. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend you, Scrooged Bill Murray's comedy. At least, funny ...
