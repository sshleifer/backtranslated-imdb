Well, I can not see why I honestly think of everyone. Its not really. There are two good things that come out of this film. Jack's performance, he can tip my hat. 2. Danny's performance, he is good. No other other then it got too stupid. And, do you think about Stanley Kubrick Shelley portraying as a vendame? She is very bad. Every time she feared she looked the same. The problem with the movie ended. Kubrick had it more respect if I had it differently. And, all the cinema is just stupid. The problem book with the picture is very good. So this movie does not read the book and you are better. 3/10.
