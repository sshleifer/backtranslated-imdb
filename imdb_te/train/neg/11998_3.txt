This terrible, terrible picture !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> All the TOOO is the first one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever you feel like you ' /> This story is very repulsive and badly written, it does not matter whether the characters die or die ..... <br /> I have some expectations from this movie but my expectations are completely crashing in the first few minutes ...... <br /> <br /> The film is good about MUSIC ...... and obviously the education balloon. And all the senior actors ...... She is just a new actor and yet she shines and looks so pathetic with the other cast !!!!! Govinda and Blonde are also helping to save this destructive movie by playing his love interest. Govinda is definitely the driver in the role of the driver. <br /> Another talent actress Ayesha Takiya is completely in the film Akshay did his role well but it was topped! Anil and Juhi are also completely wasted. <br /> <br /> Salman is not just wasted. /> <br /> All in all, the Impossible film storyline is composed of stupid comedy scenes with the missmessment screenplay and the duo musular. <br /> <br /> It's four hours long! RETHINK !!! Avoid good !!!!!
