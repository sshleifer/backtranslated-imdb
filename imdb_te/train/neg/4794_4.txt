Why do you see it There is only one reason and it has the greatness of John Saxon. I love his acting. My favorite performances by him were Nightmare on Elm Street 1,3, and 7 in Nancy's Father Cop, as a cop as Black Christmas, and again as Cop from Dusk Til Dawn. When I was rumored by my local mall video outlet, I came across the Zombie Death House film and I was not the only actor in the film before Sawson was moving but I heard about the director for the first time before moving it back. It was a surprise to me (yet cheaper $ 9.00 price tag) and I and I should have it. Upon arriving at home, the film is also noticed for his other work in Saxon's other works, which may have been exacerbated by additional pressure of directing. But he's not only sucks other actors. They seemed to have recently pulled out of filming porn and now you guys who really want to act. The film also appears in the romantic quality of the 80s. I can not recommend this movie to casual viewers with good faith, but if you're a long-lost fan of a culture that has come from that era by the late 80s, or worse than a fan of fame. I will also do John Saxon.
