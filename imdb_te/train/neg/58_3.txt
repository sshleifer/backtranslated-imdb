Washington, D.C. When visiting an Arab powerful, trying to kill Ohter's Emir, his life is saved as a cocktail waitress named Sunny Davis. Sunny is a national heroine and media celebrity and a reward for the United States Department of State's Protocol Division. <br /> <br /> The map we see is called Rab al Khali or empty vacancy in the Bandar Desert, which is worse in the borders of South Arabia and South Yemen. In real life, a state in this area is virtually zero and virtually zero strategic value, but for the purposes of the film, the strategic importance of the Ohtar Cold War and the American government, who are keen to build a military base, Everything needs to be done Continues. Emir had fancy the attractive young man who had saved him and he got an agreement with the State Department; They may have their base that their haret may have a fresh addition to Sunny. <br /> <br /> Sunny new job is just one night to make sure she has more opportunities to meet her. <br /> <br /> This story is related to some happy satire, but in reality the satirical content of the film has been reduced. Perhaps in 1984, American citizens were not indifferent to the satirical irony of their country's foreign policy; This was Ronald Reagan's 40th in the fifty states of the presidential election, leading its voter turnout to the voters with the Soviet Union. (The film took place two years later in the context of the Iran / Contra affair, whose tone might be different). <br /> <br /> The movie is not quite a vehicle, she shows her pruning and charm for Goldie Hayne. Sunny is a simple goldie character - beautiful, sweet nature, innocent and not too bright. However, there is a limit to how you can keep cutting and charm alone, and you can not automatically make a bad image by creating a dumb blonde. (Actually, good movie sounds like a recipe to make a bad one). Goldie tries her best to save this one, but succeeds. The role of the cause is the staggering way that she played the role. Sweet, innocent country girl from one side Sunny Oregon. On the other hand she is a 35-year-old woman who works in a subtle bar and wears an exposed dress. Rebecca's of Sunnybrook's Farm is like guessing that she's working as a bunny girl. <br /> <br /> One of the most important reasons for failing to save the film from Goldie is the best comedian or comedian, his / her subject, and the "protocol" is just unfunny. Arab men, after Western women, are very tired and distorted, especially if they are blonde and blue-eyed, who are relatively hazardous about all the serious sexual passions, however humor is tired and distorted. About a dangerous Middle Eastern ruler abducting a red-American woman and seeing the horror of Ben Kingsley / Nassassa Kinski's film "Harem", in the midst of the mid-eighties this topic has a short series of time, with a real similar storyline. Motion picture makers seem to have realized that their film did not act as pure comedy, because "Mr. Smith goes to Washington" eventually. Sunni will change from a rounded bimbo of political intellect and democracy and constitution and vote and we begin to uttering all kinds of platitudes about the Citizen's Duty of Eternal Vigilance Blah Blah of People and Citizenship Price? <br /> <br /> Goldie Honey made good comics like "Cactus Flower", "Overboard" and "Issues", but "Protocol" is not one of them, I did not see all of her pictures, but this horrible comedy Very bad.
