From the initial dialogue and scenes, I know for a rail wreck. I do not want to see, but it does not turn around. The film's eye was not for candy, I would have given it a star. The fact that the interaction between the characters and the behavior of the relationship has been received so far, added by the poor direction and the horrific story makes nothing more than the low budget disaster of this film. Money definitely does not need to make a good movie. <br /> If you are trapped in the woods, your childhood best friend will die from an unknown disease, while other friends around you will get trapped in a strange way. <br /> <br /> Flee from everyone and make your fortune at yours. B.) Have sex relations with your friends. C) Take your bath as a hot bath to mitigate your hardships. D.) Your baby's best friend and beard on the life-long crush head with the chin. E.) The above. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, most of these answers did not come. In fact, all are acceptable and well represented in the cabin fever. The overall shortage of reality and unwelcome effort is to explain what the movie will do in painful situations in your local rental shop. Stay away. Stay away.
