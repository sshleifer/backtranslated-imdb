This film is sort of enjoyable until Ed Norton's facial hair problems. One afternoon he had a light beard playing but the same evening chin and much lemon juice was replaced - without revealing any plot details. It's more fuller than a bearded goat. Later, on a dark night, the whiskey opened and he cleansed the heavens. This is not a choice to stop the jaw. These continuity contrasts distanced me from the rest of the images and destroyed the reliability of the past. भी, I was alone reminiscent of De Niro's in the taxi driver in a long sequence of cowboy alone in his bedroom. Even this meant that the viewer was laid on a very thick, even if it was meant to be a tribute.
