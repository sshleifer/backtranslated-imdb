At first this film was not that bad.It was fun ... at least for me all the reasons probably me. <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of the obscene Christopher Reeve film The Damned Village. Both films have different plots, but the creepy frustration and unwanted comedy are both. <br /> <br /> Let the wicker man be a secret / thriller / male. <br /> <br /> When Nicholas Cage received a letter from Kylligraphy from his long-lost husband, who lost his long time, who claimed that his daughter was taken by fellow islanders and secretly. <br /> <br /> Cage is a police officer and he goes to semi-stranger island because he is a tired policeman. Stupid. <br /> <br /> Amish - his fianc√© did not help any of the large peninsula on his peninsula, as he seemed to be elusive and unhealthy. <br /> <br /> The island is located on the island when Cage learns that he is his daughter and is the unfortunate victim to the island during the island's sick crops. Did not come well. <br /> <br /> "There are many potholes in the film, and I am angry with all the women Apart from being uncompromising on the island, the way the film is painted is just fantastic.While many women are slumming and angry, this is clearly a form of sexism. Maripotanu I hate the movie. The film is something to see one or two times a day. It's not just a strange classified thriller.
