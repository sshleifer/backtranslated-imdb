The DVD is a joke, the first few minutes audio synchronization and the voice of Segals is also terrible with the sound! Pathetic! <br /> <br /> When audio synchronization improved in 5 years, poor plots, lines and actors need to get a different job because no film businesses can exist. <br /> <br /> If Seagal is doing this, it is good to have another party participating in this program, but it is totally disgraceful for everyone involved And it's insulting to those who see it. <br /> <br /> In 20 minutes, I stopped it. <br /> <br /> I do not ask for my money back in the blockbuster!
