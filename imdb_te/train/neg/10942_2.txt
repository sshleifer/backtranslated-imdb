Lorenzo Lamaas Jack 'Solider' Kelly is a former-Vietnam vet and a rebellious go-down coffeemaker who will go back and destroy to save his sister from Rednex. Deadly image is very cheap and Ron Palillo is the third bill, and yet 3 minutes of screen time, and that's not so good any good. Overall, a horrible movie, but a scene from Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hangs from a tree and some of the gagged ones are laughing. After a better sequel.
