Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a big problem in his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Caber), helped him capture the supernatural Tes (Tracy Griffith), The First Power (the Satan gave him after his execution in the gas chamber) the dead bodies of the weak. Some people, Russell joining Russell (who understand what they are doing), stop channing or most women die in his bloody hand. They seek help from Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlene) who tried to notify his bosses in the Catholic Church of First Power, but declined a weapon that could crane with a blade that could block the chair. The Chinese heart shattered his evil world. She will help Russell take anyway, and he needs all the help she can get when she comes to kid kidnapes who are preparing Tess for some sort of a form of culture / celebration. <br /> <br /> Michelle Williamson, always a reliable welcoming assistant, receives a partner of Russell's character. As in this kind of films, everyone around Russell is dying, but when he attempts to kill Chang, he murders the weak host of others's poor soul. <br /> <br /> Pure quilt rubbish. Gate to the finish line. Try Philips and Griffith, I'll give them, but in this way they do not stand a chance. Cubbler is often heavily influential, really jumping into the air and nothing more than a goofy villain that touches rotten idols.
