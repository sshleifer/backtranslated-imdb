Well, do not let my essence deceive you. This movie is SUCKS HARD. But the worst ever movie? People are not afraid of this kind of people to explain the brains. But it's worse than Manaus: The fate, the hobbobilins, the spider's or the small hand of the spider island. The film sucks as a review, it's terrible. Do not look at it with MST or you can develop health problems. But there are worse movies.
