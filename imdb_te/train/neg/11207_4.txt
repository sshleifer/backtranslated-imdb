As an avid fan of Flashman books by George MacDonald Fraser, I waited to see flashy on the big screen when the film was first released. Unfortunately it was a big disappointment - I left alone for 20 years to go back to see again, but the latter was not improved. Mr Fraser is an amazingly skillful author, but I'm not a fan of Richard Lester's work on his film screenplay. I'm insane to 'The Three Musketeers' for the Slapstick and the same applies here. For me, the whole tone of the film and the feeling is wrong. Flashman books are terrifying, but they are novels of adventure. The flashman has the most intensity of the adventures that have - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. It is notified in novels, but everything in the movie is unknown because of its funny style. It's a wonderful shame because it would have been a more reliable adaptation of the book style. When I read that the book was originally portrayed, the film claims that Olivier Reed is acting. I read, because the essence of Flashman. I liked how to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit into the visual image of the flashman created by the books (looks very strong! Reid is as bizarre as ever, and the killing of the movie is made as comedy, killing Flashman Gatot (Tom Bell) for the only scene of creating a real atmosphere in the book. , Costumes, sets Etc. Casting is usually amazing - the film is very different from Malcolm McDowell for everyone.Richard Lester's direction is responsible for this film, recently Radio Broadcasting of Frander Frieder, received by Fraser, worked very well.One day when we saw flashman Legal on screen Did.
