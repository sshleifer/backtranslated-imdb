<br /> <br /> Cast: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbett <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? ? 2 ?? 1! Thunder birds go! <br /> <br /> Thunderbirds, childhood favorites of mine are beginning. When I hear that they're going to make Thunderbirds, I'm ecstatic. I can not wait to save Thunderbird 2 people, will Thunderbird 4 dive deep? You got the idea. I can not wait. The film was finally released in August 2004. Critics denied it, but I still wanted to go. After all, as long as the heart is in the same position, it is very important to me. I sat in the theater, only one young man who met 50 people. The most probably awkward theater experience I have ever had ?? <br /> <br /> The film (intended as a prequel) Alan Tracy (Brady Corbett) focuses on the younger age of the Tracy family. He spends his days in defense of his family and his family, but he is too young. One day, he finally gets his chance when Hood (Ben Kingsley) is trapped in the Thunderbird 5 (space station) of his family. It would have him to dodge the servants of the hood and save his family before stealing all the money from The Whole Bank of England. <br /> Trust me, Plan Thunderbird when you're reading on paper. What is the mess in our hands after it gets into the film? For the first time, the film was intended for a child, as the original show. However, Jenny Anderson has acted like we were older, and gave us a plot that goes far beyond for children's programming. On the other hand, as the plots down the plots it tries to make a ripoff of the Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a movie that will appeal to fans of the Thunderbird series and children, which is totally missing. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Frax is convinced that he never wanted to direct. They gave a solid performance to the script they gave. Ben Kingsley is very unusual as the hood, for the most part played the role. <br /> <br /> My complaint to the characters is related to the servants of The Hood, which are deduced from the old Looney Tunes cartoons and are taken care of adequately by children. <br /> What's odd about it? When I was watching the movie, I was just fun. But once the lights went up, I realized that the movie was very bad, i was $ 8 and my time was two hours. Wrongful happiness? Maybe. Even so, Thunderbirds is an unforgettable mess. Instead of a big "go", I recommend that I stay away from this film. If the rest of the movie is the first ten minutes, it is a wonderful movie that deserves the Thunderbirds. However, fans of hard Thunder birds that we die (if you want to see your child crumbling) or get a movie to be very bored. <br /> Thunder my bird for birds 1 Â½ stars.
