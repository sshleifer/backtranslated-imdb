Although I recently put it on my 10 worst films list, it's worse than Burt Reynolds in "Madling" or "Look Who Talking" sequels. Furthermore, despite the horror-film response to Holly Gowleyley, she was not seen as a harsh look, as she moved from New York City to Los Angeles with sexy Drew Barrymore. Poor Sally Kelmer, an actress who receives great appreciation in the '70s, is down to the frivolous supporting role, and Barrymore's prominent guy George Newbern pits for Sitcom's bad act, always laughing after each line. The film is spell, but Drew's Bloody Shower Scene Showmanship, and Psycho's Identity (albeit the "Scooby Doo" episode to the right) is interesting. But for the end ... get true! Who had to clean up the mess? * ** from
