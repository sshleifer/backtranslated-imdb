I love this kid as a child, but looking back over 20+ years, it really succeed. The Academy up may be back in 1980, but there is nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes hold much better than this steam puppy today. <br /> <br /> I recently bought a DVD that I thought was the gem that I remembered. Well, I was WAY off! The soundtrack contains only 2-3 accredited hits (smash compilation not mentioned by others) and often voice-overs are terrible. The only thing that's interesting to me is the assessment of the lines of the character before they say it. Yep, I see this movie a lot back! <br /> <br /> The only reason for writing this review is to give me my two cents on why to forget this movie. :(
