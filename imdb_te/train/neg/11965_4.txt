As a history of interest in this particular historical event, I was disappointed with the film. Of course, the costume and performance are quite standard, but this "Hollywood image of the British Little Big Horn" is really boring. <br /> <br /> Film footage dedicated to the marching or parade of troops is an unprecedented image in the history of the film. Eveytime I heard the successful background music began, I know that the fill fill was to prepare me for another awkward scene. Obviously, the producers invested heavily in "staging" and decided to obtain the value of their money. <br /> <br /> Despite the unusual actors, their conversation is boring again and their characters have never been developed. I'm afraid of disappointment whenever Peter Otell or Burt Lancaster completes a scene. <br /> <br /> I thought Laurence and Alcoraz's Bird Man in Arabia were two great actors in succession. <br /> <br /> There are worse myths, but not better.
