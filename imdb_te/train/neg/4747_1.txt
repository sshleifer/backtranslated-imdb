I thought this film was terrible. I'm Chinese, so I thought it was totally wrong. The facts are very wrong. This matter is only about Chinese history when the silver mother explained to her husband about the shields of Shi Huang. I also felt that the fight sequences were very cheesy and fake. Most actors and actresses are not so great. Some of the jokes that are supposedly "funny" are really stupid. I want this film to get the worst rating it can get. If Disney really wants to create an extravagant image to get more information about Chinese history. Mulan is very clear. Watch this movie if you want to waste some time.
