I love Henry James's books and Washington Square is no exception. It is a pleasure to see a new film based on the title book. Jennifer Jason Lee is an outstanding actress and Ben Chaplin is good enough to play the lead roles. Albert Finney had a bad impression and did not play well. I want to shoot Maggie Smith ... or she's a crazy, disappointing character. <br /> <br /> I'm asleep, watching this tall, out, unexpected boring image. There are more spaces in the dialogue than pinter play. In the book I thought Catherine Slopper and a deep attention to her life. The film has just the opposite effect. I do not like the twist that Morris has with her aunt sexy attraction. Eeeeeeeek. <br /> If you can not sleep, it is a perfect snooper. If you are discouraged, do not see it. <br /> <br /> "Heires" is unusual in title characters with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift. The actor who is starring his father is in an unexpected and cold dad ... in the mourning of his dead wife, he hates the cathedral. This film is not confident in the book but it is not one. <br /> <br /> This film is a box office flap. I have no doubts.
