I'm more willing to be open minded about rom coms than most people, but it's not just a very good effort. There is nothing in comparison with its British counterparts - I do not see, and I doubt it. <br /> <br /> This is a huge amount of money on the screen wearing the Fallen clothes and the lack of chemistry between the leads and its intended male lead (Jimmy Fallon). And a 15-year-old hairdresser and a younger than a decade old. He needs to be a teacher that you see, and in fact school schools want to appoint less mature people than children who love to teach around the world. This character was very disturbing and irrational, and I doubt whether any actor liked him, but old beliefs like John Cusack or Adam Sandler gave it a shot. Not funny, not funny, or an actor, but he seems to think of both. Whether Fallon does not believe in his role at all in the amount of the film, or whether these two people believe or not. At the end of the film there is a scene that Barrymore (as beautiful as usual but not alone can not carry this one - its hard to have a guy romance) has been done a lot, over it, and tells her moving to Fallen. And worrying about the scene, or sorry for the Fallen, you're actively encouraging her - what should she do about her months ago. But of course the Plot Mechanics does not allow it to be at the end (in fact it can make the announcement of this mess), and instead we encourage this childhood idiot and his illusions to chase the rational career girl all over. Of course it's Goo and intended to be satisfying, but it's actually more disgusting than anything.
