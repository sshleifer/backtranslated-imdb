I thought the film was the worst of the nightmare series. <br /> <br /> When I was about 20 minutes after the film, I could not remember it, and I had tires to write a review on it. <br /> Okay, # 4 is a joke and a freddy joker. He returned to the roots of the # 5 series. It's a good thing, it's darker and more atmosphere than Nightmare 4. They tried to shoot a horror film instead of comedy. Unfortunately they forgot the suspense and scared. Because that nightmare 5: The Dream Child is not funny or it's scary. <br /> There is a good picture of what we actually get (except Lisa Wilcox) for Plaza (Lisa's friends killing Freddy using Lisa's friends dreams). The base but it's 90 minutes film is not enough. Sometimes the story is very confusing (there is no reason for it) and you can not be surprised by the filmmakers. The screenplay should have more holes than Swiss cheese and therefore the movie is very cheesy (tell me I'm not cheese when I come from Switzerland). <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> My rating: 4/10 (It is used, # 6 is also a It's worse ...)
