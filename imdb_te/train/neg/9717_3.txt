A clear, clear thriller-by-numbers, in which only the twist turns out to be nothing. I'm mainly looking for English language performance by Isabelle Hubper. It's not great, but it's a strange character. I would not be surprised if half her contribution remained in the cutting-room room along with many last minute script. <br /> <br /> Acting about the film is at least attractive. He looks like everyone else Steve Guttenburg looks like he's trying his character meat to charm him. His sexual prowess is a sensational stupid order which suggested that PTSD may be able to help treat. This is an uninteresting performance. Elizabeth McGuvern is a real draw and character with a real draw, but this is a little comfort. 3/10
