I saw Rock Hudson, Lauren Beckel, Robert Stoke & Dorothy Malone - Robert On the Wrath of On the Wind. Only bloody terrible - he was considered the lovely jet-set millennial - instead he went from a word to the jerk - the plot stupid and tired and had 3 cheeses of "erotic" leads. Some Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress - even though her campy trips were boring - the biggest sister from Sprandler in Glass thought to be innocent and boorish and glamorous. Director Douglas Cirk violated their way through the whole cast speech, and the final result was 99 minutes. In a smart role in the actor who star in the Chief of Smart Get Smart
