Wow, this film is not only a "new lesson in real bad taste", but also a lesson in "the preparation of real evil images". Do not make me wrong, I appreciate the concept of 'Zombie' 90: Extreme Peralalins, but at the same time a movie can be terrible. If you missed the protagonist, the plot of 'Zombie' 90 will cause the state of the airplane to crash into the jungles of the forest, causing chemicals to kill the locals. The next thing you know is that all of the zombies are eating people alive, but the Goofy-looking doctor and the government agent are trying to figure out the disease that somebody else has to eat - so the name of "Extreme Possilance" Since then, all the zombies we see have a field day for each local - nothing but serious and sickening disembowelments and pieces and gore pieces together with endless buckets. When it became a German film, the film was translated into English, and while you were smiling at the hunters of the zombies, the voice-overs were also very fun and fun. User UnratedX * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER * There is a scene in the film crossing the line between not acceptable and unacceptable, so she is a woman carrying a baby baby, wheeled some Dude and a group of zombies in her wheelchair come out of nowhere and attack them . When the baby listens to the cry, a piece of the baby is put on the side of the baby and eating its organs. Wow, this is a new lesson in really bad taste. I'm scared.
