It's fun when you stop and think about it: The frightening movie fans are deep and respectful of those daytime frightening folks. Texas Chainsaw Massacre can give us nightmares, but we can not feel the true feelings of love for Gunnar Hansen in Brutal Massacre in us (Faithful) or for the Four Forfeiture, the eternal and permanent hero of the original Don dead? To stand in his guest role in the remake and to stay enthusiastic (Tom Sawney's guest role); I'm not a child. And Brian Halloran and ... okay, you have my motion (if not, just stand to stand ...). These are some of the heroes of horror. It is almost unknown to see that the film is mixed in a single image (at least to this level, to my knowledge). If the author (s) is only for such a monumental task. Maybe someone else, in the line, will try again. This is not another half-hearted effort (for example, Blood Brother, for example).
