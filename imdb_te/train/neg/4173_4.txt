I would be happy when I saw the trailer. Futuristic soldiers, nasty donkey vampires are taken by art White White Ironside ... in space. I did not expect elite art, but it's a B-movie scene. It is no doubt a TV pilot, who was later taken into a movie and then did not choose it. Correctly I start making movies a few good points, action is effective for a low budget movie, and can not be used by CGI and the used sites. Now on the evil, the first Michael Ironside is this barley, and here for his performance .... Well it's cheesy not in a good way. But as I said it is not much, I can not blame him. One thing that is really stupid, is the PETA type group for vampires, no I'm not joking, which is the most unbelievable thing I've seen along time, and it's serious. Also the film is one of the major B movie cinemas, which damages and breaks a lesbian scene. Most of the things that sink this movie do not happen. Since it is a pilot, this is not a simple end because the script does not exist. Even the main villains come in the end only. If anytime a film is to be slimmed and the gore factor, it is Vampire Wars. At the end I will say the main crew on the spacecraft, all very capable actors and well put this mess behind them, and move on to big and good things. They do not have anything to work here.
