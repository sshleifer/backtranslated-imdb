We feel great when we go to see this bomb. This was basically a Broadway play on the film. The music is plain terrible. There is not a memorable song in the film - have any hits heard from this film? Nothing is because you're not. As long as musical numbers go, I go to the restroom and start getting some popcorns. If they have good songs - but they suck. Develop slow and terrible character of speed. The main song was praised for her singing, but she sounded every song - it was almost impossible to stand. No one can offer this movie but the die-hard Broadway enthusiasts. There is no doubt in the highest rated movie I've ever seen in my entire life. Full waist of time and money. There is nothing memorable about this film except Danny Glover - not enough on screen and its character is not adequately developed. Rent a video and you agree - this image is expensive, productive, polished dog.
