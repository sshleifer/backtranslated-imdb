The premise of the film is explained and you do not pretend that I am a film critic if you have earned this. My view of the film is very small. I'm a fan of Takashi Miqay but in the category of great work along with DOA 2 and 3 and some others (many). <br /> <br /> This film is for free, because it is not a mistake of Takashi's film and Takashi is because it passes. This is the highlight of the film. For the rest of us we are totally annoying for the real reason (and yes, it takes away from this film), the pace of the film reaching almost the levels of RigMortis, and acting ... well ... Hmmm. <br /> <br /> If you are a Takashi fan, you will not see your tastes as much as possible. It develops any character from any realism (see the Neverending Story) or the main role in the conflict background. <br /> <br /> As the first film to be co-authored by Micheus, it is not as if we expect to kill Mickey's personality. Into the screen. <br /> <br /> We offer some of the Tokyo Miyake shots to the photographer director in the film. The campus is not very difficult to run in the premises. <br /> If you enter my mike, my advice is to go to certain standards like Gozo, Ichi and Audition. The film was then featured in Blues' Harp, Fudo, Renee Dog, Bird People of China.
