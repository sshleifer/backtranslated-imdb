Raymond Burr is a grateful advocate of his friend's grandson (Dick Forn) for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). This film is of special interest to its fans if he is inspired by his fans, the year before, after Perry Mason. <br /> <br Interesting. Lansbury is always nice, but her role is entirely clear in the dimensional and mystery of her crimes in mystery. There is an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter in love with "Femme Fatale", but the character of BÃ¼r is very beautiful. It is apparently bizarre to see an actor like Burn Lansbury, and his Hallti delivery does not exactly match his role, because I have acted in many movies. The title of the entire suspense film and Barry's character is thought to be the role of Lansbury's to meet her (a double episode preventing her from attempting her original murder). <br /> When she comes into the room where she dreamed, she does not have a large tape recorder. <br /> <br /> Some unexpectedly pleasant movements and mainly rest are TV.
