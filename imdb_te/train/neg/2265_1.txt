I would like to see Jerry in the rest of the world, but this poor need for the soft-core porno is unnecessarily objectionable and does not resemble wit, and just works as a self-promoting vehicle for Springer. It runs within 90 minutes, though the movie is worse, and I have a general feeling to go out. It's just brutal.
