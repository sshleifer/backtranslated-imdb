The film is basically a story of a sister / friend of a Russian sister returning to his home village for funeral. There are other short story lines, they are actually more interesting than one, but they are not fully explored. The ultimate funeral of the doll, awakening and subsequent controversial, selling dolls and selling vodka, but is now missing the artist who market their dolls. Clearly, the image can not be corrected. The journey of adultery from the city to the village is a dull and endless train ride and muddy. Maybe it's supposed to impress us with the greatness of Russian landscape. The village itself, as it is, the widows lived in a legion and was a male, dead girl's wife. Continuing the toy business is problematic for everyone and ultimately impossible. The film is very tired of having a hand-held camera, which stimulates nausea. Another problem for Western audiences is that the coins do not contain songs and criticism in subtitles. Do not go to the film unless you are fluent in Russian.
