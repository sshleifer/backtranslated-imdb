First of all, if you're a funny fan, well, I'm sure you'll be very disappointed! Low budget image !!! Largo Comic was supposed to be Serbian, and suddenly he became cinematic, pfff! The Chicken producers have given some spice and gates to the comic (by the way, his father speaks Serbian and he speaks Spokes ... Lol). Striking N.Y. Winch Building H.K. The usual average-small boat becomes. The good looking largo becomes some coherent Tzigan / Turkish looking person. Freddy cool 'scarf' pilot becomes some fat, out of shape, sad, average person. Simon, the good friend of Largo, is not at all! He gave some peppers! Largo does not throw swords at all, but just a few snakes stares ... The whole story looks like chaos and a pretentious TV-movie. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, the ability to fit the comic correctly or technology, please keep some Romantic shoots in Paris. Very bad movie, good thing I rented it, do not count me to see the sequel (if any!).
