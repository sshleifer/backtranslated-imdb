In five minutes, and this is where I headed. Launching ideas of insolence and rebellion through the administration of the Bunch School of high school students. I told my girlfriend: If I was below 5 on the IMDb I would go and read a book. It got 5.0, so convinced me to look at me. What are good things Well, this is not good for the story, because you are definitely distracted by editing. Like drawing of a student cracked by one of the teachers, all footage for the film was cut in a freak accident with meat-grinder and the remaining half was destroyed, the remaining half-bits in two-second. In ten seconds of local TV news there are six cuts and three different angles. And then there are montages. This is all electronic music set, so you're still crying every time you hear it about every three minutes as forewarns of another montage, Pavlov's dog. Oh, I said good about this movie. In the scenes - a nice color palette that is perfectly suited to such emotional stuff. Okay, now with the main flaw of the film, and this is not the story, is not. The director has made a serious mistake that led you to mislead people and the situation, not by the wise heroes, but by choosing well about the main characters. It's just cheating. He guess he did it to make the central character more likable. But this has become a minor offense. If the story is filled with holes, it tries to correct the viewer by misleading the viewer. And often it does not have any point. And then the end. Primarily, if the mainstream villain is a coward, it is okay. Plus it already makes a point about the nature of the revolutions, which will stand up for just the cause on its head, and through the entire specified modulation, what the whole point of the picture seemed to be, already made, and very good, by animal farming. I also admit that Bill Cosby is a sin: the first to appear, the adults are always right, the kids are always wrong. And let us face it: You are not the truth except me.
