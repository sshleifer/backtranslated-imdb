Vipul Shah has done a very impressive role in the film. 'Vact - The Race Against Time' and 'Namaste London' are entertaining and entertaining. 'Singh is kingh' is fun, he has built. <br /> <br /> 'London Dreams' has a simple storyline, which tells about how successful friendship is changing the hatred. Agree, it's capable but wondering what happens when you see 'London Dreams'? In recent times, the film is probably the worst climax. Vipul Shah is the director of Vipul Shah. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second hour is good; But again the climax is horrific. How can anyone forgive someone who decides to destroy you? I'm not. Ajay Devon suddenly went to India and thanked his uncle Om Puri, who decided to forgive his diaper buddy. Salman has welcomed him with the band Baja and states that he is behind the whole episode, when he arrives in India, abusing or misusing him. Was Vipul Shah's intention to show Salman's role as God? Yes, than you have completely failed. I ask only Vipul Shawi question, do you invite a person who destroyed you with such a great reception? Write what you like, do not stimulate us audiences, we have enough knowledge to understand what's good. <br /> <br /> It is the music that Shankar-Ishan-Loy Music has provided. A song is not in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman is awesome. He takes up the film on his shoulders and makes really good in the emotional scenes. But again his character has been shown as a god, eventually making him a retard. Ajay is equally good, but Salman is completely shadowy. Asin Wasted, and what is the great talent like Om Puri in this film? Ranivijay Homs, but Aditya Roy Kapoor is the best. <br /> <br /> All in all, this dream remains a dream.
