Heston's films: "The African Queen" "Heaven Mister Allison" "Heaven's Origins" "Misfits" ... "The Barbarian and the Geisha" (often in the general sense of the term) is another good example to talk. Japanese stuff seems to be sophisticated during works like "World of Suony Wang" and "Teahouse of August Moon" and "Sayonara". Perhaps the misfortune of Houston's work (perhaps "excluding Susie"). Jon Wane Ford's perfect fit in the world, in Houston as a bull in a China store. His Japanese partner is totally torn. Dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) The film does not save from perfect boredom. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
