Savage is a horror film I have ever seen so far. There is nothing remotely terrible about it. It is not desirable to be the best in a genre. First of all I do not see how many people think this piece of garbage is a great movie. If I've written something boring and totally ridiculous I'd laughed and much of its stupidity would bother others. Second: acting is terrible and the main actress is badly bad. Third: The story sucks, it is used before, and there is no need to do a cheap film. Read in the summer behind the case, it reveals the whole story. If you do not see me for 80 minutes, I'll watch this movie when you go and watch it worry. I feel really bad for the crucifixion of those crooks and their name. All snowflakes Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!!!
