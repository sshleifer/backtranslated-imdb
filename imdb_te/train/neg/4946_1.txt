Apparently, I have already watched this piece with very low expectations. Dieter Boehn is not only skillful but can overcome his ego size. <br /> <br /> It's the first cartoon film I've ever seen is 100 per cent humor. It's barbaric, offensive, red neck and blatantly anti-women. Therefore, it is a bohlen suitable for a creation, but it will be replaced by an average viewer. No need to be surprised that this was never featured in a movie theater: it's BIG bombing! <br /> <br /> The cost of 6.5 megawatt eros has not been able to save this rubbish piece. Save your time ... and money!
