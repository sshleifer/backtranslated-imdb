The first half is OK, but the last half really, really disappointing. It's funny that the producers also admitted they did not have a clue for the end, and it really showed. What really is tragedy is that I can write to the minimum ten lines of comment I can not post on this post. I really did not want to include my spare qualified spoilers because the display was not really worth that effort. When Battlestar Gelatia first came, I was really excited by the excitement of a good remake, not the first season boundary to be the first romantic place. They finally cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama, I started looking again. But Cara is a storm surge as well as with Baltar and six to end this series as God's angel.
