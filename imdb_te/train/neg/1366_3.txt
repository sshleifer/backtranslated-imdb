<br /> <br /> Really sensitive Sean Young (in some scenes, her hair looks like Elizabeth Taylor) is being shot in her early motion. Sitting behind a police car waiting to mark an image, her face and body time and distractions. Unfortunately, the change of attitude of Young's has never been over the fall. <br /> <br /> The only way to understand what is missing in Young is to compare his younger sister as an actress to play with her colleague and best friend Anneani Walker. Walker is open, emotional, and at ease at all times ... there is no clear barrier between her feeling and its expression. She is an open book. Young, on the other hand, is skittish, self-conscious way that you can expect to play your neighbors who suddenly threw into cast in a movie. Usually, she does not have a clue. <br /> <br /> When we see this big vacuum in the middle of the film, we are thinking of the fads of this story. For example, when Miss Young kidnapped the offender, she went back and locked up in the room, leaving her door unoccupied. Granted, she was wearing a bra and panties, but a similar situation, with no mental capture, can you take the time to go for the door ... or by his dresser, take some clothes and wear? I guess this and other scenes suggest that mixed emotions are facing Miss Young's character, but the young complexity does not reveal this type. <br /> <br /> There are some effective moments in the film, such as small police interviews with the victims of the past, but overall it is an unmatched attempt. While Miss Young replaced the comics book style films, some of her jokes (Batman and Dick TRACY) used her limitations because she was tired of trying to play the original people. At least in this "thriller", a sad scenes, try to be looking at Miss Young.
