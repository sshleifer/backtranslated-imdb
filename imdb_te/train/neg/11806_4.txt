The film was very hard to watch, and since I was a big fan of the original 1944 film, it was completely legitimate and aimed at. This is one of the biggest movie stars I have ever and for many. This is just a small TV movie made and many people cheated on it, I can not expect much but can not help you but compare it to '44 image. The scene after the scene, I compared what I saw and recalled how it played with Fred McMurray, Barbara Stanwick, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now Richard Creanna, Samantha Nacker and Lee J. Cobb I see the most famous characters of these famous actors. <br /> When it's all in, but there is no match for the 1944 originals. The two main areas taken by this TV movie are not as good (1) between the two main components and the lack of electricity (90) and only 90 minutes, the story will be developed between the characters and the chemistry. Kreenna and Egger flat and Macarey and Stanwick do not match "Walter Neff" and "Files Detriterson" respectively. "Barton Keys" and "Edward Norton." Heads Insurance, such as Cobbs Keys and Robert Webber, Norton, is the head of the insurance company. Changing the time frame is also somewhat interesting, so houses, cars, telephones, dictating machines etc. are among the 70s. <br /> <br /> However, one view is enough and I will happily go back to the original version of this classic story and the rest of my views on the film.
