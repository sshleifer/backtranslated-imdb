I was initially an interesting film, nowadays in a special thriller movie in Madrid, but it's nothing but it's just an interesting movie to learn about not having a movie for the Film Film Directors. The presence of an Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is also not worth the $ 3.00 dollars to watch this film, the acting is horrific and it seems that the actors are just waiting for the day-to-day shots to go home, it will lead to somewhere and boring, weaker And bad, don`t spend this movie cost or money.
