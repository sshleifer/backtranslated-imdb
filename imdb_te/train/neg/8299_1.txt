A Christmas Story A Holiday Classic and My Favorite Movie. Obviously, when I came in 1994, I worked very hard. I saw the opening day and was ready to enjoy me. I got a reversed and digest. It's not interesting from this mess to imagine that it's wrong in a Christmas story. A Red Rider BB Gun is better than a Chinese top. It's not funny. Charles Grodin is bad but the buck stops there. Bottom line: 1 star. Not even trouble.
