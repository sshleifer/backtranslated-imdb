This was the most useless commentary that I always suppressed. But "Freddies Dead" still warns you about the movie. It's not only the worst chapter of the Nightmare series, but all the time is right up with the worst horror sequel! It's boring, mean, almost death free. The terrible 3-D end and over-the-top top CORNY murders are enough to drive into this "film" field. However, do not stop there, just add bad acting, a terrible script, and the cheesy comos number and you got to heap this heaping Guano! Not surprisingly, why Freddie always played Robert England, and why two postmortem shows. That's what I did. This is certainly not only fans of the movie, stare at our shame.
