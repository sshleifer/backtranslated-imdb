Nammad has some of the best horse riding scenes, storytelling, and some of the scrambling landscape cinematography you see, but this movie is not good. It helps but the story is shining on top of these things. <br /> <br /> When it was said that the story "crisp" was "great", it was thought to be thrown together. There is no mention of many major characters from this story area (this is clearly evident by names such as Lee and Hernandez). If filmmakers want to stimulate us in culture like Juggers and Kazas, they use good actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> In the war, tribal species, a gospel, brotherly love and respect, interest in separating our "heroes" affect everything, but have fewer impacts, and many viewers have a subsequent war scene, , Or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape is brush aside. <br /> <br /> There are some significant changes made to Nomad in director and cinematographer, especially during its filming. Don Lustsen was replaced by Ivan Pacer (director) replacing Sergei Bodrove and Ulay Steiger (cinematographer). In one case, Lost seems to have a good eye, because landscapes have made his final cut here. That's definitely a good thing. But it is not a wise choice to change the director to Bodov. From what I'm looking for here, there is vision battles and people, I feel it comes from Bodrov's eyes and of the passer. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie, it's a really brilliant film that focuses on character and action. Unfortunately, high-ups are necessary to take action and take the cheapest (intellectual) way. <br /> If I do not give this image a positive rating, it's worth watching just for the excellent cinematography work. But that's it.
