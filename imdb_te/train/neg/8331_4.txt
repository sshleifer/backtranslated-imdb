What's an unfortunate mess "Sainar." I like this over-the-top, anti-film assistant, and in fact a few moments with powerful echo. Sadly, those moments are very low. <br /> <br /> When I congratulate some of Calson's efforts, no budget cinematography has been destroyed without any benefit from bones. Budget (and big budget) film, Sainy has a very painful appearance, which is almost painful. Especially the "straight" couple Linda and Young Guy. These are two poorly written characters. Acting is not very unhappy and the actor seems to have the ability to laugh or tear down when they leave their lines without skill. Unstable editing felt that these characters were totally grateful and had to be seen as the ODDBal Gay film to essentially remove the pictures. <br /> <br /> If there is anything wrong with it, there are many performances in which Coulson is trying to catch what he is expecting. The story is particularly concentrated in Bob and Tim. These two of the greatest characters and Nicholas T. King (Bob) and David Jeelinos (Tim) are very rewarding with virtually attractive performances. Tim is boxer with some serious problems. Rarely less self-esteem is in disguise as almost the cartoon as the pride he wears as shielding. Tim, boxer stalks in classic cat and mouse fashion, surprise with seemingly harmless yet ultimately creepy Bob. When the tables change and when the hunter hunts, the result of this movie's real emotional cutsis. In a film, the artificial hard-edge (which is a compliment) must have a role in the film (or break it, in this case here proves) and the final clash between Bob and Tim. Some of the real acting chops are the opportunity of the Gelnas and King <br /> <br /> Scott Step and Derris Neal, portrayed by Tony and Danny, and some of their own brave moments (sexual /), but weekly    ఒక కార్టూన్ లాంటి కళాకృతి నుండి తప్పించుకోలేరు మరియు దానిని చూడటం చాలా కష్టమే - లేదా వాటికి ఒక నోట్ సింఫనీ కనిపించే దానికంటే మరియు దానికి స్పష్టమైన దానికంటే తప్ప మిగిలిన వాటిని కనుగొనండి. <br /> <br /> Finally, this same raw material can be used to tell the story (and should be) in a good story. Yes, this is not quite a lot of recommendation yet, shows by Kings and Zelinas, are really worth something and a glimpse of what might have been seen exclusively and are worth seeing.
