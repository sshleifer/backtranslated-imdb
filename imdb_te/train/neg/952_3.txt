Happy Go Lovers everybody's time and talent, including lovely audiences. The light of the old hat recognition and faux scandal plot lines is prevalent for the pardon. Very few people saw these movies for their plot. But, they are usually some interesting little characters involved in the subtitles - not here. They usually have interesting choreography and breathtaking dance and impressive songs. Love is lovely go lovely. And Vera-Ellen played the whole movie as a whole star, which was desperately looking for a star to star in - instead she called for a film and was unable to do it. Scottish locale is ruined. Usually obscure doll is not Scottish. Photography walks. Musical numbers are pedestrian. Caesar Romero offers his usual professional performance, as no one plays his role, Walter Abel and Adolf Menzow often comment on the role of the producer. David Niven is good, and no one can David Niven as David Niven. At the end of the day, I worshiped as Neven, it was enough to make 90 minutes of happiness in Happy Go Lovely. Otherwise, skip.
