My expectation is that this director / writer has something to say. Let's see, it may be ... a. Frog storms will be creepy? B. I can refer to a person like Tom Cruise as "C" repeatedly and look like a bad Patrick Rafter? C. Get her to cast my wife and say "2" every 2 seconds. Aside I really liked the beginning and the frog storm. The rest are relentless, long-time (under-edited), high-fatal failure. You enjoyed it very glad! <br /> <br />
