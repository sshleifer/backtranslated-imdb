Time cuff <br /> <br /> Halo boll time is completely ruined. The script and dialogues are poorly written, directed by the poor and acting boundaries in Hammy. This film is clearly meant for the Rang De Basanti audience, but it is a very low mark, because it is not one of those items <br /> <br /> Compared to that nearest masterpiece, Halah Boll takes a step backwards to the scenes. The leader and leader of the leader who guided the villain's Persian rug saw the bullets in a vehicle! Although big films and big films such as Divya film and Phool Aur Kaante have become a big hit, it is acceptable for all in the 80s. Rajkumar Santoshi is a supporting director and I want to give him a social message in every film he has done but I do not know how to do it! He deliberately lectures in understanding what he says about the audience's intelligence. <br /> I mean, you may agree that if you do not agree, you will be screening. Rang De Basanti is very well and Shanti Ohki has lost the Samshoshashi industry. Busting Industry Satoshi has shot this industry in places such as back-batting, bitsching and casting bed, which is happy to be happy with a starlet named Sanya. Some believe that these parts will show the true face of the industry. <br /> <br /> Make your voice against earlier movies and do not spend your hard-earned money on this bomb <br /> <br /> * Out of ****.
