Does anyone really see this rubbish if you do not have naked kids? From the cinematic point of the scene I was one of the worst films I had ever had to face terribly. Some people have been awakened one day and I do not need the p * rn films, because they do not need a story or description of how they come in, or how they appear, or how they appear in the rural areas. I will comment on the rest of the movie but I have not spoiled my eyes, so I'll stay away, stay away and find the right image
