I really want to see this. It was an old Raj Kanwar film, which I began to look for, even disgusting, because I'm not even close to being a filmmaker. I played Shahrukh Khan in this film. I do not know this film, because I did not think it was just a simple fairy tale. I imagined a love story between Shahrukh Khan and Divya Bharathi, I thought I would play her father or uncle by Rishi Kapoor. And to my complete shock, Rishi Kapoor is actually a hero! He loves the young divine! <br /> <br /> I have a small part of this schedule, and I'm worried that this idiot is the only part of the film. 40-plus long-haired, chubby and pigeon piglet, like the old lovely divine sage kapur? Rishi Kapoor should be shocked to bring this piece; The only thing he did was ridiculous. He likes a young girl who is younger and more lazy than his own daughter - dealing with a young man in his forties. <br /> <br /> When he was more regret over his work, he acted as a pop-star. As long as they are persuasive, there is no problem. In fact, the main actors always starred alongside young girls (Amitabh Bachchan-Sridevi, Mithun Chakravarthi-Madhuri Dixit, Shahrukh Khan-Deepika, Salman Khan-Sneha Ullal) and beautifully added. Also, there is nothing against Rishi Kapoor, I feel he is a good actor and his action in Bobby is still well inscribed in my heart, but Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, <br /> Aamir Khan is watching today. Oh, and every person actually saw this movie, Shahrukh Khan made a good start. He allowed him to do so little. The late Divya Bharti made a good debut. If you want to see this film, go to the second half only. Personally, I can not do that too.
