A fine cast can not increase this simple story of the murder secretary of her husband. In fact there are more questions than the answers in the story of one side of romance and murder; And since we have been provided only to the prosecution, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of "Who Woman, Manhter" clubs appeal to America's clubs. As provided, this is just a marriage, the story of an innocent woman to be "caught up" in romance with the upper attorney. Is it possible, that she does not have two timing for her boyfriend, and having a deal with a married person, would not have been able to escape all the evil ruthlessness and misdemeanor events? When you look at it, do not worry about going to the fridge, you will not lose anything.
