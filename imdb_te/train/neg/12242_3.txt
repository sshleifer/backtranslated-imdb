I imagined a bad movie and got a bad movie. But I can not really imagine how bad this film is in my bad fantasy. I should not even try to explain what the blood surf is about. Surfing is not about blood, but a big $$ crocodile. They complain about fake tarrhea in jaws, but Spielberg is clever and does not show shark until the end. Here crocodile has been shown many times, and it is the worst fake crocodile I have ever seen, and they do not try to hide. If you want to see a good fake crocodile watch Lake Playside. <br /> <br /> The director provided a chance to make a good surf / shark film, but he had to make a bad B-monster movie. He gave the original surf to the film, but he wanted to make a monster film. So you understand how bad this movie is, is it some good parts? Not really, it got some nudity, and a sex scene taken directly out of a playboy movie. Acting is not half bad, and Kate Fischer is good. Very bad does not take her top off. The main actors are not bad either. They have some potential. The area is beautiful and the film has opened some nice surf scenes. An insulting author and director is a suspect. <br /> <br /> This conversation was some of the worst of what I saw, and the script was really bad, and the director did not get any talent and was not very fantastic. <br /> It is. If you want to see the beautiful Kate Fischer. It is not worth it. <br /> <br /> I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrj√§bal is a good nude, and Kate is cool. (But bad actress) and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Bellenghi doing good work.
