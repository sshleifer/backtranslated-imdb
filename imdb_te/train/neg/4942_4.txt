At least every new fall array display, my "3 strikes and you get out" policy deserves. I give a comedy 3 opportunities to laugh at me, ie 3 full episodes. After episode 1, I really said to TV, "Tomorrow is canceled". This is bad. I now see the first 4 episodes of "Cavemen" and could not perform a walk. A deaf, the gaffafra, the Church, of course, is not any facial movement. I will continue to punish myself by watching each event because I believe that I'm losing something apparent in this program. I'm not just "Gets", but I believe that a comedy on a major TV network is just funny; But I have nothing to laugh. ABC at least 8:00 p.m. At least at all times, it shows at least ridiculous comedy. I knew I had got an inside joke that was not jaring with my brain. I have read each of the previous comments, "I get" its social aspect, but are there any jokes? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes, until I get the light bulb moment, shouting "Eureka" and kill me on the head.
