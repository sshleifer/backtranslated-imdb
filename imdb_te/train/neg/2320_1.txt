<br /> <br /> Jay Chow is targeted to fans of the most talented songwriter / singer Jay Chow. He is a moderator, although he has appeared in several huge budget productions ("Early D", "Curse of the Golden Flower"). Exciting, he won the Golden Horse (Taibuan) and Hong Kong Film Awards for "Early D". <br /> <br /> Assistant actors are well-chosen, appealing mainly to everyone from China. Many well-known films / TV actors, singers, sports commentator (Huang Xiangzong from China) are also present. However, they did not give them enough time to show their talent. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is the director and the writer Chouleine. He has a reputation for producing shallow and intellectual films based on rational scripts. <br /> <br /> However, the horrific film has successfully collapsed at $ 10 million, and may be even higher in Asia. It was the biggest box office success in Asia. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: If you want to see you wasting money and talent, or you are accompanied by your kids who are Jay Chou fan.
