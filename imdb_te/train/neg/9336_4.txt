The poorly-constructed "bluxploitation" crime-drama in the black town market in the early 1970s. Palm Grair starred in the title role, a nurse who became a female vigilant after making drugs thugs coffee's younger sister jackie. Strongly nonsense pads are tight, powered and enthusiastic; Grair's luminous meditation only gives the story a jolt (she is not quite an actress here, but she meets the audience in a primal way). Not much different from what Charles Bronson was doing at this time, the film was sold and promoted as a cross-robbery, yet many city audiences were found. Today, it is only Footnote in the history of the 70s, and does not have a wide range of other movies in this genre. **** from * 1/2
