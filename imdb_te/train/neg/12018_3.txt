- Tricks out of the local mob boss out of a short time hood money. Of course mob boss wants to return his money and he does not care who can kill it to get out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Punk is a friend of his friend and adds an old gang to help him save his life. <br /> If it's ridiculous, that's it. The idea is that the Isod-dressed, Doon buggy-driving punk can hold one of the most powerful groups in Rome. His friend is good with a gun, but he is with a group of trained killers. The old Mubster is slightly more than comic relief and does not have the original help when it comes to face with the mob. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Scarface, played by Jack's Palace," I suppose he got a name because he looks like a shaving nick on his cheek. <br /> <br /> Recently I have seen some beautiful Italian crime / cap flicks, but Mr. Scarface is not one of them, rather than checking syndicate sadies or revolver Please.
