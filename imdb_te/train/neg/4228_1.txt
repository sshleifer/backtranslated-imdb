I can not believe how good this bad piece is! I want my $ 3.99 back! The words describe the words that make the words worse! Dubbed in shape or form with the mouth of the actor. It seems to have been filmed with a 1970s vintage camcorder. I've shot movies with my cell phone camera. Gore is ridiculous because of the foolish plot. The actress called you all your friends on Saturday afternoon and was completely unveiled when you tried to stop dancing in your garage. Do not get me wrong ... I did not expect O'Neill and I loved zombie movies, but the production values ​​are rare in this picture. Avoid!
