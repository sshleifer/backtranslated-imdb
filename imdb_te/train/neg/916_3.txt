Lauren Bacal and Charles Boyer did not provide the right chemistry in the 1945 film. <br /> <br /> There is a good story about Axis trying to get the coal to use in the upcoming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story does not emphasize. Instead, we deal with a supposedly bungling boyer. By the way, Bacall is British as Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> The real acting grandeur goes to the leading Oscar winner Katina Paxinou. 1943 Oscar-winning "For Home the Bell Tolls" with her memorable Pilar, Pacquin returned as a Spanish revolutionary, but this time she was a double-crossing spy spy for the Franco-Proco Group. She's a very vicious character here, most importantly, she throws her window at age 14. She believed that Boyer gave the child the most important thing to hide.
