The film is the sexiest Olympic track actor ever appointed as a coach to the high school basketball team. Similar to Goldie Han's WILDCATS, it stars Kathy Lee Crosby in the title role, and she allows the script as well. I think Rockwell Welch can be a good choice, but they can not buy her if the movie takes into account the obvious TV movie budget. Kathy Lee looks great in every shock, but she never comes to see her naked. This story is pretty imaginable, at least to say, no surprise. A young and lucky Michael Biehn is the male mainstay. He is also the actress in the team and the love of Kathy Lee. Keenen Wynn runs some athletic show and there are some amusing scenes for the great old man who does not think a woman should be a sports coach. This point has risen throughout the film, and, unnecessary, is dated. Ironically, Kathy Lee has not put his team through any kind of learning sessions; She does nothing to make a male coach. There is a funny subplot involving his class pass and a long and not-so-light player enchanted in order to play as pro basketball player Sidney Wicks. Everybody seems to have a good time making this film, but this is the only real reason for Kathy Lee Crosby. She is not a great actress, but she has an amazing smile, beautiful hair, and a lot of tan body.
