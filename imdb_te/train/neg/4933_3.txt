This film is not as bad as compared to the original two sequels. It was directed by Martin Kitsars on Friday 13th reputation. Acting is really bad, but gore and special effects are interesting. One thing that I describe about Mad George (making an artist for the film) is that his effects are off-the-wall and the hideous ones, watching a bad movie to see how bad they are. The picture is really not all that gory, but Mickey Rooney plays a guest role is a very thick faint-munching scene in the toy he's probably not too enthusiastic but maybe that's the time that money is needed, perhaps? If you like the Weirdor 4th (all my favorite 5), you probably prefer it. I liked it better than the matrix! Enjoy.
