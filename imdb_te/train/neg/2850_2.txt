If I find John Wayne in this film, I can not see it. This was unfortunate for Hollywood, and the embarrassment of any thinker to the Japanese. But most are John Wayne's movies. Hollywood in the Fifties is still believed to be the truth that every Americans in the world still love (still). The film deals with Japan's nineteenth century isolationism. It must be separated by Hollywood. To make it as accurate as possible, the film's geological scrapup is unlikely. (The sort of a madam butterfly with bad music.)
