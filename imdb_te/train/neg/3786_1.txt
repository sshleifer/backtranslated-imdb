The film did not see much and was not the right review. I stopped looking. <br /> <br /> Here's the problem: I've seen enough to introduce many characters, not interesting. Not everyone gives me anything to look forward to, with tedious, deeper mental illness, and any attractive personality. <br /> <br /> If a person is interested, if I do not feel good or good, then I understand an interesting person and I can stay with it. See "Grace State" to see my point. Gary Oldman's role in the film is full of mystery, but he's * very interesting. Al Pacino probably did a good job at Scareface, but his role did not refuse me.
