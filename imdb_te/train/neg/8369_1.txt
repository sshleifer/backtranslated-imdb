Since the film is categorized as a "pure entertainment" and since there are so many commentary on it, I want to ask something about the abuse of humor. We can see that Marlon Weiss is playing the role of Joker in the film. As long as he is involved in the casting job, he is acting as a young man - the actor may change his traditional dress but can not change his physical appearance and the next one has a purpose when needed. However, far from what I had imagined, I seemed to be quite different from a 40-year-old criminal who was trying to expose various aspects of the baby's life. And with ridiculously happy ending. So what's the point? Many of the elements are combined, some of which are violence, sexual and criminal activity, the story is badly composed and somehow, there is no general sense: where Vanessa was when she violated the peace of the home and followed her husband's life? In addition Diamond is larger than No.1 Callinan in the world! But the continuous effort to make the little man a superman by showing his physical weak points is very bad. And they are called comedy. A diamond is valuable, hard and weak; It can not be cut by any other material but a male goat captured by hot blood. So it is not the pieces of diamond but ruins.
