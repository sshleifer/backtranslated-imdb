When I was 11, Grease was like 2 crooks. It is classless, insulting, euphoric, and powerful addictive experience. I'll see my sister, rewind it and see it over and over again, when we go out or get confused and become hostile to someone else. So, if you're a 11 year old girl, when you review the film as "fantastic" or "more fun than" or "better than the original grease," you blame your winged teen hormones and you're not in this little girl. , You grease 2 is a grim, meaningless, slipshad difficult character for its production, distribution, and / or use. <br /> <br /> Why do I respect the film now, for explaining why criticisms are made for criticism? <br /> <br /> In well-implemented music, the songs should be brought forward or developing characters. In Grease 2, with some debating exceptions, music is obscure. Most songs are the biggest and simple way about sex ("score tonight," "reproduction," "do for our country", and "provinely" the characters or themes of the film. Plus, all music is uncomfortable stupid and no one can sing or dance <br /> <br /> 2. T-birds must be badass, and at least prefer to like a little, but instead of each Finally, Johnny Nogerelli gives Michael the sacred T-bird jacket and enters him into the gang, Michael should leave the ground and spit on it, and to seep any part of his body, but, in fact, if he is gold Confess, because they are a group of fried meat heads, with T-birds <br /> <br /> Because Michael is pretty, intelligent, kind, efficient and average on average (in his musical impotence), it is possible to eventually embrace Staffhani as a masked person. Stephanie, on the other hand, is a slovenly, slack-jawed, bubble smacking smashing, dirty sweatshirt, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat. <br /> <br /> I'm not pretty much (I guess), it does not have any of her favorite features, so there is no justification for the audience for the depth of Michael's appeal. <br /> I've gone, I do not mention gross degradation to its ancestor, because there are too many cranks that seem to feel like that comparison is unfair. For those of you who say I want to visit this mess for a long time, I would like to say: Grease 2 is your first kiss again. You are now 32 years old and kiss a leopard-eyed 13-year-old kid with acne and slabby braces. The magic has gone and you leave feeling dirty and disturbed. Trust me
