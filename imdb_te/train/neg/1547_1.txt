I named the most funny movies. There are comedians, and funny. For example, some films like Zimcaatt are trying to be serious but end up with funny. Women's ghost is a film that is desperately funny, but if it has a lot of chicks in the ruins of a nuclear devastation, it's not less funny. <br /> <br /> I do not think that I am doing a little bit of anything in this film. It's just not right. It is boring, stupid, inane, annoying, mind-bogglingly evil, but not funny. <br /> <br /> The film did not show special attention to this character from Tim Meadows or SNL. <br /> <br /> There is no logic or general sense in this film. When he was typing the script writer had a bag on his head and could not see the keys he hit. They say to Ladies Man's "origin", but still does not inspire her immense appeal to acting like the seventies. Shortly after he tried to hang himself, he tried to get rid of humor from the person he liked. Is it funny? <br /> <br /> I have a pretty big feeling of humor (I'm spending a lot of comedy at the time), but maybe it's not bright enough for this film. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, where Tucker in There a Something About Mary, is worse here. <br /> <br /> In the end, I am in my chair shaking in my breath, what's going on in the movie, and maybe I have attempted suicide. The film may not be as bad as the Battlefield Earth, but it was the first film I saw as close to it. <br />
