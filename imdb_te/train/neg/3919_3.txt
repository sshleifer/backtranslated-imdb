This film is not as good as it was all thinking. Actors are low and the story is very ridiculous. I respect Fantasy but the Lord of the Rings Fantasy ... Conan ... Fantasy ... This is just a simple HK-LOWPRICE-entertainment ... why they have this award-tongue, which makes all the worse. The only good thing is cinematography and job of the cutter.
