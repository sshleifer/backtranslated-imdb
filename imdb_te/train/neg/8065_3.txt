Steve Carpenter can not make horror films. First casting for this movie is very wrong. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the only good part of the hot brown haired girl. The film is Gore (a key element for horror movie), no action, no acting and suspense (also a key factor). Wes Bentley is a good actor but this way he is sad and plain. Funny (teen horror / comedy films are continuous) and some parts of the audience have not been laughed. I thought this film was rated R, and I did not pay attention and realized that it was changed to PG-13. However, the film featured last summer what I did was what I was made it still looks only to those who remotely scared the movie. And seriously, this is you Steve Carpenter, stop making horror movies. The film looks like a screenshot of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
