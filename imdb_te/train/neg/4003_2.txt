A major disappointment. It was one of the best UK crime drama / detective shows from the 90s that developed the lovely title role played by Scotland's Robbie Coltran. However, this one-lane is very small and maybe unexpected expectations when a favored display returns after a return. Coltrane did not really give much to do, more attention spent on uninteresting killer, and in what he worked, he seems unbelievable, almost bored. Wrote the story of the former soldier's story and Coltrane's family life seems lightweight to attempt to update us. Perhaps the writers were in the front row rather than during the two-hour event, and they wrote much more depth. As such, skip this and watch the older cracker from the 90's too old.
