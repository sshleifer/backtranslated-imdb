I'm a sucker for a good romance, but this does not qualify either good or a romance. Before the credits I wrecked the plot. With such poor dialogue, plot and character development, I'll invest your hour and a half. I could not get this bad taste from my mouth because I was rushing out and renting the serendipity for the third time.
