I guess I would have to give some points for the courage to write music around a history lesson, but what about some good music? <br /> <br /> Does cartooning of Howard Desailva intentionally intentionally portray the children who are frustrated? <br /> <br /> Will William Daniels Camping appeal to the contemporary (for the time) acting style of the 1960s / 70s? <br /> Do all the "jokes" about NY & NJ? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I'm finding it very hard on the screen for the whole piece, boring & acting.
