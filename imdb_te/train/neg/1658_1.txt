It's the most boring movie in history. I'm really looking forward to seeing this film by actor / director Roman Polans. I think I will see three Amigos rather than watching this film again. It immediately went directly from the DVD player into the trash. You probably liked New Coke if my apology for you obviously liked this movie. I'm losing to see who's enjoying this movie, it's slow, dull and there is no original plot. Wait 105 minutes for the movie. I understand this happened in 1976, but this is a bad television period. God thanks to the disco and three companies along with stop sign glasses and Bay City rollers. Oh well my thoughts.
