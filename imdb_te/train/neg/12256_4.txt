Oh God, when I was 11 or 12, I saw this thing, I was young, but I was not a fool. It can be seen as bad movie, nasty, gross, merciless and anyone who is very crazy. I saw the most impressive effects in Disneyland, I saw good performances at school, I saw more exciting crocodiles in the zoo, where they could not do anything, but sitting in the water and pressing on the glass ignored the kids <br /> This story is in Northern Australia. As a matter of prestigious young people, trying a new water game, surfing in shark-filled water. This is more dangerous in water. <br /> When they learn what they want, they get the help of a grizely middle-aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to take revenge on his family's eating. <br /> <br /> Every crocodile film I made was fifteen years old, the best lake in the lake, and the worst sequel. <br /> <br /> Australian saltwater cordodil is one of the most dangerous creatures, resulting in more than one hundred people, the blood surf is the second worst crock flick I feel. Wounds or deaths each year. Films such as Blood Surf are not only a horrific film of such a creature, but only a good hour and half in the life of the viewer. If you really want to see it, avoid blood surf.
