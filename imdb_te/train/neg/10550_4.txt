After a big fan of 'Ten Stella' T.V episodes of 'Stella Street', I look forward to the movie's enthusiasm and expectation. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Almost all the costumes and a linear lifted directly from the TV episodes, if the actors once told them once with less enthusiasm and humor, can not repeat them. I purchased my copy on the DVD and I cheated on my hard earned cash to see the same jokes again. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler starts with * Stella Street. Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson, and The Rolling Stones, and the last unemployed sectors living on the screen and slowly living by some famous people. All the celebrities on the street are out of their luck through the local cheat and are forced to live up to the tramp and the common working class people. There are some nice moments, but overall, the authors take an interesting idea and manage to make it pretty boring. <br /> <br /> In the T.V episodes, all the sessions are made by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including the girls), but Rony was cast in AntoCo. I think this is wrong. <br /> <br /> Although she is not a fan of Stella Street episodes, it is entertaining that you like her. But if you're a fan, I think I've been a little cheated. 4/10
