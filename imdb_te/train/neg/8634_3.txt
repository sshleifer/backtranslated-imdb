Seeing a photo of a man attacking zombies gave me hope that Lucio "Zombi" might be up to his old tricks in full. Unfortunately, there is little to recommend in this story in his daughter's quest to identify the killer of a wealthy man and kill him, rather than the close ups of a decomposed corpse. None of the characters are attractive and you do not know how they did it (that twist is, at least, cooler), you can stop the care. The only good thing I can say is more sense than Nightmare Concert!
