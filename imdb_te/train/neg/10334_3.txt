A story of "fantastic psychological disorder" kills "upward mentally". Characters and stories are absolutely interesting (Falsky's mad camera work, which is usually a redeemer in his drawings), and any sense of suspense is not found anywhere. It exceeds an unsustainable degree - in the end, you will not be bothered by enthusiasm but suffering from boredom (and like me, perhaps an uncontrolled desire to sleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance is desirable to star in the film. Fulzi Gorhounds Beware - not just "The Sacrifice." <br /> 3/10
