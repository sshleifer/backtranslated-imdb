Without a doubt in the worst movies I have seen in recent years. This story helps us four women, and they want to somehow suspect. It is difficult to have sympathy with the characters that make such stupid decisions. Oh no, cops are on the side, they know who they are, what do we do? ... Let's steal a bed then we're outta here! What!?! Each character is a stereotype and it's easy to tell who ends up dead.
