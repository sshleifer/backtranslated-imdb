This is the first time I write a comment on an image on the IMDB. But I had to write it. Its 3 hours unreasonable violence. Get the idea that the picture from start u should be wrong. Acting is tragic. I was a big fan of Ajay Devgan (who loved him in Bhagat Singh) but he was his worst in the film. Amitabh seems to have worked hard in this regard, but somehow there is no fear. Prasanthi Raj Naan actor. And the film is a very irritating part of the nisha cuttery. I do not have a clue why the director has taken this film. Background score is recurring. I thought that somehow Ramu tried to repeat a sarkar, color theme, background score, camera angles, but it did not work. Please do not look
