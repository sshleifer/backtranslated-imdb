I will warn you here: I chose to appreciate this concept, which is not a psychological drama rather than a general feeling, based on which you should greet it and you'll be late. <br /> I'm here to tell you that I'm wrong. Absolutely wrong. <br /> Completely, not completely; If you are looking for an action movie too frustrating, they are right about that. <br /> <br /> Tom Bearinger is not too bad, suppose I'm worse than usual. But what of these to act like Billy Jane? Do some kind of producers want to die? Is there a way to make their film a flawless flop? <br /> If they are really targeting success then who can not act? Oh, and go for a storyteller who knows how to write. <br /> <br /> The guy who's sitting in the chaos will soon redeem himself, never giving you the assurance. Pitti, it was a good movie.
