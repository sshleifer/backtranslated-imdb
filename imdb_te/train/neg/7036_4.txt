I will not destroy anything when I tell you to see a woman having sex with a goat in this film. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband are going to see her broken sister in a family building in the woods. Her sister is a creepy lady to say the least, and has the benefits that her family crosses in love. A group of involuntary characters will appear and begin all kinds of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty weak and the characters are pretty dumb. Sexual relations with him continue to be a woman when her husband becomes a slave and starts meeting with the pagans. On the side of exploiting things, there is a couple of bared meat and kinky couplings, but nothing else is not good at all. Oh, the above-mentioned goat-sex scenery <br /> <br /> Many viewers can not do that in the end. <br /> <br /> Robbery fans ride on it, but maybe even more. <br /> <br />
