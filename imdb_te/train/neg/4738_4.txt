I love the original Azumi, not the live action manga, the constructive storyline, the cool soundtrack, direction (Kimmoor Rocks!), The beautiful Andy Yuto who filled the album and the whole episode. I'm really looking forward to watching Azumi 2, but after watching it, I seemed to have won Lotto and lost the ticket: Ajumy's 2 story, but they are totally 2 different films. I agree with some reviewers who say that this is a losing chance (if possible)! If the Ruhi Kittimura only continues with this installment, it is very slow, the action is excellent and does not direct the dance and the character development does not have much to do with the same person responsible for reducing the value of Tao monster franchise See slow action There are some beautiful Japanese forest scenes, bit characters are quickly killed. Very bad people can be killed very easily without much fighting. The memorable fight scenes in the forest forests of the Spider Guy (directly in the Monkey's episode!). Azimil Verges 1 We have a confrontational scene with barrel camera effects, Azmi 2 brings us Azimi Cape Com !! Ultimately Azuji's devastation is unbelievable, but he is still doing the job well. She looks great on the cape ... but where did she come from? I do not think it will be watching this one over and over again! ... no pity.
