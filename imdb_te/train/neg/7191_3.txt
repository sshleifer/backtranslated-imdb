It last night night at the Festival des Films do Monde's midnight slam in Montreal. No disappointment. This image is rated by IMDb fans. Acting is simple but simple. Directing does not bring anything new or interesting. This plot is not significant: the college is about graduates and everything about the game they make with sharp calls (7eventy 5ive). And on top of that, you can predict the end of the image in the first five minutes. If you want axes with pranks and a ax, you may want to jump once or twice in the whole movie. If you do not, this image is not worth it.
