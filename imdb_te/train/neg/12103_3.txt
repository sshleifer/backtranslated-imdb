Some funny bits, but the bill has come! A movie? Zeitgeist quoting? Keep TV Show and Interviews, but a movie? I'm probably overreacting but no unnecessary petting film ... I do not know. <br /> <br /> Bill Hicks is a clever comedian who is very confused and irritated by Bill's rhetoric. . But as many comedians, the border between comedy and teaching will be annoying. I think the main problem in this movie is his absence of sensibility. It may be just personal taste, but the comedy that constantly demands someone is not true. The bill for religious fundamentalism clearly emotionally reacts. I agree with Bill that religious superstition is not intelligent, but the response is not correct. It creates unnecessary crisis. We can do better than respond to fundamentalism. His ending is "we do not know" and he tries to convince the viewer that no one knows, and the agnostic society is concerned about his intensity in being a moderate priest. <br /> He is a contradiction to his humiliation when he attempts to emphasize that all religious ideas are anonymous. <br /> <br /> I saw the bits of the jeepgastist, the film. The unbalanced influence that affects all religions simplifies all religions, which is simply frustrating. The geologist provoked many controversies and confused the value of valuable religion studies scholarship. It is very sad to see how false facts have come from loyalty sources. The "stars all say" that reduces all semantic and spiritual sources from the Middle Ages. This film is a tumultuous statement from the confusing "agnostic". <br /> The postmodernism is clear evidence of how to simplify and normalize major issues on humanity. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie (It has nice interviews and bits) but behave like Bill. You can not expect someone to have a mature conversation if you're making every other comment apologetic. His argument techniques are reasonable and insulting, emotional response to rational and logical reasoning. It should be a more mature way of dealing with these issues.
