When I say darn is a bad movie in Alone it should not come to you. To make it vague, a scorching monster has been removed, eaten, and vomited. <br /> Depending on the oldest (!) Atari video game, the movie's intestines are ancient civilizations, although the earth's intestines have nothing to do with a portal. There is something about the two worlds of darkness and light. Oh, and 10,000 years ago launched a truly super-duper modern civilization portal, the demons come and have a blast, then the civilization is wiped out. <br /> <br /> The Christian Slater is a paranormal researcher called ephed corbeni for pumping Hays days and volume. When he was 10 years old. He was hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of modern civilization. Carnobie 713 is part of a secret organization that tried to figure out what happened to a civilization for a long time. <br /> <br /> But he left this group, but he left this group. <br /> <br /> But, look at these beasts, drive them, separate them in the middle, set nerve control devices, or kill them zombies. Yes, this is another zombie movie. <br /> It is distilled, I can plot. It's very twisted and inconceivable. In such films, at once, a vague researcher / adventurer can see figures of the figure, and it is very fun when the audience is mentally emotional. <br /> Acting is not terrible. <br /> <br /> The performance is terrible and is saved for slater, although he (the film he almost gets embarrassed) shows his ability to load the load. He came; Get this - Tara Reed as a museum curator! Honestly honestly, I saw a lifetime cast when Denis Richards starred as a nuclear physicist on Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid fits here with Richards, crappy emoting for crappy emoting. Reed - Reed as "Newfoundland", "Newfoundland", Reed in a mess, in a short quadrilateral (Reed - a week before night all night bender) Muse Curator, Mind-Bering Top and Hip-Hugger Jeans A lot of movies are spent. Oh yes, she is believable as Jessica Simpson is giving stock quotes. Oh, why should be pretty bad guys? (Note: I do not think Tara Reed is not good for everyone.) It is not entirely unforgettable for everyone in the cast, perhaps Steven Dorf, Burke Dorf's character is not drastically well developed, but there is nothing in the film, from sets to characters to Tara Reed. <br /> <br /> However, the unhappy and utterly insulting storyline is difficult to move in with such a film in a breakneck pace, but the director Uwe Boll strokes a beaten, mind-dead soundtrack; It's so loud that the actors are saying some of the scenes! That's not right. However, thanks to Mr. Boll on the level of acting. <br /> Oh and a fun note. The early motion of the film is in the storyline ... the words crawling on the screen at the same time. Remember the first Star Wars? You heard a familiar known-known Star Wars theme. Story is not required; Why do I need some dufus to read what's on the screen? Are the producers looking for blind people? Soundtrack explains why it's too loud - they are also looking for people who are listening hard. Also, the narrator had a lipstick for the first few lines of the inexplicable crawl - then lost it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Alone in Dark, terrible acting, abusive script, and a loud, doping mishmash of ham-hand directed. The original one note is true of the rings. There is a lot of confusion in the audience to care about the roles and roots of their death. Even in the dark, demonic creatures appear cooler and more developed. <br /> <br /> Ironically, there are only three other people in the theater, I saw Alone in Darn. Would I be surprised if Uwe Boll planned that way? I had little hope for it because it was not the lowest rating - because I did not get enough of it to work on it. Although Slaughter itself radiates a small bit, it is worse.
