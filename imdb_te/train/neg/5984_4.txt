One of the "few Americans" that I grew up with all of Gerry Anderson's fairy creations. <br /> <br /> Thunderbirds were able to make a great series of time and a great action / adventure movie, whereas the authors were able to identify where it was targeted. <br /> I thought I was a fiery, not to target such a younger one. Like Space Lost, it may be visually amazing and exciting. This is the goal of more action / adventure and the original series ... It is necessary to save people in trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead, Alan saved the day instead of his brothers, the original original was). Breakout episode Lady Penelope and Parker. I did not pay much attention to the original characters, but I'm grateful to them in this film. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed much more Thunderbirds than stories and have not had enough screen time as long as I am concerned. <br /> But, I'm a big kid ...;)
