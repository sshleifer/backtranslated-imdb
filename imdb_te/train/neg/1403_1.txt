A completely damaged waste of the film !! Nothing ever happened. No ghosts, rarely any train, no mystery, no interest. Stable and brutal efforts in comedy are painful. Everything else is curious. The courtyard is idiot: no one is a group of people alone in the middle of the space, because their train is carried in less than 3 minutes. What? And there is no place for the railroads to stay in a huge storm? I'm not. Oh, they walked 4 miles on dead black grounds. Oh, yes. Sure. Or, they can force the railroad's hospitality, and stay in the 'haunted train station'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br
