Well I watched this last night and one thing that did not make it totally terrible was that it was ahead. This kid has no beating around the bush that is anti-Christ. However, the film was poorly written. For example, why did they make the dentist's incident a "risk", or why the cop ended up unclear at home to protect the children from being called by the police yet? Death scenes are really bad and are not fun at all. Kid bored they chose to play anti-Christ and they could have really chose a good kid. Do not waste your time watching this.
