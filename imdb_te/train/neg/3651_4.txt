I look forward to a very funny picture. Instead, I got a picture with some funny jokes, and many do not work. I do not like the idea of ​​taking the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. It's confusing. It was a lot more fun if they were newer than the Moriite survived. Some things are funny. Burt Quouk was very fun, as always. McClatch is funny on the horse. Mac Garrett is not like McGarrett-5-0 from Hawaii. Connie Booth is obviously a lot of accents. She came from Indiana, but played well with English and New Yorkers. Unfortunately, she did not submit much into the script. I look forward to a more funny picture. Instead, I got a shocking film with poor script. But it is contradictory, because both Booth and Klee are together. Perhaps they are going to break up in 77.
