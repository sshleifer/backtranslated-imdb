I saw "Beach on the Beach" as the director and could not understand better reviews. This film is very much, very few dynamic and two people who are trapped in a relationship with someone. Like his other films, you are a bit less likely to listen to the sentence dialogue and the underwriters, who are enchanted with the most amusing characters. If you think you like this movie, I can not stop my review. I'm like minimalism in cinemas, but I think the movies of Sai Ming-Liang are very high. He is the most outstanding actor in Lee Kang-sheng in his films. Nothing here. I liked the IU, but I did not. Oh! Good.
