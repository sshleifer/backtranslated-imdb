I can not recognize the film-making skills above hack. For example, I appreciate his hanging on the unremarkable-natural-day-light settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. However, I am very sad to see the content of this film, a desire to diagnose dominance-offering relationships or feelings (and / or BDSM techniques) in the 21st century. Walter (I do not mean the depression of a lover which does not love the same way and the main character is unbelievable topical issue as she has alienation and incompetence; he will be on her, as if she was crazy, or looks like her, as if he was a nun! ). I'm not new to D / s in the world and I feel rather crazy than treating something like "freak" or pathogen; That's not. <br /> <br /> The recent film scholarship shows that the film has long been outdated psicoanalitical theories (isn 's almost embarrassing?), and this is in real life lives and D / s relationships (personal experience, forums, and IRC chat rooms) ) Does not relate to the participants' experiences.
