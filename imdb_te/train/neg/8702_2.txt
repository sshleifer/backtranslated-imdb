This is one of the most terrific films I have ever seen! After I saw the first two, it should have been anticipated, but I keep suckered into these kinds of films with the thought of "probably they did this time". <br /> Where did I start? How to give a thought to what goes for SFX in this film ... With special effects, one soldier at a time runs down a hallway and is shooting at a "raptor". With less than a second of the screen time, the viewer can easily see that a man can only run with a tail around him. <br /> How about acting? If you know what you can call it. Suppose we should be from the south. However, after living in the South for six years, I have never heard of this. Perhaps he was sort of strange disability - the inability to talk normally. <br /> <br /> I realized that the hero does not deserve anything - so the actor does not have any reason to try. <br /> How about the plot? It's pretty basic - the Rapters Escape, the people with guns should hunt them. Why am I wondering why the dinosaurs in these movies are running in a nearby tunnel system ... they are not out to hunt? <br /> <br /> Other things - You know that you are in a building and you know that man is eating. Raptors are running around it. Army or Marine Who has an argument about who's good is you decide to take the time? And is it the wrestling decided to compete in the arm to get it over? How about the idiot idea they have to track down the rappers - divide into two groups. Do they ever see any horror movies (or Scooby Doo's episode)? In short, this is one of the dumbbell movies out there. Miss it unless you want to moan your way through an image.
