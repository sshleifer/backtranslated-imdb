A talented director, Desplin, a impartially talented actress, was unable to get a good show from Phoenix, and there was no substance to tell Esther Khan a very delicate and clear story. In an attempt to fulfill the centered circle of the actor's plight, performance and performance are much more motivated and much less implemented to compose any compassion from the viewer. In overly long periods, Esther's fighting has been very dramatic in recurring effectiveness and has reduced the storyline into a weaker frame in a disastrous performance. The content is incomplete and inappropriate, as Esther struggles to follow Phoenix Desplin's orders to try to do the same. We do not feel a successful success with Esther's pain, we can never win Phoenix's talent.
