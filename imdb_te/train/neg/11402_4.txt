Exactly what you would expect from a B-movie. Potential, inappropriate nudity, boring in parts, ridiculous gore and cheesy special effects. However, it is good, well-acted (presumably) best written and directed. But I guess I'm not a B film. The actors are pretty much absorbed, in fact it seems to be the episode of the vampire slayer or episode, along with a lot of blood, defilement and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Sheeps must be alone. She is the surname of the new millennium. Acting is not really a priority, but she is better than other actors. She's also smokin hot in the suit of plastic jump that she wore for the whole movie - Wow! She is absolutely amazing in those costumes that are posterior, so I can help you check her every time she turns around but she can check. <br /> If you're a loose B-movie Horror F (Like), check it out. Otherwise, you should probably escape at all costs.
