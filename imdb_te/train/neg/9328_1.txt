I'm very lucky! I got a sneak peak at the Texas 'Horror' film in this tragic little shot from an Artisan Entertainment before I let video hit the shelves and tell me ... I looked hard and I laughed so hard in my life that this deadly megabomb rails were off and insufferably stupid Full Moon Failure KILLJOY (I'm sure we have suffered by one of the horror fans of R DD!) From 'all the worst killer clown image' from all the references, it is filmed in DV, and it's not really 'bad for all digital', but the boy will never fail miserably in other areas! <br /> <br /> The story (just a bit) and concert goes as follows ... An executive (co-writer and co-producer with Ken Herbert, co-producer), suspicious co-worker Tracy (Amanda Watson) and Horny Brown The couple Mark and Susan (Hankfields and Chris Buck) traveled to a nearby weekend with a 12-kilometer tunnel with a cabin . On the way there, they pick up a bitch / slutty hitchhiker (Melissa Bale) in a bar and end up at their destination where the nightly winter story about a murderous clown stalking the same forest area is true-everybody, the pat-smokin friends' <br /> <br /> The killer clown is also missing in the film There is nothing like the ghost depiction of the video box (from the obesity to the dam). It is basically waving around in woods, timber separation and hitting nursery rhymes. I can not say a lot of bad things about the cast, especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chicks, who can give their inappropriate conversations with their minimal enthusiasm or overtake them in the most inappropriate times. Truly the script is completely and totally does not mean full suspense, realism, intelligence, general intimacy or humor. <br /> <br /> The film was released as a SICK in the US (serial insan clown killer), but the whole package is still in trouble, . It is currently listed under its (actual title) of GRIM WEEKEND. <br /> Score: 10 out of 1
