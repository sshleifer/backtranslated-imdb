Although I'm not a fan of the biggest Blair witch, I have appreciated that effort, so after I read superbitives thrown in IMDb comments, I look forward to looking forward to it. <br /> <br /> Let's see where people come to describe such a poor effort ... especially the "exclusive", "brilliant", "future cult classic" is a poor, weak image and fail to take part in every respect. Stupidity is not funny. The horrors and gore are not scary. <br /> <br /> Some of the poor people in the movie are "panicking", as if seen in the film, causing panic. Because there is no deeper or intelligent about this mess. <br /> <br /> Well, we can not find anything. Is it at least bearable? Is there any better experience? Not unfortunately. For starters, get very little acting. It is not a stretch to say much B-movies this time better performance. The plot? Boring and worse. Dialogs? Many enthusiasts are actually better. <br /> <br /> There is really way to puzzles. I did not expect big improvements on Blair Witch, but at least came up with small steps. <br /> <br /> Instead, our director may seem more aggressive over time, never forget previous experiences. <br /> If there is a major flaw in the conversion, this is the main set. A major part of this area takes place in one place, where the main characters are limited, but Santé fails to give the area any personality. In Blair Witch, the jungle plays a major role and you feel that the character is the same thing as a character (one enemy, if you want), as the three students. But ... there is no habit in this place, no details are given. <br /> <br /> There is nothing safer here. "Blair Witch" hard fans follow Diane Myrrk. Although his production is far from gold, it shows a better structure than Sánchez and some lessons (unfortunately, still in weak stories) from Blair Witch.
