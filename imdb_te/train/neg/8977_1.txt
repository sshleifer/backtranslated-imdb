A female nicknamed "Big T" is a country singer - seriously, they are known to her - her junior musical career and her life by falling into the graveyard drunken boutique who wants to be his manager. His mother committed suicide, his father was also a drinker and he was violent. You can imagine that. At this time, as with Popton, she is a melodious vocal talent and a song Belt (at least half a dozen of Texas). Clear this confusion and check her in the NINE for FINE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead.
