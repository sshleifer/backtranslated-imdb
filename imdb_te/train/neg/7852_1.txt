I'm no horror movie buff, but my wife is gay and nephews. So, I saw the first film. It's gruesome, confusing, but not my taste. Even better yet. For this reason, in this moment, I'm facing the sequel. <br /> <br /> That speech is not even inaccurate. Those disasters can occur in the desert. I can buy those mutants. I can also buy it could be so weird and strange that the events may decide to take part in. <br /> <br /> I believe that a military team that can reclaim such a territory in any way can not escape. Mutants. As a member of the United States Army, I can assure you that newly appointed recruits may not be experienced by experienced eyes and veterans, such appointments join in a capable group. <br /> <br /> The armed forces will not take some mutants with soldiers knives. It works. Squad movements, more superior ammunition, and of course, radio support will make it less than overall success. I'm not saying that you are not dead, but as soon as the area is proven to be negative, military training is given priority, no one has used the bathroom and left their own. And if it finds that the area is the fastest in the area that the area is not in danger, they will join the radio for backup. General radios can not do if their radios do not hurt, and the squad has a military problem satellite phone. <br /> <br /> To accept this film, our soldiers are ineffective fools, with inefficient leaders, and incompetent chain of command. Although the world's most dangerous thing is the map and the computational lieutenant, our armed forces are filled with intelligent, well trained and competent soldiers. <br /> <br /> The film failed to release the film depending on the imagination impossible. <br /> <br /> We believe that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen deal with a lot of common threats. <br /> <br /> As a fighting veteran I see the film as insulting.
