Because you do not think this movie is a waste of time and money. The remake of "Heaven Ken Wait" (which is worth watching at least) is not a poor need for a romantic comedy. This is a vehicle to give some time to rock in the movie for a weak stadium in the big screen. Especially his jokes are usually believed to be from an old, fat, rich, dead man's body but the rack is coming from him. Chemistry is all wrong when he insults blacks and whites. This film is not funny, acting is exactly weak. Go to the hire "Heaven Can Weight" and Live Rock Video and you'll be ahead of the game's way.
