When you choose the movie, are there any actors in the film using their reputation to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative manner? It is not a political statement that these events are a moral issue called influential society. We should ask ourselves when a comedian / actor makes a sexual and racist comment about a young man and her father (I want to support that behavior)? In this case Mr. Fox's behavior teaches us misunderstood tears, loving kindness from good and bad, hateful and hateful to our youth. Mr. Fox needs to remember only that he is entertaining and there is so much more to choose from. He does not take him from the hook to forgive him. It spreads to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to disable the fan of it. They can no longer see any parts. We can not change them, but we can stop the fame that we gave them.
