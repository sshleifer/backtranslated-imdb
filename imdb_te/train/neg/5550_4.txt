Have you seen that you are looking for the right performance for eight years? I understand the initial excitement of looking at the coexistence of strangers on an island, but if you do not see, sunflower leaders run harsh movements through the bush with an egg in a spoon for half a decade. <br /> I'm not talking about the performances that seem to be questionable for the record. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to stop the disbelief for "antitrust bill" for eating the mouse while the whole crew of producers and camera personnel are in a breathtaking mucino's breathing with a air conditioned shift bio-dome mosaic. <br /> Appeal here? I do not care about these people or their moderate lives. I can not get it. But I realized that you would be attracted to your hair and anonymous people, stop calling your TV and go to your local bus station where you can see people in their real dwelling. They are called homeowners, free of charge, and you are surprised at their incredible ability to reclaim many cigarette ruins from cigarette canaries, eventually hitting the "pay-dirt" and at home by Dr Frankenstein-style cancer stick, "Alfa Welva" All people yach to change the food If it is not in their breath, it is enough to indicate. And the best part? Such as Survivor, is a member of the "island", a "island" in each week, when they are recklessly packing to the local company when they kick into the gear in the scary state of Schizophrenia! Now entertainment!
