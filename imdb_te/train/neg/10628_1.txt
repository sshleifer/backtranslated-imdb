The so-called "documentary" USA tries to say that land-landing is fake. <br /> <br /> In fact, everyone who studied the case knows. <br /> First: There is absolutely no proof. When the astronauts on the moon, they have taken many pounds of rock from the moon - for geological studies. Hundreds of labs all over the world. They are different from what they see on Earth, but they are the same as those calculated on the Moon, so they come from a planet rather than on Earth. I.E. Conspiracy theorists can not do any study: they describe what is right with their theory and ignore the rest. <br /> There is another false allegation from them. IE flag moves. There is a logical description: the astronaut moved it in his hand, so it moved. And it proves what it is: Conspiracy theorists are also studying footage, they see that the flag never moves after the astronaut allows it, I.E. The conspiracy theorists are bad-sciences, they can not correctly study one thing or study it until they do what they can to do with lying, and make profits (this "documentary" IE is called a law. Because all the shadows come from different places, because different canada But the conspiracy theorists are false (common), which is not night-light in the desert, with light-resource. <br /> <br /> I am no conspirator theorists any longer than the Star Trek-Convention The suspect that their grandmother was outside the basement. <br /> The conspiracy theorists are in denial and big time. Only those who see it will see, so all these lies appear to be important - that's true.
