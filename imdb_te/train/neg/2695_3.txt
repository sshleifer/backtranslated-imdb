When I go to the video story to go to an image I usually believe IMDb's scenes in a film and so far, I gave a rating of 7.0 or above which I never enjoyed. <br /> <br /> The great director of the best films of the 20th century, Sidney Limet, was one of the biggest mistakes that could be the filmmaking: a film's cast without any real redemption features. <br /> <br /> I love movies with flawed characters, but somebody is with the personality of a dark person, where everything is a bit of light, we're gray with some darker or bright colors. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawks Hank is a 30-something, divorced, irresponsible child divorced from this marriage. He is a wife who hates him and a daughter who thinks he is a loser, he is very much. His innocence and willingness to communicate to others that he is too shy of him makes him vicious because he leads directly to his bank robbery plan and the mother is killing. By the time he stands at the end of his older brother, it is more enthusiastic than uplifting. Ethan Hawk plays his role well, but when he is portrayed as a constantly stamped person on his face he does not give much more to work, and he does not care to be there specifically. His character speaks equally as bad as his wife. Every shot in the previous film was her self-esteem and insulting herself, as she spoke to her for rent and child support. Seriously, just makes all the character. <br /> <br /> Albert Finny plays the role of their father Charles, and Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades, and he spends the same mouth about 90% of the film, opening half the grimace on his face as he is suffering from constipation's world's worst bacteria . For someone who is Mr. Finney's long-time actor, you think he should be more apt at emoting. Although he did not show much, his character was filled with evil and anger. <br /> <br /> When Andy dies for the production of this film, Dr. Frankenstein has a monster. He helped to get out of his own troubles. <br /> <br /> Marios Tommy did not give much to his character. Andy was happy with a happy marriage and his brother for some vague reasons. When Andy's world is swamped out of control, she logically flips the ship, but it is really selfish or self serving less than any other nature, but maybe at least one of the most common sense. <br /> <br /> Finally, we always come to Andy, who played good Philip Seymour Hoffmann, the only reason I rated this movie in 3 instead of 3. His performance of heroin-slave, who finishes financial execution comes into the "perfect offense" impersonation of his parents' insurance jewelry store. Reliable and tragic for his descendant from the calm master planner of a flawed scheme for unstable, unsatisfactory homicide manpower. Hoffman's role is the main villain of the film, but it is difficult to root out against him alternatives, an emotionally small brother and his father's self-admired poorly-born child, his son's mental and dramatic, eventually leading to his mother's murder <br /> Finally, this film is a great performance of PSH The value is really valuable and the family is the ruined nature of the train. Just do not really expect there any roles worth cheering, because it's not really.
