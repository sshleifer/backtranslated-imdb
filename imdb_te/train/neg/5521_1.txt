I came from watching this movie and others think about it. I'm surprised if these people who give lovely reviews look at the same picture! This is a very good story, which failed to hit the mark. The script is very weak - this plot has many holes, which makes a great dip for fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed and the storyline moved a lot, I said, "How come I'm here?" <br /> <br /> There is a lack of any chemistry between cast members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's criticism during filming. <br /> <br /> It can take a nice warm bath, play a board game, go for a walk and save your money for something that is worth it!
