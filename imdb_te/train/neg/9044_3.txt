I really wanted to like this movie, but most of it was stolen from other work / borrowed - some borrowing is painful. The New York Times's review of their frog is reminiscent of one of the famous Warner Bros. Cartoon ('My baby hello, hello my darlin', hello my ragtime gas ... '). But I'm challenging anyone to see the fox / blue ski animated feature Robots (2005) and find ridiculous similarities: the storyline - a young inventor is developing and a new innovative company delivers all the great discoveries. <br /> City scenery - Similar camera angles capture many similar future city environments. <br /> ... Robots ... - Robinson's Robot Homework is very similar to robots, a sort of retro-futuristic look. <br /> <br /> All of this finally appears to be contrary to Disney's bad coat. <br /> <br /> In the 90s, their entire catalog of stories, heroes, <br /> <br /> Filmmakers send their own story, and instead of constantly moving objects and sounds in our direction, <br /> <br /> The villain is really well designed and brilliantly animated, and he is a pleasure to watch. The rest of the film seems to be thrown out. Some landscapes appear as CGIs from the mid 90s. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the original Classic Mickey Mouse shorts. By the end of this cartoon, we remembered that Disney could not be very interested in newcomer or better storytelling - the greater the screen's proof of their virtue.
