I am seriously sorry, I know that Fosbinder is still one of the greatest directors in postwar Germany, and I know his paintings are considered "master-pieces", but when I saw "Lili Marlene" in 2004, let me see how much everyone is in the 2004 film! Acting is just terrible - all smiles like an idiot like Hannah Skigula! - The changes between the Nazi glamor and the battlefields are ridiculous, the whole picture appears to be in an attic within two days. Perhaps this is exactly the same and many people take this for "real art", but for me this movie is just bad & cheap. Compare it to Viscintis "La Dude Digli Dee" and reiterate that "Lily Marlin" is a good movie ...
