I'm afraid when a hammer completes my courage to see the film and protect Hollywood after the holidays in the bus. I saw a bus film and thought it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen. <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the 70s, all the horror comic strips of British TV screens were filled. <br /> <br /> In fact, I saw some parts of the film ashamed. I have now been familiar with the characters and have experienced some of the circumstances because I do not know how they react. <br /> <br /> The jokes start with the holidays on the buses, but the band is "thinner and the three films are best compared to an early Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, but the second is best done (although they are probably the only one that is comparable). People who would like to watch this movie are probably TV series fans, no doubt this is enjoyable, and Hummer is just like me. Nto this movie is not bad and I think everybody Hammer comedy.
