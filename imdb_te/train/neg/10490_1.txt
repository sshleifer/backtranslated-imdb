I realized that the previous reviewer (which seems to be still in school) was a good review and I can assume that the reviewer did not see the high-profile 1989 BBC adaptation of this classic novel. The main problem I encountered with this (1999) version was Tom Long as the actors of Anthony Way. Three times the talented boy who received praise after his appearance in the Anthony Way TV mini-series "The Choir". I can only imagine that I'm working for Tom Long with the strength of his amazing performance in "The Choir". Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in "The Choir" was filmed as "Long Tom's Midnight Garden" by Time and Ganguly, and Anthony failed to persuade schoolmates. The speculation that Tom believes that a very young hottie can be a friend is far removed. In the BBC version of the 1989 version, Tom and Hatties were very close to age and the development of their friendship was more reliable. The 1999 film failed to convince the special effects of the film and there was no significant improvement over the 1989 TV effects. The cast and acting of this version are low in pre-adaptation and all the films have a soft version of the true classic. As a final survey I would say if the new DVD of this version can be bought under £ 5.00 but I would say that the VHS of the BBC version of the 1989 well receives £ 20.00 second hand?
