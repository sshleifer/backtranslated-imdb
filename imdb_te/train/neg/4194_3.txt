The film is very good with a story about a director who loses his story and tells about a blind woman who is committed to helping the protagonist. <br /> The script writers did not know where they were going from there. <br /> Why did she still come from the ship? Why did she try to borrow a mobile phone on the ship to call someone? ), The stories are totally ridiculous (would it be funny with the mother and boyfriend? And what is the story with the parents?). Although the plot is a monotonic trend, the film is totally speculative. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about it is that there is a very high probability. As I mentioned, the movie is a good idea, visuals and score are very beautiful and the main characters are good. So it might be a good movie ... but it's not.
