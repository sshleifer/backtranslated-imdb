I saw this movie and I was trapped because the film was foolish and frustrating. Ram Gopal Varma justifies his work but unfortunately he has failed and the whole movie has been broken and they have lost "shale". Cast and crew are bad. When watching the movie, the whole theater was lying, some fled in the middle. Amitabh Bachchan's performance is weak, I thought this film was a great hit of the year but this film is definitely a year long, sure. Nobody, including Ajay Devgan, did justice. This movie is not eligible for any audience. I'm betting this film will fail. <br /> <br /> "Finally this movie suits"
