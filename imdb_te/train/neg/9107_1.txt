I was mad by this movie. I'm still angry and I still sit still to see this valuable moment in my life. I had a wax job and had more fun. At least Cherry makes me laugh before it hurts. I was confused a bit at first but then realized I was going to catch what's going on. By this time this film is half way through, and yes I'm a procrastinator but I want to see things until the end. So I saw it and saw it. Actors are not attractive in cruel intents, they are not convincing. I saw my nephew for the more favored attention than the emotional difficulties I had painted on the screen. Let's see if you like bad movies with bad acting.
