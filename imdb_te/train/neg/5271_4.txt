A bull, an American family, a resting place in the west, can find a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. Some people know that this ghost town was once a testing ground for nuclear bombs, and hunting them with a deadly presence. I usually love mystery horror movies like this. "Cube", Spielberg's "Duel" and "The Birds" provide all the answers but do not answer them, yet we are very keen and want more. Apparently, "disappear" writer / director Walter Klenhard is just trying to make that kind of film, and whether he is the winner until the winner. I personally came about half way, then the movie was drowned. <br /> The actors are all just "ho-hum". They are not particularly bad but the audience never really feel their fear and they respond to situations in dubious ways. Walking out to investigate strange sounds of someone completely out of the characters? <br /> <br /> For TV movies, this is definitely an average fair fair. Director Kleinhard was involved in everything that really provided the desert environment and some settings were striking. Two characters have been melted to the glass for a really cool scene sand finding on an old nuclear test ground can be viewed entirely in the sand. <br /> In truth, I do not speak, and 'creatures' or anytime hell after these people? We have not given any real origin (mutants, aliens, ghosts or ancient nasty Indian souls? Oh, it's really traumatizing us!) Or where it came from. <br /> <br /> There are many clues here too. Why are the towns-folklore in this kind of movies really really stupid? Why always feels crazy that an old guy turns everyone will be right? Why? Why? Why? How a new scene, folks boxing! <br /> <br /> The "disappearance" seeks to be different and intelligent, but ultimately it will fail directly in many ways for video horror lover fans. Hey, I've seen movies so badly, and disappear is not bad, is it just too much ?? <br /> <br />
