I remember that most of these children came to nuts. I'm a bit too old to get all the excitement and I'm a fan of true martial arts films and have always found this bit cheesy. <br /> <br /> <br /> In the early 90s we were drowned in the programs and children thought they could fight and be in a power ranger or in the same 3 ninja in these children. <br /> <br /> Many children feature films that they have some big points they are trying to make because of the fact that parents and filmmakers are suffering from ill health. And it's good to see your kids message and receive it, there is no doubt about it ... it will exploit a million differences within just 90 minutes. <br /> What great visual features but one would expect it to be? Acting is very bad. Viktor Wong is a cool actor but he is embarrassed to see him here. The small, fat, fraudulent old fart, just as happy as a powerful ninja. <br /> <br /> Many stars in this movie and the little ninja tum could be the worst kid actor I have ever seen. <br /> They also have a story that no one knows before reading the review. 3 ninjas ... yes you know they are gonna fight a bunch of bad guys and obviously win ... I need to say more. <br /> <br /> It will make that kid. The film is aimed at children and can only enjoy children. When you see your child reading pictures of children, you have a good picture of them. <br /> <br /> If you do not allow your children to see the perfect trash of your image for your kids when there is nothing like real martial arts, real acting or reality, you will see the kids ... <br /> <br /> I will remember all the girls who have a love for Rocky. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " There are tons of great Shaw Brothers films. .. Do not really show them your kids things that do not really entertain them and make them mute them, maybe even teach them a few moments and grandfather 3 ninjas is not how to kick a man between the legs ... what ... left the man between the legs ... It's like that all-time.
