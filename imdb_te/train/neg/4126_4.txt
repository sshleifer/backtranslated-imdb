This snoop, directed by Amanabar's general collaborator Matto Gill, has nothing to do with a loathsome, thrill-less thriller. There is no real film that deals with some of the boredom and thrillers, and the boredom is a workout. The whole scene is the film climax, which takes about 30 seconds. The plot is neither serious nor credible, and the idea is genuine, the method of separation is unilateral and each plot is a result of device or twist external interference (Deus-X-Mashina). The hero is always inactive, giving him everything without showing him any initiative or resources. If you're the fans of the genre, see "Tessie" instead.
