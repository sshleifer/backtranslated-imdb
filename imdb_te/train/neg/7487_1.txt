Unfortunately, this movie is very bad. Original Out of Towners Manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason Neil Simons script can not be used in this movie, so it comes with flat time and time again. The audience was never laughed at me. The pair is sexy in the park because it is too slow and tedious in this direction and when it is joke, the joke dies. They announce a lighting ceremony for New York, we know we are all going to come on the lights and we will be able to make a cute and mugging Goldie & Steve Slap stick a bit mug. The whole movie winds are like this ... a joke is set up and given away. Why golds hair is not always messed up in the picture. You'll notice up each of Goldie's (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you give a real rent with Jack Lemon and Sandy Dennis, if you want to laugh.
