For the first time, I saw Madeline L 'Engel's fan and made a film for Time A pitch in my favorite books. This film, however, has lost that excitement. Sorry, Meg describes the presence of glasses and glasses that are too sweet and is considered too obscene. In this film, she has straight hair and glasses and is "sporty type" with deep voice. Medlain L 'Engage is not Mega shot. In fact, Meg relied on Medlene's role and was portrayed as she felt when she was younger. This is just a prime example of how the book and the film are different. If I'd like to see it for fun purposes, see it, but if you're a fan of Madeline L 'Engle and Time series, I'm scrambling this movie.
