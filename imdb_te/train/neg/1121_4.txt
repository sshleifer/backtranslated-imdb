In the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, Krabbe, a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps in the underworld, finds that he is furious about killing his companion, who tries to steal a newspaper from a newspaper stand, a train station. And he's all this (but with the exception of the crab at least one scene) is the hero of this unhealthy movie but is nowhere to go. The basic plot is quite simple but pulled out for about two hours before reaching endless nonsense. Verhoeven has a nice visual flair but the forest hallucinations are sights, open symbolism, and effortless gore when he runs out of ideas.
