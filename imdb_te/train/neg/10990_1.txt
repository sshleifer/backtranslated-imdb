I ended watching this whole (very long) film because its stupidity and drama attracted me. Most prominent people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Oliver, John Gielguld, Vittorio di Sica) were also believed to have been willing. But maybe 1968 people really * are very innocent? The plot is written with an agenda of some confusing Latin American Marxist priest. In a super power struggle, and the Russians are really good boys, the Communist Party general secretary is a good and spiritual person, suddenly, after 20 years he sees the light and demands to reduce his evil conscience by releasing the prisoner priest from the Siberian Gulag. The priest will immediately pope through a series of coincidences. <br /> Meanwhile, Communists in China have achieved half the hungry socialist economic wonders. Death country. They want to start a nuclear war to settle this little climber in the relentless bright path to the Communist (to deliver Western capitalist wealth to China's poor workers). <br /> <br /> Our Good Old Comedian General Secretary is a bit worried and calls the broker asks him peace before his coronation. They look like a 15-year-old boy with the Chinese leader Peng. In 1968, people are sleeping on the ground and you know what the Chinese are doing. When the pope gets coronation in Rome, the world wide Catholic church has a whole wealth of food for food for our poor Chinese brothers in Rome, while the monks are not demanding to pay for the madness of socialists, and that the Western investors must pay He vows. <br /> In addition to that there are some small sub-plots, which are very small to release a very bad picture. I give three Oscars for stupidity. <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is rarely seen as a pope. He is a very bearish testimony of Zorba.
