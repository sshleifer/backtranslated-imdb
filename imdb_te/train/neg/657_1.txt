<br /> <br /> Starring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Strap, and Dana Davis Three years ago, her teacher (Donna (Brittany Snow) her Jonathan Scheck ) In the hands of her, she killed her whole family. Now, she's preparing for her stupid annoying friends for her senior prom. Once there, they started killing each other because nobody escaped from the killer and started to bother to warn Donna, because it is obviously important for her prompt disruption. <br /> <br /> "Everybody decides not to tell everybody with Donna, who is helpless to her (she does not look great) <br /> <br /> Cons: Let's start off by saying that I am a huge slasher fan.I usually enjoy bad ones.I was a few PG-13 Also love horror movies. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, in fact, have been rated PG. I also POLTERGEIST (1982) and the grudj (2004) fun. <br /> <br /> As the PK-13 <br /> <br /> The first story is a big problem for me and I also like slasher movies without stories, at least they can be entertaining. Some years later, she will destroy her campaign and kill all her friends and try it for myself ...? Then there are the illustrations that I ask. Claire (Jessica Strap) is fighting with her boyfriend, she is cramped, and I can not work very hard. It's not a remake of PROM Night, it should be a lifelong feature. <br /> After that ... This is a horrific death scenes. My favorite slashers (Halvine, Curtains, original PROM night) are not that bloody but do not care that they are not the crypt that still have effective murders. Here, we will die when we go back to the same hotel room to die characters, a woman who has been wounded and wounded in a moment on the face of the evil actor. <br /> <br /> I'm 10 years old girls are terrified, but not me. <br /> <br /> I also hate characters. Donna's dubious delicate boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can assure you that you have never been a gentleman in your life, a sweetheart in your life. Then we mean Donna's annoying friends Claire (Strap) and Lisa (Dana Davis) and Token meaning Girl Chrissy (Brian Davis). If you want to tease characters in DEATH PROOF, try watching this movie. <br /> <br /> "I'm on" the soundtrack and the lack of a big deal in relation to the original material, and you have a very stinker.
