I have seen this film for a project in love. To find out how Nicolas Cage feels to be his role, and read back the lines he says. My life is not gone ... I accidentally cut my own hand ... my brother is close. Obviously his fault. And the happiest conclusions are the nice guy who takes care of mother's regret and loneliness. The closure, bad script, and small letters are not sufficient extension. Save yourself, except for a good laugh. Costumes have been made appropriately, and extra amazing work. I think this is a fun movie, but it's a more specific style, and I can not recommend it to anybody who knows me because this is not an intellectual movie. It's not chic flick. It's not perfect romance. I can not show children due to sex and questions that need to be followed. All in all, not just a good image.
