If you revive in Asian horror, do not worry. The film is not mentioned in the A-list works such as Ring, A Tale of Two Sisters, Cure, and Ju-On (or a good thing like the eye or Inner Senses). The pictures are framed with thumbnails, unexpected images, rich characters, and decisive non-violent things. <br /> <br /> In the past twenty-five years the American horror is desirable to gavy with leftover organs and organs of everything lousy. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to combine the story of the Asian ghost and the Hollywood slasher image, but it is bad fit. An aesthetics other smiter is committed; Can you imagine it? Film producers do not have their story to exploit the ring for a nasty-child subplat, but the situation is disappointing. The clips, the worst characters, the intellectual plot, the dull ghost, the ho ham.
