In a treasure hunt in the London venue, Merry Magcasps, a young woman accidentally fixes her wedding politician with her father, a strong, independent lady-fighter who is never in love. The secret startup vehicle for Catherine Hepburn plays the role of aviTrix, such as Amelia Earhart, which is one of the most autonomous ones to give. Director (Dorothy Arzner) and filmwriter (Joe Aquins who received Gilbert Franco's book) explicitly assigned this project to gain women's opinion, but why old vintages remain intact as frozen artifacts? Billy Burke plays a simple, crying wife, who takes her to bed, and if that mistake, Hepburn's final scene is another bummer. Kate-Watches is an interesting artwork, but not classic. ** from **
