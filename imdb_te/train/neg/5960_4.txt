My friends and I have hoped for this "Bad Movie Night", but the Brain is discouraging. Brain is also a great looking goof, but it is on a very small stage. Who thought that Brain would be cool enough to have Munch of three people with just three minutes of drawn 94? This film is a rebel genius (we are putting crazy glue on one's chair, there are things going for it at first including his esteemed intellectual-knockout lead his miserable intelligence led to his extensive pranks and school stunts). It's also some great lines, a ridiculous out-of-shape and out-of-breathing assistant just barely everywhere, and, yes, some chick gets naked. However, the director seriously needs some schools in the art of passing. In the last half of the cases, only 3 or 4 point, boring chase scenes reach the third of the plot. The scenes inside the PRI complex are particularly bad. At least 15 minutes in this movie people walk up the same stairs. I was able to solve the screenplay properly for half an hour - more cheese, more gour, more nudity, more brain action. If you're going to do a bad horror movie, you'll have to look at at least one. Perhaps the director is really trying to bring his audience into his film - at the end of this crop I thought I was one of the damaged villages.
