I actually have a favorite for Christopher Lee, but it's not up to his other shows ... and he's one of the good actors. <br /> <br /> The movie does not live up to its premise. It's not that horror, it is overly dramatic, and it draaaaaags. <br /> <br /> If I'm in the right movie, at the expense of this film, I've enjoyed some MST-fication ... Nahh ... It's not really worth the effort, it's not very good, it's not too bad, it's just mediocre.
