I read a while ago and enjoyed the favorite of the Anne Brontë's and especially the BBC dramas because I bought this adaptation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> అన్నింటిలో మొదటిది, సంగీతం (మరియు పాటలు) కాలం డ్రామా (ఇది ఒక సమకాలీన భయానక చిత్రం కోసం రాస్తున్నారు వంటి ధ్వనులు) మరియు మరొక వ్యాఖ్యాత వంటి స్థానంలో పూర్తిగా తెలుస్తోంది, నేను ముఖ్యంగా కెమెరాలు పరిభ్రమిస్తూ మరియు నటులు రౌండ్ పరిభ్రమిస్తుంది మార్గం ద్వారా చికాకు జరిగినది. I shot a few scenes in "North and South" and it all seemed right there but in the tenant, it's definitely overdone and just annoying news. <br /> <br /> Camera movements can not make the woodwork fun. <br /> <br /> The second characters are harder to recognize first and the script is not clear. None of the characters are properly introduced. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald's role as Helen Graham's sparrow has been a bit cold and tough to her, never let go through emotion. She does not seem to cry at all in a realistic way. I could not believe that Markham fell for her and did not mention the awful hairdresser I gave. I will have some sympathy with her husband! Fancy will marry such a virus ... Moreover, he is the only major actor to be right for me. Toby Stephen I did not appear correctly, Helen Graham's brother was very good. /> <br /> tragic elements, such as alcohol abuse and cruelty <br a novel dealing with the difficult to adapt. Moreover, the creation of the book, the reader is left with the only, TV adaptation with the complaint, some of the macro and the comic scenes, (hantingdon the start of the blood of the eye) and others play a very long time! I mean, do not get enough scenes of contemporary plays in the bed?
