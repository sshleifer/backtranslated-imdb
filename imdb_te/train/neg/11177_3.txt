The longest one-hour 35 is what I've done for a long time, Al Pacino definitely provides a perfect presentation. It's not his typical typecasting, which is nice. But his character is just stare at curiosity. He gets irritated when he forgets the appointments as Hollywood's social life has realized that he has lost his life. But who we like in this movie. And for some reason, every character in the film, Al Pacino's intruder, said, "I do not know why I love Eli" and that I do not get close to him. Other actors played their simple styles. Tea Leone, Richard Schiff, and Bill Nanne did nothing to change their established personality in TV or previous films. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger did not perform any performance in the film. <br /> <br /> Film story does not slow down. Most scenes are never driving forward forward story, but collecting realism about the characters which just got the game in an anti-final end. It is probable that they prefer to build on the story. <br /> <br /> What is the point of this film? You believe that Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Buttz are "after you have Hollywood, you can not come out". Yes true! That's why many people have shot in Hollywood.
