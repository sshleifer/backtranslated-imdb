Audrey, you really know that your husband Ted keeps memory, but do justice to his legacy and follow her wishes. Dr. Suss did not allow his characters in the course of his life for a very good reason. We must stop cash in his stories, pictures, fantasies and characters. They are unparalleled by the powers of Hollywood and Broadway. <br /> <br /> Tomorrow kids are composed of these hiroshionic and stupid explanations that permanently pollute love and innocence in his books. <br /> Your property is really as you wish. For some time, I would like to hear the advice of others. Save the rest of Dr. Suss. Thank you.
