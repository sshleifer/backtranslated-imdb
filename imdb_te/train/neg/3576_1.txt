When I saw the film with a youngster, I was wondering that I was working on the film about Pia Jodora, who had worked on the film. Much like sexy and sexy as Mrs. Jodora, this unforgiving-donkey of the film was not overlooked. "The Lanley Lady" is not even her photoshoot for the Penthouse, which is promoted by "Daylight", which keeps the film from tanking. Is this the only thing that can save the movie? A completely different script. Give this a miss.
