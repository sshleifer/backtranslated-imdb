Nightmares of a woman feared she was buried alive. The fraudster wants to kill her and decides to use her morale better, and hangs her in a coffin and leaves her in the dungeon. But B-horror film Queen Brink Stevens is a terribly ghostly creature. Michael Barryman is only two small scenes and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard to watch this amateur junk film. The last twenty minutes of Bringie's bloody devastation were fun to watch. The head of the decapitation is really awful. Better Watch "Sculls" or "Alien Dead" again. But I'm not expecting classy entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but it's pretty dull that enjoying "The Fear of Hunting".
