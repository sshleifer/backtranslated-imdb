Gaygigers from Outer Space is a small foreign film about black and gay aliens who explore the galaxy until the earth is flawed. Being homosexual, their goal is to have only one universe which is homosexual in all men. Hence, when women or "females" live on earth, they are initially afraid; In the end, they decide to eliminate all women on earth and free the population. <br /> <br /> A risky title containing a racist, gay and sexist storyline, perhaps intentionally intended, gives the film some shock value. However, there is less material underneath. As another reviewer suggests, there are some jokes along with the names of the characters (eg I'd laughed once in a small gay joke.I quickly got the point of the cinema, bad sci-fi was a satiric, but later I had enough I wanted the movie to end Small image!) Is not intelligent or particularly well written.
