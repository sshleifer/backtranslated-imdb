I never liked this movie. One, not for me, it is obscene and vulgar. It is also considered fraudulent towards women. The film does not really know anything, and I can not find any of the characters that I like.Also, there is no point in it. I missed anything, but for me, this film time is very ruined, I can do something more productive and enjoyable using my face as pin cushion. C. Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones and James Cromwell. All are wasted here and I'm sure each of them is less in each of their career. Jenny Harrison (in the subsequent years of Thrace Company) also starred in the film, and it was nice to see her in the role of a non dyssy. Growth on the average script To me, tank 3/10
