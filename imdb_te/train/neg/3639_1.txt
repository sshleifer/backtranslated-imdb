Until the beginning of this film (especially) sucks to the end. <br /> <br /> But it's very bad, acting, storyline, photography, camera work, etcetera It's not too bad, too bad. <br /> If it is 'great' watch, it gives you more than good laughing. Worse, better! <br /> <br /> I do not have any clue about what these people think of this movie. Extreme Viking movie? <br /> <br /> The film is very ridiculous, it is a disguised comedy, just like the mafia, which is irrefutable.
