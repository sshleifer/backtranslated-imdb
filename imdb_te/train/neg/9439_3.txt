Twist Endings is really cool in an image. This is very interesting when the twist is in our eyes, but we do not pay attention. That type of twist endings feels like one of the people. Then we got turns like this film. Whether you care or not, you do not have any clue what's going on. When they reveal this kind of twist, instead of shock, it is somewhat a cryptic response. <br /> <br /> The movie begins. It's interesting in horror, 20 minutes later it's a boring dialogue and a stupid twist. <br /> <br /> Three young girls go to the concert, lose their journey through the woods, and beat the tree trunk. They end up at some old creepy lady's home who hates men, and they are greeted by her honored daughter Marian (Laurel Monson). <br /> <br /> The film tries to go home or go home for several days or go home, and the suspense reaches a mute slasher. <br /> <br /> The film is caught in a lot of dialogue, and it is only a few characters. We are not the main three girls, creepy spinster and old lady, and beyond any of this significance dialogue. To make matters worse, they are never interesting. It's really sitting through their conversations. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of plot holes here. These girls are three miles from three miles away when their car is in danger. Two hours or less will kill them. Why not ride this house with a worker in the town? Does he have a seater? Will these girls quit at anytime and just rarely check each other? Why should it have too many dumb twists? <br /> <br /> A slasher movie with five letters is really bad idea. It's not thrilling, it's not horrendous, and the end will definitely be there, but undoubtedly dumb. <br /> My rating: * 1/2 out ****. 79 minutes. R. for nudity and violence
