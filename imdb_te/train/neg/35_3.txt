The actress & model Laura Crawford (as Ursula Buchfelner as Euras Fellner) starts with her assistant Jane (Gisela Hoon), checking up for her new movie, as sex kennelball or devil hunter, commonly known among the English-speaking audience. Chris (Werner Pochat) and Thomas (Antonio Mayans) kidnapped her with the help of explosive and dropping Jane when Laura relaxed in her room bath. Laura dismisses a man who hired Peter Weston (Al Claire), who informs the agent about the situation, kidnappers on an island with Laura and seeks 6 million ransom. Peter Petter and his Vietnam vet decided to decide how to save the island & laura as he said that if a dump pipe in a helicopter pilot jack on a dump pipe is faster than a rat, as well as returns that he can safely get back to her and pay 200,000. So, kidnappers Laura & Peter have 6 million but no one wants to give them more. Just more of this particular island (gel, they are now that ancient, in all generations where they've only managed to build a straw hut) Some cannibals are the man of the monster (Burt Altman) God's balding eyes with human sacrifices and these cannons are young, white meat & Prefer to the intestines. <br /> <br /> The music, co-written by the Spanish, French & German co-production & directed by John Franco, also features music. In the 'video Nastus' list in the early' 80s, the Sex Connelly received an impression in the UK, as it was classified as an alternative Devil Hunter title and therefore formally categorized as pornographic & prohibited. Why is it a bad movie & even Franco who is not afraid to be associated with a turkey, why he decides to hide with Clifford Brown's nickname. I'd imagine having a hard time defending this thing too hard to die hard hard. Franco's script, Em Summit, I mentioned Clifford Brown & Julian Esteban as Julius Valerie, was less than impressed with his final product & wanted to remove his name, was awful. This is quite simple. For the beginning of the movie, it's unrealistic, kidnapped plot is one of the dullest I've seen so far without the slightest bit of tension or excitement and stupid looking over-scaled redshoot eyes plus two-tone cannibalistic scenes that do not improve the horror side of things like we gets a big black. <br /> <br /> Director Franco shows his usual inefficiency throughout, the head on the head of the head is placed at the bottom of its neck and try to ground with big leaves & give it impression that it does not match anything! Cannibal scenes are poor, the action is sluggish, and it runs around the forest from 'A' to 'B' and does not really do anything when they come there. It's very sluggish & tedious to look after 10 minutes & forget about this thing in 94 minutes. When Al Claire climbs up a hill, I should have a happy scene, which Franco turned the camera towards its camera and crawls on the client floor! Look at his coat hunt & he's never going to get it when he's grabbing himself! Gore is not great & some of the cannibalis are some gross close ups of mouth as it chews bits of meat, as the movies of the euro cannibal go to this too much, is a man being impaled on the spikes, has some blood & a handful of intestines. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sex Cnobal should have low budget and I need less understanding. This is a terribly poorly produced movie, with awful special effects and rock bottom production values. The only good thing about it is at least the official looks wild alignment. Cannibals are breathing heavily on the screen. Acting sucks, the whole thing is definitely dubbing anyway but nobody can work on this subject. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The only good things I can say is that it has a specific shade atmosphere and those close ups of cannibal gluten are pretty gross. Anyone looking for a good cinematic experience would have to give her a huge berth as much as sexy cinnabal.
