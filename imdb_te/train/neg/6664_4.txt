Edward Norton's first lovely Harlan gradually reveals herself and things start out as a delicate country yarn, as the film gradually changes in a modern forest from a southern romance, Western. <br /> <br /> In a delicate race race (Norton) a young girl (Evan Rachelwood) moves in and around town, <br /> <br /> Edward Norton? <br /> <br /> Edward Norton? A chameleon actor (with the change of facial hair for match), playing a country hack, tone a little noisy but he's just trying to run the piece without worrying about the slang. When he learns more about Harlan, he makes an effortless effort to make all the smallest adjustments. However, with very little changes, we are not sure exactly what comes from Harlan, and the good performance from Norton is confusing. Evan Rachel Wood does not like to bite her eyebrows in Norton. <br /> In the valley, a little unequal storyline due to the change of its pace, the sympathetic audience sympathy of the characters really does not make sense of the character. Do we want this drifter or like? The dramatic turn of events is also unclear. The ambiguity of the film is that the author can not make up their minds, telling them the story and settled for a little hatch-rod. If the image is one or the other, it might be a solid picture, but we're left with a mess. Old-fashioned romantic fans enjoy a piece of the movie, but stopped by black tone. Fans of Norton (or fans of the lush scene of the San Fernando Valley) give this miss.
