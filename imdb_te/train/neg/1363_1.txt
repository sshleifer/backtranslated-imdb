The film starts slowly. After spending an hour, when I saw nothing happening, I went out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. No story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people who know any of us. The filmmakers may be sued in court if they attempt to sell a "motion" picture. No motion. I still tell a story with a couple with a couple stories. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I suspect that any script in the world would save the doctor. My biggest remorse is that I did not waste 60 minutes of my life "Love in Money Time", but I missed a great chance to be a leader. I was the first person to go out, but I waited a little longer. Instead, I saw 20 people going out of my front.
