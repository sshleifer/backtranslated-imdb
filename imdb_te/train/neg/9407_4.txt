"Houseboat Horror" is the most terrific Australian film ever produced and is described as a distinctive Slazer film, which carried the campaign 'Watch the Academy Award-winning movie'. Underground disco band members die from a maniac shot when they try to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian Outback. Slavars starred and wrote the film with body suspense and annoying characters. It certainly provides the gore: the heads are divided into half a machete, the throat is cut and a woman murdered with a horseman. If you like cheesy slasher movies you can make this an attempt, but you have been warned. It's better than Swedish "The Bleeder". 10 to 4.
