When I finally got the chance to see Zombie 3 (Japanese Flesheaters 2 in Europe) on the imported area 2 Japanese DVD, I was blown away just how this zombie epic was entertaining. Transfer is as pure as ever, as good as it was going to see unless anchor bay caught it. Gore really should be it and you can really appreciate the amazing makeup and Gore FX. The sound is also excellent. It's just 2 channel Dolby but if you're a receiver Dolby Prologic 2, you can really congratulate cheesy music (actually a very good score) and effective sound effects. It's not good, and the amazing transfer will add to the overall experience. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how much blood flow in the film, it's shots on the head, pace mech pimples, zombies hooves a cleaner, a woman's gray funeral), intestinal munching, zombie kids and much more I've lost track. <br /> <br /> It is no doubt for the Italian kind hardcore zombie action fans. <br /> <br /> The film does not allow for the second time, and I realize that this is a plain platform, dubbing is terrible, acting hard, and celebrates a feeling of corruption, but it's part of its appeal is. <br /> This is one of the best horror films of mine to me. This nasty, very nice movie. This is the accidental intellect of the highest order. If they played it for laughs it was a catastrophe, but they played it directly as an arrow and the result was a fantastic cult classic that thumbs no and no all the traditional movable scales. <br /> <br /> Beautiful scenes of action scenes, exotic locations, fantastic set design, good, sometimes gre cute women who kick such entertaining but still interesting plot, great decorative effects, beautiful women, and sometimes hilarious, sometimes creepy, always entertaining zombies . With this image you can go wrong, all of which is a cult classic that stands on time test.
