I do not believe all the praise for this film. The play and movie are a ripoff of Sleuth. Michael Cain wants to become an Olivier and Reeves wants to be Cain. He also has nails to rebuild Sleet's original part with Cain Jude Law. Jude Law? What do you mean by a remake of "Alfie"? <br /> <br /> The film took place during the career of Cain, which became clear that he needed to pay the borrowed debts. He will do anything for money. He has acted in such award-winning films, and "Poseidon Adventure Beyond". Reeves' death will be driving praise for this film. He deserves better than to remember for this lousy movie. So Cain. The film can be seen at Walmart at $ 5.97 bin. "Rio on Blame It" along with gemstones like "The Island".
