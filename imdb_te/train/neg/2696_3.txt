I know of John Singleton's intelligent person, who made Bob's n the hood, so how did he write and direct it? It was like a bad pilot to "go to college for the first time", a teenage soap, boring stereotypes and the procession of Clessis that I threw out to make a commercial proposal with some gratuitous violence. Who would expect the date rape victim to dump the sausage for seafood? Laurence Fishburn's creepy progressive professor has bothered me and I love the person, and everyone who is associated with the film has lost the story - a lonely Neo-Nazi band (and a black and a Jewish-room laughing!). Except for Busta Rhymes, of course. Big Ups.
