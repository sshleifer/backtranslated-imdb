An archaeologist (Casper van Deen) accidentally slips over an old, 40-foot mummy, well-preserved underground in the Nevada desert. They decided to call it in a Jewish translator to help keep it secret and find its history. Initially described, Mommy is the son of the fallen angel and one of the many Giants that clearly exist in "those days." To save his son from a devastating flood that he had imagined to kill everything, his son mommy, and for many centuries, he had been planning to wake him up for years. Our present, fallen angels still walk on earth and mummy is resurrected and is expected to happen. The picture is very slow, so much biblically worse and a couple lousy, like to do with air punching stunts. Mummy is good looking but is almost insufficient. It must have more to do but it's dragged on a great deal ... eh. No trouble.
