The cast of the film is some of the better actors of New Zealand, and many of the ones I have seen in fantastic characters, the film fills me with just a deep shame from the same country. The duplicate American accents are the first clue about things to go blurry. Unlike another review, the stupid luxury cruise ship is actually an old car ferry, which is decorated with some of the most used stolen multi-colored flags. Most cast from New Zealand Soap Shortline Street (great) appear for a long time. The film is a short Land Street cast starring in a Christmas party, which is a result of many songs and a bit of Salmonella. <br /> <br /> You have come to think of "Love Boat" organized by your local primary school and directed by an autistic one. <br /> If you are an actor, one study of how to destroy your career.
