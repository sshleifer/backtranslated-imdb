It's true that I always have a scene of scene. Would be irrelevant. The end also makes no sense but it is a wonderful relief that is finally over. I will continue to deteriorate and see a kind of fictitious passion to see if it does. At the end of this mess I was forgiven and the characters survived and I do not have a very strong feeling about actors. If you want to see a train ruins, I would recommend meeting at the railway station. Waiting on a deserted train platform also beats this mess. Apparently I did not have enough to replace my suggested ten lines, so the redundancy risk, I once again said. If this picture is a zero and I have a word for low rating it is less. How about minus zero?
