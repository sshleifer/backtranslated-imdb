In Texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate Halloween night before going to a party. Meanwhile, they are called American Nightmare Pirate Radio fun and agree with their inner fears. A serial killer, listening to their confessions, their nightmares come true, killing each one in a brutal manner. "American Nightmare" is an unnatural low budget film with an awful start: Friday, 13th, without any previous explanation, killing two couples in a discrete camping area. Then, this story will reach the bar where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From this moment on, the story has a great potential and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance, which shows some beautiful breasts and naked bodies similar to the C production. However, the screenplay's end-to-nature nature and nurse did not give any explanation for Jane Tapan's behavior, but it was reported that the budget was finished before the budgetary filming took place. With a better start and end, this weird story is a good low-budget slasher movie. My vote is four. <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")
