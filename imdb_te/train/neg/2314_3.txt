Plot Abbreviation: When his wife, a news reporter, was kidnapped and overrun with an Android double, Secret Service Agent Eric Phillips uncovers a plan of arms dealer to create an army of invincible Androids to track her down & kill world leaders. /> <br /> When I saw this sequel to Richard Pepin's low-budget science fiction / action hybrid "cyber tracker" I did not expect much. The film is not unique, not to blat out the blatant from both "The Terminator" & "Roboxop". This sequel film is in the forefront, opening the film is all a complete action sequence. Blasts, heavy gunfire & heavy body parts, as well as star of some martial-arts film, Don "The Dragon" Wilson's courtesy. All scenes with action scenes with movie scenes. Before acting, Wilson was a bad actor. He really needs a personality exchange.
