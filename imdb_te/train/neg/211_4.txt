High school (I think) is a ridiculously clear "play" - or something about children trying to be a DJ in non-stop hip-hop, break dance, graffiti and roxi. I forgot to be completely honest! People who love music are also terrified of the film and agree - like a drama - failed failure. We're supposed to find these kids who love and nice. I found them bland and boring. Ramon I really hated. He graffiti on subway trains and it looks great. Sorry? He is defacing his not-public property to start. And these "great" kids tap into the city's electricity, so they can manage the big dance party in an abandoned building. Uh Huh. <br /> <br /> We've made fun of the fun and pleasant lounges. <br /> <br /> If music is good, I can not stand a hip hop. The songs - the best - mediocre and they are uninterrupted! They are always playing! I came to the point that many endless music numbers are fast forwarded through the numbers. Subway dance fight, a really funny Santa Number and Weather Roxy Show - there are some imaginative numbers (perhaps the music cut and you have a 30 minute film - haha). If you like hip hop your movie here. But you're looking for good drama that you combine - forget it. How did it get PG rating? This is an amazing amount of swearing in.
