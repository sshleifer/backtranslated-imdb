After watching this film, I felt like I needed to go back a bit in my despair. Selma Blair is an amazing, presently undervalued actress and Max Beasley is rather lovely than "Kill Meter". Although some of the promises are not true, the original story is not true. <br /> <br /> I do not know her agreement, but director Dana Latti has no expertise in director. She dropped the footage, dropped the footage, used the awkward camera angles, used abusive color filters, made a Julian shortcut, jumped back in the timeline and was the innocent "modern" soundtrack. Last time I saw the ineffective job of directing the film. She must be heavy to put on the front and center of her direction to act and toss out the story and to take notice of the audience members. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes in "Kill Meter", which shows what can be and can show. Unfortunately, things start to show promise, Ms. Lustig again will make the movie trick into her bag of things in school tricks and chaos. You can not say that Blair and Beasley have a good chemistry because it has a good chemistry. 3/10
