As soon as I really have to watch a good movie, it seems every other entry or so is something I hate. But my history speaks, I should not say a lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything about it sucks big green bananas peels. Never thought that I would read the thread as a thread of the movie. Al Pacino does not appear in the film: he pretends. There are many scenes in his role as a driver of several cars watching the camera. He is absolutely awful. Martha Keller is just as bad. These two are in love affairs, and no chemistry is there. Sidney Pollock directed this film? There is no trace of genius behind Tootsie here. Is this the person I enjoyed in the Eyes Wide Shutt? I rarely believe it. Save yourself the terrible cinematic experience. Do not run away from Bobby Deerfield.
