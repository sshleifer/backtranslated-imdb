The motion of this film is revealed in the DVD box. A garment worker develops an awkward miracle fabric. But the film failed to get it. Instead it pads 45 minutes, noodling around an introduction before he makes a big discovery. This is a strange choice because it does not benefit much from watching the audience from having trouble: the film has successfully blocked any item from drowning. After the fabric has been invented, the film is intentionally seeking innovation with bigger and blue-collar collaborators in industry, the film has only two weak movements; <br /> <br /> I can not understand anyone who describes as a comedy. Tone is not funny or funny. It is similar to the serious social criticism of the day: capitalism occupies both the supply chains and the product. It prevents innovation from arriving and improving the world. Yes, it's probably true, but to do with the attitude toward the fact that without a little bit, the film is just solemn argument. <br /> It's similar to a British meet John Doe (Miguel Do Meat?).
