I love the horror movies that brings out the real amount of mystery as "silent hill" (I'm pretty good, but still, something does not) and the movies that you keep guessing, I thought it was one of these movies. The film initially starts with some good suspense and has created a good starting point for a nice horror scene, but then goes down the hill and goes from there faster and faster. I mentioned a silent hill at the beginning of a reason because the "stolen" themes from the movie can be seen a lot .. all I say is that the silent hill looks and its good, its more scary it is very susceptible and even the end is very good .. and best of all , You wont be ripped as I did this one .. It was just one of those So i want to make it back in my own really bad version. "Oh picture and a lot more ... Lordi in a horror movie ... As a care bear trying to scare a kid," hug me and I will love you forever " It's written on the stomach ..
