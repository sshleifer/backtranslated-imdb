I can not tell you that "The Screaming Skull" is trying to tear a hitchcock or tap the Edgar Allen Poe. Nowadays, some cut a bit a bit and that old TV "Tales from the Dark Side" presented one of those TV Anthology episodes ... but only after extensive relay. The sad thing is that this film is a nice, nasty little story trying to get out of under the rubble of the film, and the actors are clearly doing their talents and the material they have to work the best they can. But the director does not know how to draw a dramatic scene or pace; Special effects just did not work; The screenplay can see its quarterly storyboard, so that a Bivil is clearly coming to them; When trying to intimidate the audience, the soundtrack was playing the German "Omfa Band" music. <br /> They tried; They tried really hard. But it is only time to be interesting. I think many young people who have not seen much of the suspense or horror are out of "The Screaming Skull", but maybe a lot of subtext or plot inspiration. ("Mommy, why is that nice man trying to terrify the scaredy-cat lady faced by Twisty?")
