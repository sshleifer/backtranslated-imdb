I saw a better product quality on YouTube! As the writing is terrible and direction shocking, I'm pitying the actors, they are not sure how to get the lines - I really doubt whether any of the actors could have saved these images better. The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real synthesis of the plot that just seemed to go a lot nowhere. It's really a shame, the premise for the film is good and good product quality, directing and the script was a good movie. It's not comedy except you laugh at the dubbing - it's an amateur and English actors too.
