I personally liked 1995's "prophecy". Christopher Walken, as usual, is great, and the film is not so flawless, it's the creepy and most original horror / fantasy film that's very much fun. This low-level 1998 sequel is still worth watching, but especially due to the Wakeen. In my opinion, one of the great actors was Wacken, and he was once again in the role of Gabriel, the Fenne Orchengel playing second. Once again, the battle between fallen and faithful angels was brought to earth. Gabriel returns to prevent the birth of a child, the angel Daniel (Russell Wang) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child is once the defining factor of the celestial war ... As I have mentioned above, Christopher Walken is once again Gabriel as excellent. Nevertheless, with Gabriel, "Prophecy II" sin also has a group of horrific annoying characters. Valerie's character was very annoying, and Danel made me more angry. However, the biggest pain in the donkey, the role of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), is not the closure of her suicide girl. However, Walken's performance is not the only quality of the film. The entire film is very discouraging, and is well documented in dark colors, which makes the atmosphere much more attractive. Gabriel's resurrection scene was initially very impressive and one of the finest moments in "Prophecy" films. Although "Prophecy II" is weak in three "prophecy" films with Wachen. Absolutely a Christopher Walken performs a man, entertaining, but nothing beyond that.
