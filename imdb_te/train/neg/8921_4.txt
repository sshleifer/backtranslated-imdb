Inspired by the African-American Women's Scout's inspiration in a modern, struggling city, there is nothing else in the film. Here, Ms. Scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of mostly poor and black neighbors employees and consumers who live in it. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. The part of the problem is that the origins of the story are not well-translated in the urban setting of the film, and the script has failed to perform the update work. Also, the continuous message of sharing and giving is repeatedly repeated, the audience becomes very tired before the film reaches its familiar conclusion. It does not know when to exit message picture. In the title role, the talented Seasely Tyson gives up the overlay and sometimes the lines are difficult to understand. Charles Dickens' novel has been habitually accustomed, but it's new and relevant despite its corresponding message.
