But "Cinderella" is my vote, not only for Disney's princess's worst movies, but for Walt's lifetime. The music is genuinely beautiful, and the story deserves to be deserved to be "classic". <br /> <br /> Failure characters in this film, especially the title character, are called "heroine" only for the very small part of the term. <br /> <br /> Audience Cinderella after a short speech. She was walking in the morning and singing "A Dream a Who Makes Your Heart". This made her an idealist (and deserving of our sympathy). Unfortunately, the script gives us any clue about her dream. Freedom from the role of her servant? She is the dignity of phase-family? Talk to someone besides mice and birds? She wants many of hers that Cinderella can do her job more effectively, as a song (filmed in the featured features of the latest DVD). You go to the girlfriend! In short, Cinderella is a very respectable character. She consistently accepts the misuse of her step-by-step family, escape into her unspoken dreams for relief. She recalls her stepfather, who is still a member of the family. For this, she is given a token gesture that is absolutely absurd to everyone except Cinderella, of course, given her permission to go to the ball if she is full of housework and wear something. Does anyone Belle or Jasmine become such a dormant? If Cinderella is dull, her male counterpart is not lifeless. Prince in Cinderella has no dialogue and almost no screen time. If we respect Cinderella or anything, we do not have reference if he is a good man. We know 1) he is a prince and 2) he dances well. The heck, the prince from "Snow White" sang at least a romantic song. <br /> <br /> This lack of development makes romance less interesting, as it makes Cinderella a social climber or an idiot, she is already weakening sharp appeal. <br /> <br /> Maybe the main characters are dull, the animator's cinematic relief, Cinderella's friends, have chosen to give rats a high-screen time. Of course, these characters are fun. However, when comic relief stolen programs from mainstream programs, tell them that your story has some problems. <br /> <br /> Denzi likes to advertise all his animated features as "artworks". While many of them are, there are some who do not qualify for this reorganization. Cinderella is a prime example of this fact.
