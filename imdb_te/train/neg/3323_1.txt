I've been watching a lot of cartoon or animated movies because I'm a baby girl who likes to watch TV. I started looking at this picture to see if I wanted to see my younger one ... and not. In the beginning I thought Bambi was a beautiful picture like the movie, but it was all the way gay like insinuating ducks. They make fun of him because he is not good at sports, but that is not the case. It looks like a movie made by children to learn to be fun. It's also very sad, daddy's father and everyone. I do not know, I guess if you want to be gay, but I do not think I'll see my child again.
