The painful bad Christmas movie that has his own typical fraternal self-payment but equally painful bad performance by Vince Vaughn, who with this intellectual or charm that is in his R rated movies for children's film. Vaughan seems to have been in autopilot even though he is a big part of the film and he walks the walls with his smooth performance. 30 minutes after the film hit your inner blows, and when "Bahubedg" tells how the film is unfair and another 30 minutes later, how can the film not bear? Among all the actors involved in this chaos, Paul Gaymitti and Rachel Weisz, will briefly present the paper to the narrative paper and they are very good for the actors because it is polite. Paul Gaymitt brings some depth and warmness to St Nick's character, but when Van's sad sibling confuses him he will force the boy's childhood behavior. You can see that you are not happy with his role and it's painful in some parts of the film. Rachel Weisz brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role, but she does not have much role to work and is a part of her, that she can see in her face. Fortunately for her, she is very much in the movie and can save some face, unlike the giants who are about to shoot his agent at the end of the movie. Direction does not even feel, there is no feeling or flow and this is a holiday movie but it ends up feeling like you're just staring at a fancy widow performance that is torn down <br /> <br /> I do not know what's wrong here but two actors (Giamatti And weisz) at least try to bring up something in the table, (and it's all Mus film) and his performance (Vaughn) who do not care about you as an actor, you see one of the most painful is the image of unparalleled evil.
