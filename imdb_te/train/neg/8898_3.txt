Can a fake scene be destroyed You can not think so, but it really is me here. Listen, I have many classic-Era movies, and the exception is that drivers are such innocent cars, front of the screen, but there are many actions in the hockey business. Fake scenes were found in fake mountains and "brigadon", and the flowers burnt were awkward for a while. <br /> <br /> As long as musical entertainment goes, this is always offensive. A person may not like the songs and the other one, it should not be a big part of a movie (whether anyone likes songs). I was able to blast the film for its 1950s songs, dances, love stories and characters, but it's '50s and many people liked the likes of this kind. The musical concerts are very well made in '50s. For me, I liked the '30s and' 40s with great taps. By the 50s, tap out and these new items - which I can stand - it's. Does it make a secular image? <br /> <br /> Despite good cast, good director and high expectations, the film was bombed at the box office and me. I should have liked more, being a dreamer and a nice part of this story. I'm not kind of dull and a nice town and nice people making me feel good sounds awful appeal. Then why do not I connect with this movie? Part of it is dancing. I do not care for the content of the dancing by pressing on the screen. But - no - the thing really turned me off what that show was. No Scotland, tall lands, just a hokey-looking backdrop to make it look that way and it turned me almost from the beginning. To score a point for today's reality they "position" a lot of time.
