For all, I do not sit down to see the premiere of a "Star Trek" array. <br /> When Archer finds a nibula or something that separates those lines and wants to take a closer look, it destroys the ship. <br /> He sends a shuttle in Nebula and the shuttle suffered ... <br /> <br /> In all the episodes I've seen, all the problems are due to Archer's stupid mistakes. Oh and did you see a preview of an episode that kissing Archer and Tappal? I thought to see that episode but after that I left the company completely. Come !!!! This is the Star Trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> What happened with Banana Slug? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana slug but had to leave behind some stupid reasons. Okay good, little dumb you need to bring the pet slug in place. Well I thought they were left on the desert planet !!!!! A BANANA SLUG would not leave in a desert !!!!!!!!!!!!!! How are these authors dumb <br /> <br /> In what ways are business entrepreneurs talking about it?
