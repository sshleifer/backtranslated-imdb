I'm taking this film into science fiction. If you are interested in seeing Dean Cain Dive and do not cover at least a dozen times in flames, the film is for you. If your interest is not reduced to the maximum level, the movie is very bad because you are afraid that you would like to be covered in flames. Acting, to start, is awful, awful, awful. The characters are completely bad, and the dialogue is worse than your typical Z-Grade, the size of the image. In the end, except for the naked and unseen person of the dragon, the film reminded me of the 'Hollow Man' (perfect for escaping the elevator shafts). Unlike other similarities, it is not even bad ... it's just bad.
