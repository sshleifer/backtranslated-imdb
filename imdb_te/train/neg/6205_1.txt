So they highlighted the violence and branded it sick. Well, violence is the best bit I'm scared, but unfortunately the characters do not develop enough to allow us to understand why they go to their (utterly predictable) devastation. This movie has a real terrible script. We can not earn anything to get to Robert, and in the end his actions are silly and curious. This acting is not quite as a TV chef and school teacher. The direction is clumsy, pace enough to send you sleep. And what is a school cinema project on earth? Perhaps a comment on this image? The use of NewsRel during the climactic murder is ridiculous. These guys are apparently they are intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their deep. I do not know how they got the great Yorgos Arvantis on Earth. And it's a great secret if they have earned money in the first place. Absolutely awful than comprehension.
