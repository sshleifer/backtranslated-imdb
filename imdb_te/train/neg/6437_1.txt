Spoilers. <br /> First, nothing really happened in this film. Secondly, this is not a horror. Third, there is a worst soundtrack ever in any film. Let me broaden. Was this sound modified by Beavis or Buthehead? I'm not sure, so just let go with Beavis. The film gradually becomes more quiet and the people get confused and grunt, you get the volume (I've seen this at home). Then, when Bevis blasted some really noise sounds with scary / horror images, you quickly forced the volume down again. It happens many times, with compassion, the movie ends. When the test team is enormously rushing for the remote every time, I can see the images that are lazy and laughing at the back of the two different mirrors. If you have children and they love to see horror images after they're sleeping, this is a big mistake. But it is a big mistake anyway. Is there an idea here? If you're going to do a horror film, before she's pulling a 19-year-old elegant girl in the top of her lungs, a shadow on the wall of the camera, throwing in a cat camera to frighten audiences, a lighthearted weirdro or aluminum with a playful smile Fayl (in a la TV Still in the space). These people did not even try to scare me. They wanted to hurt my ears.
