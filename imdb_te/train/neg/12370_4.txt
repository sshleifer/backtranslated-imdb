Because the whole stupid image is better around the map in the cemetery, they should be called this map. There are no number of boring shots of the map there. The only thing that they show up on the map is the little beads of sweat that constantly builds on our forehead's forehead. Filmmakers showing how long the Immortal Hills cemetery has passed. Just now, do not we only show one of the death scenes? We can not see anything when everyone listed on the map is heard a whole lot about how it's falling as flies. I am generous with the rating I gave to some people how to make my life barrier to keep my attention but I do not recommend this movie to anybody. If you have deep fascination with charts or sweat I would recommend the film to rent better, I'll put your grave or your bloody drink.
