I'm never really a Scooby-Doo fan (due to its horrible production values), this looks like Shakespeare compared to the worst heap of Hanna-Barbera! Without a doubt, Scrappi-Doo is the most annoying and awkward character for children (such as the Telebub and Tommy the Tapeworm). Whose bright idea is it to create a kind of small mutant dog, talk with it and collect the Scooby-Doo characters ?! Whoever dies or deserves to see this event (I think death is better). The bottom line is the little dog just unfunny, annoying and grates on the nerves - and this is only the Better episodes !! Many years later, the franchise is better than creating this mess! In the live-action Scooby-Doo movie I will see why the villain scrap-doo - practically everyone hates him!
