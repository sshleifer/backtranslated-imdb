The film was originally filmed at Northern Arizona University in Flapstaf in the late 1976, although it was in the "Ivy League" college. I participated in the theater section, and most of the movie included the members of the theater department. <br /> <br /> In this film (if you know your Arizona geography) there is a humorous scene from the college where many of the bikes are riding a bicycle. Knowers knows we're at Campus and Creek (original oak Creek Canyon) about 35 miles away, and when the trip is all downhill, it's literally going to turn a bike.
