The original film from the Snowy River is the best thing I have seen, almost perfect. Lady and Tramp Storyline in Two Scrolls - Rich Girl / Poor Boy, and Capacity vs. Blood line. This sequel is not just a shameless attempt to invest on the real name of the original name, but the funniest, biggest Disneyfly mess is better equipped as "Rambo meets the block stallion". Without the charm of the Black Stallion. The young hero came back from a 3-year absence, and suddenly he was supermen on horseback; Actually, in the good movie, he is real and believable, but in the sad sequel reduced to a satire. I was disappointed in the film, and at times it angered me - they rarely missed a cliche. Brass Audience - Studio Heads Do you feel that you have to do with horses-beloved audiences and make them beautiful horses and make them happy? The mess of an image.
