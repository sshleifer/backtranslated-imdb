We went to the movie with a band, because the game we were playing was canceled. It's without doubt one of the worst movies ever. It's not me I'm not liking cult movies. But nothing happened in the film. No roles are associated with any connections. Endless Times Without Dialog And car. How does a huge tent and beds chairs and garments run in the car every day? It's two seats! But the scenery is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director has to make a photo shoot of the film, so if we skip the 80 minutes of useless time, nothing will happen. <br /> <br /> It does not recommend because it waste your time
