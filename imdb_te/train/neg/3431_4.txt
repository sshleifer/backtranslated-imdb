It's not as funny and gory as DVD box arguments. I really love the twisted and wierd movies, but this is really just dull! It's an hour ripped off penises, flying a lot of Boolean birth toys and rape! I think this intrigue with the sleaze sleaze, it is to make it's it-so-bad-it's-good movies, but it fails. It's just bad! Some scenes are ok, but overall it's a mess. If you like the amateur splatter like this (the only way is good) I recommend Andreas Schnass' Violent Shit 2 and 3.
