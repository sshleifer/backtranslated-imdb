<br /> <br /> Some of the classic gems from the film: Paresh Rawal I can not laugh or understand her role: Cause he is looking for his mother As he walks over the village, it becomes bigger and it becomes bigger and in my childhood I remember him and my teacher At the same joke, tell me! <br /> <br /> The whole film is not a joke, we are in a dual role (i.e. older and younger) and Rekha old Wife Raveena We have also rejected Harish, Aruna Irani's son kills power, who both are fighting the Ghost wig * br> <br /> <br /> The music is bad for directing <br /> <br /> Anil hard attempts too young in the young character and a lot of old character Inna age is still very good drawing, Raveena Harish is very good, like Shakti Kapoor, Aruna Irani is terrible, a Camilo okay rajnakant
