This movie is two and a quarter of excruciating hours. <br /> I mean, I understand the historical background. It is a ragtag group of Confederate Bushwalkers (terrorists?) In the Missouri-Kansas border, revenge against northern Northern sympathizers and abolitionists in the U.S. Civil War. But there is not much point in this film from unsatisfactory violence. Perhaps it was a political statement. Is that war really unjust than violence? That point was very well done, but I do not think that point. The producers really thought I was doing a worthwhile film here, but I was not worried about any plot when I was concerned. <br /> <br /> The characters I see in the cover of these novels seemed like watching a paperback novel when I came to life. <br /> <br /> The film is set on fire with some towns!
