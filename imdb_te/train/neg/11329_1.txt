Elizabeth Taylor could never play the role and she is the most annoying and unanimous in the film. But she still looked very small and dampy before she got too fat. Rock Hudson was exactly as Bick Benedict, but he was a more prominent actor like William Holden. James Dean has certainly proved how he cheated his way through a movie. The whole image is too slow and goes too long. None of them were convinced because the cast was so small and light and poor makeup. <br /> <br /> Hudson is just as funnier and Dean and Carol Baker is the same age.
