I could not see this movie because I could not see it. If I saw it in a theater, in its original presentation, I might have congratulated it, but I was slowly moving. <br /> I read the book 25 years ago. The details of the plot are reduced from memory. <br /> <br /> It's really four films, or four-part film, and I mean, I thought, it did not help the movie. Four nights can be seen in the drama show. I found Part I enjoyable enough, but all I can do is sit through part II, it drags endlessly. It is one thing to read Tolstoy's philosophy. If you get a good translation or read it originally, his amazing masterpiece will overcome any problems at the speed of the story. <br /> <br /> In the picture, it's hard to reproduce without much importance. <br /> I have problems with some parts of the picture I have seen. <br /> <br /> Instead of moving forward with this story, it is very beautiful with the hay-look-at-e-camera work that he cares about. I could not summon the excitement crank up to parts III and IV.
