This product is not exactly a storyline. Acting is embarrassing. Promised Dutch television Sophie Hillbrand Star should not add the film to its CV. Her performance is blameless and personally I feel that I have crossed the professional courtesy; She will be revealing her in this film. The film has a lot of unnecessary nudity, obscene sex scenes and tough languages. It shows the wrong image of the Netherlands (as in most movies). Do not worry to watch this film: wasting time, an awkward record for money waste and Hillbrand, who has proven her better to be on the screen.
