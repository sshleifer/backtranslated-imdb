<br /> <br /> Santa Claus is living in a cloud on an outer space and fighting against Satan and his followers ... It is still fun. All of them consciously argue, though. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to be combined with "Santa Claus Conkers The Martians", "Santa Claus" Dudley Moore and John Lithgow. "The Santa Claus" with Tim Allen.
