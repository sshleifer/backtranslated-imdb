Really unpleasant movie. Rick Baker's special effects are very impressive (if the stomach-in turn), which have no other ransom properties. As many as 70 movies, you can take a long shower, and leave feeling feeling if you need to scrub off the sludge of your. The characters are uniformly hollow and the plot does not mean at all.
