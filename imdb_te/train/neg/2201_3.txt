Horror / science fiction is ridiculous. F / X is pretty good ... for what you can see. The most notable of them is the TV thriller. Jeffrey Coombs is a false scientist who combines Stem Kell Research and manages a Hammerhead Shark's human DNA, even though it is bad. The killing of horrific results gives birth to a hell of a machine. A team of scientists led by William Forsyth and Hunter Tie has been invited to a remote island to check a bright new experiment. Of course, after laughing and boring ... the creation of the revision, his own son is gone with a Hammerhead, leaving his father to hunt one of his colleagues. Revenge is not always a gift. Also in the cast: Elcy MÃ¼ller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velier Bineau.
