This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Acting was poor and the storyline was almost impossible to understand. Whether you're lights or not, any ships are irrelevant for that matter. This film does not have any special effects. While the entire film crew is on the boat in rough seas rather than in a studio, some men are "cut out" (you can also call it) their responses are not entirely true. The guns are quieter than a mute. How this picture puts two serious awards in the human mind state of the two awards. Well about it. This review is very fun to read than movies. If someone looks at it or buys it, I strongly oppose it for obvious reasons. I said I have a spooner. There is a possibility that a few people have been stabbed and a gunfight may be given to a plot. I think it is only good parts of the film.
