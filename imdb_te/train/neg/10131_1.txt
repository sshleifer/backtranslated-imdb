Well, I can query the question for once and for all: 'What's the worst image ever made?' It is co-starring and co-written by Fury Flight, Steven Seagal. There are definitely very bad movies, but this one takes a cake so that it takes a very serious look. <br /> <br /> Let us see how far we want to go to Romania. With Bollywood. This is not the intellectual and talented Steven Seagal completely disconnected. <br /> <br /> The movie is very bad, it seems to be a violation after literally and you do not know where to close and close the shower's corner. (Why can not I imagine) and I suspect that we should wear gear to protect the crew of DVDs and receive regular counseling.
