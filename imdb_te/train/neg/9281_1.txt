Only the Antichrist was behind such a disaster. This sarcasm feels only the inspiring power behind the "motion picture"! The film is very bad, and it forced me to register with IMDb, and in the end I was worried. It makes this movie even more tragic, it has a great book! <br /> <br /> I've never seen it as a film that gives me less than the sum of its parts. <br /> It may seem unclear, but I want to start with the score. The proud owner of a musical degree, must enter my anger! I was torn between laughter and powder heavy as John Sheffer listened to Goldsmith's amazing score; It is more intimidating than horrific death scenes, and is almost unexpectedly jokes. It's the most inappropriate score I've ever heard so far, I can not really think it's the worst. <br /> For the plot ... I'm sorry. New Age Spirituality ??? What happened to the sandy reality of the original trilogy? Most of the films (the first two, but still more than the third!) Have been suggested to the episode, and the films are very diverse. Here we go with plenty of crystals black (all Skeksis and mystics !!) and inverse crucifixes, although in some scenes crucifux is perfectly normal but for the camera angle. Our collective mind has a refined mental manipulation with a characteristic illness: a repulsive "slap in the face" of the recycled clich√© and transparent incompetence. Say "actress" for that role. Such scenes do not appear to be thankful to the director. <br /> <br /> I have been talking about a lot of movies before. A study on how this train-wreck or most of the waste celluloid disorder does not make a film. Beware of the viewer! If you're lucky, vomiting can stimulate you.
