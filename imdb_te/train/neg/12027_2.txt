I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I was flipping through channels and there was nothing to see. This is one of those films for a moment - what you want to see. - But no matter how bad it is now, you can understand it after twenty minutes that you can not stop it. Between somewhere and being bad somewhere one of those movies is good and very bad, it's just plain bad, it's just valuable to experience the confusion of learning both! Great mid-night charge, only for excellent tennis drag. Logic does not apply because you do not even ask Chad Lowev that no one can say that man is obvious.
