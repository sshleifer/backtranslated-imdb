OK, this is one of the 2 worst excuses 4 is a movie I have ever had a bad luck looking at. Like all other Olsen twins films except the New York Minute, the film does not have any story, plot holes, disgusting acting and evil filming !!!!!!!!! I'm still unexpected and I hate Mary Kate and Ashley !!!!!! I was really bored and there was nothing else. I'm surprised that the twins now stop the same stereotypes of the stupid adventure that they are unbelievable in the exotic area and save the day with the help of two cute guys who immediately killed them at home. At least they have a person 4 1 or they both fall to the same person. The plot in this story is very vague and plain mute. Even the Toddlers could see the shortcomings. But they should break up and begin to portray individual or movies with a different kind of story. Anyone who liked this movie does not have any confession - really stupid, really artificial or no good movie. Or maybe they are really smart and bad movie options. Either way I would not recommend this movie to my worst Nemesis for good cinematic experience. That's fine only 4 laughs some ribs at good efforts. It's nice if you laugh. Basically I give 0 or less.
