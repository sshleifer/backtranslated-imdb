European Vacation (or National Lampoon's European Vacation) is weak in vacation films (the highest in the first and third films). Chevy Chase and Beverly de Angelo Clarke and Ellen Grisswold (with new actors in the Rice and Audrey Griswold roles), during which they give a weaker script with a very bad conversation. This causes the passing to hurt, jokes are not so funny. To be more specific, the reason for the killing of the film is that "jokes" are merely a cobbled-together script, rather than offering a central story relating to 3 external films). Oh well, they can not win them all. 10 to 4.
