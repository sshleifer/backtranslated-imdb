"Kids Like" may be a good image given to this topic. But instead it's going to be lower, which became a low-level, mill-TV-movie of the week. Acting is old, plot is imaginable and directionless. For a better film on the same topic, try the awesome "Le Hauteme Jour", a movie that really asks people about down-syndrome. In "Kids Like This" they just use a need for weepy pity. Pretty terrible. 1/10
