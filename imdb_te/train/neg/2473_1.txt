My grandmother would make a better figure than this one if they made movies ... unbelievably bad ... the main characters (mother, father and son) are okay. Specifically the mother proves to be a nice actress and kid is a nice one with special scenes where even he wants to get scary. But the director knows the meaning of the terms of the word bar, triller and good script. The suspense was the subject of the script being not any intimate atmosphere. If you like to follow the trees, perhaps enjoy it, stay at home and sleep. Oh ... the fact is something funny: since the film 2001 was not too bad (because we were in the small dv) and cars were so bad (like the 70s and 80's).
