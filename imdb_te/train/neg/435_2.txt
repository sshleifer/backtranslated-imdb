Old intellectual discussions about what he thinks about art in movies. You'll get your hitchcock, your chaplin, your bergman and some other stuff before the 80s. <br /> <br /> Today, he throws in the Matrix without hiding what's going on in cinemas. <br /> <br /> But it is not the same lapse-film-speech. This speech will be reduced to outdated mental testimony: it-ego-super ego, anal step, sexual inability. <br /> <br /> The cheese has been decorated with editions of editing to the movies that he takes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br On the screen, last night, or in the words of a great filmmaker: <br /> <br /> (Zizek), you're just one of the biggest idiot things I've ever heard. At any time in your ramble, the involuntary response is even closer to anything that is considered rational. Everybody in this room has Dumbler for listening now. I will give you (two) points (only), and God may have mercy on your soul.
