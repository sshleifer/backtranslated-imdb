<br /> <br /> ******************** ******************************************** ************************************************** ************************************************** <br/> Young and wealthy add executive, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck ) Believes that Christmas should not be alone. (And from the outset, the underlying issue with our suspension of disbelief in this idiot film: Drew's social home in 2004 is a fifty-dollar prostitute of whether one is truly alone or half the family or spending a family or spending?) Studio line Discovering that he is buying a family to spend Christmas, as his own actress, his money For a $ 250,000, a narrow suburban truck driver Tom Walko (James Gondolphini) and his unfortunate wife Christine (Catherine Hara), Drew's temporary family, from them The protests were the son, Brian (the very size of Josh Sukerman) and daughter, Alicia (very soft-eyed Christina apples Gate). Drew then spends the rest of his youth captured - something. Messages in this movie are distorted and irrelevant. Drew plasterers filled with overtorous psyches had a fake smile on his face and Bludley refused to deny every denial, and he certainly wanted to buy the Volko family. <br /> <br /> Question: How can he be mentally regrets some of the happiest family emotions, how can he enjoy happiness between his barbs and mental anguish depending on his existence? This is not a case for the Valko family hiding their true feelings and drolling around Drew - all three of the four hates him. Does not he realize that his money does not buy him "truth" in the first place to teach him the "family" environment? Like all movies, the four * screenwriters make a difference in the film, in their own epic dreams appearing in the credit sequence, they lose any reluctance of proximity or intelligence. Deus Begalove: Mike Mitchell, the director of the male gigolo *, stop there. <br /> <br /> Gondolphini and O'Hara have somehow shine with their molecules in this mess. Cristina Applegate is bizarre and cutesy, elegant and fiery in all the right places, after which the corpse is cut into small pieces for the movie, and then the girl falling in love with her face and the script tells her. <br /> <br /> I could not go to say that Ablek was a bad actor, but John Shinair looked better on his shoulder. There is a new level of talent demanding in the town.
