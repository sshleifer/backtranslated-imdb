Well this film is awesome awful. I'm sorry for the actresses involved in this project because I'm sure they did not write their lines. It's sometimes a little surreal, believing that this film can not be ignored, or anyone who looks at the monster slazer who is beating this bad thing. I can not help when looking at this "living creature", I think it is not a high budget or competent author of the band. But, if you'll be happy to go into watching this for a laugh, the film is shameless even because I can not see how anyone can see this and can not be proud of sending this film directly to DVD clich√©d Wanna Movie Film Festival in Action thriller / Horror.
