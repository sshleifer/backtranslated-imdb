Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I'm excited when I bought my ticket for Syria. Being a thriller-lover, I want to see the first fast moving and breathing film, smiling in international policy decisions and taking the relationship between oil, energy and corruption from the latest perspective. Well, I almost left the picture in the middle. The pace is very slow, almost all the stories are stereotyped, the interaction made by logic very difficult, but Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, and you do not care. <br /> Save your money, save your time, and select another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
