Note every mad scientist everywhere: If you turn your son into a genetically modified monster, you should give him a more psyche than "Paul". I do not care if he is a mouthful and dirty hawker head shark with dagger-sharp teeth in a mouthpiece and water as well as the ability to attack dry ground. Give the kid a more valuable name, such as "Thor," "Rock," or "Tiburon". Because he eats me I probably just sit there just smiling, "h! Get this load! Paul monster pieces can not afford me !!!!!" The worst part about this film is that the shark is referred to as "Paul" throughout the movie. It does what may be better, the horror horror movie just looks silly. There are no other campy and contrived parts "Hammerhead Head: Shark Frenzy." Scientists spend the entire movie on the island, and the girls suddenly starts to mock the madness from walking in the dense forest, and pour the water on her feet to reduce itching, "Paul" comes out of the water and kill her. The SCFI channel has been placed correctly in this movie. But there is a small silver lining in an otherwise frustrating image.
