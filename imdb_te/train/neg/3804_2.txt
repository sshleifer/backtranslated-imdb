It is a poor picture of any standard. The story in the match point is a specific conspiracy, and is directed and written and a specific glamor (Woody Allen combines his own culture of classic English murder and exploring what it can do). <br /> Scoop, but none of these. It is poorly written, the two leads are hellfire and there is no interest in the story. <br /> <br /> It requires some kind of subculture with the intriguing explanations and tie-ups (why are Tarot cards and keys locked under French horns in locked rooms?). <br /> <br /> Allen's delightful and witty variety of Hollywood genres (Jade Scorpion / Purple Rose of Cairo etc.) gave us much pleasure. Even the ending of Hollywood came with a great central idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration left him this time.
