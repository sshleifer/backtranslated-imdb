Is this film banned in England? Why? <br /> <br /> The film has the basics of a good 70's or early 80s horror film. Good looking girls (by the way, can not save their lives), a horrific lightning storm a torrential downpour, a tall scythe, a crazy brother wandering around the family estate, and indeed a beautiful damn good twist. Banned? Seriously. When the English parliament banned the film, the Italians laughed their collective donkeys, perhaps how to push back and bridge. <br /> You may have a total of two minutes dedicated to violence and gore. It's too small). There is no nudity but sexual harassment is sexually explicit, obviously. <br /> <br /> If the filmmakers have a good budget to work, I want to see what happened. As it stands, the film is fun, but lack of image and sound quality will take away from the final result. <br /> Forbidden ... no joke ...
