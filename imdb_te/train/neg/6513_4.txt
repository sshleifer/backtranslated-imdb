I will have more than 20 root drains to go through this film again. Terror Prince, Miles Berkowitz, has been down for about two hours in my life, this cynical duplicate-cool. This is the only fun thing in the whole mess is Mr. Samaha's bad-of-camera flag about tits and donkeys. Berkowitz takes a great feeling and takes it into the dust. It will be obscured and badly, in a clear effort to make it feels experiential or funny. It's not. I rarely feel that the film (or tape) is not waste, but it deserves this difference. If an image suggests that this film has been seen, run.
