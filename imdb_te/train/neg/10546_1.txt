<br /> <br /> I recently saw this mess in my movie program and thought it was awful as I said in my tagline: It's awesome and simple, I feel the cinematic fan and the cinema. If I want to see a documentary at Cannes Festival, I'll see A & E ... and they will be more targeted. <br /> I do not recommend this. <br />
