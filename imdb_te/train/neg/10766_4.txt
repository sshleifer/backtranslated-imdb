It is known to be a well-directed director for anyone who watches Tom's Child Eaters. Let's not have a case with so many hands in the pot (telephil someone?) And the second feature is a case of jitters. The characters are over a dimensional and used. The scene is magnificent but the Pacific Northwest displays beautifully. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is good. Completely out-of-the-shot, the images are crisp and beautiful. <br /> Technically the film is as they come out - it's not just a heart.
