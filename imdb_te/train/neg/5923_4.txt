From the border, young father Owen Moore goes to join the Union Army. Shortly afterwards, Confederate soldier Henry B. Waltal is separated from his code and driven to the property of the enemy and desperate for water; He discovered a supplier where the youngest daughter of the Union was sitting in Gladys Egan.

From a sweet, short story Griffith. Location footage and humanity are displayed in love. <br /> In Border States (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Waltal, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
