I brought this film from the library. <br /> I would have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is very bad in this movie, it is very painful to see the scene with her. She is a beautiful girl, but in this film, she is not seductive at all, but I would witness her awkward effort to come up with almost all the other main characters. <br /> <br /> The dialogue of this film is very serious, and does not contain the humorous fact that is acceptable. <br /> Completely Failure.
