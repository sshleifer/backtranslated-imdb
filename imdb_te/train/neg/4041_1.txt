Dressed in a hair shirt. Undoubtedly, obviously, the shadow of a doubt is always one of the worst films. Pure violence. Zero is from the stars of ten. A long, tedious, hardened, acting, self-conscious, theatrical, and another heartfelt squirrel scene. With the intention of being dreamy and attractive, the spirit fell, instead, it was morose mesh. <br /> Half-naked, father and son are wiped out as witches and lovers. "Homo-romantic" is pointless, loud and clear. Ok, what's that <br /> <br /> The son is repeated more than once, "Lives of the Saints", "Father abandons love, as God and His Son are in parallel with Christ, all here as great, abominable and extravagant." <br /> <br /> "The Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenove, "Fathers and Sons"; <br /> <br / > In English <br /> <br /> This means that you do not have to be Russian to understand this mess. <br /> <br /> It is not possible or compelling either as "Sokirov's Last" and "Russian Ark" (2003). <br /> <br /> His "mother and son" were shot from some distorting glasses, although not interesting. Ekavarnamainadi concealment, it will be done by the beginning of filters from the light brown, which is visible to the sparsarahitanga. A soft-focus haze only adds to the concept of morphine. <br /> <br /> An annoying soundtrack drones do not move like a tape loop. Old radio constantly plays in the background. Russian romantic sadness endlessly "themes based on Tchaikovsky." All the irritating sounds, radio static, sounds, distortions and "designs." The emphasis on the presence of "sound designer" (Sergei Moskov). <br /> It's hard to believe that someone (Sergei Potopolov) actually wrote this thing. <br /> <br /> The boring actors are sophisticated, and there is nothing to do without being nothing but traffic is uniform. <br /> <br /> Modern art now relies on the subject without matter. The idea of ​​thinking, the shell is empty, but the shell itself, just the shell's idea. Can you ask for a better definition of a decline?
