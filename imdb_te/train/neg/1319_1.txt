Perhaps someone heard about Alberto Tomba. A former police, a former sky champion, and, now, a terrific actor. "Alex L 'Ariette" was planned as a TV "mini serial", but Italian television refused to show a movie on its channel. Now it's me, the funniest movie. The script is just as happy (it is a dramatic film), something like a 5-year-old kid. But really it is acting in the myths away: Alperto Tomba, who actually does not believe as a cop, plays a terribly entirely silly role: the special special operations Italian police to open the smash doors! ("ariete" is "ram"). This super-guy seeks to marry a young girlfriend (a real Italian "small" TV showgirl, singer Eros Ramazjoti): acting is good but totally ineffective. Do not lose one of these and make yourself a favor. Image of insult to the Italian film industry: John Travolta in Earth Attack
