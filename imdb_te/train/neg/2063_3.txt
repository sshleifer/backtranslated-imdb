When I heard how the film was so fun, I eventually rented it. <br /> The video store and I have laughed 3 times in 75 minutes. <br /> <br /> The collection of skill in the television is fun. <br /> <br /> The impossibility of confusion. <br /> <br /> SNC Skits for the past few years <br /> Yes, Chevy Chase is in this but everything is <br / <<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a matter of time.
