Bourne is again a sub-standard piece from season one. It deals with reincarnation and does not just fly. I have never been big on rebirth and will be part of my apathy towards this episode. It refers to the Tooms case which is some good continuation from the previous episode. But the positive ends there. It's unfortunate because it happens at the beginning of the episode. I think it is ridiculous that the dead person chooses rebirth in the body of the totally unrelated girl. The girl will wait for eight minutes to begin a sharp revenge. There is no confusion of witty Mulder & Scully dialogue to protect the episode. If you enter the reincarnation, this episode will be narrow for you. If you do not, then you can learn what bradycardia is.
