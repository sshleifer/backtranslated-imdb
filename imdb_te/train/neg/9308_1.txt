This film is definitely the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life, and I've seen some pretty bad movies. I do not like the way I shot this film. It does not seem to all actors, and although a group of friends came together and decided to film their own film. But it's definitely terrible. I have never seen a worse picture. The story is very fake, and I realized that the film took a long time to finish. There was no plot, and they were not planned before filming began. The story is very strange. I do not like how slow it is to get the image's position. There is no point in filming this film. If you're watching this movie, you should not. You're wasting your time.
