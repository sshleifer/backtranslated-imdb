<br /> <br /> The story has made our character Chrisi, a 'youth'. In fact she was too small to move the story, so I did not surprise her attention to her relatives. It's a pity, Chrissy looks like an interesting character. <br /> The story is imaginative and sometimes very formalized. So the question is, is we going to watch the camps, jackson's and tamomori's breaking ground with the inspiring, inspiring, cinematic-telling stories for two hours? <br /> <br /> Technically, a nuisance was filmed.
