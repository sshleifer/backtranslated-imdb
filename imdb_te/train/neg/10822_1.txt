Jane Eyre is one of the great novels in the English language and the protagonist read it. I hate when writers use Spark Notes for a novel. This movie may not be able to see if you read the book. <br /> <br /> The 'red room' total down so wonder why they are putting it into trouble. The book 'Red Room' is preceded by the WHOLE story and the rest of Zen's lives. Helen Burns is treated badly in the film, I'm glad to die and die. In the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she is not the red head. <br /> <br /> I read the story and read the film, as Charlotte BrontÃ« remarked.
