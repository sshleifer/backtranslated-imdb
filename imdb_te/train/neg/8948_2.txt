The 'seventeen-eighty four' government portrays a prestigious society in which the government controls everything and no one can trust. This is a very dark picture, and one that does not make you feel good about yourself. It is a romance and love of the community in this society is self-centered about betrayal and human nature. The film has some good ideas and works well with the dark tones in the color (differing in the bright colors of dreams and dreams) and the general feel of loneliness through objects and people and places. However, despite the film's intelligence in portraying this idea, the film was very slow and did not get the idea across. It's just a story that seems to be a very clever time.
