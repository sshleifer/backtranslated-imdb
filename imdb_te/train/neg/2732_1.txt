I was happy when 'My Dja Wu, My Dua Wu' was broadcast last season. The scrubs, I thought, were doing something brilliant and unique in relation to the concept of clip show. <br /> <br /> "After a season, they had to make almost all the comic strips, and lost the clip performance." It seems like the work experience was a kid, and it's not as good as the 'My Long Goodbye' will not appear again after some 4 episodes of Dr. Cox's shaved head, which shows how lazy to keep the editors together.The sequel of a well-built sitcom <br /> <br /> It reminds me of the episodes that were last broadcasted last year. <br /> <br /> The three second clips incorporating the background music, (a) the extra DVD to the rainy day, Not the episode of prime-time television.
