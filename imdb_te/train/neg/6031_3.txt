It's been a while since the first time, so I saw again with the second film in the series. I recognize the 3rd movie I have not yet seen, and under the original title I will review it. <br /> <br /> From the product value, screenplay and movie making perspective, this film fails at many levels, although this is some success. What can you expect from a low budget, "b" movie? Not much, and it works from the perspective of the product. However, this work is definitely confusing, the character is a bit less in development ... exactly as I expected when an agenda for a movie. I do not have a problem with acting ... the cast is great; Nevertheless, the screenplay in both films gives a little chance to really lose their role. The film is "Christian" because it is imaginable because you can not generally portray the violent confusion of "End Times" because they do not break the ethics that are usually associated with Christianity. In other words, the G-rated movie is the right thing to do in this case, even though it is quite conservative in the biblical narratives, any measurement is R-rated. So, if the intention of the film to scare people into the Christian faith, then the picture should be a little scary, right? However, without commentary in the book, or in this case, you can not comment on a movie in a book without commentary on the books. There are plenty of valuable Christian materials to produce in movies ... but the "backward left" series ... and these films are ultimately failing because they are the best marketers and they are poorly written novels based on bad theology. <br /> <br /> The Southern As a Baptist minister, I have acknowledged that these books are guilty pleasures, but I am the last Do the finished books. If I describe them as good fiction and take the opinion of books as a "chance" or commentary on Biblical eschatology ("end time"), then I can live with it. This book divides the Christian circular because it promotes the "literal" interpretation of all the Scriptures on proper hermeneutics. Unfortunately, as I have always said, "Pre-trobe, pre-millennial" exemplary perspective, the powerful God of mankind says, as I have always said, our helicopters And the bombs are his ultimate task Ceyakudadukani many people, especially Christians, who do not have the understanding to think beyond their own views of the world <br /> <br /> We are conservative with respect to the interpretation of the Bible, migilipotunnamu fundamentalist attitude, and it is "the same", the commentary will try to push it through. <br /> <br /> These books are the only means by which the basic theory is to be understood by the need for Christ to get "lost" to understand them, and to understand the Bible. In the second novel I read very clearly (a couple of years ago) a scene that refers to a person who is "left" with a view to the notion of this view. The "true" Christians deserved to be "rapture" may not be possible for another esoterology. <br /> <br /> This is worrying for a number of reasons, because the "rapture" is briefly told in the script and the connection to the realistic and ultimate prophecy is not the best. These books explain how the Christian community is divided and how to portray "true" Christian behavior. In the end, I feel that they want to hold more people to a legitimate faith / religion, but rather to win people towards it. It turns out that all Christians are equally disdened and laughed into satire, despite the fact that there is a philosophical room for the vast diversity of Christian thinking and practice. Overall, as a Christian community, we have suffered enough loss to society in the history of 2000 years ... and there is no need to propagate to millions of others. br> <br /> <br /> "Left Behind" films do not fail because they do not understand movies.
