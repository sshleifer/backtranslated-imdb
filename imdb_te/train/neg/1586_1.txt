Perhaps one of the few people who read Stephen King's book is based on the film. After reading this amazing work, I could not wait to see its image version. After watching the film, I was completely disappointed. The only thing that is common to this movie is the book with the names and names of the characters. In this book, Schwarzenegger's character is put on a game show. The main object is to survive. But he is not a field. He is set to loose in the city and escape the villains of the game show (I guess you'd call them), which certainly does not overlap with cinema roles. The building has created a lot of tension and suspension and ended up with the climax. The image is completely worse. It does not have the quality of the film. I respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he confused it.
