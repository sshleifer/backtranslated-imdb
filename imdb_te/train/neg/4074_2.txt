I was hoping for the same enthusiasm when I was splitting your ghost but how would I call this waste? The guy made my illness while eating his own business. There is no narrative about each of the killings quickly. If you like watching nude or men's parts, there is scarcity in the film and there is also a romantic place in the film, not a romance and a cinema. I've seen some dumb films in my time but this is number 1. I want to see it again. Actors make me bored in the movie, so they probably need a lot of money to make this movie.
