Tom Hanks without doubt the highlight of this film to me. As Mike Sullivan, he certainly acted against the genre and said that he could manage an unparalleled (his) role. Hanks is a good person in a movie in general - you like, to admire and to root. Sullivan is definitely not a good man. In the context of the film he is somewhat superior - he retaliated for the murder of his wife and younger son. However, he is already gangster and murderer before the murders. <br /> <br /> Hanks has played a role that I do not expect, and he pulls it out. Sunnivan has evolved into a gangster - much more interesting about the complex relationships raised by Rooney, which is problematic (for some time I do not know where it goes) (Paul Newman), who is a sort of mob owner, and his own two sons to raise and talk " "Trying to keep up; He is separated from his business. After the murder of an older son, the gang attempts to kill him to keep him silent, and returns Sullivan and his oldest son (Mike, Jr.) on the run, getting the wrong son (and mother). This turns into an unnatural sort of father / son relationship film. <br /> It is somewhat darker throughout the hopeful (at least in the entire context of the story), but the mood is strengthened in many scenes in the dark and torrential rainfall. While I admire Hanks' performance, I agree, the film is 4/10 overall
