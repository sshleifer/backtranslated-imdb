The film is unsatisfactory. It begins with multiple random blasts and then talks to audiences (this is because filmmakers can not get direct actors.) It's all one of my friends selling this rare video sold in a selling store I found this a very rare video, with print B-movies, and he made it for the sole purpose of making it fun It was not neecessary, but our intervention was not neecessary. <br /> <br /> I thought that Ed Wood's "Plan 9 from Outer Space" was a cheesy movie, but it overcame Japan / Lego cars / sack leathers. If you ever watch this movie, buy it without hesitation, it's rare and very good, very good laughing.
