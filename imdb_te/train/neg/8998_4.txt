Stephen Feinberg, a protolist, was one of the authors of the film, disappearing in early 2006. In 1993, I met Steve in Portland, and he was the author of Hollywood years ago, mostly working on TV promos. He asked me not to see 'Tunnel Vision', but it was too late, I had already seen! When I was released, I saw years earlier. At that time I did not think it was good for a movie. Yet it has been a bit different from my opinion as an adult. Yes a bit active is dated as well. Steve agrees it's not a very good movie. He said the 'Practologist' sketch was a little pleased.
