I loved Tom Robins books, so I'm very excited and I'm curious to see one of his books later. I know there is no way to capture the half of the movie Robbins magic, but after watching the film, I want to read the book again. The film also does not have the eighth book of Cowgirls Get the Blues and is more concerned about the love connection between Bonanza Jelliebeen and Sissy than anything else. In addition to a very weak storyline in the film, I think the good actors have chosen to play the roles. In their five-minute clip at the beginning of the book, Julian's friends, the only actors in the film that portrayed their characters that fit Robins explanations in the book. Those who do not read the book can enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robins fan, the film is not only disappointing.
