Nacho is very famous in Spain. He is a bad man suffering from illness ... is very embarrassing. Nacho made some commercials on TV, and I remember looking for Nacho for Paul McCarney around Madrid (the trade is about a McCarney CD collection). <br /> <br /> This little movie is like Nacho's business: bad storyline, bad direction, and awful performances. I can not believe that there is a frustrating movie in the Kodak Theater. The poor Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Nacho made his wife to his wife. The film's producer 7:35, is well connected with Spanish TV businessmen.
