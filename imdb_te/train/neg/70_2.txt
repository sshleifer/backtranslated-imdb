This film has never been to theaters in our area, so I was the first person to rent it when it became available on DVD. I have heard many critics and have passed in this case. <br /> <br /> The film is very disappointing despite the amazing lines of the actors. Now I see why it went straight to the video. <br /> <br /> I thought I would have some value with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush. The past has done all the amazing work. <br /> <br /> This film is slowly moving and I have never been caught. I had failed to grow up to the characters and had to fight with the desire to speed up to come to the end. <br /> <br /> I feel that the film is only for the purpose of eye candy purposes. It is also not satisfied.
