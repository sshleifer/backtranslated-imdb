I agree that I'm never a Rodney Dangerer fan. In fact, from me he "does not respect." My wife wanted to see it, and I saw only what I expected. A sly story without real humor. <br /> <br /> It is a completely ridiculous plot that revolves around a developer's (Dangerzild) plans to build a ski resort in rabbit, crude jokes and Uther. It just did not get my attention. <br /> <br /> Dangerous The film starred with Andrew Daisy Clay and the weaker cast, including John Bainer (I did not know he was still there until I saw his name in the credits for this name). <br /> <p> This is really a Dangerous Disaster. <br /> <br />
