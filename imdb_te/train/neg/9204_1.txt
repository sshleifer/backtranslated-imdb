I have seen this movie many times (recently read the book based on this movie) and every time I watch, I will kill four of them. They can not recognize the fact that Tom Hank's role outside of the gaming session is moving towards his D & D (ah M & M) :) person ("Oh, he's just acting in the role"). After three months of it and treatment, let's just destroy and feed his illusions! <br /> <br /> Music is the music that says 'cat on the piano' and 'we have hurt us'. Almost enough to fit your teeth on the edge!
