King Macker is undoubtedly successful in Thailand, but this (but elite) 'The Legend of Suriyati' created box office records. Seen Casey, directed by Lek Ketaparporn, is based on the historical fact in 1547. The film has some amazingly beautiful visual elements, but one of the most powerful, pedestrian scripts and storytelling in the film refused. The Portuguese soldier's Fernando de Gama (Gary Stretch) did not leave the vengeance of this father's murderer to sail and capture him into slavery and sit in Ayutaya in the kingdom of Siam and the beautiful Maria (Cindy Burbridge) with the consent of her father Philip (John Rice-Davis) By the name of the story and the past with the story Continues. King's and Fernando and his new Siamese puginist Tong (Dom Hathakul) lost, thanks to some of the grateful CGI art of ill art, the first king earned his bodyguard and Queen Sudachan (Yoy Hassayevichit) to allow his lover Lord Chakragt (Oliver Papat) to rule Siam Her plot to kill the king and son is revealed Magnanimous. Fernando and Tong also fled and condemned to fight each other to protect their families (Tong's wife and children and Fernando's now affectionate love with Maria). <br /> Acting (with the exception of John Rice-Davis) is very weak, which means the film is occasionally camp. The Thai casting fight, mainly due to poor written text, asked us to use their local Thai subtitles. Ian Livingston's musical anthem sounds like the old TV soaps. But if you have that visual illumination, it's worth looking at the film once you are plenty of and then alone. It shows all the special effects and an image that has clear high financial support for the cast and set of masses and its good intentions. It's just the missing basics. Grady Harp
