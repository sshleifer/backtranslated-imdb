The only reason I remember this movie is (and still) because it's time and money is the biggest waste. I am 17 and my friend. We're our age to enjoy a lot of action movies. We went out with a disgruntled feeling that we wanted to withdraw our money back but was not able to get back on time. <br /> <br /> Editing killed this movie. When the vehicle was attacked by heavy vehicles with rocket launchers, the rogue had bad guys in the 4x4 VW bugs shooting rackets in this truck and insulted the audience. Please rockets on a truck carrying plutonium? What's worse is that this is manage to get off a 4-rocket launcher's 15-18 shots of VW's. You'll see 4 of them in VW with 4 racket fire, finally cut the trick and burn two racquets after it, and then the truck going forward and it's done again. <br /> <br /> Never before We had hoped for a big end. <br /> They just stopped coming out of the money. <br /> <br /> Just ridiculous.
