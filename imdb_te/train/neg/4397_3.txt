One of my sisters gave me this game, and it's so gruesome! It has the look of a child's play, but you have to learn how to tons of complex movements that need to twist your hands into all sorts of difficult positions, and to improve your 'score', you have to search for endless endless levels for 100 notes! You also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces, which are necessary to make things almost impossible to get them! And I STAGE THREE ONLY !!!!! If you ever have life NAD all the time you might get some pleasure from this, but keep it away if not! And it's not perfect for kids - they put their hair in the week!
