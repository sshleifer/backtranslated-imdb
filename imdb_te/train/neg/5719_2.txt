This movie is pretty good like a hostel, except for BAD * acting and a lot of suspense. There are gore elements, but you do not really feel anything for the characters, violence is not very effective. Some of the pieces are strange ... someone's snake is forced into the throat. What's with it Is it scary or scary? It's just stupid type. Of torture, there is really nothing (unless they initially hit a person who did not show it). Saying that the main evil person is "slowly dying", the butcher will kill them very fast. Deaths are relatively quick. Yes, I saw the version of "unspecified". So, overall, the worst gore image that I've ever seen, but at all good either. If you skip this, nothing will be lost.
