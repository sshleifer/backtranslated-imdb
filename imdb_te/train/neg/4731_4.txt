An attempt to bring Elvis Presley into the modern day, but with a sexy little shower scene and a fake playboy magazine subplot, the presses move around the same old cai, cliching. A woman E.P. On the beach and then continues to take over his life - and he does not seem to care! Dick Sargent is in another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallie (!) Try hard as Elvis' two bosses (he moonlighting, you see). Some of the songs are "Almost Love In", most importantly, but if you want to see a loose, hipper, see Elvis's sex-comedy updated - see the rest areas. When Elvis and his fatal attraction come into bed together, the wooden table is in their midst! Get true. ** from **
