I saw the lake cabin in the afternoon in the USA. The sequel is very keen to see that the film was made for TV. So, I was tuned for this evening's airing and was very disappointed. I knew I did not like the movie, but I did not expect myself to be disturbed by using the DV (digital video). It's not for these films that seem to come from somewhere, it's so much fun. I thought the plot line should be linked to these shots, but there is no logical explanation. (Warning: a spoiler for Melbourne)! The open end in the cabin through Lake has been approved, but the open finish on the sequel is ridiculous. Even if there is no film, I can only see the infomercials at 4 am when the lake looks back to the cabin.
