This was very bad because it was written so badly that the writer of Madison County bridge writer Robert James Waller. This work is bad because the plot is perfectly complete and the dialogue is wood and the inexpensive. An unsuccessful couple leaving an eunuch partner for her killer, to show the scenes of the murderer, a beautiful Mexican woman who has an American American writer and a shrewd Mexican woman, a strong, self-directed criminal, and some stunts (more alarmingly violent) As bad as he is, she looks more clearly than anyone else Ndi. The film was unsuccessful as Scott Glen's killer, not the glamorous Latinism of Giovanni Zakaria as Luz, and not the rigid performance of Harvey Keitel as a CIA specialist to track down the killer. Time is serious waste.
