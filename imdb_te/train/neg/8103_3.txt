This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It does not matter what critics say, it's bad. I feel this problem with a novel novel. It's not inefficient; It's 99% of his work, it's proud and overdrawn. He falls in love with him, his characters come in like navy-looking, and his novels are fraudulent. I read a lot of his writings (his socialist realist poetry is also terrible) - I did not understand what Fuss was about. Characteristics (such as self-absorption) in his novel are angry and readily utilized. In a picture, I have all the things that are reluctant about Kandera. Maybe I missed something, but I do not think so. One side note, I can not believe that this is a Criterion Collection DVD. No need for this film.
