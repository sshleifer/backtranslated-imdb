Deathstock is directed by John Watson, which plays Ruck Hill, who is a kind of body builder, and I know it is well known. Deathstocker (Hill) tries to pull back from the evil lord and he has to travel to the Lord's cave. He meets several dwarfs and giants during his journey, and the settings are very close to Tolkien and Conan Barbarian. This is a split of Conan's huge success, and although this is a very intelligent movie, it has very good trash lurzes and is recommended to cope with trash fans and movie junkers! The greatness in the film. The couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and lovely, but concentration to show Deathstalker, nude females and Hill's huge muscles. Women are usually helpless victims and very stupid, too, so this is a very macho film and so many feminists can not please! Combat scenes are unique and are not pretty dull, and demons are not unique. And all the other elements of the film are also made too absurd and bad, but did you expect from a low budget effort like this? It tries to be as great as Conan, but pretty badly fails. As I mentioned, it may interest the Turkish movie fans, but nobody is. <br /> <br /> The death is still not good, and as a turkey movie, I'm enjoying the other turkeys, of course, of course appreciate this! If bad movies are your cup tea, try this and have fun, but if you do not understand "enjoyable bad movies" then stay away. And if someone does not have a big amount of nudity, then stay away. There is more nudity than violence, and due to these scenes, the film has an R rating. Otherwise it might be a safe family PG family! <br /> <br />
