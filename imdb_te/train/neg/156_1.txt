An animated series should be performed because it is like an image that looks like an old anime on acid. The film just starts somewhere and her boyfriend with a cloud or something that people fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself. This princess is a god or an angel but it is enough that this flying air comes with a bad guy and the guy with the razor wings does not either have either the plot of the other god or the devil / wizard thing or you have to be insanely clever to get this picture. The plot follows this Chinese moral that is known by this god to fight the evil guy immediately killing the princess, and immediately we have a mountain or something weird Wolf Boll directed as a full-blown dance scene like a fierce martial arts scene. Even some of the visuals are weird that they are amazing and colorful but I'm going to say they are unclear and the acid trip (yes it's a word!) I saw it with dubbing and subtitles, and both were bad and understandable ... I can never understand who? Some start watching the comic series 5 at no 4 or how the total time I missed because some of the 1980's anime's episode 30 was watching and the story began or totally I had no clue about how to get started with this topic. Honestly, it could be one of the worst movie experiences, like the look of the Inu-Yasha at the 134 episode episode ... Yes it does not know what hell you are. The brain is trying to figure this out.
