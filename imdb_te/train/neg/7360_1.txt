This is one of the worst action films I've ever seen. It is actually very inefficient (especially when it appears that someone is talking through a wire or a scene, as it is acting as a bank loan officer, but it does not mean that scientists are safe to enter a room, but it does not mean that it has never been found), cheap sets The bank is even worse S visible) and bad acting. This is a story of an organized criminal group that has been stolen by a capsule of successful malignant virus. However, the head of the bank will drop down the Bank Security Deposit Box Honecko at the same time the bank robber is going down, as well as information from the FBI agents, while a terrible earthquake has occurred. Needless to say, the earthquake is worse in more than one way. However, the results are made for a fascinating action movie, but instead, the film is clearly z-grade waste from the start. (Perhaps some extracting the screen from the various sequences of the film's packaging form that is created with computer graphics rather than the actual screen captures). I do not know what Ron Perlman is doing in this. I'm surprised to see that as I see it.
