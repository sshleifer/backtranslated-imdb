Others can appreciate by watching Bilal by other works, the film is well appreciated, which will fail in a major way. It does not stand on its own. This theme is a mishmash. Here begins an idea with a definite story. Then make icons around it. We start with two different comments, some as a human being, a "god" judged for some reason, but one last event on earth, and beyond the boundaries of this mysterious John character "resort". Why? None of these questions are answered. But do we care? Suppose we have any role in the story, we have taken Jill and then we can look forward to improving. Unfortunately the movie is very impressive in the overall view (which, this), but at the expense of inspirational development. I would like to see a little more from this point and rewrite the person who does not think that every image should be in the picture.
