While the film may have been an interesting character study and given some insight into its subject, the real problem with this film is nothing. It does not give any understanding or solutions to the problem. It is just the role of the 'old' male sex addict and the problems that each day create for normal life and family. Do you want to see it? It is completely understandable and meaningless. <br /> <br /> It does not help the main character to be some dirty 50 years old. You have a hard time recognizing him and having sympathy. He is like Dirty Old Playboy, a continuous hunt for woman and sex. He has sex with all kinds of sexually molesters 3 times a day with different women and not only with prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It does not have a bad visual style, even if it is a bit forced. But it is better than other live-video-video productions. If the filmmakers give better information to work, who knows that the film will be a good faith. <br /> <br /> The stories in this story really make fun of you. There are really some nonsense story lines that are often more ridiculous than they are obvious. I'm talking about the entire Ordell plot line example. Things get worse once the movie ends with ending. <br /> <br /> The protagonist's sinner's sessions are considered a bit cheap and simpler with his psychiatrist, along with the protagonist's hero. This is not just one of them. <br /> It's no better or worse than any other random straight video clip with similar concepts. <br /> They are weird and very exciting, they are a simple little product of Nastassa Kinsky and Ed Begley Jr. <br /> They are really frustrating for work and money. <br /> <br />
