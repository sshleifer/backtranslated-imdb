I am very scared of this film. Arrogant and irresponsible, which gives Columbia a sketch of controversy, so it is a disgrace for the Colombians. Fanny Mickey (who looks right from the Burton nightmare) to Diaz with a great deal of effort to bring a life to a character, from Berariáno, Girijes (her nude scene is totally bad), shows -deminal, so-called cliché and so badly written There is a mustache. Thanks to the end of the edition, the gourfest making ed Wood is so cheesy. It all works, cinematography, art direction, costumes, makeup, editing and all direction failing, George Ali Triia is always a secular filmmaker, but has some respect for his previous films. I hope Columbine filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty, integrity and responsibility with this intention, but I can not tell you better about these waste.
