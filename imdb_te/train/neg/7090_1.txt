I was sleeping on my bed at 7:35 pm last night watching Larry Saunders (I usually DirecTivo it, but it was not last night). I woke up at 3 am (Investment Banker on West Coast) and was impressed to see it on HBO2. I saw how poor this film is. Seriously. Shocked. So I had to write commentary on IMDB. It's really bad. Writing boring, but directing and editing are just below a freshman at a movie school. <br /> Yes, it burned the video. Mind you, it's shot in the video, not DIGITAL video. It looks like a soap opera. <br /> <br /> Skateboard videos' videos have a more motion picture of this horror feel. <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe poor directing but did not remember anything honestly. Stops shots and blocking. Yes, I've chosen the word 'stupid'. Not extraordinary, not daring, not bolt, just not stupid. People who review this review say, "Give me an example." I'm getting up. It's 3 hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
