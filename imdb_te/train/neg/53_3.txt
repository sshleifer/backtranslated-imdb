I am reading the Kataller, and I am glad to see El Art, who is mostly Catalan talk with my Art House Video Store. <br /> <br /> It is not pleasant to see it. <br /> Yes, as other critics have said, this is well made and beautifully taken. Though the child's opening sequence is intimidating and violent, it is well acted and convincing. (For the most part, ie ... a corpore strip made for burial in the center of town square, in the full view of the manorquins dead man's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well .. small details. At this time, Spain has something of a Maya-non-Pan's Labyrinth set in the Civil War. <br /> <br /> Fast forward and three children from the early incident arrived. Age. Francisca is a tuberculous health worker and a nun working with two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both patients. <br /> I know that most Spanish movies (apologies for the Almodovar fans), the characters with an exception (Francisca) are just dang * strange * but hay. Their motivations, individuals and conversations are often incompatible. <br /> What else are you doing, it can lead to some horrible violence. Be ready for the burden of pain and blood. It is a tracker that is a "potboiler". If it happened 40 years ago, the poster said: Look boldly LOVE !! Rape !! Murder !! Disability !! Foolishness !! Animal cruelty !! Betrayal !! <br /> <br /> The starting lineup is almost insufficient to do the personalities and relationships of reliable characters. To work, there are many flashbacks to the meat from these characters. Meanwhile, there is a tremendous and discouraged cross between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction". If you look like everything, enjoy everything. <br /> For Catalan, this is much different than Barcelona, ​​the Mallorca dialect, which is different for me. The dialect, although I was also amazed, the Bertonanas also made clear that the Catalan subtitles were understood.
