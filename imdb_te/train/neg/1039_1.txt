<br /> <br /> This is one of the most terrible things I've seen. <br /> <br /> Please help and avoid this inconvenience. <br /> <br /> The scales that swing and receiving the camera are not counted as "direction", the film is needed in droves. Writing is not all spectacular, rather we are left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in a very insidious way (a gift duplicate documentary "style that does not know how to direct it). </ P> <br /> Film making <br /> <br /> It's just terrible, it's sunda HPV and Victor Vargas, said a lot of what was presented there.
