After Life was a miracle, I did not expect much. It is hard to believe that these films were made by Do You Remember Dolly Bell. Javate made two hours scenes without any narrative. The forest and unbridled humor of the underground seems to have descended into the pathetic buffoonery here. Black Cat, White Cat, I think it was great, but already has some disturbing signals of dementia, after which he began producing life-proof comics, that kasturika is going to go deeper and deeper. I liked my first movies, and it was especially frustrating watching something like this. Let's hope his next one will be great.
