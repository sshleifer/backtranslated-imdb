Love to Kill (Hong Kong, 1993), Billy Chung Sue Hung (1993 Bloody Kaddy film Assassin), was one of the strongest products of the category III Boom in the HK Movie at the beginning of the nineties. It has strong sexual, nudity and torture images, more or less grateful and shock is valuable. <br /> <br /> HK Psycho Anthony Wang (from the award-winning Untold Story by Hermann You from the same year)) plays a businessman and his wife (Elizabeth Lee Mei Mei Fang) as a husband who loves rape and rape. Danny Lee, a popular police character like Billy Tang (and Lee's co-directed) and John Carey (The Killer (1989), however, finds the problem and begins to defend the wife and son but Anthony does not naturally like this at all, and During the rain storm the general ultra average leads to enthusiasm and into the graphic end. To make money when these films are so popular, only a portion of exploitation can be done almost entirely without any serious profits. చిత్రం మరియు సంఘటనలు పాశ్చాత్య చలన చిత్రంలో ఎప్పుడూ కనిపించనివిగా ఉంటాయి, కనీసం ప్రధాన స్రవంతిలో ఉన్నాయి మరియు పాశ్చాత్యులకు కొన్ని / ఎక్కువ మంది నిషేధితాలు, పిల్లవాడిని చూసిన హింస మరియు విపరీతమైన వ్యంగ్యాలు వంటి ఈ చిత్రాలలో విరిగిపోయినప్పుడు, తరచూ కథానాయకాలను చదవడం చాలా మంది ప్రేక్షకులను జబ్బుపడినట్లు భావిస్తారు మరియు ఈ చిత్రం కోసం ప్రత్యేకంగా సంపూర్ణంగా వెళుతుం  Continues. <br /> <br /> The film is a rather interesting and creepy soundtrack in the tradition of Dr. Lamb, which is still practically all started in 1992. Music and soundtrack is generally interesting in HK films, and adds pictures especially in these terror films. Cinematography is particularly valuable, especially in blue colors and camera lenses (Assassin is also doing) and a stunning storm in the camera is well portrayed. <br /> <br /> Actors and actresses do not make any movie worse by talented and professional actors and their performance. Yet the film has normal HK humor, which makes sick goings on even sicker as some sick "threw up" soup into the soup. There are some jokes about Danny Lee's production and hence never seen in Western "majestic" movies. <br /> <br /> This thing will generally destroy the hoor hher movies. Humor is just a clear way and tries to make the audience and people entertaining. <br /> <br /> The film has many scenes, Wong's wife misuse in various ways. She is subjected to rape and sexual abuse, hitting and kicking her husband. We also get to see some flashbacks from Wong's childhood which is very much murdering his own father and he turns equally violent as he turned his youngest son now. At the end of the film, these flashback scenes and images can accelerate some completely unexpected experiences, such as a completely hilarious experience, and it creates an entirely insane and intimate atmosphere. Something to come up with only HK exploitation makers again. <br /> <br /> At this end, a sudden and shocked plumber lends his ax and adds some nails, for example, with his anger. <br /> <br /> This film also means that my opinion is also genuinely "suspicious" of torture and terror, as I deal with things that should not really be taken as painful and fun, mostly I understand rape. The version I saw (I saw two versions) has a long and totally rape rape scene that tries to keep it as wildly as possible. I'm not sure HK viewers really like these pictures but I feel that somebody does not agree or do something in moral sense in movies / entertainment. Women are very painful and in short ways are cruelty and killed, and men's fate is almost as flawless as females. <br /> <br /> The other version I have seen, newly released DVD subtitles in HK) is a scene of this "table cruelty", which is much higher than the subtitled Taiwanese DVD, which is similar to the HK version. I am different from both the old HK laserdisc and the theories of final credits and images that do not appear in the original image, because the "uncensored" versions are released or shown are theoretically impossible to tell. <br /> <br /> The film is written by La Gaum Fai and La Wing Kin, former Dr. Lamb, The Untold Story and Bandits (Kirk Wong, 1988), but in his other films I've seen, Love to Kill is quite gratuitous. Doctor. Both Lamb and The Untold Story are some of the most brutal and violent, but there is some attempt to some criticism of the authorities and men in general that it may be easier for a person to become a beast when chasing or fighting. The Untold Story's violent torture film, the victim's culprit, is very strong and certainly has its impact on something to be spoiled between society and e.g. But this is nothing but an honest, measured and fastest exploitation produced by Kirk "Organized Crime & Tree Bureau (1993), Crime Story (1993)" Wang ". <br /> <br /> /> <br /> Because I do not have much praise on these films, Kill more than Love 2/10. (HK) The film is meant to be and is much more and like Love to Kill Movies are commercial parasites living between real pieces of art.
