Your heart is constantly broken as a bustster Keaton fan. Most of us faced Keeton from one of the greatest productions of the film: The General, The Navigator, and Sherlock Jnr. We recognize him as the greatest figure in cinema of all time and want to know more about his movies. Heartbreak starts. Following 'Steamboat Bill Jnr', Keaton's brother-in-law Joseph Sheenck pressed him to sign Keaton in a MGM control. Keaton was another nurse, becoming another actor. Then his alcoholism was intensified. After 'Steamboat Bill Jnr', Keaton has never really made the first-rate film ever. The parody of the "Grand Hotel": There are two sources that Keaton said he had to do in MGM. <br /> <br /> Between Keaton's long term steady decline, he just came up with a better image because Heartbreak grows. His little comedy is 'Grand Slam Opera'. I went for footage of Keaton's dramatic scenes in 'It a Mad Mad World' with Spescher Tracy: The Triisi Telephones attempt to replace old retired Crook (Keaton) telephones and Smirr Grogan's money to steal cash. <br /> <br /> 'Forgive', alas, one of Keaton's movies from the beginning of his downfall. MGM Jimmy Durante (incidentally, smiley Grogan has played three decades later) is trying to build a new comedian. Unfortunately, MGM has attempted to build Durante with Keaton and his style is humorous Durante's contradiction. Throughout his career, Durante was a relentless scene-stealing: he knew he was constructed at Keaton's cost, and Keaton was never co-starring Durante. <br /> <br /> Keaton was often a victim of ruthless machinations. In 'Speak Easily', he received a letter claiming a $ 750,000 inheritance to travel to New York City, where he plays a postage and ridiculous Midwest college professor post (he is like a wood) receiving a message to travel to a New York City. Is he calling a phone call to verify this? Does he also check postmark? No; He takes his life savings from the bank and goes to New York. As soon as he went, the man's manservant of the admission he admits (fake) is the letter that the professor posting out of his professor post! <br /> <br /> 3/4-Millionaire Post, Jimmy Dodge (Durante), despite trying to produce a musical review, has no money. The characters that are playing on the screen of these two excellent comedies are simply mutually exclusive. Keaton is one of the heads of this egg (like Mr. Logic in 'Wiz'), and everyone is intellectually wealthy. Durante plays one of the most unpleasant hepatoces because he is unable to make any direct statement because the script needs to speak in his slang. Durante is trying to talk to Keaton about the money, but instead it comes straight - Durante is to use the slogan words that deal with 'Kale', 'Cartwheels' and so forth. Keaton does not know about Durante of course. I give Keaton credit: his own dry and dirty prairie voice, his flat Kansas assent, is perfect for the role he plays here. <br /> <br /> Sidney Toler, just a year after he's looking more thinner and more beautiful than here, Professor Post is impressed by the revived Directorate of Reveve Bankruptcy (Tick). Henry Armata, I never found anyone funny, it is less fun than usual, offering a stupid payment hog. Thelma Todd attracted me here and played a more villain role in her role as 'Horse Feathers' (a very ludicrous movie). <br /> <br /> One of my favorite characters was Edward Broffie. <br /> <br /> A part of the problem with 'easy to speak' is that the supporting characters act in completely inappropriate paths. Keaton's lawyer appears in Durante's Theater with an emergency message to Keaton ... but he is not there, so the lawyer reveals the first stranger he enters Kathon's personal business. (That Lawyer Buster!) In another scene, Professor Post - Chorus is a musician in the Exchange of Girls' Music Exchange - Blonders Banker, and all chorus girls are immediately squeal and cover themselves. * Modern Koreas girls can not react and I doubt that in 1932, Chorus girls will behave like this ... not in response to the 'angel' that controls the pursestrings of their appearance. <br /> <br /> Spellers Coming Soon. In about half an hour, "Jimmy Durante" meets himself in the piano, grins into the camera, and he starts to play a tune and makes a little shake of his head. It's a long time, and I wanted to get to the end of this film with a fun goal. Oops, no. All the most annoying of the movie is over, which makes use of the most humorous and ridiculous cliche in all comedy: a completely incomprehensible actor who is a star comedian through his own sophistication. <br /> <br /> At the chances of wasting in '' easy to speak ''. Keaton, Durante, Toler, Braffy and Miss Todd Respectfully, I will rate this movie from 10 to 2 points. <br /> <br />
