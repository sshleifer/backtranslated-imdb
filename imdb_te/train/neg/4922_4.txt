The DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that has been continuously shown in Sky Movies in Britain and I thought it was shown three times a week for the entire year. Television Tonight. In fact, I have seen many of the fans of horror films because my theory is that this is my triple. <br /> <br /> I would like to say, <br /> <br /> Dracula 2000 is such a bad movie as the amount of dumb scripting. For example at the beginning of the film the bad guys are flying from London to Dracula's coffin to the United States (in a twin engine turbo prop plane!) And one of the bad guys is left alone in the cargo grip that comes to Dracula's life. A fight breaks out, but there are many people with noise but the bad sound of the cockpit will be heard until the script demands. It appears in the climax of this section that Dracula can control the atmosphere, but this film has been forgotten since the film is developed. Slowy Scripting, and the New Orleans Mardi Gras seems to have a problem with the construction of several scenes, and then the characters in a different position, such as the police station in the following scenes, return later. <br /> <br /> There is something else in my chain - product placement. There are rare scenarios in the full view of the logo for some record label / retailer chains. I have not been able to promote the company brand (except for the national jockey rail company in Britain), but I have published this kind of campaign against the British Broadcasting Guidelines and surprised that the BBC was featured in the 2000s. It's good to see this good looking cast and boy, these vampire chicks are hot, but in the past few years the expectation from Hollywood - very dumb
