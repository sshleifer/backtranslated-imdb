It is the smallest of Gore Fort, based on Stephen King Story. Two tabloid reporters believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) may actually be a bloodthirsty, a long time (Miguel Ferrar) and not-for-profit (Julie Entwistle). This modern day blood saucer than the odd stranger does not naturally wing his way, but through a black cessna he is seeking his victims. Gore gets really gruesome as the film is near its stupid end. Remember that Mr. King did nothing with this movie. It's scary at night.
