<br /> <br /> Although portrayed in English, previous Demons were not considered to be a continuation of the movies, but made for Italian TV. <br /> <br /> It is simply the giant The OGRE that issued the director, Lambertobba. <br /> <br /> The American villa is rented by the Italian villa in the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has a dream of recurring herself as having encountered this cocon-like structure hanging from the roof of the villa's old wine-cellar. It glows and covers in the cobwebs and hangs down from it spider or worm legs. <br /> <br /> "The villa is just stale and creaks and sounds strange in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it. <br /> While the OGRE is also kind of 16th centaury dress <br /> <br /> The movies are not really bad and at least is brilliant without the ridiculously puzzling phrases that bring the dialogue dubbed at least a really cool one. <br /> <br /> The copy of the Sheik DVD I've watched is defective, with a black movie about half an hour in the film. I think the sheik has been corrected. Extras have a short interview with Lamberto Bava He does not have this sequel, etc..etc ... other trailers and other sheik DVD release releases. <br /> < br>
