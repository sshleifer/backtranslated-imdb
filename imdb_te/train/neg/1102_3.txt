First of all, I saw two films that I saw the director without seeing the titles and hence he must lose points. My check is not bad but, by his two movies sit, I also wish I could have tried to learn. The equator is very good. Way is great. It consists of ten different story lines that work together. It's not too deep in Prague (small, really.) Town. The main characters are between 20 and 30. They have jobs and single studies. Balkan is the best character of a young man. Her sentiments are echoed on immigration day one day here. About it. The only great character. Everyone will suffer a lot of hell of their own lives. How will I be sympathetic to such an obvious inadequacy? Perhaps there are interesting bits with Japanese tourists, but do I need another stereotype image? If you want alright music, watch this movie. If you want to smile with someone else's folly, see this movie. If you like sarcasm and dry humor look at the original jermaus is not a simulation. And in any case you see the image of Andrisek, the vepeper. Except if you do not enjoy homosexuality.
