Higher Learning is based on personal experiences of director John Singleton at Southern California University. <br /> <br /> The film has three main characters based on its foundation for its foundation: Malik Williams, the lowest distance to an African being the American male athlete. Kristin Connor, a shelter-soft white girl, and Remy, which is unmanned white males. By three unaccustomed (Kristine), and unwanted (Remy), the three are overcome by sudden disappearances, such as promoting three campaigns by disappointment (Malik). One good thing about the film is that modern American colleges show that only high schools are larger. Colleges do not have places to build a character, develop probability or improve personal development, but they are used to collect all types of students in one-size-fit-all-all climates. It is usually an experience built for failure of many students. <br /> <br /> The film is good if it is a story about this tragedy, rather than racial politics. Singleton, it seems, got a bad experience in Southern California. Through this film he allows it to hang out all. No need to lay around the bush here. Singleton allows the leaders and the villains can easily see this piece. <br /> <br /> The black characters in the picture appear to be pretty many leaders, but all whites in the picture are villains <br /> Who can understand the irregularities in the film? Block gang members who helped her with a white woman telling her that she was raped? Dark Dark Dorm Planning The convenience of black gang members at the university is to meet a group of skin groups in violence? <br /> <br /> Omar Eppis (Malik) and Christie Swanson (Kristin) performances were disappointing. They appear as the third choice for the characters in the film (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore Malik and Kristin but not available). Shia Jackson aka Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes, and Regina Kings were all irritating their roles. And Laurence Fishburn was proficient in history as a professor. Michael Rapappoft only performed well in the film and he portrayed his role in three major roles. <br /> <br /> With this single image of American college life in the case of race and odds of John Singleton. And he did very badly. It's sort of like killing a shotgun with a shotgun. Life is very complicated, it looks and everyone is the same and he needs to know it. Higher learning is proof that he does not understand all this. When you see the film, now it is disturbing people, disappointing and expressing anger. It's a little bit less.
