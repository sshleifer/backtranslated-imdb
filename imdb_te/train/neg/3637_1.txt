<br /> <br /> I am very surprised that foreign films often complain of slow, and avoid "lack of action" that is not in the best international films. <br /> <br /> In the foreign industry, I enjoyed the lack of art and clich√© often. <br /> <br /> Many foreign films can not be built in the cool luxurious small bow. <br /> <br /> In the movie, I did not offer any ransom value for watching. Meaningful character development, no attractive story arc, no emotional connection with any characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Summary: Some emotionally impaired are mistaken for some of their slaves, and the "house-boy" is finally bored when a girl is hurt by a little girl. <br /> <br /> While the above paragraph is sharp and dramatic, you like this movie while playing the visuals. I took three meetings without finishing it, and I did not even say it was not for positive ratings. <br /> If you do not have an academic interest in this period, I will steer clear on this.
