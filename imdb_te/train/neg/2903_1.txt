Oh dear. This film "When the writers strike!" What a stinker. When I really read the IMDb reviews, after reading about IMDb ratings, I really was surprised at the IMDb rating system, but this was a special thing. I liked Steve Carroll in Ankorman, Bruce Almighty, Office, and so I was looking forward to great things. I'm less than a year to say I'm disappointed. There are many things wrong with this movie, but I (a) behave like this people (a mass aerobics exercise? What is the original planet?), Clunky scriptor murderer of love? Please), and the fact that Don's character can be quite impossible, falling in love with what the girl saw in herself? This film is filled with breakthrough clunky conversations, creaking in direction, ridiculous set-sequences and it's slow, slow, slow. If we were not with my parents, we could go out for a long time and not waste money. Unlike the film makers, all the throws of the movie turned into a bonfire - it's more entertaining. If you like movies, avoid the plague.
