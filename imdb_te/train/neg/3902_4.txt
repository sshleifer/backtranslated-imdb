This is actually the adaptation of the god of Jane Austen's novel. Compared to American version of Ginnet Paltrow, the script is as close to the book as possible. But acting is terrible. In addition to Kate Beckinsale, I am in this book as a true match of Emma, ​​and other actors are trying hard. Mark Strong is not the "Gentleman" he is supposed to. He is often rude and objectionable, there is no feeling, and his love for "Emma" has not been "grown" over all of the film. It has a terrible impact on Kate Beckinsale, who appears to be trying to make her the main character as well as her partner's "blood". In addition, there is no chemistry between the whole cast. Harita Smith, starring Samantha Morton, had no real affair with Mr. Elton, who played Dominic Rowan. Therefore, she does not seem to be heartbroken in her book. These image settings are very poor. The costumes are much higher. I thought Imma Woodhouse was going to be a more comfortable, elegant way here. The end is too long. It sounds like the end of the book, but it is the ultimate killer for the film. Again, Mr.Nnightley can not see any feeling of joy in the face. To the end, I believe this adaptation book is trustworthy, but with poor actors. It seemed that the film was made without any budget. Despite the clarity that these actors (except good Olivia Williams and better Kate Beckinsale), make it a "blockbuster", the entire script would like to see a "lightweight" version of Paltrow and Northam.
