When I saw this shop, I thought it was really good and original. When Wolf's Creek meets the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I will spend three lines (about $ 6). I do not think it's honest. <br /> <br /> Like the directors, the 'Kasai Brothers' did not decide whether the horror horror or the Gary slaser would be. Horror. This was not a clich√©, and ended with all the characters in the cryptic hour and fifteen minutes as a dimensional and you did not care less about what happened to them, but they ultimately tried to show the viewer about the characters that added a useless statement. <br /> <br /> It was a two-hour movie that looked like a whole nonsense watch. If you want a slasher image, you do not have trouble - the film is always slowly moving slowly.
