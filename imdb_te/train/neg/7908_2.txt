I do not expect much when I see this at Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It is an alternative choice which has sold two other movies. Nevertheless, I faced hope. This has alerted a bit like "bride and prejudice" (L.A. Guy is an Indian beauty, parental dispute, blah blah blah). B & P is not perfect but enjoyable with some good laughs and favorite characters. <br /> <br /> "There is no one in my Bollywood Bride". This act is discouraging and has led to a number of numbers. This story appeared as the characters wrote a high school student play student. Technically, the sound really hurt me. The dubbing of the conversation seemed to be quite a lot. I mean a lot. I knew it was sometimes needed but the half picture was shot in a room and sounded like it drew much attention. <br /> <br /> The two stars are somewhat generous.
