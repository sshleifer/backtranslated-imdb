This is a very creepy movie. I found it to be effective for this music. Photographs taken in the village of Mario were also alerted. But with this film I had three problems. It's hard to say that the light is very dark and it's hard to tell what's going to happen for a while, but this may have a copy. The latter is not very well explained at the beginning and does not know exactly what's going on there. The third problem is that I did not understand the ending, but obviously do some people. There are also general problems of people who are actually stupid, and the male is 70 years old. All in all, not watchable but close to being a favorite.
