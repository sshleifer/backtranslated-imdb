I have gone to the film's reciprocity and it's very funny. It's a combination of every horror / thriller clich√© to comment on many things including pedophilia, satan worship, undercover cops, affairs, religion ... and it's a mess. Acting is pretty; Kid and Jesus dude alright, but away from them .... Anyways. In an attempt to show the Christian people in a different way (a little bit failed) I praised that effort ... Although they did, the way the Gospel was presented was a bit stack and a junk. But again, he is talking to a little boy ... not that. In fact, I have just decided that it's all bad. Music ... Oh my goose ... terrible ... toooo over-dramatic. Okay. I felt bad for the people I made in the premiere; It seemed like a poor student project. I'm just going to stop confusing about it and go on to say on the bottom line, watch this movie if you want to watch your movie for hour and fifty minutes in the trash. Go there.
