I really watched it but I wanted to imagine it because I wanted to know if the movie would be funnier and ridiculous at the end. And it did. Climax is the most poor performance ever given by the defense lawyer - so it is very strange for the fiction story in real life. No one on this planet can behave before the court. And perhaps the worst advocate on earth. Why was he in court anytime? He has nothing to prove to be guilty and absolutely nothing. Her home was a result of finding a simple search rings. But do not go. He preferred to say "objection" 2 or 3 times during the entire trial - that is the same. The blonde lover is proved to be true-Bret to prove her innocence. Bret's altar is in her home, where she can prove her sickness to appease. But did not go back. In the court scene, I wanted to bang on her head several times, taking her out of her hands and quietly. Even true weirdos did not seem to be that silly fake "she's innocent" she did. And what does this picture tell us? Do not marry a woman with life insurance: As soon as her stairs lie down, her husband is imprisoned or imprisoned. Wicked and evil.
