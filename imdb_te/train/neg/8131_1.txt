Some kind of spoiler for the transformation of the title wife (must fiends! We ruin it). Although the film is not made-for-TV, there must be something that will hit every 70's clippings except the low-budget, low-budget, under-cocktail and disco. No one is likeable, and you could not care what this one is for anyone. Never forget, except bad and bad performances.
