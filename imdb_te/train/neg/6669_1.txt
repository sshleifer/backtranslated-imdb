I saw this movie in my movie class. I'm glad I did not pay. I got it with an open mind, and is also a little excited. I really enjoyed Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood and the rest of the cast was interesting. I never connected with this movie. Acting is very good, cinematography is interesting, but the storyline or lack of it is not a problem. The center is not connected to the movie. Is it love between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Is it west Kind, but not. I'm all for turns in cinemas, I recently saw "Brick" and enjoyed it, but the place where the movie went was there. It's quite unusual, and if I did not sit through the whole movie, I walked out. The writing is not terrible, but it's just on the place. By the end of the movie, I wish terrible chaos and soon ended. There is something about this film that does not echo, I understand more offbeat movies like "Fight Club", but I do not care about the characters at all.
