Looking at this film has made me think constantly; Why are you making such a problem from some broken brakes? There are a million options to reduce car speed! The authors of this movie have a good reason why speed writers can not stop ... <br /> <br /> There is not much good to say about this movie; All the general narrative clic is their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is like a sieve-like leak. The film makes time and money waste.
