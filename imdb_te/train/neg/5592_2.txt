It is hard to describe this movie and wants to try not to remove it too quickly because you have a feeling that this is just a few 12 year old girl can be the perfect image ... <br /> The film is a nice concept - the modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a twist. It is a nice start to some rather dreamy shots and some nice sketches associated with the young boy with his single work maternal and his school ... You might tell a good start, but it got a bit greedy, very greedy, it tries to science fiction, a play , A thriller, a romantic love story, a fairy tale, a funny and everything under the sun. The result was that it was not enough for the audience. For instance, instead of romance, the girl (who played Risa Goto) finally recovered through her (Yuki Korara) kiss, then it was necessary to scare us to laugh ... it's a cheap trick, <br /> <br /> The film is a good half It destroys all the imaginations and emotions that are trying to build for it. Comic book artist Osam Tejuku is known for his mystery and critical stories) I wonder if all the problems are exsist in the original story or insertion of it? It is also unacceptable for a person who uses the "laughing logic" of the Japanese comic book. For example, the role of Yuki Coraara is to immediately escape the role of Risa Goto before a television camera and immediately find an instant (away from the hospital) <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> > <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < br> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br / > <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < br> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br / > The famous "The Lion note" from "The Roman Holiday" from other films <br /> <br /> The film is all but endless without ever ... It's a fantastic story and it's not enough humor to be comedy ... And surprisingly some scenes appear to be a random "ghost" film. However, it should give a credit to see some part of Japanese teenage sentiment. <br /> <br /> I have a feeling that there might be some films with a warning label that the film is less than 18 years old. " <br /> <br /> It was obvious on the poster of the film. <br /> <br />
