Are you talking to me (1987) is a pretty bad movie featuring some actors who have never seen before or played a guy from a neighbor who is trying to become an actor. He has huge jones for a taxi driver trying to make that shit big. When he realizes the hard truths of life, he changes his image, what everyone does! He goes from the good feta to Surf Up Dude overnight. His friend did not believe this change (but he scores and cold pay show with Faith Ford). <br /> <br /> It tries to put too much things into it. An interesting idea that is different from poor execution. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see young Bubba from Hot Faith Ford and Forest Gump. <br /> <br />
