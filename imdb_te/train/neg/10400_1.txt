Enough to be enough ... sometimes they should stop doing movies based on a feeling of long dead. The picture of the first tremors was great. The second is ridiculous. Third is disgusting. The TV series is discouraging. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first one is like a rehash, how they beat them again Has to learn. I think entertaining. Otherwise this straight-to-video release, just like the Tremors 2 and 3, just going too far. Oh and I continue to see how the record of these events never happened ... Did they just forget to record this unprecedented event? I think making something history like this, so the first film is not so unprepared as our pals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
