If you like "Pulp Fiction" and handmade cameras, you should like this movie. I liked the quirky story (though I think it was a much higher rate film from "Pulp Fiction" "The English Patient"), but the characters are unrealistic but interesting. It was not "Waterfront" or "Citizen Kane" and was burdened with European pride. But the worst part of the hand is the camera camera. It was so far and annoying that I found myself waiting for desolation for the film. I do not know why new filmmakers are so good at shooting. If you are motion sick, stay away, the hand-held camera laughs at you in about 10 minutes.
