Every Saturday and Sunday afternoon Children's Matinees is a local theater when I was kidnapped in the 1970s (who remembers that?). They have shown this thing around a year Christmas time. I and some friends went to see it. I imagined a cool Santa Claus movie. <br /> <br /> I know Santa Claus and Merlin's magicians (do not ask me what they are doing in the same movie) Satan (some horns a little bit!). Images were hit in my seat. I have always launched a Santa Spooky that does not help. The man in Satan's suit does not help. But I was afraid that the wooden rein derers of Santa's sled. I remember having them nightmares about those things - he made them bruises and creepy sound and movements! This year, I go out of the theater rather than a bit worse than I have seen. My friends are very frightened. I saw the ad for it on TV and made those nightmares bounce back. It's a creepy, disturbing little Christmas movie, and any little boy who looks at it can scare the pants. Avoid it - unless you really want to punish your children. It comes in as 1.
