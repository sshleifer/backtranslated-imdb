Two years ago at Sundance I liked the first-high tunnel directed by Josh Kornblue. I'm looking forward to his brother (often collaborator) Jacob, the best Thief in the world. This is a play about a seemingly good kid growing up in New York's low-class area. The film is not without its sharp moments. But if Korn Bluff is working very hard to express it, life is harder for some people. <br /> <br /> The more subtle, the more important, all of these perceptible cultural affiliations and anti-social behaviors, these characters have no shortage of goodness and humanity. We may be back in their language and in their living conditions, but we can not reduce their intentions. In fact, the struggles to maintain a family in such disadvantages will thank many of us. <br /> When this is known, the world's best thief suffers from many painful disorders (including title). The characters are not very believable. The writing is uneven. And the plot line is just as clear. Cornwalleth uses two young black people who are involved with gangsta rap between the scenes. But I do not question the potential reality of this phenomenon, it puffs me to look at talking about mf'ing 5-year-old kids and having sex with women lineup. It's a bit bit of unnecessary shock value and interest taken to borrow.
