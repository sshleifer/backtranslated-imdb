LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elles. Roselyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - Wait a minute. Justin Timberlake? And he is star? I need to know better than renting EDISON FORCE. In fact, I know very well. But in the moment of accurate weakness, I hired this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV you realize that it is one of the two: an indie or a dog. Sitting on a shelf Which is what. And with good reason. Such a plot is corrupt killer cops are in the team of La Lose Force, and "Journalist" Timberlake is brave enough to uncover them. He is targeting his efforts - or I should say about his terrible acting. One of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and I was turned off after the thought that it could turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing. Just awful. On the frequency cover and the film is filled with a tremendous beard, nothing seems like a hobo. You know that the director is not in control. Freeman is clearly dirty.
