This movie is the second worst movie I've seen (the first person Ghost Rider). There is no need for any plot, climax, clash or any other important detail in portraying a stretch. The film 'Toby Keith is another pretense to show towards his men and is really tough guy. I totally waste my time watching this movie. The best part should be the end credits. If I was Ebert or Roper, I cut my thumbs and threw them at the producers. In their right mind, Toby Keith has been given a chance to star in a movie, he is in the same mood. In the end, watching this movie does not waste your time, it's probably the only thing you regret.
