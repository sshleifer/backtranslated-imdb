In the last years such as the WWE New Years Revolution took place in 2006 with the Elimination Chamber Contest. The difference between last years and years is fun though. In fact, it is possible that only three WWE championships will leave the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York. The men are current champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There is no way to put any belt on Vinnie Mac any rookies; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane's last WWE Championship was held in June 1998, and it's only one night. He's obviously not one either. Last year's match is a thrilling affair with six best WWE offers. 2006 was speculative and frustrating, but still the night's match. <br /> <br /> The bell was surprised only after participating in the bell-hour main event. Vince McMahon stood firm and demanded that they lift the room. At that time, Edge announced that he had made money in the bank championship match. Elimination chamber turned out to win the match and John Cena did not retain an opportunity and fell to the top of the spear after one of the most entertaining matters in WWE. It's only entertaining for nightly actions. <br /> <br /> The undercard like last year was really bad. Triple H and The Big Show put me on a smiley festive in difficulties to keep me away. HHH has succeed but is there any real doubt in it ever? There is no chance that the pay-per-view, which includes both Jerry Larlar and Wrestling Wrestling in the same card, will never be successful. <br /> <br /> King's Helms (who wrote this stuff?) and Big V was defeated by Shelton Benjamin, who wasted little help from his mama. <br /> <br /> WWE women also have a busy night. There is also general diva nonsense with the Brow and the Pontis Gauntlet match which won the Ashley and Women's Championship. In a match, I felt that WrestleMania 22 challenged Mick James Trotsus in a good match. Trish won the competition, but it is clear that it will continue in the future. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The nightly opening contest soon became the WWE Champion Edge on Intercontinental Champion, Ric Flair. It may be better, but it is a damaged and bloody flair that retains after disqualification. <br /> <br /> New Year's Revolution In 2006, the pay-per-view calendar was dismissed in a devastating manner. The only good thing from WWE is the only way to know. They are not much worse than that.
