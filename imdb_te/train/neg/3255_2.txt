I saw this movie in its premiere in 1975. I am 13 years old, at that time it was adequately and somewhat enjoyed. I came to know the world of Dock Savage's WORLD through the Bantam novels of old pulp magazines. I have not thought of any of this before of Doc's realm, but I became one of the most avid Doc Savage fans you could ever meet. I've read all of the bantam books, I'm going along with Comic Book Cons (Star Trek and Doctor Who and all of the Unique Fat Children) and I have a wonderful time with every adventure I took with Doc Actual Fab 5 Philip Jose Farmer's Book - Apocalyptic Life of Dock Savage has become a bit of a Bible for me and to this day Many who have come to the stage I'm feeling in my dock. In this film I have to accept a few years after the boat is missing. It is a movie that does not know what it's intent when grown up. The screenplay was an infant and a slightly different picture of the pulp story. These stories from the 30s have been short and failed for legend Dent's (AKA Kenneth Robeson) writing, the PERFECT 3 legal drama they gave out for screen treatment. That might have been better with George Paul and Michael Anderson as the head. Spoof elements lose the target and more intense moments reach almost there, but are later smaller. Being interesting to see they were all sold out well by the second-string character actors (some players and extra characters before the movie). Paul Gleason has run out of a fine utility player in all aspects of entertainment of course and Bill Lucking is a television perennial. All the rest of the sin fell off the map. The fourth film of the film is my own hero, but I'm afraid that I can not see it very painful. I can say 0, but I give it for the sake of 3rd stinger for a moment in the direction of the art direction (in the past, Doc's peace machine is a nice touch) instead of 2 years in 10 years and a moment in the sun.
