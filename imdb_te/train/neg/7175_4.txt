We may be based on these historical events, and we know that this TV document has taken liberties to make play dramas more dramatic - I can live that way - but it's so bad! I was amazed at the case of the air crisis between an unfolding how calm everyone appeared, surely someone is afraid, and a smooth flight, no passenger discomfort obvious - come on! Not sure about the terms, currently the airline security issues seems to be some OTT nonsense, but why the emergency landing is off your shoes before, common sense tells me it's not a good idea! The firing of this huge airship on this remote air strip is incredible and hoax. In fact, it was a spectacular view from the nearby land, in which the ratio was over and probably it was a model. No one appears to go out of the front, even though the escape that appears in the emergency doors between the front and the middle is still very low. Captain landed again after landing - why? It does not explain. We know that emergency landing is emerging from fuel but while some fuel sloshing around the tanks, and the explosion risk should be a very real risk, yet the move seemed to be almost restless, and everyone was surrounded by the slide's foot instead of getting as far as possible, think. There are too many instabilities, bugs and fake actions in this way. I liked seeing the representation of play in real time, and was shot with the plane's realistic motion. It is very thrilling, but due to the budget restrictions failed, and an aircraft feel that losing all the engines is not really a big deal, and you can safely slip down a bit down into a bumpy, but real danger! - Of course it's actually quite different!
