First of all I want to say LOVE this show !!! But this episode ... this episode is deriding in the whole program. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they have achieved with this episode but they have successfully created the WORST episode in the entire series. <br /> <br /> There is no storyline, everything is haphazard and jokes are ..... they are rubbish. <br /> They tried to answer the remaining questions in the game. <br /> For example, "How the furlings appear" by creating "stupid" ... is just as embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Without thoughts and it is very bad.
