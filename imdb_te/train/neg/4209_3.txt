"I'm a cartoon!" "You are an illustration!" What does this mean? This storyline is not as bad as a very memorable boy in a very memorable movie because he went into this book. The purpose of these waste of celluloid is to encourage American children to read, and this can be one of the best, more effective way advertising! The talents of McClay Kulkin (child), Christopher Lloyd (he says "a mastermaster" as "a book"), this useless film can be saved from a discouraged story. Frank Walker's voice has never been saved, such as Hoop Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (also) Leonard Nimoy, or Hollywood of Voices of Gods, as cartoon characters. I can only describe the horrific 1978 simulation of blue babies in the 1990's, because the bland animation film still degrades, and the dull plot does not improve!
