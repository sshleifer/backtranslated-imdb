<br /> <br /> The Yahoo Whale Pirates squad is holding a woman and stringed by her tail-fin. Whale's mate comes out of the woman's unborn baby and sees the whole thing, including the moment of falling on the deck. "Captain Nolan" (Richard Harris) is said to be a big male madman, "go out of town." <br /> <br /> This story of vengeance has the presence of Harris and the beauty of Bo, but not many. It was Bow's first 'release' film, but his first acting career four years ago in 'An One Upon a Love' released in 1981 was 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek). <br /> <br /> Today, this review date (November 20), Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a good time 'whale' ..... get it? ..... whale ... hey-hee.
