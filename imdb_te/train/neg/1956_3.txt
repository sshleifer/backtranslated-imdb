This movie has a renewal feature. On one occasion, when a character is chopped off with a chair, his brother asks him, "Where's your dick?" <br /> <br /> Acting is not quite a bit bad, but kids should be shy of all the stink and PJ Soles. The story is weak and you do not know what (or any simple concept) you will do. <br /> <br /> In fact, most of the story points are. For example, in a scene, young children's demons should be seriously focused on moving the physical object so it is difficult to prove that they exist and do not interact clearly with physical material. However, after a few minutes they lift the whole sprout and defeated Tooth Fairy with them. Apparently they sometimes move the matter and sometimes they can not. Go to number. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and guts, though ... some nice boobs. <br /> <br /> If you want an image about tooth fairy, please rent "Darkness Falls". Although most other reviewers do not share my opinion, I think it's great. At least it will set a mood.
