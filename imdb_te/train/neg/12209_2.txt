Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother had a mechanism to pay the person taking the picture. And, when they paid me to look at some of the worst they took me, I could not resist a free tour of movies! I got to see the worst like the second Conan movie and never said it ever! Now, despite this a wretched movie, it is in the entertaining places to watch - a brain dead on the way. And, technically adventurous and camera work are good, so it raises my rating up to 2 all the way! So why is the movie so bad? Rambo does not have the same character except the first Rambo movie, Rambo himself only tells about 3 words (apart from tears and Arun), where there is no unwanted and totally unrelated and "romance" and the film is a giant (and stupid) special influence. And what are the special effects of enthusiasm. 12383499143743701 Bullets and racquets were shot at Rambo, no one had any impact on him and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots hits its mark! And, when the bad guys use the AK-47s, helicopters and rockets, some scenes are all Rambo's what looks like nuclear powered tips that have a bow and arrows !! Slow and calm down the scene where one of these exploding arrows fired him like a bad guy especially for dumb spectators! It sang greatly in the UHF starring in Wired All. <br /> <br /> Plus, hot shots, PART Dukes also make the funny simulation of this style - not just this stupid scene. <br /> Everything is dumb and pointless, almost self-imitation!
