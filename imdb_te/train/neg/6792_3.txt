The film is here with good cast and nice looking city work but it does not. Director Richard Brooks needs to be slightly tired at this stage of the game; How good his PROFESSIONALS is! Even in slow motion scenes, horses and other action appear slowly in motion. This image must be spam-up, if any. That tire tracks in the desert tracking moments that horse-foam sure looked terribly fraudulent to me- just lazy. sloppy work. Very bad. Actors did, but I saw them all as good. Ben Johnson is always a pleasure, though. I saw this movie almost 30 years ago. He was disappointed and it was after a second look after 30 years.
