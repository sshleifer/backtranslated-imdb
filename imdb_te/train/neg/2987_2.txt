The dubbing / translation is a jolly hobby in the movie and in this way entertainment is only entertained and produced in a zombie flick. I did not laugh very hard in my life so I saw the zombie 3 (and I have seen some really bad dubbing in my life, believe me). Seriously, filmmakers can rewrite the picture and release it as comedy and earn millions of dollars. <br /> <br /> But ... Furse is not your tea tea when drowning in a zombie movie, then cut all costs.
