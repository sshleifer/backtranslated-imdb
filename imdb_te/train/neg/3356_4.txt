The story of Shirley Jackson's novel 'The Haunting of Hill House' Terror. It tells the supernatural phenomenon of the old building. The atmosphere is well directed, and the cold is well displayed. <br /> <br /> The 1963 Chiller is closer to the book 'The Hunting', but adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, so the book's panic is much better on the cold screen. Black and white photography is only added to the mood of the movie. Excellent! <br /> After that, John De Bont made it. In 1999, The Haunting's remake cinemas hit - if you called this remake. Why they made the reconstruction of the 1963 film, it's a mystery, but for this moment, let's look at this movie. <br /> <br /> For most horror movies, it rarely starts. The set used for the Hill House is very beautiful, and is extraordinary, and a few minutes seems to be the simplest way to rewrite the film. And then, the first scare comes: a loose harpsichord wire is a woman's face (Dr. Maro's assistant) slash. It's happy and true, I'm in tears. <br /> <br /> Since then the film just jumps up. Owen Wilson's role was particularly annoying (hence such a relief when he was beheaded by the fuel). This film is practically practical, it is a shame, most of them are very cheesy and long duration. <br /> <br /> More than anything, along with hundreds of others, you strongly recommend that you look at the original retailer, alternatively buy a Shirley Jackson novel. But stay away from it. And if you decide to look at it, it can be seen on TV (channels do not open and do not have this movie too) or rent cheap, but please do not buy anything. Do not waste your money! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
