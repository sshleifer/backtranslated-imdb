Start with a good bit: Many times Swayy talks are heard between friends of the friends or those language. <br /> <br /> Usually the USA & UK movie audience speak all people on the planet in English (if you are one of them: they do not do anything). As we say in the Netherlands, it is 'Tencornumen' (which connects the eyes of your toes - not the best way). I love Swayze but in that he is awful. The muscles in his jaws make overtime and he must say the whole movie is furious-some people say it looks like Butch. No Patrick: It looks silly and the compensation for lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) chose the style of acting that she did not get the style of her colleagues. Her performance is very simple that the film is set in the present days. And it is not. <br /> <br /> I like the best people like African Continent and Sombed Ounyu from Umbopa. In the clear, warm and in the role, his performance is a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> Simple: It's entertaining in Mawwa on a rainy day. Pity. May be good. Steal the director
