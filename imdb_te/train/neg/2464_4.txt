Love Part One, The Impossible Planet, but alas, there is no 'disappointment' in the two 'satan pit'. Cliffhanger - something that comes out of the pit clearly does not come from the pit. Then aged, the Beast intelligence is not vacant, so I'm going to look forward to a doctor / villain face-to-face. Tardis is somewhere inside the pit despite the pit that does not open up until Tardis fell through the planet crust. And finally another ready made solution existed for any logical reason - I mean, did the pit start to plunge into the host immediately after the launch? Why do not you drown him these years without ever having been arrested? Why not - I have gone but I lost interest ...
