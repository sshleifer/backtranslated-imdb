I liked that movie first. It seemed to me a good comedy with some silly moves. Costume designer Albert Wallski did his best! Excellent set decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really has a very good taste! But the authors of the script are very disappointed with me. The best finish is the scene on the ladder, but instead, they decided to stay with the father and his daughter. Do not like the end. The father becomes his daughter's lover and his ex-wife learns about it and embraces it. For example, if script writer's example says that there is a different spirit in the body, it would be ok but they did not, which only lost memories. Actors are good, they're really funny. Cybill Shepard is lovely, Robert Downey junior is very funny in the dance scene :)) ... but some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, who played Cyril Shepherd after her husband's death after her husband's death, was waiting for 23 years (a long time!), She was genuinely real, she did not love her and she met her friend Philip Rail (Ryan O'Neil) After the scene, about loving her, she has been waiting for so long a long time A person who has the most easily manipulated! Even if this does not end, some of the missing human psychology is a good film.
