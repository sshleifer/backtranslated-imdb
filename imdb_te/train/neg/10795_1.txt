He tells the shock to stick to what's good in basketball. This film is not even entertaining at the stupid level. The shock in this movie is a genie born in a boom box is not a Genie genuine in a lamp instead of a lamp. He is supposed to help a little boy who plays equally annoying Frances Cappa. This film has a very soft storyline from the water world, the acting is awful and I think that anyone who likes this Flame is afraid to accept it.
