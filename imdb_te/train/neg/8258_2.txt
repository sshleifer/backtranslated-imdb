Before I saw this movie, I had a good luck reading the book. It's an epic, teenage dream of adolescence, great dialogue indie or big budget drama. It got into the hands of a hack, who really took notes looking at Boogie Nights and Rushmore without learning anything at all. The script loses the book's meat in favor of emotional notes and less brow papers. I am sorry for the actor because the characters in the book are wealthy and well-formed but have reduced the uncomfortable position in the film. Mason Gamble is great when given the opportunity like Dyson Baker, but after the special skeleton school of the story plays badly. Poor people = good, rich people = bad. <br /> <br /> Although it is worth to see it on the South California beach, the Gary Chinace parks are meant for his trailer to go for a bay in Delaware. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but the first director Mills is an awkward turn for Good. <br />
