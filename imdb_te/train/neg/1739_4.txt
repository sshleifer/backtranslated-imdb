Watching Lady in Ermin I wonder what was in a project that seemed to target for Marlene Dietrich to make Betty Grable. One of the 20th Century Fox decided that another would be better for a sex symbol. <br /> <br /> Betty has unveiled a 19th century Italian Countess, which was occupied by the Douglas Fairbanks, a junior captain of the Hungarian Husseer's squad. Its ancestor ancestor did not have any comparison with her special family tree, Palace Hall, Doug 300 years before, and another invader herself when the army failed. <br /> <br /> The current Betty is married to Caesar Romero and the invasion has come during a very unlikely moment, and things have already been done. <br /> <br /> Fresh, American Betty is a good actress, seductive and mysticist. Marlene Dietrich may have given this over, but it is more than just a buddy presidential candidate. <br /> <br /> Frederick Hallander and Leo Robin have scored for the film and The Is the Moment for Best Song Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Ernest Lubitsch died at midway during the film and completed the lady in Otto Premininger Ermin. I can not believe that the lubitch saw the straw here. If you see that lady in Ermin, you also practice.
