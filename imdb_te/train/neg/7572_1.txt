It seemed like I had seen this movie a thousand times before. It's definitely imaginable. Every time this story is a bit distorted, every time I looked forward to something interesting, I saw what I expected. "The bread factory opened another facility because there was not enough bread". Two words: The flat story is a bit funny, mute Russian police, Vlad, while punishing around the dumb boys, becoming a clich√©, bad acting, bad special effects ... The muscle pile is so incredible STUPID, which made me smile for a moment. I wonder why spitting on that shy-of-a-film and wasting my time ... it's not possible (because it's not possible): D
