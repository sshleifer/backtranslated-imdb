Amazingly, damn, MooCow will grudgingly admit to the truth: I like Kanta 'a simulator of this cheap, cheesy 70s. The idea that the vast hordes of killer tomatoes will destroy the US is a great idea, and despite being himself, Moovi offers moostly some good chuckles of terrifying extras running away from the big, clear fake tomatoes. The film, together with The Kentucky Fruity Moovio, is one of the earliest attempts to make it 80 & amp; In the 90's it became very popular, thanks to Airplane! Like most spoofs, it is very poor. Many attempts at humor stimulates dismal failures, and much groaning. But the sudden tomatoes groups, the vicious "pubber love" song, and the spectacular helicopter crash scenario, the killer Tomatoes' attack has provided some kind of things, but mostly for worse reasons. There are so many things wrong in this movie ... so correct, it's hard to explain. In Tomatoes 2 movies, and a cartoon series returned with enough people to enjoy it! Large parts of the time spent on the tomatoes are pretty dull. Take that 70 garment, dude! ; = 8) This tomato seed and cheesy, but a stew or two worth; MooCow Tomatoes says to grab a pizza and pop !! : ??
