This is my kind of cinema. Even if it sucks, it should still be right up my thinner; Hell, I like the movies "Conga," and "Alan Quatermine". The crazy alien / demon / adventure movies are in my heart's soft area. <br /> <br /> I have decided why I want to see this in the first place. <br /> <br /> Horror / science fiction is almost always a conspiracy for me 2. I'm a big fan of archaeologist, and this film will have a rare treasure. Super-natural enemies with quality FX 4. Christian Slater and Darf I usually enjoy. <br /> <br /> Tara Reed is hot. <br /> The film is at least in the cheese-horror section of the store store. Slaughter and Darf are the only things that can get rid of, and not everyone I find them entertaining ... I mean, let's it let, both are dramatic. <br /> Tara Reid. Though the film is even worse, Reid's performance is really awful. We're not talking badly, I'm choosing to make Tarah Reed bad for the year. I do not know if she is capable of acting, but the museum curator play is just out of her league ... totally. The attempt to take the role of a educated scientist is not much different from looking at setup in bad sex. It's not just bad, it's ridiculously bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, and she is not naked to anyone you care about, down to Brah in a silly, completely unnecessary love scenes. <br /> <br /> Reed's acting, but the dominance of the plot, and the plot seems to have been written by a 10-year-old. Until I was watching the DVD, it realized that this was a video game adaptation until the real time I was stupid. <br /> <br /> "Slater in his adult life has been assigned by some unit 713, which apparently hammers an exceptional military force, or You never really knew, except one of the voice-overs that I zoned at the time, because the movie slaughter begins with artworks, some retailers <br /> <br /> Some hellions on earth (for no reason), experiments in children, Super Depp / Alain- <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I mean, why is this evil scientist so damn bad? Oh right, humans are doomed and he's just trying to save the human race. I expect he was infected? How was it done? Oh right he is one of the nasty demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself. How was it hell Why and where he powered half of the super-slug, slaughter blade, but his slug "caused by an electric shock, though he was super slugs (yes yes, they use the old science fiction stand by parasitic aliens / monsters which is" fuse "with their host backbone) Not completely fuse, "Thank God. Oh, and the people with these "fused" spins do not have the idea of ​​dealing with half the alien / ghost and good members of the community, they will be given a secret code until some killer zombies are rotating. "<br /> <br />" The big deal of a deal to fix in the first place ... did not hold a small dynamite that was not at least nothing. <br /> <br / > Not the most rubbish you're watching, but really bad image.
