When promos first came out of November, I was excited to watch this movie. It's amazing and looked at the songs! I was disappointed when I went to see! It connects 6 movie couples. It has 12 castes! The film has a large number of stars. Director Nikhil Advani did not perform the situation well and I thought that there would not be many people in this film. Compared to 'Kal Ho Naa Ho' directed by Nikhil, 'Salam-e-Ishq' is far behind. Nikhil wants to have a small star. I think that is the best of these movie songs! These songs are good and I am great for songs, and Shankar-Ehsaan-Lai has done fantastic jobs and have done excellent work in years. I can go through the ratings of this song with amazing songs! One thing that I am disappointed with is that this film made by director Sohail Khan and Esha Koppikar should not have nudity. I saw a lot with this family! Some may find this naked as a comedy, you do not want to see with your parents! I have done well with Salman and Priyanka, I think it is a good movie!
