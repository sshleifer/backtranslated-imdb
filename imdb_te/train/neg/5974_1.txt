Let me start by saying that this film will not appear or not. <br /> <br /> The film does not have any real movie language like another TV show about the famous girls and boys in the movie. <br /> <br /> The camera angles do not go straight and connect with it. I did not see this film before a Film Theater was going to be a warm medium for every topic of people's interpretation. Very clear. <br /> <br /> The big picture in this movie is used only as an extensive TV. Each of these women can be seen as bigger than life. <br /> <br /> Young directors seem to be compromising the art of art. Sales. It's terrible. The art of industry has dispersed art. We need to be aware of cinematography and its language and our kids are aware of it. Not just sales and entertainment, but feelings, desires, and culture are also a way to communicate. Getting Started for Young Dias and Jacks is not the venue.
