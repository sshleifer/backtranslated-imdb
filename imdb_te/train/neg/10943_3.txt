This bad acting and very boring pace is a really bad movie, though Lorenzo Lamas is really cool! All the characters (except for Lama) are just annoying, and no one is root or no one to care! Plus, the action is very boring. The film gives us 3 villains who are boring, ridiculous and supposed to find menacing and disturbing when there's just a bunch of morons I wanted to shut! Plus it is very cheap and unwelcome! Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma but he can not save this garbage, and I believe it is not a start or really started, and everything is so boring in the middle, and I press the fast forward button, plus the dialogue is particularly ridiculous! There is a cool bar scene that I really like, but once the LAMOS Dock heads come apart, plus the scene villains attack Jennifer's family, and kill them! It's really ridiculous when it's ridiculous! It's really bad movie, bad acting and very boring pace, Lorenzo Lamas is really good! But it is not enough, it is not recommended. Directing is very bad. George Erschbamer is doing a very bad job here, keeping mediocre camera work, a blend of space and movie at boring speed. Acting is very bad (except Lama). Here is Lorenzo Lamas is awesome, and he does not need to act, he is very fun to watch, and has a really cool character, and even has a lot of attraction, but even he does not save this one, and he does not have chemistry with cast! (Lamas Rules!). Josie Bell is terrible here, and she's good, she is not very convinced and does not have chemistry with Lama. Cherry jeans are hot, but not too hard, but feared and scared, she corrected. Robert Scott is tired of being the main antagonist and does not have rape, and he is still 2. The rest of the cast is bad. Avoid altogether! Avoid! If you make it like lamas (like me). * From 5
