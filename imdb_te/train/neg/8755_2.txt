This film is terrible to say the least. After watching "High School Musical" I had a lot of good wishes. The whole picture was a complete split of "The Simple Life", not just a reality show. <br /> Acting is not good. Amanda Michalka had her moments, when she was not that terrible. On the other hand Alison is all the way through Michalka. Chris Gullinger, who played Amanda's love, played a French guy, but a terrible voice. A good thing about the film is that of Alexander's sweetheart, Michael Trevino, completely engaged. If the film is aired before "High School Musical" it probably does not look bad. <br /> <br /> In total, I will give 2.
