At the beginning of 2000 TV structures were weak and between bad. The TV does not have the right hit before the marks (alias, last, prince brake, desperate housewives, or monk), which can attract the attention of 2000 spectators. The titles (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Last World), (Sheena), or (Baywatch Hawaii) are the predecessors of them as you watch and follow, or at least not that attractive and interesting. (Special Unit 2) is no exception. In fact, it meets Men X files' spoof in black! (If this is a separate unit 1). But according to this amazing formula; It did not work well. It guaranteed; Several decades later there has been some saturated time from "supernatural" cases, so it's also a modest for the natural soul lamp (suppose a mulder woman!). However (Special Unit 2) is not strong in this regard, it is stronger when it shows a comic size-up display. It's very ridiculous, for instance every sexy situation must be ugly frustrated. It has enjoyed the taste of bad taste. (Michael Landes) is a comedian but attractive and largely unsustainable. He is accompanied by chemistry (Alexandra Lee), as well as any sexual focus, all tired. Certainly the show had a funny look but overall it was unfunny work. It is clear that it is more interesting than its main idea. (Evan Katz) co-authored and co-producer (Seven Days), or (24), then it should be a low point! Despite the distinctive personality, it was a crazy jest for a long time. So if it is aimed, they are really tight! And really, it will be one of the rare times to be thankful for canceling a show after 19 episodes!
