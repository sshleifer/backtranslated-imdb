Who are they funny with this? The film is very hard to digest and is very much in the film. When Arjun (Ajay Devgan) was unaware of his father's uncle's death, he left with his uncle (a few minutes later) after a few minutes. The only problem with that theory is that anyone who has ever gone to London Heathrow knows that such a rare Indian can not be removed. But film issues do not end there, the problem of the two main leads (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) is the rock-star on the edge of their dreams. I understand that when we win Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK who achieves her dreams after 50 years in the UK) but got a rare case. I thought Salman and Ajay cast was just unfortunate because it refused to believe me. They are never able to play Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi, as well as Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men in their 40s) trying to lag behind for 20 years. Do not talk too much on the screen today on the self-conscious actress. This was her second film (I saw) and she was just as disappointed as an actress, not only for her performance but also for good performance and a good deal for the camera and her only smile. I believe that all other film roles have been rejected to act as the actor, then the actress and the impressive, there is nothing to write home at all. And above all that, the picture just dragged on boring. There is nothing special about it, I believe that every cliche is going to be expected.
