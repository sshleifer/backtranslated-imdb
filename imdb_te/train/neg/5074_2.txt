Two weeks ago I saw the film at Paris "Festive des nouvelle di do japan". Even though I do not expect from so many, I have to say that the audience was disappointed as many people ... If I wanted to compile how I felt, I'd've compared it to princess from Mononoke and Nausica until the end. Of course it's crazy. But I could not help it. Stories are very different, but the images of the images are very similar. From this perspective, "the tree of the palm" is not perfectly matched with the medium of magic. Although technically very good, the boredom remains ... Finally the complete inability of realism will advise you not to look after me. I made it from 10 to 2 (a bit harder, I think I am 3 or 4)
