This is a bad image that plays a mockumentary. The romantic documentary filmmaker in the film has more time and other characters, such as dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film is not actually a joke, its problems are very low. The movie is not funny. The image is not sexy. The film does not have much interest in telling about romantic business. This is not particularly harmful. Simulated gender, while nudity is light for an R rated image. <br /> <br /> Today, this is not the case.
