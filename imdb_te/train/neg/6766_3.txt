Did you hear this phrase when it came to this picture ?? "Herbie: Fully loaded with worst" and yes it's true. <br /> <br /> The film is Lindsay's second most terrible film from the confession of the teenage drama Queen. The only good thing about this film is the talented talent cast, which is much better than millions of times and is the only selling item of the film. I can not see that this act as an honorable actor like Matt Dillon can not be part of the film, and did he not read that scary screenplay before he was signed? <br /> <br /> I do not like this film, Herbie climbs on walls like abnormal ability and fantasy and climbs on the wall and how fast a beetle is when a racer goes faster than a car. I know a child's picture but they have gone in with it and make it more crazy than entertaining. <br /> <br /> Final Words: I doubt that no one can experience any of these fiction films except for children who are 5 -12 years old. My money is no waste. I feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)
