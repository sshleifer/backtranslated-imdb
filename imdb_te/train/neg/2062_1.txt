I read all the reviews here because I saw this part of the movie trash and it took me at least 2 pages, and this unfortunately unjustly montage in the 70s is actually a comedy or other era! If it's not the least funny set of sketch * comedy, I'll do it until it comes. Half Skots Already Finished (Movable Python) and Woody Allen (Complete) ... It's a nice piece of animation that continues for 90 seconds and I said it is the theme of this film. In 75 minutes, these waste is not as close as it is to the minds and strokes. Seminal comedy Seminal is really semen means world. Stylized comedy Scott is actually a world of feces. Precorcer jokes? This means that it is a handbook that tells you how to do comedy. Bits and booms and odd bows. Nice ... If you are at least one hand-free kid and can not find a playboy. Give it a break because at the beginning of the 70s? There is no chance. Sketch comedy is back at least ten years ago. If I am at the gun point, I can only apologize for this film. Retro? Original. Sketches about the distorted clowns can cut the edge in some circles (and it may actually be funny) but it is very sad. What did I do throughout 75 minutes? It's pretty good that you can save a real funny skirt for the end. I gave the film 1 because it has a low score ... and I would only recommend insomnia or coma patients ... or maybe people suffering from lokozov ... their jaws are finally open with disbelief.
