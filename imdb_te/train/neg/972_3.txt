It's a frustrating film about a mysterious young girl and her nightmares. For horror or "thriller" film and hype, it's way too tangible. There are only a few moments here, not much for the film of this genre. The "era" scenes are not as well. <br /> <br /> There are so many experiments here that Elitist critics have described this as "an idea man's horror movie". If they think about it, I'm sure they will come to the same conclusion - money in the video rental store is waste. <br /> <br /> Summary: And generally poor acting. It is not well promoted.
