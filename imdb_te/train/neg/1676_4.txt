Wall Killer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, a solid show. Josh Lucas, a solid show. Three glamorous actors gave good performances. The problem, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Despite the fact that his poor, drug addicts, and AIDS were signed, an individual who continues to make adult films did not play a witty role. <br /> <br /> After the story and a tragic mass murder in Los Angeles at the end of the 80s, Holmes was arrested, arrested, murdered, and finally convicted. <br /> <br /> In the case of OJ, the guilt factor, regardless, is much higher in the "he made" zone. <br /> <br /> There is no sympathy in the film, a self-serving criminal. There is nothing remotely interested here.
