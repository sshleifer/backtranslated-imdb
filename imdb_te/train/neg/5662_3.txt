When I read most of the other comments, they were very bright for the film. I found that I completely lost the spark found in Zatoichi movies and just after a long absence from the screen, it just goes to prove things are often best to let things go.

I do not care about blood, but some can stop it (especially those with severed nose and severed heads).
