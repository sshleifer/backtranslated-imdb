I saw this movie in the youth group, my real youth leader and his wife squeed on it. Then some of the big couple in the church's Christmas party made themselves wrong to attend the film, and now my house is committed to this movie (though thankfully it is in its grill). I heard tears of tears on these tragic events, and why I'm here: First off: If you are a Christian like me, this film has good intentions. The film tries to show that you can trust in God and improve your life. Not so bad, right? Eh. This becomes a problem - bigger. This Church is made by a church, so each issue should be fully tasted to Christians as possible. It's all black and white, gray areas. <br /> The grace and determination of God in this picture is a matter of speculation, and it comes immediately to everyone who makes his commandments. <br /> This is not God I know. This is not a Christian life. I believe that God is a powerful and loyal God, but He is not the One who grants me every desire. I follow him as best as I can, but it is often difficult; Yet the football team in this film finds their humility and self-control more easily than anyone. I can not relate to the cardboard pieces that have come from bad side in some structured movie scenes. And when I follow His commandments in the Bible, I certainly do not find the rain in the blessing as these characters. The biggest of my immediate rewards is the thing I've ever known; <br /> <br /> Make an example of this film set: Grant Taylor coaches football team at Shiloh Christian School, there are 6 losing seasons in a row. He may lose his job, and he and his wife will have little money. They want a baby, but the doctor says he is clean. Oh, and his car does not work. And the boys in his football team are disrespectful to their parents, after their millions losses, and poor field goals. <br /> <br /> But Grant Taylor decides that he has confidence in God in all! He follows his faith to his team. So far everything is fine. Not long. They begin to obey, literally bless them in the POUR. Suddenly the students stopped to disrespect their parents; The school has a large "renewal"; Each team of the team starts to win; They also win the Grand Championship against the hardest team in the league! Coach Taylor job is guaranteed; The school gets him a shiny new truck (by the way, the shallow, the essence of perfect weather owners); He enhances one; His wife (get this) also gets pregnant from her clean sperm! And that skinny kid manages to kick his first darn field goal when it's really important! Wowzers, VAT, yes, praise the Lord, etcetera, etcetera !!! <br /> Just YIPE. In my church no one has ever experienced Christ in the cut and dry manner. Yes, my family has many miracles, as well as gifts and creatures. But it is not God who is a good haven or a bad hood that you can turn on and off! He is a mystery and a great mystery; His gifts come unexpectedly, if you feel that you do not need them, you really do. <br /> This is a long, tough slogan that leads to fulfillment, and they will never reject what you think. <br /> <br /> This film is good intentions. But due to its supreme seduction and total espazism, it's excellent tanks to 1/10. <br /> <br /> We hope that all the films in this movie will be made into a filmmaking. Do not be afraid to show real life, you have to add some uncomfortable facts into the mix. However, with this cotton candy treat worn by many people, no one learned from it significantly. Give us meat, bones, real stuff! True Life applies to all, not just Christians, and "Giants facing" is not a thing.
