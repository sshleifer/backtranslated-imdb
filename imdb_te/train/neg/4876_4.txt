... when he rebuilt Broadway Bill (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). The '50 Day 'screenplay is not only supported in Bing Crosby 34, as do Bruce. This sad film has total scenes lifted from the original with the support of a number of repeats of their characters, except that they are dead. The director does not matter even if he is old. Not many cars and clothing in the background plates since 1934 did not seem to match up to the standards of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> We both rated the original and remake IMDb four **** Stars. Frank's touch had gone too long and the rest was Capra-Corn. That does not stop Mr. Capra. After making 50 academic documentaries, he changed his career to Lady Howe (1933) to Recycling of Miracles (1961). Again casting fine was that IMDb was let down in Six ****** Most effort was attempted by Star Eight ******** Stars. After the European state (1948), it's good to leave it when you're still on the go.
