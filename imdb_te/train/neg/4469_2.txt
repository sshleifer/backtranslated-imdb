This game stopped playing in the middle of the play and made it to bits and then was the first player (respect) to be burning. Congratulations. <br /> Plot: If I type that word, I'm laughing. Not one. No character is developed. We finally have a * Beep * Mary-Sue, but unfortunately, she has a girl and a heroine of a girl who takes care of her, who is huge in her dress like her breast. They came to attract the sexiest boy gamers that you see. Nevertheless, she went to the tomb in the tomb, meeting her and performing the tomb. I do not know why she does that. I subtitle and t.v. I was loud enough and I still did not understand a damn thing. For her (or lack of), her two friends and * villains * were ridiculous. Also have levels that you have to go through that are supposed to give you any hint what you have next and you would literally have a lot of boring as hell tombs for hOURS you are trying to figure out what's hell. There is one of two courses specially on her on a motorbike (which is not fun for me), you will see without having to save the HOUR for ATLEASE. <br /> <br /> Bass Stupid F * ck: Levels do not seem too long for you, as long as you do not have any saving points, no story, no character development, never in the game, more music on a long range ear-bleeding And they do not give any indication to the player, so they are a long time <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: The thoughts sound like a bang-up. <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree with you. <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry, but these ideas look like they're the player most player. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Game-Play: All of them will shoot her. Moves while moving while moving, jumping, or kick shoots again. But jumping, jumping, and kicking does not wipe out the fact that it is being wiped out. Boring !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: Intro music is very beautiful. I love to hear. <br /> Visuals: In 2006, I'd take a look at the game and visualize that the visuals are going to get away from me. Not the best way. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: This game has lots of development for a plot less, no character (just forklyly) boring reason (no i might tell you) with unimaginative shooting gameplay. Stay away from a baby !!!!!!!! This is a tale of a child in a childhood (how little she is covered) and two stars to be beautiful in music.
