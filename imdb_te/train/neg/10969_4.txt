Maybe I'll get out of date or Electra does not know the same as in the current publications ... but I've read Electra is very fraudulent and always has a plan. She usually used others to perform her dirty work and did not have some sort of relationship with the double cross. <br /> <br /> The film is very weak in dialogue, acting is not particularly convincing, and action is spotty. I'm really looking for something like Frank Miller's book "Electra Assassin". <br /> <br /> In this movie, it was a lot darker. <br /> Cool, actions are interesting, but the plot and plot are neither slow nor inappropriate. Tha Hand is not enough menacing, and Electra ..... No bitchy is not enough. She's a girl I love you ... but in this story, I do not care either way.
