American filmmakers have decided to make a film that they think is Japan. The characters are all serious, and the actors are not Japanese and the set is cheap, but certainly does not represent Kyoto in the 20-30s and 30s. The script authors have read the book anytime adding the extra value to distinguish the image from the script. Worse, they also changed the original plot line with some goofs. Rob Marshall uses two well-known Chinese actors for his two main characters. Marshall is probably a Chinese movie and they represent Japan culture. Again, with the two actors, the films are becoming more ridiculous. In Kill Bill # 1, Quentin Tarantino is more than ten times that of Japan than the film.
