I heard from some people who brought tears to the theater. I first saw it and I look forward to another romantic, tear-jersey Barbra Streisand. We are like the Way. I'm definitely wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, has become impossible to be added to the characters. There is nothing romantic about it. Straussand's role fell into an alcoholic drug addict, and I could not sing a single without having hit the fast-forward button. At one point, her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him after five minutes. There is nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who does not recognize it until she dies. <br /> <br /> The death of John Howard is entirely imaginable. In the film was clearly anticipated of his carefree behavior, and he felt no emotion when he died. This is not a tragedy, he is basically an idiot. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the movie are stream songs. At the end of the film, "You Want More More You / Then That Sucklewatch" gave the movie 3/10. That was only part of the movie for 7 minutes and I felt really emotional and irritating.
