Another film depicting the faint, worn out clich√© of the mad scientist. The film is centered around surgery, whose life's ambition is to bring the dead. I know, I know ... never heard you before! Of course, all of these movies go, the experiment goes quite wrong, and creates a maniac, bloodthirsty creature. For this good setup, you may feel at least a bit curious. Wrong. Like many images of this era, the idea is good, but the execution and the script are mediocre. The worst horror film I've ever seen (no, the acid: Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but one of the gems, either.
