Full waste of time .... This movie is not funny, it's not a play, it's not romance ... even the young comedy at least !!! The story ... It should be at some end of some turns ... but it's frustrating! I would like to make the movie much better (turning "Fight Club") when it comes to cinematic film at the end but this turns the movie even worse ... When I see teens comedy, 'too often, I expect a group of lousy jokes and nudeness ... jokes are very lousy and nudity ... you only got one .... I must admit Law is good ... the girl, and that's it! And she totally wore the whole image! Acting is bad ... the soap series is ... do not waste your time! <br /> (Sorry in my bad English)
