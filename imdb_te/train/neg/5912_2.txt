After Mike Myers enjoyed previous work (Wayne's World and Saturday Night Live), my estimates of the 60s bond spoof were very high. This is the first minute after which it is a workout in what is vain and as unfair as possible. I read it ten minutes later. The second day I saw it for the first time to see if I was unfair. I changed it after ten minutes. I believe a twelve year old boy also found this funny thing. The dialogue is an embarrassment, Myers are more bad in the role of characters, including the sadness (like Heather Graham) and the Fat Bastard. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen, apart from a slightly amusing title and psychedelic design. I personally recommend you avoid this as a plague, although many people of mine enjoyed (maybe they were drenched eyes at the time).
