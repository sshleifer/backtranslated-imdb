When do you stop hurting? I never want to see another version of a Christmas Carol again. They keep making movies with the same story, trying to break each other to make the film work better, but it can not sin because it is not a good story. Moralistic, old-style, traditional, happy to think. People know. We have shown that we have not done many different versions of the film.
