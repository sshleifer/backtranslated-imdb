The film is part of the 2007 Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival. <br /> <br /> In fact, I really like the images that allow time and stories to be taken to improve, and the flow of stories. Stillism is good. But this film is just slow. <br /> Credit must go to two main actors. There is a sense of tension between the two different people, the misfits are really, in a very difficult way. <br /> When I learn more about them, there are soft movements and suffering. <br /> <br /> It is claustrophobic and monochrome and adds the intimacy of the film to the peculiarities of the characters. <br /> I can not understand the ending. What is it all point?
