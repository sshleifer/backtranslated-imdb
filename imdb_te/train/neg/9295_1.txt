I was surprised at how bad the film was. Nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take this film so far. <br /> <br /> This is why the Kunku Fu movies have taken a bad reputation in the first place. <br /> <br /> This film is very boring and frustrating because it reminds you because it is very boring and frustrating. The game believes the game with a girl when trying to play a girl. I think every time your frenzied battle is feeling a little different, they say, "Oh haha, I think you are with your super powers and 10,000 Ray guns, but my vitamins are plutonium and teflon, so your ray guns do not work and I'm away from your super powers .... tap any trade infinity plus one backwards Are adversely. ") Children can continue this silence, no one listens because they are having a fun time. However, for the viewer, especially the adult viewer, this tall movie is worse than bad gas. <br /> <br /> If you have a knife if your kung fu is not strong, it will hurt if you are in the PCP, (b) if you fall behind your back, it will have a knife More damage, fake prop, (c) when you cut the heart with a knife, especially in ancient China, without the Kaiser Permnant around the corner, (d) kung fu fight Alu not hours. <br /> <br /> However, it's perfect in its own small world.
