Spoiler Contains The movie storyline is summarized in some sentence: Three boys are hunted in the forest. Two of them were shot in the head without explanation. The last person can clearly stand, shake and do nothing without a shot. He walks through an old factory and leads his scope to the right in the fight against evil people. Villains are comfortable with black dresses and are seen as villains. <br /> <br /> This is not entirely detailed, as a whole story. Everything drawn with a guy standing on a door bell ringing. We'll wait with him. Woods and sleepy are bored. We take them a nap. <br /> <br /> There is a terminator like Diet and not a lot of actions, but a shot by a female jogger can be removed. The characters just do not speak. And then they do not have something to say, 'I'll come back'. I'm looking forward to him, because I have a lot to do with camera controls, if I take my friend over the weekend. It is totally unacceptable to pay for renting this DVD. <br /> <br /> The lesser thing is that the director told them how they had fired the police and led them as a random guy running around the gun. If they do it, I'm sure the movie will be more fun to watch.
