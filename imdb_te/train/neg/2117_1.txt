The brides die at the altar, and their bodies are disappearing. Everyone is concerned, but no one knows how to prevent how to behave. I did not bear with me. Bela Lugoshi is responsible for transferring the spine from these young women to transfer this former wife and keep her alive. Continue bothering me. Finally, the authorities have found that anyone will be engineered to death and disappearance, but in fact they can not recognize the incomparable intention. Let's just ignore the ridiculous pseudo-science and move ... If you can get through this stirring the first twenty minutes, you'll be treated to Lugosi striking his laboratory assistant for insulting one of the bridges he kills, explaining he sleeps in a coffin more comfortable than a bed, And other vague horror of real horror films Ukaranalu (budgets and the kind of plot). Anyhoo - A female journalist follows the nose for the offender (and the uncommon worn noise does not appear anywhere!), Then the play really starts. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and acting are fine. There are a lot of people in this movie that is very cool, very weird. Directing justice, and the script material is slightly better than the material is deserved. However, the film failed to increase interest in all but a very hardened B-movie fan. This is the best thing ... It will end up, but not immediately enough.
