<br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I am a Uwe boll adversary like a lot of humorless people on IMDb! <br /> <br /> Uwe boll films such as postal and tunnel rats are ridiculously bad and entertaining. But honestly, this movie is just terrible. I'd like to give it a zero star rating. The story is just the worst! It spent four fifths to build the plot and then in the middle of it, which was just gray horrifying murderous murder! Finally, it ends with "The End of Villain Successes", which is totally acceptable but definitely more tasteless! <br /> I'm not against the Wool boll (as I said before) or against the violent films! I love the f ** king's violent movies! Tokyo Gore Police, The New York Ripper, The 28 Years, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, Last House on the Left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, Every Tarantino Movie, Every Sam Peckinpa, Cannibal Holcost! This is it! Omfg !!! <br /> It is cruel, ruthless and disorganized! See movies I've read! If I liked the cannibalist, it should be bad! Uwe, do not go all the darkness again! You're so fun when you're like Ed Wood. It's just awful! <br /> <br /> When I saw this, I thought it was awful. <br /> See! Avoid all costs !!!!!
