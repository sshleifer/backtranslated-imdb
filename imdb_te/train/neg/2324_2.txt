I agree with two user comments, the two main characters are well-directed, Gary Gilmore and Giovanni. Very bad story is very boring. I did not hear about the film, I do not know anything, so nothing about Gary Gilmore before the movie. I felt like a dead man walking or a chamber but how wrong I was. Talking about the whole movie, talking and talking about their mother and father. There are only cool scenes in the glasses where dad loses its temper. This is the interest I received from this bourse.
