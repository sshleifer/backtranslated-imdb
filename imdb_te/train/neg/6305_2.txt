This is a great story and the beginning of equality in the United States. (We're still working on it.) Even though it's true, this is still a movie and it's a movie site. I find it hard to get good actors in independent movies, but WOW. The single person is also amazing ossie Davis. But he was not prepared for all the actors (including a teenager playing him) for a completely painful acting. The script is a terrible clich√©, but also you got to get some good actors! I do not recommend this recommendation for everyone because it is very small for each category. Read some books about the true story of US.Son, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
