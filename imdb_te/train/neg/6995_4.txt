We're here with the soft, action pack, gory and "hoopie" filled 2 hours MTV video. <br /> <br /> It is not original compared to other recent remakes (Chainsaw Massacre Total Disaster) ... Round that is pretty good acting, "Who Will Die Next" and completely out of curiosity and curiosity are that they are producing plenty of original revenues alone The whole cash in the name Dan ... <br /> <br /> Does the remakes of classic get on your nerves?
