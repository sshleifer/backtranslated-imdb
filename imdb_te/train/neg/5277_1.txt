I was surprised by how this was caught in this showtime tonight and closed a picture of an interesting premise so being so unbelievable awful. Who is your father Brandon Davis adopted high school senior Kris Hughes, a geek, who gave up his biological parents as a descendant of a romantic empire. The motion pictures, such as the film, can be a lot of fun, and it is the first time directing director Andy Fickman, Clutch, and the direct screening of the imaginative screenplay, which also played badly with live-video-video standards. Even the funny boy Charlie Talbert's best friend is a surprisingly tedious appearance. This lame and unfunny garbage is only a good part of only Ali Laundry. 1/10
