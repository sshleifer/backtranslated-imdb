Looking at this I mainly saw ad placements. DHL, Aquafite strips, rock star and more. This is a product placement after another. It is very clear how this film has earned its funds. Jessica Simpson's "acting" is ridiculous. No dick should never get to work because he plays the same lame role. "Story" This is a very commercially a theme. I can not believe that the film was also considered for the theatrical release. You're watching this movie. You will suffer everyone involved. Larry Miller and Rachel Lee Cook are the only small savings credits, although Jessica's cousin has no screen time. I'm totally impatient and I see the whole thing. I would recommend avoiding this.
