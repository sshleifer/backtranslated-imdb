This is the first of the "I Died 8 Movies" collection and it's not exactly made me want to see what's in the rest ... even though I've heard that at least a couple of them are good. I do not know, it's not terrible, but it really did not make me much. Your primary illness in Siberia is the family, mother & father who died, and that family is sold to farmers in San Francisco (this is the best part of the creepy Goths sister, a friend from the school he has ever left.) Of course, of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on This family is like a white bread version of Sawyer Klan They are evil and they do bad things but they are fighting without any soul I've seen a lot of reviews from people who liked it and I do not know what I missed but I found it to be very common & I really recommend anyone to 10 to 4.
