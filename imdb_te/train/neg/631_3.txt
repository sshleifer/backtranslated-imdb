Amazing. If you sit through this film you say. Just, amazing, amazing. It's pretty awesome that you really are stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity not what you've seen. My friends, this film is really scary. Some people think this is a good idea. <br /> <br /> The High School Student (occasionally called College?) is a prostitute for a mother who lives in a trailer park and ridiculed an "artist" who is his "different." Well, of course, this poorly ridiculous boy eventually murdered and, the original part here, his soul lives in a scarecrow (under which he killed his slutty Mama's latest John). Then he sees the standard of killing all the people who hurt him. <br /> <br /> Here is the breakdown: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a sequel to a disc in Wal-Mart $ 5.00 bin and it's just overpriced. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> Will they make some effort to music? But it's not really good for the movie and it's not as good. /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> - Terrible, terrible acting. <br /> <br /> Let's have a different slasher with sexy ladies? <br /> <br /> The glorious story. <br /> <br /> - The basic underlying love story has gone nowhere, and has not been done correctly. <br /> Some of the randomly selected people? No one knows you and they are killed. <br /> <br /> - Just a mean slasher charge, instead of a murder scarecase? <br /> <br /> This is worse than Angela's interesting from Freddy Krueger, Jason Vourhees, Pinhead, Chucky, or "Sleepaway Camp" series. <br /> The whole worst conversation I've ever heard in my life. The script is filled with a level that is retarded that I never imagined. I'm serious here and it's a complete phase than terrible. I can not get it wrong, but it is funny as hell, but I have never heard of it, "Slumber Party Massacre III". The film will make "Jason X" look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The guy who kills the scarecrow is always worse. <br /> <br /> Elementary scenes: <br /> <br /> All primary schoolchildren split their own intriguing conversation: "Hey, let's look for small animals to torture huh. <br /> Acting: 3/10 Story : 3/10 Climate: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Role Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Make Up: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (Nudity, Mother Courtesy, girls wear any bras) Violence / Gore : 5/10 (low quality, medium amount) Language: 0/10 (Very ridiculous, blatant, over-the-top and painfully my first rating for dialogue in any movie!): 5/10 Directed by: 2/10 <br /> Chess: 10/10 Compression: 9 <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The characters are not really boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentH azard.com
