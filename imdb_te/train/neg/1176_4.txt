Revolutions always provide opportunities for dramatic films, in fact, many revolutions are dramatic events. Unfortunately, this film does not know what's in play is compensation by overabundance of boredom. Whoever wins, loses, dies or lives - end up as soon as possible. What's up to me for the use of background technology is very big for me. Paris and French rural scenes have cardboard quality. They make a good step and leave that way. Can not imagine the amazing effects of "The House of the Flying Dogs" or "The Golden Compass", but it was the 2002 digital marketing product. The characters enter a scene to enter a scene, so the rooms are often entered by a number of characters. In my view, the movie revolves around the French Revolution of the 1790s as the "papier-cache" revolution in the "Papier Kale" world.
