It's a stellar cast and a horrific script that really stands out as a "lock stock" clone. I do not know why many top British actors signed this waste, they should be bribes. The miss match of a storyline will never be and will always happen and if I do not pay good money for it, then I turn it off after 10 minutes. I'd say 'GUMMO' (I'd be called 'director' for the lost hour), but this garbage is almost down right there, so I went to the bogroll that used to really pathetic movie. One of the worst 5 films I have ever seen is definitely one. Such stuff does not really have a monopoly of horror films for Hollywood.
