I could not waste a lot of time for this film review because I had to give an alternative view to help avoid the film. The animation crude and the story changes between boring / mean to most irritating. Humor is completely lost on the audience, and yes - the ghost of yes - shell fans, this action is not science fiction or something - an attempt at its comedy comedy, and humor can not work after just translate. The whole task is to see this film, and I have a terrible way to leave the filmfest, especially considering how I feel emotional and open - I can not imagine a ghost in the shell sequel, but I expect something entertaining, and it just does not achieve this. Emanuel ... instead of renting the Kinos Journey.
