A film written and directed by Neil Young, "Greedley" is less than a Dexsen or more set of songwriter's works than a 87-minute music video. Instead of dialogue, the film relies heavily on the lyrics of "Young", specifically linked to the social-political commentary, to "story" when "actors" broadcast the scenes. <br /> <br /> Harmony shows and Shadow Grindness movie, Young is very similar to the release of some of his own home movies and releasing them for public consumption. Although the "story" running through the film is alleged, the film's unpolished look, lack of dialogue and the unfinished gratitude for the performance, does not know what will happen. The hippies of all ages that we receive for eighty-seven minutes are silently caused by an involuntary story, while the young songs play indefinitely in the soundtrack. The whole thing turns into a tedious exercise in self-pleasure. "Greentley" of Hollywood offers a low-budget movie-bad name.
