Directed by the idea and plot of the film is absolutely original ... However, for those who read 'Slam Dunk' comic, the characters are very similar and some jokes are clear ... <br> Jay Chou does not know himself Kung Fu, as if he can try it can not impress anyone, many people today can see the differences .. Luckily the film <br /> <br /> The joy of Joy's performance is still very sad, most of the people in the film are better than everyone else. <br /> <br /> I want to stop anyone from watching this way. This "Regular" film should not do this. This year it was one of the best budget films in China.
