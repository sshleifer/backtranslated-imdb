This image is very bad! Very bad! It's awesome! I can not stress enough! Acting, directing, story, characters and everything about it is bad! It is brown and cliche. Do not be fooled by the cover, or there is nothing to laugh at the tagline "The 'Texas Massacre'." Are you funny It's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> For the first two minutes until the main character arrives in Brendon, it's fine now. I came from the cinema, a group of ugly, annoying and immature people go to a clown who kills them in a cabin and nursery rhymes unnatural and fake ways in the middle of Woods. This film is ruined my time and money, and this is your money and time is also worthless! I fast forward through the movie a lot because it's terrible, I just wanted to see how every bad actor died, and it still is not worth it! Just looking at the cover is time waste. This is a very bad movie! Rating: Not a qualification.
