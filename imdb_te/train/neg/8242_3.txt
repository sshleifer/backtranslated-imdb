Only after seeing the speed of the eye, be honest ... I do not like it. <br /> <br /> I have read many good reviews in this movie, but I did not find where these reviews came from. <br /> <br /> I've got a lot of time in film making, the directors are good, but the main problem they have is that there are two cameras used in the whole movie (it's perfect) but they're really less cameras. Another problem is the sound, all the girls talking simultaneously talking and shouting, talking to everything - it's just impossible to hear what they say. It's a good idea, they hit a car in a car, and then they are driven by a mad woman who wants to kill and kill the car after they hit the car, and there are so many opportunities! ... and on the other hand there are plenty of opportunities for girls to escape, but do not! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ... I just scrap it just by this!
