Despite the spectacular cast, this is a special film, especially from the flight angle. It's something superior to "Van Richtophen and Brown", but not too much. "Blue Max" is the best in a small market over the last 35 years, "Darling Lily" is fun if not seriously considered. It is interesting to imagine what ILM can do with Zeppelin and Godas in a new, high quality WW I Aero film.
