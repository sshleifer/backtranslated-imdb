I feel totally ripped off. Anyone needed to pay $ 4.95 back at a blockbuster to rent a mess in this house. It's not a musical full of time and my evening full of fun. Why was not I being delivered in the first place ??? ... Some people are doing some heavy drugs on the night of the contract. I have come out of good films from film schools and I am going to film school so I can say that it is a fact. The quality of this work is also very bad to see SO ... the shot in the DV put it. Songs are not songs, but they stop the same sounds in each section. Want to see a good music? Do not rent this movie.
