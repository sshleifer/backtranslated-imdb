It's 1978, and yes certainly teams are black black players too! Fans are upset and perfectly 75,000 seats are complete, and only the most black players in the field are less happy! It is made for the TV Super Bowl movie. It's not too much, but really a performance (for the time), perhaps surprisingly casting talented actors that make Tom Selleck in particular. Unfortunately for any goodness Selleck brings the screen, is quickly trumped by "actors" like Dick Butkus. <br /> <br /> It is a silly story about betting the Super Bowl. In this case, PJ Jackson is charged with "New York" (reading the mafia) for ensuring a $ 10,000,000 bet in their favor. PJ is na√Øve enough, and has a loose glimpse by purchasing some people here and there. But things seem to him to decline. Another person, the unsuspecting Lainie, takes charge. For some time, the mystery of the murders is unknown, but Lenin is clearly the new enemy of the final killer. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, but it's worth watching. Acting is good, and the shoot is okay. At least no silly typical 70 car customers (not here). <br /> <br /> Think publicly about the past truth and the cocaine era. <br /> <br /> <br
