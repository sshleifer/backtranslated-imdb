Too, what a painful Bourne sci-fi movie! And that is especially saddening because the start-pack and the start of the 15-minute finish is so full! During the introductory, we follow a bunch of nervous security bosses and a full briefcase with top secret files as we chase a doctor who escaped from a secret laboratory. He was executed as he was going to be exposed to the horrific & inhuman incidents in the laboratory. Statistics ?? Since then, the 'action' between the two places varies between the above laboratory and the rural building of a corrupt senator (or something), and it becomes clear that the experiments are actually the opposite of disruption. It is more dull, mean and vague. Scientists have chosen four random people without relatives and even though they really read the content of their minds on a really big machine, they really are really really important to speak the truth anyway. They hide the dark secrets from their feet and the people are suffering when it comes to survival; And yet I am unable to see how these tests can occur on the humanitarian-bullying device. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt it. Interaction between patients and doctors is also less interesting, because no one of them has personality. So basically, "Brain Machine" is just about a group of lame people living in a grimly decorated room. It would have been less than half an hour if the buildings were not shots of thousands of years! From the laboratory to the villa and vice versa each time by five-second strokes of the locations. The manufacturers really need padding, or all size-sized viewers feel that they are unable to detect a change of location. I'm assured you, looking at a pool that left the building for a tenth time in just five minutes. The performance of the best of James Bestson with psychological difficulties is good, but a person can certainly not save this thing in absolute waste of time. Avoid!
