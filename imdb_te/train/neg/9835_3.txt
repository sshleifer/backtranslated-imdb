Before I explain the "alias" comment, "The Desert Trail" is also bad in Western terms that I have seen three stooges. It is actually Carmen LaRoux's semi-bad girl junior, when she listens to a Mexican accent you can identify Senorita Rita from her little classic stozy with her "Belle Saved". <br /> <br /> <br /> John Wayne plays Mo Howard in "The Desert Trail" and Eddie Chandler plays the role of Curly Howard. Like their Stooge counterparts, Mog's hitting curly is a 53-minute film. Wayne's character, chasing a skirt, is not very fascinating, but it is a good guy. <br /> <br] The passing Rodeo Cowboy Wayne is a gun at the box office at the box office and takes a good hit when his attendance - other riders make 25 cents a dollar (which is still short after Wayne's box office termination). Wayne's ripping off the riders and is still given any explanation for which the girl gets considered. <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul Fix-starred villain (Al Ferguson) and his accomplice Larry Fine to play the role of Sheriff Micah in Television's "Rifleman Man" and then steal the money from the Wayne Rob box office and kill the Rodeo manager. Mo and Curley were blamed. <br /> <br /> Mo and Curley move their names to Smith and Jones, going into another town to keep the law away. First they meet who but their old friend Larry, whose sister is interested in the 2nd half love (Senorita Rita is left in the old town and will not appear in the movie). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister is a bright charming Mary Cornman (now grown up, but in her short days she has done well in one of her original roles of Hal Roach's "Our Gang" shorts). The main reason for seeing Merne-Kunt Westerns is that her scenes with Mo and Curley are better than those who are in production, as they are entirely portrayed by another crew. <br /> <br /> The action sequence is too weak for these issues in 1935 and the technicality of the film is very bad. The two main chase scenes end up with a wide range of rider's stunts falling from a horse, with stock footage. The editor twice took a shot to one of the characters moving on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the film stock is totally different, and the role of the character is more different than the stunt rider. Other places have a generous use of stock footage, none of which is remotely convincing. <br /> One thing to watch is that Moss and Curley come on their horses and drive them from the cabin to the cabin, from the left to the cabin (from the cabin to the right). The cameraman slowly follows the two stoves on the right side of the pan and then whip the pan to the left to reveal the nearby pussis. I have never seen this outside of home movies because it looks stupid (though it does), but because a competent director can never make a scene in this manner. They filmed two riders who had left, and then camera and film could reach Possis as a separate action. Or if they are creative they will show the front riders of the camera and they will be in step in order so approaching Posey in the background. <br /> Again, what do I know? I am only a child.
