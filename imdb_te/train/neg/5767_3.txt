As mentioned earlier, the visual effects are excellent. They're breathtaking. I personally use the blender and such graphics are not easy for everything. But this picture is all there. The plot is not confusing, the whole conflict is not clear. For example, in the very first scene, Progog and Emos are trying to flee from those who know. This conflict is between man and nature. Later, when they enter the bottom of the pit, Prago describes "out of one foot and (as you die)". Here, there is a more precise conflict between the neglected man and nature. As the film progresses, it is clear that there is a dispute between man and nature. But suddenly, when a dispute between man and man prog, somewhere out there, murders emo. Being a sick person will soon learn to be a lost kid and be a caregiver. He cheated us. This is not discouraging, but we do not care because the controversy between the character's ideas and actions is developing. This is not about the story, but by the fight, it will emerge strongly. It is discouraging because there is no great truth about the world that has been brought about as mental as a soul or as a great play. In my opinion, this film is intensely developing in all aspects. However, the graphics are excellent, but a picture is much more than eye candy. No truth, no struggle and a bad surprise ended. At the end, the image that was developed without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
