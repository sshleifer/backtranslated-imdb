Some people take into consideration a painting-expressing your imagination on the image to create an image of pain and death .. The film is a disgust and I do not want to be released forever. This film is repulsive, careless and nonsense. It's not totally waste of time, but it will make you sick in the coming days. The horror images shown in this movie are not only for you to comprehend for the wind but they take your mind and take days to forget them. People with such illness will lose their imagination unexpectedly. "Kill Bill" is another example but at least "Kill Bill" has its purpose, meaning, climax and clarity.
