The film was created for the Grammys very hard and suddenly the criteria. This film is as bad as most of the 80's critters / trolls / gremlins movies. The sad part is that there is no punchline for that comment. <br /> <br /> The problem with the image of this subtle monster is that it really tries to be funny and like a guy who's like a whale Mandel. Changing the 80s of horror movies into classics is that they're really scary, but they are very happy because they're happy. Some Bettina Hirsch (Yes the Bettina Hirsch) had a knack for comedy before directing the film. Unfortunately they are wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " His Paul Reiser wannabe schtick ended credits only enough to start fast forwarding from the time of his first scene until stopping to see a scene that only a munchie throws pool balls at a man ... I'm not that. /> <br /> So the bottom line runs, the manager does not walk your nearest blockbuster and shake hands, thank you for not having this garbage stack grapes on the shelves.
