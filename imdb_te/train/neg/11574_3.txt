Goodnight, Mr. Tom begins in an impossible sensitive village in the south of England, where the Sun always shines. We hear a radio statement of the announcement of World War II before we think a lot about the time. Soon the steam's steam clouds bring refugee children from London and our story begins with a cheerful old Tom (who knows you have a heart of gold) reluctantly shy of William. <br /> <br /> It's what's the sentiment scrapp. In fact it is the old odd couple couple formula. <br /> <br /> Did new stories not be written? <br /> <br /> You do not feel any longer in the village. And the blazing no-hint of Blitz's horror like the courtesy file of London's civilians attacked in the air shelters. <br /> <br /> When my wife did not like the movie, I enjoyed my wife for all the reasons I did not like, <br /> <br /> In a minority <br /> <br />
