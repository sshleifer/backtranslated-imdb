Suppose I look nice and sophisticated to see the amazing things in the perfect vacuum of the movie like this. We can relax and enjoy the glimpses of a number of Hollywood films with no meaningful exploits, explosions, foul language, and a one-liners without clapping. Minimalism is in its place and is very effective when doing the job correctly. However, this film is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Get a lengthy look with any dialogue and a depressing, short scene. I'm sure they should have great meaning and insight, because the predictable message in guise in speculation. The acting was poor ... the tramp and the pedestrian ... and one of the most horrific scenes in history (at the end of the movie, if you eventually sit it). The scene of the girl's ridiculous long-term ending with a scene scene and barren park is pleasant for pulling the tooth. I called this antitiomic, but the film did not build any climax ... even in the "sexy" scenes ... this is not true. I think there is a script working during filming, but with the amount of speech, I think it's written in a cocktail napkin. Generally, this film is nothing to interest or marvel at ... no great story, no fantastic ideas, no visual drama, no excitement. Unlike two or three amusing moves, the film was wasted for two hours. A pathetic boring and daunting image.
