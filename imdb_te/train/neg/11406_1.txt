But I got on it. With me, the author of the book also liked Caroline. I'm sorry for character Luis, and she constantly compares it with Esa who is bad, so I felt a bit tough and un-realistic to comparison. However, the movie is very bad. You can not really see it unless you're ready for a bigger break.
