Ben Stiller does not respond very much. And he's going to do well. He relied heavily on the comedy around him. In Their Something About Mary, the stand-up hair scene only attempts to strike Stiller directly. <br /> He encounters Mary's other two suitors, who is the wealthiest man in the room, but the scene is happy. <br /> <br /> In the camp in Poli, the principle is very difficult. Stiller has a humorous talent around it. Hank Azari and Phillip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, the few of them. Huffman relies on a bit more on physical humor - you know we're in trouble when rare jokes go up to raise a smile. Hoffman is completely ignored in the basketball scene under the hammer hammers (a stupid response throws a misfortune in the form of a shirtless opponent who increases a smile). However, everyone seems to be acting in a bubble, where there is little reaction. Hofmann and Stiller's characters have been very active at each other. Aniston repeats his Rachel role again, but Stilller does not. <br /> <br /> Polly is a rom-cam of a number of numbers and it fails - it's not heart. You do not have to root for the characters. With a little more work we may have a deep story, but ultimately the failure of the film drops to poor writing. It is worth watching if you slowly pop in on TV at night, but you'll regret forking out cash to see.
