Spoiler warning Was it spoiled upcoming though I can this one ?? The film is made from this studio with these stars, which is very scary, but it is hard to guess. <br /> <br /> Rich Wife's surviving American elite Penn Gellard leaves his younger daughter in "charge" and leaves for World War I. Was killed. Then we are going to the current day (1942) and the whole confusion. Three sisters have been in court for twenty years and have been trying to keep the slummer named Barclay out of their home. It began with the script and more unanswered questions with more holes than Warren Report. What happened to Gaylere's fortune? If half a billion worth, why has the family gone home from a wealthy palace to the home of the Mundars? Who is the Barclay clown? And why can anyone take home from them? Questions can be piled on more questions. <br /> Generally friendly and graceful George Brent, pretends to be Barclay, without a little bit of guilt; And no one particularly fond of this chretin, along with Fiona (Barbara Stanwick). Why? None of these questions have ever been answered. We instead follow Fiona's life from a train wreck, bad Barclay her house, her luck, and her baby will take away. What does she do? To call him? Should he be thrown into the fire? No, very logical. When she is completely incompatible, this woman, formerly romantic with Barclay, marries, raises, raps her, hates her, does not hate her, loves her. And they are going to live happily anytime. Suddenly, this early women's role model of independence and power has been transformed into the usual hopeless ankle-twisting twit appearing in movies during this era. Yes, sure, belongs to me and I steal everything in the world that I am in love with you. What planet is it on? I can not imagine that I have never heard of this film before I get hold of Turner because today it's lost on contemporary audience.
