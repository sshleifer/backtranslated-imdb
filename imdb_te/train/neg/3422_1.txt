Oh dear, oh dear. I started looking at this without knowing what to expect. I can not believe what I saw. It was a comedy. I disagree with how the government is going to take over the terrorist leader, I think a disarmant can be thrown into the air, holding him and thinking that the rocket pad could be avoided. It's really easy. Finally, I saw the film more than "Plan 9 from Outer Space".
