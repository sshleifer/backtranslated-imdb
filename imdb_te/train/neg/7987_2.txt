I am this "WOAH!" One thing to think about is when the Epcot opened in 1982, but now it's just silly. The image's message is clich√©. Circle-Vision will degrade. In the end that horrible song hates. And I wish they'd install the seats. After so much walk, you have to sit for a few minutes. And when you read it, it looks pretty attractive! While sitting you will get entertainment, right? Wrong! You're standing there 18+ minutes leaning against small railing. Disney is new to make it attractive to the mall storm and replace this dull, cartilage image. Not fun. Skip. In fact, leave the whole country completely unless you're eating there. Move directly to the United Kingdom.
