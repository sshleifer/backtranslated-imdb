Remembering the dirty details of this fraudulent vapid "movie" is a rusty dip in your chest cavity, dug with salted spoon. Perhaps "Homes Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) was a bit of an imaginary side, but this tragic suspense film was one of the most shameless bids I ever heard. A boy who is fighting spy / terrorists while staying alone in the Chicago suburb of Chicago suburb? Ridiculous! Why should this image be made? I'm also kind of man who believes that horrible movies are not waste time, but learning experiences. However, this is actually a waste of time. It should be avoided at all costs.
