I first said that I should be totally honest that I fell asleep somewhere in the middle of the way, so I can not give the whole idea of ​​the film. Generally, a group of pirates, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bressla), plan to make a fortune to steal abortions from the Finishm Maternity Hospital. It acts as a title character, Mattran (Hattie Jacques), along with staff Sir Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Havre), Dr. Prod (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Patients and their visitors are also Mr. Pretty (Jon Sims) and her nephew husband, Mr. Tyday (Kenneth Connor). Bill Menard was cast as Freddy and East Enders' Wendy Richard as Miss Willing. By the way this plan does not get out by the way, because all staff are getting in the way. Pretty much I can say about the film until I see it again full. OK!
