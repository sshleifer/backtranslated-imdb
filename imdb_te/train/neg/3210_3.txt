In this way there is no way to lay around the bush, Lady Death: Motion Picture is just plain sucks. Graphic violence is made up of the cartoon mentality of 1980 based on the film action figures line, rather than the fact that a good endless blonde running around hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts. The bad guy also speaks like a scullet venevre, the dominant wizard, who lives in a cave that was later designed by the villain's domain from the BlackStar Cartoon on Saturday morning. Just do not expect any humor other than noling bad conversation sometimes. At other times it is anime story better, yet there is no sex, tenttape rape (thanks for courtesy!) And much less sex appeal, although it has the physical appearance of the title character. If you do not count the half naked heroine and bloody deaths, this is not an adult edge. In particular, there is a feature length episode where we have the she-ray, power of the princess, but the skimpier clothes and more that we have here.
