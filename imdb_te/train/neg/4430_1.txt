Thanks to a poor, dimensional screenplay by Neal Simon, and thanks to poor motion from Robert Moore, Chapter Two became a dark show for Marshall Mason starring in the film, receiving four of her Oscar options for Chapter Two, where she was awarded Cinderella Liberty 73), The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only When I Laugh (81); Moore ki Neil Simon's The Cheap Detective (78) and Third and Last Movie Chapter Two directed by Murder By Death (76). Ken is a false factor, the characters are mono-dimensional, the dialogue is overly analytic, and virtually no structural detail. The first half is less attractive than a combination between a beautiful, dazzling Kanyan and Chipper Mason, and the second half will make you the first half of time. NYC positions as well as Joe Bologna, and a painfully thin Valerie Harper are not associated, but at least they offer some welcome distraction. Last and least, there was a terrible song played during credits.
