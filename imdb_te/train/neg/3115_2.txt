I rarely write a negative review for this site, but felt at this time committed. <br /> <br /> Knight Lizner, one of the most dullest films I have ever seen, is without doubt. <br /> <br /> I do not know what's going on in this film. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, no actions, thrills, no suspense, nothing. There are no highlights (no spoilers - there is nothing to spoil): a man coming up through a window, a dog barking outside a hotel room, a car going on some tough ground and a truck that horns it. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "One Hour Photo" and wished for a similar sarcastic character from Williams, but he was very frustrated. What's more disappointing is I'm sure there's a good picture somewhere - the idea is interesting and I should have felt sympathetic for the characters, but it just does not work for me. I might have also given 1/10 but that score is reserved for producers remake
