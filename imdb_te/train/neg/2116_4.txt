The Poverty Row horror films of the 1930s and '40s have given me a penalty of mine. I know there is nothing against low-budget films, but those produced at the time are unclear about them, in ultimate analysis, are not very good. "The Corpus Vashes" is a bit more entertaining than the bottom-of-the-barrel darck, such as "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man", but it's not classic. Bela Lugosi spent his "Dracula" Haydeyday, a mad doctor; Unable to bear Elizabeth Russell plays with his wife. They sleep in the coffins, because Lugosi is more comfortable than a coffin bed, explaining to a suspicious young woman reporter (Luna Walters). Ho ham. Angelo Rositto and Minerva Eurekal are also in the hands, which can help hardcore fans of the '30s and' 40s movies.
