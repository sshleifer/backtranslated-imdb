Honestly, I can not be bothered to write my time about this milestone of cinematic excellence - life is just too small. I say that Alone in the Dark will only succeed in three things: 1. It laughs at you, but for all the bad reasons. <br /> <br /> It will throw many worthless plots in the air and throw them all off. <br /> <br /> It is completely insulting the Classic PC game based on the failure of all aspects of film-making. <br /> Doctor boll, here), what are you doing on the director's chair on earth?
