At the beginning of the film, the director attempts to play a role, instead of the story that directs the story instead of the story, because he is okay, a kind of movement he wants to do, and a story to suit. And he failed very seriously. I guess he's trying to make a beautiful image. Anyway, I feel the total waste of time and effort of this film. In the director's credit, he knew about the media he was working on, and I saw the worst pictures of what I was doing. At least here the director knows how to continue the sequel. And the actors also have a good performance.
