In fact, someone who does not feel like having a good film is not able to appreciate quality films. The film is an insult to watch, in the direction of high school film class quality and cinematography. The Blair Witch Project has a good cinematography and I attribute that hobby! The storyline is a very good movie, but it's flat in the rest of the movie from the rest 10 minutes. Someone said that someone is a child's predictor, good and good. But they could do better than they did with this script. I mean, India in the store. Do you imagine the Indian and the whole story about the child's small statue and Indian spirit known as Vendigo? They mentioned about the shop employee and she told me that she normally does nothing but works here, so you think it's creepy devil scenario, but then she just bang the whole bomber and forget about the little kid we saw this guy. It's dull and it's beyond curiosity. The conclusion left OWG was not only Otis in the hospital but also with wondering what was left !!! Why hell I waste my time watching this !! This is a move I recommend not to see, there are absolutely good quality movies out there that do not insult your intelligence! Thanks to the God I always pay to see this film, I demanded my money! It's very painful for those who are easily entertained by the movie, telling you that it's a good movie to reduce your standards to the level of the film.
