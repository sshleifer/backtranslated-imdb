If you like movies with a small plot exposure shaken with kinky sex, this picture is for you. Plus the main actor / actress (newly transferred) has an interesting screen presence, but it's not enough to add up to a little more interesting film - that. There is essentially 3 social outcasts (transexual prostitute, male hustler, and Russian, gay migrants) who have developed some bond of this film. Why is not it clear? We believe these missifoses are silent, they are silent on the court, and they have the ability to love their body on the street. Right !! And Anna Nicole Smith fell in love with his ninety good Daddy! The filmmaker shows us the gritty, unpleasant side of life when he wants to believe us below These are seriously damaged people until they really have a trail that can really help them through a lifestyle. Very fantasy, but unfortunately the actual form of wild life is depicted here. In sum, no plot, no truth and the real reason to spend most of the time here. Of course you like to break in the cook!
