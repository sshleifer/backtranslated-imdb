I'm sorry, I'm hoping to escape the holidays as I am now, and I'll ruin the plot line and the end for you. Dad dies and asks Santa in a letter to bring Santa back to his family for Christmas ... and Santa does. Father Pheichi is happy, healthy and unaware of the fact that he died. <br /> <br /> If you look like a parent who has lost a friend of his best dogs at age 5, it's a horror film. My son convinced Santa to ask him to bring back his son now! Do not underestimate the frustration of a younger heart - it is no longer enough to persuade it to convince that the film and his dog will not come back for Christmas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Recently you have been humiliated by all believers who lost loved ones. It is difficult for a child to suffer losses, but there are also some opportunities that can not be shown as an opportunity.
