Not the best of the movies I have seen these days. I have read so many reviews about Shining and I look forward to seeing it very good. But this film disappoints me. Sound and environment are good, but there is no story here. There is no one moment afraid. I think of a horror thriller film, but there is no thriller in horror. The only scene I was scared at the chapter change scene that "Wednesday" shows. I have a lot of movies. Most things do not explain anything without linking to it. The story of the woman or other scenes is not in this story. The good picture to see in the 80s is not the 21st century.
