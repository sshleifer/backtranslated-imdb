It should be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were terrifying, acting b-motion picture and effects were just plain Nintendo 64. You think you will do a little bit more effort. Of course, it is a Scifi Channel movie so you expect to have a lower rate, but this takes a cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, a shake in the image of betrayal your head, this one does well. <br /> <br /> Although the film has some well-known actors and actresses, it is hard to believe that the quality of the movie is valuable to their time and effort. <br /> <br /> Graphics may be good at the beginning of the 60 'or' 70s, but it came out in 2009! I'd like to be spoilers, and you're familiar with what you see in the movie if you play "Jurassic Park" in Nintendo 64. <br /> <br /> It took me to sit through the subject which is definitely worth 2 hours
