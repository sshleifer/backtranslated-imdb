Very boring nonsense I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> When using camera angles that I feel complicated to make it much worse, the random music is terrible and drowning (perhaps not a bad thing) <br /> <br /> From the promotional video of the city tourism board San Francisco's shots seemed to be stolen directly. <br /> <br /> Oh, the scene has not done well. Next time for improved lighting, please.
