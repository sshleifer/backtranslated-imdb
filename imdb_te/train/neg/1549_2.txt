Lyon is beautiful on SNL, he's only a minute. Like most SNL skits-to-movies, it should not be 90 minutes. It has some beautiful moments (ones you've seen in the trailer) but most of the actors wasted. Tim Meadows is his best but the plot does not have just too many points. Farrell has some part. Farrell is a fiery man ... but not in this film. No shame.
