Written, directed and stared in this shocking piece of trash should really consider a carer change. Yes Rob Stephaniek, I mean you! Seriously, who financed this garbage? There are so many skilled writers that can spend money on them. I thought the idea was great but the acting, script and direction was just plain terrible! Jokes are not funny, I mean they have to get Mickey. But with this style, the film is shouting live skeets on Saturday night of 1995. Why, again I do not give Stocks the hacks money like Rob Stepheniac - never give a commission of direct and direct star in his live movie. Duh!
