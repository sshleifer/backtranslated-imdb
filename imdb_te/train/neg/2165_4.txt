This movie has a very odd viewing experience. The film is clearly depicted on play. Now I'm sure everything in the film works well, but it's not interesting enough to see it in a movie. The film is also a great venue and they do not even care to have more interest in changing a dialog picture. Almost literally presenting is now literally re-filming a stage-drama, over-the-top characters and dialogue. For this reason, the storyline does not really work and the film becomes almost full bore- and the use of the experience in use. <br /> <br /> It takes some time before you realize that you are not comedy. You can see the movie as a tragedy, with a drama in which you are looking, with quirky characters in the film, which is more than just a drama genre, rather than comedy. /> <br /> The characters and dialog are really things that make this film an really unpredictable and over-the-top one really become really unwatchable at times. Certainly, the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Suzanne York and others, but they really do not have enough film 'watching enough' level. <br /> The story feels completely different. There is basically no story and focuses mainly on the brothers / sister characters in the role of Peter O'Toole and Susanna York. But what exactly is the story? The film appears to be very low and meaningless. As I mentioned before; <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are also funnier, bad. <br /> <br /> Anticipated from Lee Thompson, this is a much better movie than a cinematic, rather than a platform for the project. <br /> <br />
