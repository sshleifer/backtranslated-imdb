This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. The story line is weak - I can not even follow it. Acting high-school. The sound track is frustrating. No comedy attempts. Editing is terrible. Credits are also slow - my name is embarrassing to have a picture associated with waste. Do not waste your time thinking about this effort in acting.
