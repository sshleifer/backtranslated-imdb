I did not even come to see this movie at the end. I can not comment on this story because I can not see the whole story, because I can not see it because it's 'actors'. First of all, they looked stiff and I'm sure they took their scripts out of the frame - but that's a small problem. The main problem I have with actors is not really their fault ... who's casting this movie! Come on, this film came out in 2003 ... I thought young people went out with a new wave of cast people in their late twentieth to play? I can not see one of the first movies, "I'm 17 years old" from the eldest elder than me How can anyone take it seriously ??? The film should not be a victim, go for 90 minutes walk and get more than this film.
