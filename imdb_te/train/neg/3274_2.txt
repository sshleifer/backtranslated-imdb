Once again, like Charlie Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbird, a TV series has become a full-length feature film and loses to hundreds of people who have watched it. Duke's cousins ​​in Lewis County, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Sean William Scott), spent most of the time in "General Lee". But they need to take their action together and blast along almost the entire town through the evil gerber Davis 'boss' hog (Razzie nominated burt Reynolds) to make their way to the mine's huge coal mine. Sheriff Rossko P. from their sexy cousin Daisy (Razzi Nominated Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jessie (Willie Nelson). They will be assisted by Coltranne (M.C. Gainy of Lost) and the police. Joe Dawn Baker as governor Jim Apple Whiteheat, as David Koychner as Deputy Clement Hag, Paul Polick Deverport, Michael Weston deputy Ennos Strat and Linda Carter as Pauline. The only reason I give the movie an extra star is the impressive car stunts, and actually the simplest body of Simpson (I do not accept her legs as Catherine Bach, but still!), But it's very boring. It is proposed to be the worst screen pair for Razzis, Jay Chandrasekhar, the worst remake or worst director for the sequel, Simpson & her "Daisy Dukes" and worst screenplays. Pretty poor!
