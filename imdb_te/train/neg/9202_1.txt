I have this movie. Not by choice, i. I was really frustrated the other day and the box was interested in me. So I popped it out on the old VCR and spent the next hour and half of my life "Why Why God?" The story line is not that bad, as a gamer I could not appreciate its bits. I think you might have enjoyed this movie as you might be doing into the super geek-cheese romantic scenes. "I always thought you were a valkon like Dr. Pak ... I can not afford it" There are few things to say about this film, which is really awful. But it's up to you if you're really up to the painted image! <br /> <br /> The story of the truth is quite interesting; <br /> <br /> I would like to add this film in a single word.
