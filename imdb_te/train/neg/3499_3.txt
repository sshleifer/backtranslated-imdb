Comedy Central has succeeded with original programming using professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mensia, The Daily Show and the most popular Colbert Report are all in solid performances for all star professional comics and all, or the Chapelle Show. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the business, and I look forward to good when I'm tuned. <br /> I was very disappointed. Funny scenes, but given the star Silverman Caliber, the performance may be very good. It's a pilot, and hopefully next week's performance is great. Otherwise, she has some help in the form of good writers for the show.
