The version of this film I have seen comes from the grave of Horror Rises. The question is horrific is a bad medieval magician who played the Spanish horror legend Paul Naschy as he plays Abanazer in a church hall ponto. A stupid heir (he thinks he is a descendant), returns from his grave, returns to his ancestral home and returns the wizards, the wizard's head and body separated by the witches who run by him <br /> Obviously the head And once the bodies together hell all the hell break and people die. Like all good magicians, Abiener is a lovely assistant here. This is a great, beautiful hell line of another Spanish horror. Practically every other woman in the film line periodically gets her kit off. This film is a lot of nudity, and not just a woman - we also see Naschie's paunchy body, it's not a beautiful sight, I can tell you. The sex angle of the film is very ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Naschie and Line discuss their evil plans and suddenly find out the young couple in their youth who have both. <br /> <br /> It is also beautiful in places - especially the Herschel Gordon Lewis-Esquire line that lifts the heart into a person's chest to remove his heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They are scared off by a fire though, and do not bother coming back. This is an insult. The growing scene of zombies, however, is the most ludicrously inept moment of the film. It happens all too long, and we do not know what we're really up to when we see some of the images from the dark. There are many worst moments like this, thank you so much for poor editing. <br /> <br /> When a worker fell down under the hypnotic spell of Naschie, his face would always be at the height of his face and there was no benefit. <br /> <br /> It's not a big horror film, it's entertaining. However, the version I saw was probably a dubbed American version, which was probably cut into pieces. For all I know, the original Spanish version may be a masterpiece ...
