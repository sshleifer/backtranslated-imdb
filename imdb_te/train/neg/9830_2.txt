You know that I am the most Christian of 10 people who rated this movie. I'm not. If you're looking for a Christian film, I recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good simple picture, I'm afraid you need to go somewhere else. <br /> I'm embarrassed by the characters, and their unwelcome behavior. Morality is misinterpreting the teaching without teaching that Jesus is the basis of righteousness. One scene shows the main character of a boy who is wrong to steal, and then continues to tell that the character Jesus taught us. I found that attack: Do you believe that "you should not steal" from Jesus? I suppose he wrote the Ten Commandments? And before being stolen? I rented an image from Netflix. I realized the nature of the comments. Oh! Good.
