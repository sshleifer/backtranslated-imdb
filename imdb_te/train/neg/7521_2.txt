<br /> <br /> "I'm at the scary farm of the nut" and I'm in a mood to really see the horrific Halloween film. <br /> <br /> I usually do ffwd through this movie to get "good stuff" but I'm against the desire here and still not sure why. It's obvious from the early sequences, it's not a "real" movie, not a B-movie too. It was 50 cents (actually the "Brotherhood" or something in his underwear) shot in the filmmaking video for 50 cents in the "Son Brotherhood" film, as I was afraid of her foolish college boy at least half the time she was afraid to fear. There are no cut-shots (most expensive to make multiple camera sets) and flat lighting ... that's the right place.

Ha ha, that's fine.
