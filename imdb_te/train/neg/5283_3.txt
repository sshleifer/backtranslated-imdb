I am eagerly awaiting the first screening of this film ever since I gave myself on DVD at Christmas. After reserve a special slot last night, my daughter (aged 17 and a student studio student), with the desire to be interested in coaches, I sat down to see it. We love Jane Austin. <br /> <br /> After the first two minutes, we were overwhelmed. Moving camera shots and angles, general poor cinematography, direction and wooden displays have already been flat and unhappy. <br /> <br /> Anne played by Sally Hawkins, unusually, at the camera, in most cases, at the camera, the fantasy of our hard-won 'moment' and the mood <br /> <br /> Poor Rupert Perry, who played Captain Ventworth -Jones made his best of the script and direction, and blessed him. However, he was practically drowned by a huge sea wave that repelled him and his co-star. They almost came to the sea. Health and Safety had a field day! Poor Rupert left the sea to deliver his line. Perhaps there is no money left in Kitty for filming this scene. <br /> <br /> In addition to Mr. Perry-Jones, Alice Craig is only convincing as Lady Russell, but her attempts are soon to be through the incredible descriptions of Sir Walter Eliot's Anthony Head. Captain Ventworth appeared unusually Anne, a great pain to avoid every two seconds distance. He has developed into a memory barrier, which has caused him to forget a lot of reason. In contrast, Anne had been able to call a good captain from the pillar and high-ventilating, at this point, we could call on the amount of bath we told in about three or four minutes, <br /> <br /> When we saw Anne's charm of the screen datukunnamu. In fact, we did not say that attractive Captain Wentworth had previously seen in a plain, spineless, opinion-less Anne and no one could understand, just to close the wal cir surter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When they went closer, Anne opened her mouth and closed it, affecting the appearance of the gum before it finally met the lip. Eww! <br /> <br /> The happiest thing about last night was the hourly exchange of views between the mother and daughter as badly as movies and movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, some of England's finest scenes were filmed. <br /> Sorry Jane.
