Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I was bored. I looked in my casisk small box to find an image to see. Zombie Nation Hey, I love zombie movies. There is some sort of custom in the description of the filmmaker. It does not warn me to watch this movie. I was able to use that advice. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation is just like trolls 2, it's totally wrong. It is low (if any, depending on your opinion) to do with zombies, and everything within a city. The film revolves around a curled coffe, who is as bad as possible (he is trying to suck this too), and he tries to kill women for a tiny bullshit. Oops, he's a serial killer cop. This film is flawed in thinking that it is a zombie movie, it also gets completely wrong with its serial killer facts. Enjoy killing serial killers, they live for it and they get down and it's personal. This man melts the women and sends them with some poison. He does not have sexual contact with the corpse or has not broken it. Talk about boring! Eventually, one of the five women who died had a voodoo protection to her and there is no obvious reason for the head of the five to come back and kill him. They all buried or thrown into the ocean, but they could not buy the sharp clean clothes they wore. Women then work very poorly and take their revenge. <br /> <br /> This film is even worse in every category. Worst acting, worst writing, creperier sets and creperier makeup effects. Women do not look like a zombie, unless you calculate really dark make-up around the eyes that is what the actual definition of what makes a zombie. They can speak, behave, think, and work as a perfect human. Compared to many PG-13 images, weakness is weak and low naked. You see the chest glimpse at the opening scene ... then the perfect chest! Go and find out. Suppose I'm ready to be the only actress for this cloth. You can see that the police station is so bad that you can see where they are painting the warehouse walls that they exactly paint. You can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the infant's kid's arrangement and you can see that the director has failed. <br /> <br />
