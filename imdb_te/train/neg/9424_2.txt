It's not fun to see. Frank puts all his dreams back into the burner and makes a simple (boring!) Job so he can go to his Steppen film school, but his man decides he will make a humiliating documentary about man. A documentary filmmaker should not comment on the camera, just shoot and comment on snyd headings and comment. The filmmaker is clearly seen with his stepfather stupid and angry. And sad. Frank appears to be mute and boring, instead he is the most populous of 3 people. <br /> <br /> There is really a smear campaign that is much smarter and more active than anything else. It left me as a serious dislike for the filmmaker.
