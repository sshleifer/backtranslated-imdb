Metamorphosis is the seventh cinema set by I Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and Metamorposis. Metamorphosis released in the 1990s seems to be a reconstruction of "The Ampe Age Vampire", an attempt by a scientist to produce similar results. <br /> <br /> In modern times, the Metamorphosis horror film is not my kind. <br /> <br /> The university researcher is working to crack the human genome to create a serum that eliminates aging. The administration has pressed to publish his papers; And to produce some results (or loss of funding loss), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! First of all, he realized that the serum had changed the way he did not really imagine! <br /> Acting is perfect; And, acting in this performance has greatly reduced. Score loss. And, the science behind experiments and their discoveries is not only deceptive; This is irrelevant; Is it ridiculous? Above all. <br /> As the others say, the ending becomes a 30-minute minute, which is not seemingly endless. Without giving away, I'll call this one, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde live and meet the animal from the Black Lagoon."
