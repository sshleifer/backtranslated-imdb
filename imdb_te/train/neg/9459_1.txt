Bad. Bad. Bad. These three lines are a small picture of the film that will impress the idiot child and their parents. And its ... # 1 Movie in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looks like Michael Jackson. A few Chinese lady sleeping within a few minutes. Dirty jokes a lame plot. It's strange and awkward. I'm very happy when green-eggs and ham came in 2005! (Not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play the two hipsters who are trying to find Lost Green-Eggs and Ham. They try to chase Sam-i-am and mean that he is a runaway man. (I hope they will not be able to destroy the classic book.) Do not waste time and money seeing this.
