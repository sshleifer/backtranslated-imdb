I thought this film was definitely moral. I mean, how do you feel if your fiancé is left on your wedding day for your fiancé ??? I'm heartbroken !! It was classified as comedy but I did not find all the funny. I laugh very cheap and have taken them. I usually love Julie Styles movies, but this is no exception. Another insulting performance is Jason Lee, which proves that class and good morals are not relevant in today's society. It's totally lacking in taste and I hate movies like this. I understand that people are protecting this film because I'm still standing with my mind that it's not just a movie, but this bad behavior is not allowed on the screen. If you enjoy this movie because everyone has their own opinions, I am not trying to tell you that this movie is enjoyable, in real life, people are talking about acting and the characters in the film are ashamed.
