There are no spoilers in this review. Nothing to spoil. <br /> There is no plot, nothing; Most clip shows try to tie clips into the plot by at least some sharp story, but it also did not. Clips, dull clips, three lines that lead to the next aftermarket ... OK, so maybe they were less of the time they produced, but they were completely off to skip this part. <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not know how it was made. <br /> <br /> Scraps are usually better in destroying the trophy, but somehow this is going to happen ... <br /> They are back in the next episode.
