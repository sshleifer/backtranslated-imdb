Times, Angel Town, Iron Fist Boards and most unknown (mainly because of the awkward writing) gangs want a street boy to join Martin, so they beat him everyday. Although Olympic kick-boxer (Olivier "World's Lovers" actor) is named Jacques, there is hope. One of the most useless messaging films ever made by Angel Town (and I've seen my stake) is the French crick-boxers who think it's essential for all gang-based neighbors. There's all the worst very awkward moments it's really hilarious. How ridiculous is this matter best from the exchange between Grenner and Aragon? "Are you fighting?" (Olivier holds his Asian best friend in the headlock) will I kill him? I die when I die! If I kill him, his son and wife will kill me so I know he will not die. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is wrong to kill anyone, leaving your best friend out of equation. <br /> <br /> Do not let this sound, it's too long, it's so lovely to hate this movie. Reduces the use of guns (the film's largest logic gap) that eventually comes to the end of the dangerous ending of Grenner going on one of the gang members And Ganeser kick boxes are restless. <br /> <br /> It is all set for the sound of these ferocious "Mexican" tones and surreal power that made it remarkable about this movie. Gruner does not attend college, he is here in the states and his love in France (In a graveyard at the start of the film's awkward) Angel Town is a perfect picture for you, with all the macabre levels without a failure, but with the frantic levels of action at the level of martial arts. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> *
