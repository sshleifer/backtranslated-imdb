I do not know why, but for some unhealthy reasons, I think since I'm a fan of the Disney sequel, I decided to go ahead and see 102 Dalmations. Glenn Close is the debut film of Disney cartoon classic featuring Cruella DeVill, which seems to be a hit, but it's just a bomb. I think the reason why these movies work is because I have 101 dalmmas, original, a cartoon, it's just a good job and more attractive to children and adults. Adults around trying to behave like real humans rather than cartoons, because this is not fun, but I understand they are trying to make sure that I am attracted to the children, but these actors behave in the way of acting in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Cruella de Weil is in prison for a while, but things change when she proves that she now loves animals and is a pleasant man. But her fame has now become a puppy-napper, but she buys a person's dog's shelter and suddenly everyone loves them and looks like she has changed. But when she sees her observation officer Dalmatians, she begins to look silly and find spots, and she loses it. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is a very sophisticated actress, but it is good to take a cruel deeper, she's fine, but let's say it's fun, making this movie fun just a silly nut. Also, cute as puppies, it just works more for the animation, it sounds stupid, but it's not just believable in the mix of cartoon and their personalities. I do not really recommend 102 dalmmas, but this is the same if you agree that the first film is just a waste of time. <br/> <br/>
