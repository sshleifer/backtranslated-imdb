This is a very bad documentary to come out of Canada! I'm glad to see guys did not make another movie. They do not have to make a picture of all they want to do and have to be one they wrote. They vary to change the person they are pitching straight up. When I see that at the Toronto Film Festival that year, I can not get enough out of the theater. Please do not watch this movie.
