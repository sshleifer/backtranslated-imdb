I liked this book since my 5th grade teacher read many years ago to our class. For the past 18 years, I've read everyone in my 3rd and 5th grade classes. Previously a movie was made, but I could not find it. Well, my students and I are so excited to hear that Disney has made the screen of Madeline LLL's excellent screen. <br /> When I see in the movie, I have the most hopes. When the film continued, I was more disappointed. They have severely damaged it! The film was never removed from my favorite book. I understand the movies are not sure to stick to a book, but they do not need to change things for it! Not everything in the book is too much to do! <br /> <br /> <br /> It 's not like me, but it' <br /> <br /> Why did they think Anti Beast looks like Starbucks 'Chebbaa? Why did Calvin' s hair become red? Why Mrs. Not a clever game on her name is not in the right "witch - like" outfit? Saw We all surprise - why almost every detail was going to change? <br /> <br /> I have always wondered how amazing this book is, and I still waited for the film, which only sank in the sensory knowledge Write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to work!
