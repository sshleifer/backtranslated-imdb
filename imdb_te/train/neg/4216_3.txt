Stare at another day, watch another movie. And finally when I finished my Christmas shopping yesterday after a cold and fogy afternoon, I'm not somewhere to go to "The Land That Time Is Forgotten". <br /> <br /> Dove McQueer, the source of the leading actors, has been drawn to the alley sailors somewhere in 1916, when a U-boat drowned in Atlantique. U-boat (in a scene that describes logic and reason), they eventually find themselves in a strange island that has not been clearly caught by human fingers. Together, they explore the land and discover dinosaurs and Neanderthals! Can they escape before they become a permanent resident of the land forgotten? <br /> <br /> Even though a few years before "Star Wars", these images differ in light in terms of special effects. Model shots look better in an episode of Gerry Anderson's "Stingray" and are much better than anything you can imagine that the creatures are not much better. When T-Rex was killed (I guess it's what) it was the same way that zombies did when you killed them - walk and collapse in the middle, hands and feet were pushed as a sleeping cow. Of course, the sets are not too bad, but secular acting and endless explosion sounds (all sounds) are best to destroy infidelity and feel of your film. Characters are not suitable for infidelity or your sympathy, and they shoot their guns in any move. <br /> In the end, if they were not on the island, I did not care, and when the time came, I was more relaxed than entertaining. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ And although you are very clear from their actions, you do not know that some characters are German from their voices. The whole thing is just some polish and cohesion, leaving the chaos in the viewer places and nonplussed in others. Overall, although Colin Farrell is able to get some fun in an attempt to work, the film is curious about these days. I spotted his name in credits and half an an Irish accent and guess a baby who suspects facial hair. Oh! Good. There is nothing special here to see here, but it's ok if you eat your meals and the weather prevents further action.
