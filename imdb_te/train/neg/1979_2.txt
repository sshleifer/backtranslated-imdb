Humm, Western for the hip hop music period. To track modern phrases like "cool" and many others. "Sustas It's in the House!" French hands-on nails on rough riding girls. Microphone packs are clearly visible on the back of Lim Kim. <br /> <br /> I can not go with the inspiration of the director and the editor's mistakes. <br /> Acting is not as bad as what I saw. <br /> <br /> It is strange that Luis Mandinder speaks to his native voice. <br /> The girls are beautiful. Stunning outfits even though completely wrong. I can not believe what I have a great story. I believe that the film is loaded with such traps that it can play well in the inner city.
