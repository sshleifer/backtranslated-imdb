Frankly I'm evident that I'm wasting nearly two hours of his debut offering based on dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith. Are they all written by his pals? Action clunks, music irritations and used over, the script is just terrible and the mediest best of the actors (with the exception of the gardener). I want to support a young filmmaker's efforts but when it says that it is not right, it encourages him to do the same mistakes, that is, writing his own scripts and continuing to use the same actors for another actor. Yes, this was his first film, a low budget - I'll get it, but it's also available for people's purchase and it's not scratch.
