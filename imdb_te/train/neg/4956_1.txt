When this cartoon was first broadcast I seem to have at least half way off, the boy I was wrong. I must admit that the cartoon was almost as painful as all those years ago with Batman Clooney and Batman and Robins. I saw a few episodes, and two of them literally left his pocket and fought as jet Li and beat the trash from Batman and Batman saw him again another episode, jockey chan moves in the air as a ninja. When is the Joker or the Penguin ever competed for Batma? Joker and Genie Chan and Jet Li's Penguin Kung Fu representatives. The way Batman filmed in this program is really discouraging, discouraging, and sad. The animation is terrible and the dialogue is terrible. Being a fan of Batman from my boyfriend, I honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid all the costs of this show because it does not display the true picture of Batman. This cartoon is like a wannabe kung fu flick and I would recommend the Batman animated series if you really want to see a classic Batman cartoon, but this cartoon S - T! Batman: Get the animated series and do not waste your time with this cartoon.
