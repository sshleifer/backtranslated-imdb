The program has proven to be worthless of a 30-minute DVR hard drive. I did not expect much and I actually got less. I would like to cancel this presentation by the second episode, I can not believe that Gekko will ever try to use Caveman campaign again. I prefer to spend the night checking my daughter's hair for head lice rather than watching this piece of refusal. In a hospital / crime / short film reality show with AFCAC duck, what ABC has approved for this performance in the '07 fall plan? When I failed to express my opinion about this presentation, I told him clearly that it was not good.
