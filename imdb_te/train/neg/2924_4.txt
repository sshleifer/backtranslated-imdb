There is something here with the female leader who has this perfect life, she has always wanted after the worst life, starting with child prostitute and joining Eric Roberts. But her background is impossible for her to believe in Dean Cain and eventually ruin it completely. It feels weird, but by the end of Dean Cain and the choice he chose. He loves her and she is the mother of her baby because she can not hurt her (I think the time frame is clear that she is not her child and her brother), but at the same time she does not forgive her work and sleeping with her brother (he is the love and responsibility he thinks is pretty much one That is the way) and his death is part. It was a better film in better hands, but it was not bad for what I was holding at midnight cable catch.
