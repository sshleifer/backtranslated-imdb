Last weekend I saw the film, I was disappointed and it was disappointed. Initially, the film comes from the former Soviet Union, who came to this country and takes everyone with them from the old country and goes to what Americans are doing. Looking at immigration is a very wrong way, and it's a bad way to tell people about it. That's the main thing. Another thing is that the whole writing, direction and filming are on the level of village enthusiasts. Actors did a lot of good, but they did not save this kind of garbage. Some jokes are funny, but very bad and cheesy. Maybe I can not wait to get out of the theater, get my money back.
