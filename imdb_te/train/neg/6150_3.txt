I saw this movie with the intention that I do not like. I did not. It is one of those films that have been made specifically for the Oscars: we're stupid audiences, in almost a frame, almost obscene, over a period of time, the sepia-tone imagery, presents the title, NO sex and everything he thinks and ends in sfx / cgi get. One thing I like is that they did not correctly sell null prices! Instead they call the noble-price (named after the original man known as Alfred Nobel) 'great price' .. Jesus! How to make such a bug in such a large product, it depends on the true story. What a conak! What are you and others thinking?
