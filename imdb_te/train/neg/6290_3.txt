Reconsideration: Ron Mill is going to marry. They are deep and love and some are perfect for each other even though they have met a few months ago. Todd, Ron's brother of the law was not very happy. He is afraid to marry his cushy job threat in family business and decides to arrange Ron's bachelor party. <br /> <br /> Comments: Although a comedy is to be a sequel to classics, it is not funny. This does not necessarily require a pedalal show and young children, which shows women in younger age. Actually, in a way, there is many impressive that you can put there because they are everywhere. Unfortunately it is also a symbol of a movie that does not support her. It's just not good enough. <br /> <br /> There are three remorse points for this, or in fact there are three characters worthy of a better script. This is actually the main actor Josh Cook who gives a general impression. <br /> <br /> I know Sarah Foster has more expertise than these films, and Immanuel Wooger feels more talented than this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actually, bad jokes are rare. It's not funny. <br /> <br />
