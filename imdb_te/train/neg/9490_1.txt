This is a perfect and complete trash, a good example of a BAD movie, it is not attractive to anyone and not even B-movie fans. No, I repeat, this piece of garbage do not waste your life's precious time. Bad acting, bad direction, horrific (but I mean really terrible) script, and no form of entertainment (in any form) is the complete lack of an idea. I bought a DVD for 3 dollars, and I promise to pay someone I can pay. This film is not exactly what I have done. I like b-movies, killer toys, strange lake monsters, but it's not somewhere nearby. Do you know that the movies you like are so funny? Not even. Just plain old curiosity.
