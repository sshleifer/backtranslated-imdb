I can not wait to see this film. About half way through the movie, I can not wait to finish it. All (white) actors are distributing their lines as Woody Allen says, "This is ..." They said their lines on the screen as they tried to imitate Woody Allen. It's very annoying. We know what Ferrell really does, as Mr. Allen does not make mistakes on his words. The comedy part of the film is boring and definitely not funny or entertaining as tragedy. I never accepted a big Woody Allen fan, the film did not exactly change me. I think his writing is as bad as his direction. This is one of the worst 10 films I've ever seen.
