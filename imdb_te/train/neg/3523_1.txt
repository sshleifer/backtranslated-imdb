Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Sylvester Stallone has to adhere to and act and it has enough rock climbing scenes, Vertigo, Falling and Seen-Chewing Villains and aching airy haste. There are two plots, two lambs. A painful failed rescue, and other bad people wrecking an airplane for booty, and when possible it will kill various dangerous people. Generally trustworthy John Lithgow, perhaps discouraged by the product's futility, has reduced his lack of attention, "Bostie!" In the vague assumption of English accent. Jainine Turner, partly ruined by a rescue hiker and pilot when playing Maggie in her fake and troublesome Northern Exposure. Stallone stylish and muscular-head. There are no deaths in this regard. No country lines, either.
