Many b minus films are referred to as film nair, hoping to increase interest in something that is too small. All elements of the image - script, acting, direction - are mediocre. Acting through three leads is wood. I wanted to go to places in John Dale's film industry, but he realized that he had some talent and hence finished TV work. Lee J Cobb is usually afraid of poor script and poor direction. Jane Wyatt is regarded as a Femal Fataleck but comes somewhere near to persuade audiences. I have two studio cars that I had previously seen in this movie, Lee J Cabe, a specially dreamed Doll John Doll. DVD Transfer is simple alpha.
