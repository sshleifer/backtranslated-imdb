I heard him. I warned, and still, I paid money for this, after reading all the reviews, after knowing the original "it's good to be good", and that part 2 does not fit into that category, still, I did not stop. What exactly happened here? Part of it was a hilarious, and it was a very politically inefficient, and other crazy, fat entertainment, and this one, there was simply a possibility to sequel worse on God's planet Earth, Basket Case 2, hell, even Troll 2. It really tells you that the worst sequel in history and actually taking into consideration the bottom line of barrel features. Criminal Inside Part 2 is a completely different brand. Video, zero score, zero entertainment value, 1/3 of the original has a flashback, and above that, crazy, fat Ethel lost a piece of her girth. I mean, honestly, this kind of unhealthy joke ?? Thank you very much, Nick Milliard. 1/1
