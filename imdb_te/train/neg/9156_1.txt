Ben and Arthur have 10 people. Sam Marwick directed, directed and produced the film. Sam should give his idea a good writer and director, and leave acting to the person who plays. This is a good example of a person who controls the whole production. <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett Gobel's performance is good, but there is no one to say that he can be better with a good director and good. Actors work. <br /> <br /> This film is very bad. Sam Marwick chucked and wanted to see this film (twice). Acting and directing is so bad that the film became a comedy. You laugh, and got in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> The second good point .... It's a great date movie. After the first two minutes you pay more attention to your date watching the movie!
