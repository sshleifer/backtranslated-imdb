The complaints are valid, the biggest problem for me is that this soap opera is a very target for women. These nighttime sacks, Gray's Anatomy, or Ugly Betty or West Wing are quite good. However, this idea is parallel to day-to-day socks when only hunky men (Tee Diggs, Tim Daly, and Chris Lowell) target sexual abuse and ropes, and many ridiculous complicated situations called a little hospital, which is a female counterpart for General Hospital ... or Baywatch . It was the idea that men wanted and they had it, so if women wanted it, it would be a great swing show (or some men see) inevitable.
