If you want to entertain, do not see this movie. If you want to see war heroes, do not see this movie. If you want to see good performance and excellent screenplay, do not see this movie. If you want regular Hollywood war movies to give people a political appeal to the great Hollywood and battlefield, see this movie. Otherwise, do not waste your time. I'm always interested in war films because if they are well done, they teach us things that are contrary and worthless. The film shows some groups running in rural areas, telling extreme clich√© lines, doing very predictable tasks and protecting them with the same exact power and cruelty that can stand up to violence. The film is inspiring to film production and the United States of America! Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa or any other country and looking at it? Everyone hates us! Please, please do not junk this time. You should, wait and rent. 4/10
