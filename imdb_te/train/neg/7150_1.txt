After watching the previews, I thought this film was a great improvement over the fast & furious series. So, I already expected it to have a lower storyline, but at least this time it does not load with a bunch of farted cockers of fart in the fart. Unfortunately, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> If you can imagine the film with the worst hero in the movie, I do not need to take baseball bat for my bats as others say). The storyline is not only there, but the action is very trash. I think directors who dismiss some women and exotic cars, and then call it a movie. For an example, the guy pushes the mind button and leaves his Lamborghini in the air, flying to win SLR McLaren for a place in the film. Eddie Griffin then asks the girl to move on and get out of the PLAN after a bit faced in a fight with her "girls" (an Imas comment will work in this case) and of course they are in the middle of the desert. After this fantastic scene I can not take it anymore. So, I only had to see this monstrosity half. This was the first film I never went out. <br /> <br /> I have to stop for some drinks to kill my broken brain cells. You're going to the local car show and it's best to stop at home strip joint. I will put all the audience in my prayers.
