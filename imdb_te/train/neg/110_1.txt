I currently have this movie for the library and I have not finished watching it. It's very bad, I'm disloyal. Audrey Hepburn has lost her talent altogether, though she's done pretty well in 'Robin and Marian'. This is the worst thing about the absurd stupid image. <br /> <br /> There is nothing inertia between the climber and his best friends. It is interesting because it is his last film. Because Dorothy Strauten appeared before her homicide. <br /> <br /> Who believe that Hepburn is among the same Manhattan neighborhoods that are so awesome and mythical? Twenty years before 'Breakfast at Tiffany'? Gershwin's old soundtrack soundtrack and title is very loud and clear - you do not have to wait for credits, with the film's movie music <br /> <br /> Going back to 'typing to type', I guess . In this case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European Lady you will occasionally see an actress and an always starter. Here she has lost her talent as a star. If someone played the role of someone who had grown up as a Marrotte, some of them had been given unbelievably bad substance and monkey-level conditions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hepburn is a great man, in fact, many dreamed more of film stars than, After this horrific performance, she called Robert Wagner a worst TV movie called 'Love's Love's Love'. In the 50s she was still in a 'lunch' despite being a method. Lana Turner is the most influential and less intelligent actresses than Hebburn emphasized to do this way. Turner also acted badly when she was bad. Hepburn does not take it seriously, it does not bother; Even her hair and clothes look tough. <br /> <br /> That girl who plays the singer of the country is just sickening. John Ritter is terrible, there is nothing to recommend this movie unless you look at the beautiful Dorothy Strait. <br /> <br /> Ben Gazrava lost all then sex appeal, so we have 2 pictures with Gazrassra and Hepburn. Which one can ask for less? The last of Santa Dei's 'Lost,' after 2 years, nothing less budget, more than this. At least Ms. Dee spoke of her voice; By 1981, Audrey Hepburn's accent was just crazy; She wants to work with PBS 'Gardens of the World with Andrey Hepburn and there are some frustrating accusations when she goes with English gardens with rabbits or waxes that are plenty of' flowers are very fond of going back to nature! <br /> <br /> 'Breakfast in' Tiffany 'Andre Hepburn is a very light poetic thing. Women in the world - she is definitely one of the most beautiful screens in 'My Fair Lady', with many things Garroba and Delfin Seireg in 'Last year in Merenbad'. And then this! <br /> <br /> She is the last brief character lady in the Spielberg film 'Always' as the angel 'Hap'. <br /> I went to his memorial service for the fifth time. Avenue Presbyterian Church, a beautiful service, featuring the boys 'singer Shaker Hyman' s simple presents. The program was not only listed in 'The Breakfast at Tiffne's' in a fire escape in Hepburn's singing 'Moon River' game and it brought some real tears in emotion and society too. A great lady (in 'The Nyus Story'), a great and most beautiful actress in many of the 50s and 60s, has turned out to be really bad - it's not all that simple. Moreover, it's just a great human being, although the film shows are small, it has the greatest of minds that wants to show disrespect - her last film was plentiful. Most of the talk about Hepburn's misleading lies is 'My Fair Lady.' But Lee Reimmie appeared in Broadway, 'Weight Until Dark,' which featured the original actress. While not celebrating Hepburn, she is a good actress in many ways (hebburne is not really able to play badly), although Hepburn is sufficiently adequate. After that, her performance dramatically reduced everything.
