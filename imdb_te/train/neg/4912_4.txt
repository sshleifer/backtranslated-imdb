After reading the novel, I can not tell you how confident it is. The story is simple mystery material: the killer targets new couples; A female researcher falls in love with her partner and suffers from severe illness. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera and is sure to know how it works. The first 2/3 drops are saved for murders and the final 1/3 makes a semi-return faster than its partial finish. <br /> <br /> Acting is certainly accurate, the actors are blame alone: ​​the screenplay is brutal. During the last 1/3 time you make the film interesting, but it is only 1/3 of the last. Director Russell Mulkahi is very much in his subject, but he can only do much with a TV budget and network sensors in his back. He was quickly cut to cut and twisted lenses, but he was able to hold tight in a couple of "under the ground" during the murders at the club's restroom. Unfortunately, as it is made for TV, he does not find the cool mixed details that he has ever used with an extensive image. Note to the producers: Give a person a reasonable budget and anamorphic lens when you appoint him. <br /> It is reasonable: The film is bad by film standards and TV standards (see CSI, usually). Take Dario Argonto's "Deep Red" (my highest recommended, fantastic movie), "Opera", or "Tenebre". They are strong in every category.
