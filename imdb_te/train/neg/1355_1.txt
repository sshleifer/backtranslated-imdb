I'm Crispin Glover's "What Is It?" On Arbor Film Festival. I had a special idea that the author and the director could not answer, because the film was named at least aptly. At the Question and Answer meeting after the screening, Mr Glover said that the film was originally meant to be a small picture to show the act of using actors with Down Syndrome. However, it was not enough to create a movie. In my opinion, in my opinion, building blocks for a big focus - a big sight seemed muddled better and attend at the worst. <br /> Crispin Glover also says he wanted to fix the contents of the ban. Well, he's going to do that. But why? There is no stance for this film. Does he think these things should not be taboo? I did not give me an index in this film. Turtle is not interesting for taboo. There is no way to prevent or ban the ban because the audience can not do anything. <br /> <br /> It was a surprise to me to ignore the problems with a sense of a moment. Editing, cinematography and other technical aspects are often very exciting. Glover went into the picture for 125-150 thousand dollars, and I believe that different designers (Glover actually had some designing - I know I have seen the least sound design in credits). Painted sets are okay (not great), but used poorly. Components feel like a photograph - no matter what kind of intent is done, but it's just overwhelming in the hands of Glover. <br /> <br /> I will see filmmakers for the first time in IMMI. The home page with a very small problem is filmed. <br /> <br /> "What is this?" I can not understand the film seriously. Glover feels like you're throwing some parts seriously thinking. Among other things, he seems to off his own little joke. <br /> <br /> In the film, he thought he was somewhat contradictory or meaningful, but I thought Glover was not giving any attention to his paintings. <br /> <br /> Glover is a small movie which he originally wanted. Only if it is. In seventy-two minutes, it argues that the film is made out of the first twenty images and ideas and creates enough ideas to argue that they are at the time.
