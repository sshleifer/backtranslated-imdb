I have seen the best rating for this movie and some reviews are positive. I saw the movie and was pretty dissapointed. I did not see much enjoyment. It's slow, and there is no entertainment value. The murder scenes are also poor, with real close shots of simple movements that are not pretty visible. And the ending of the great twist is not really the end, I saw it coming, and then the end just seemed to be the clich√©. The film did not mention much, but if it is a little lower, it will be overrated. I do not recommend this movie.
