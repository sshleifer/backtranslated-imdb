I grew up in the "very Christian" home from birth. Before watching this movie and the rest of the series I was saved and forced to visit a young group in my church. This film is highly damaging. I was around 12 years old and I have seen literally nightmares about it for years. The bed is awake in bed and my mom's footsteps are used to hear sounds upstairs. If I did not listen to her footsteps, I would go to the top to make sure she was not up. I was scared when Jesus forgot me because I prayed every night for salvation very hard. This is not something I show my kids until they are too old, if at all. This film has taken me years to scare me.
