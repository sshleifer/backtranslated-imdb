This is the worst image I have seen !! This film is not good enough. I've seen some bad movies but this one takes it up. Do you have any plot and you are going to go fast or worse that most of the film is going on faster or you are surprised to see what's going to happen because someone can not think about the movie and you see it. I feel sorry for someone sitting through this painful hour and a half. Take my advice and do not look at this movie because I feel that the time you spent in your life is a big waste.
