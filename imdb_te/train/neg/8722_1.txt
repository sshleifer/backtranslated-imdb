In fact, this should not be confusing in Lewis Teag's "Alligator" (1980), which is a magnificent film, "Il Filio del Granado Caemano" at the end of the seventies Serbian Martino ("Isola Degley Yumi's Pecis" and not as good as "La Monta√±a del Dio cabale") . When ignoring the story of "Jaws", the script will fail to create any suspense anytime. The creature is ludicrous and its victims are just despicable. Stelvio Cipriani's lame tune describes adventures of these crazy tourists who presented from the very beginning as the obvious aspects of the meal of poorly reptiles. That's not actually a vengeance! Dialogues and natives are not inspired by pure racism and we have found this pitiful flick so much fun. Seeing such a playful attitude is a favor of a sour feel. We can accept bad movies and poor FXs, but that kind of mentality. Never!
