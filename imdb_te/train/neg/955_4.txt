I do not think any player in Hollywood history would have been as long as David Niven gave up all the weaker films he took with his incredible sentiment. He could work, had an Oscar for it, but the two ingredients he made were like a light on two lightweight tissue paper. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a musical and for the most part you'll remember Vera-Ellen Dancing. Remember that they were in Scotch outfit as they were set in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you remember a single song from it you should have photographic memory. <br /> <br /> This story is light. Vera-Ellen is a major American character in a music that clearly states that Town Trout is going to be out in Edinburgh. She starts in chorus and runs on the last day. She gets a lift from a driver of a millionaire greeting card king. Everyone now assumes the main squeeze for her millionaire. <br /> <br /> Millionaire David Niven, along with him, goes along with various situations. <br /> <br /> Finally Happy Lovely, David Niven is very distressed and does not have a very tired light and dangerous.
