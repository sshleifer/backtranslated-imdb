<br /> <br /> American Beauty is a movie I am hoping for a towelhead. Unfortunately, this is a disappointment. In fact, the countless movies I have seen at nearly a dozen Sundance ceremonies, the only Sundance film I had ever wanted to go out of the opening. <br /> <br /> The worst problem with the Toulhead is that, unlike the cultural, it is derived from the collection of "provocative" notions, rather than an organic human drama. This screenplay was received from the novel of the same name by Alicia Enion. The famous Edith Wharton Quote comes to mind: I have never seen a good novel despite the author's political opinions. Its observation is particularly destructive to the Toulouse because its political views are very old and simple. <br /> <br /> The whale of the toweled white villains, the depictions of blacks, the counter cultures of foreign cultures, etc. It has long been a long time. <br /> For more detailed review, any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost this film is low rated and poorly and manipulative tissue is exposed. <br /> On the other hand, amateur critics are more easily bamboo. When you read through these and similar sites reviews, you often come across the superlatives: "Wonderful," "is" "deep," "shocking," ... it's awkward to me to read them. In fact, I have encountered many people who think of any book or film with full understanding of the idea of ​​being deeply moving, cultural, gender, or sexual issues. If you're such a person, you can rent a towelhead and move it through. On the other hand, if you increase your standards, you can safely pass on this matter.
