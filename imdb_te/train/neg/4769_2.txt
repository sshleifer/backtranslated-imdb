Sadly it was misguided. Finish this movie from the beginning. I looked at it very hard because I would explain Clarissa every day on Nickelodeon. I loved her. The next thing I did was spread out in her Maxim and she was gorgeous! I did not really hear anything about her until I saw this film in danger. I could not even believe that something like this could let her be seen by her name. Everything about it was wrong but the group looked like somewhere someone somewhere really really trying to save a sinking ship. Very bad .. I hope she will continue to act and I like to see her with a real cast of real cast.
