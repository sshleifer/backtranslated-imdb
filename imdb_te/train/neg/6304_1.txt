A WWII naval history buff, and anyone who is proud of the history of the nation's ethnic relations, I'm looking forward to seeing this movie. No frustrating skull piece. I made a 3/4 way, but I stopped it in the sub-attack scenario. U-boat is a concept of burning a torpedo at a DDE, that it has a hope of hitting, and then "fleeing" from the DDE when it is drowning. And this is just a small detail. The whole film was poorly written, poorly directed, and less acted. I agree with others on this board, it might be a good movie. If they were determined, all those bad eighteen WWII campaigns were made with all white actors, so they had to stay with black people. And as bad as older movies, it's really worse. This is mainly about Oscar Davies and Stephen Ria. They have very little characters. I have to believe that these two good actors are involved in the film. I'm done. I've given my life a lot of way to this worst movie.
