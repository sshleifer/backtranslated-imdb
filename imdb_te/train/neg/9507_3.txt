I'm always frustrated by the obviously written films of a gender. <br /> <br /> "His football colleagues got Diane pregnant." In any way, shape, or form a guy is always getting a girl pregnant in high school The other person cheer up the slogan, they cheer up with the hot cheerleader about the person who has sex, but the first football team heard about it is not bladder <br /> <br /> The film ' It's very serious, and it's not terrible bad, but come!
