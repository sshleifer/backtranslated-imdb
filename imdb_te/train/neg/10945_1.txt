It is not how terrible it is. Last night I saw in the video, I could not believe what I saw. Generally, his search for "Snakeyear" former soldier (Lorenzo Lamaas) and his kidnap sister was chained by Deliverance-style Rednecks. <br /> <br /> The acting, writing, directing, photography, and compilation of the film should be one of the worst theme songs in addition to a song called "Soldier"! <br /> However, "Horseshback" (Ron Pallio) is playing a ridiculous bad guy from the "welcome back carter". Otherwise, please avoid this confusion with all kinds of expenses.
