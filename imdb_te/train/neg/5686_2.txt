Hello. This is my first review for any movie I've seen. I went through this embarrassment to tell everyone that this is quite literally the most frustrating image I have ever seen. I feel that this film is very low, which gives me some understanding of the budget limitations. I thought it was a bad remake of the movie. I agree, which I've seen in the scene /> movie. <br he likes where he tied up on the head of the tied up and looks very chic, but also the most disturbing scene I've ever seen. The scene is almost always, in fact, it could be about five minutes. I love some horror movies and I have found that they are good when they give credit. The director of this film is boll, and his group used to make the film must be thought out before the other. One last note haha! Watching for women and children like horror, watching animals, letting BEATIN pest to die, and hit a few hammer there with a five minutes scene, if you do not, you will see this film, and you see all the people with a high budget picture. People can not actually make films like this. Anyone who loves and loves to go to the heart, this is my opinion in the film.
