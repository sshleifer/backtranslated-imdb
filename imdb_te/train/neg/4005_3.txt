I'm a true fan of the original cracker series, and I have them all on DVD. On the eve of the crubber, he was behaving as over-the-top, but Robbie Coltran and other actors, as well as the authors themselves, always banned themselves. I counted the original cracker in the great Brit TV series at that time and some serious contests: the main suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes and others. <br /> <br /> "What makes a new terror" more sad? <br /> <br /> Finally, a very light parody of the former glory of the cracker. I've been forced to sit through the whole thing, which is not actually bad, and some spark can eventually ignite. <br /> <br /> Some criticisms: First, the right to go up to any potential partisan: I was offended by anti-American and anti-war. Most of the program and danced in it. Best: Any American crime and murder of a British jockey, in Fitz's words, "meaningless, not supported". "I thought I had hunted the trash for two hours to hear these two unpleasant bit?" I faced a negative reaction to the anti-war / American tone brought by my faith ... Apart from politics, this cracker is just a propaganda that has helped to suppress it already. <br /> <br /> How much time does Robbie Coultre take? Fitzgerald, a former story writer who wrote without thinking of Fitz's role, is a bit of a player in this regard. Coltrane may have performed on his own wide and still messy flabby shoulders, but the author was apparently thinking of other things, and missed the chance, and widespread. <br /> Third: What an ABYSMAL SCRIPT! Fitzgerald's son, Fitz's son, was unable to escape his plane to Australia, his detective chose to defeat his poor-performers, and some of the old sparks between Fitz and his misses) Nearly enough to bring the story. <br /> <br /> Fourth, where is the Horn Panhalgang? Now it was interesting ... it was Manchester, and she wanted to remain in the rank of 10 years. <br /> <br /> When it was broadcast on BBCA), "Directors Cut" was announced on the BBC On-Demand, when I announced the AH-HA The director's cut, perhaps, has to pay a lot, but maybe, like a coherent and interesting storyline, I'm looking forward to seeing tonight, but unfortunately, desperate, looking at anything, watching, looking like "A New Terror" I was so angry that the BBCA sliced ​​and put the show time to perform the show time (every ten minutes), and then back to me And perhaps tonight's Variety of "A New Terror" I am quoting the first paragraph: "It's really excitement about Robbie Coltrne: The BBC's flawed criminal psychologist is heavily influenced by a political commentator, writer Jimmy McGawarn, who was scheduled to deliver in the Renaissance. In the first it was Jolting-Americans Vinni Nambia-Pambies Twee before going home Jaded about the argument - rant article McGovern crossed the clearing of the chest, with a flick of the joy of being able to see the back of Fitz's case.
