This is a Western action. James St√©rt is an actor in the lovely Northwest film, which is portrayed as a great exposition. The scenery and clothing are great. There is action and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hysterical synergism is the main drawback being made by Hollywood as a leader. Although the film was produced, the soldier was a stereotypical hero, and some of the Stewart films had really complimented. <br /> <br /> However, he is very piggish for everyone, it really stuck to care for him, or accept him. He is like a dimensional spaghetti Western characters (not that bad cut). <br /> <br /> However, smaller characters are very enjoyable. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others see this value.
