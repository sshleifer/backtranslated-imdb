The underground comedy film is perhaps one of the worst funny movies I've ever seen. I should know that it's bad when it comes to the phrase "Written" in the box ... The filmmakers mean that you are going to focus more on what you charge than you laugh. <br /> <p> The film is a funny confusion of child skits, bad characters, and worst jokes ... From the painful bot-man sketch to the painful affectionary Arnold Shollenpeaker skirt, they are not just funny. Some of the few fun skiing skits are very small and far between - Michael Clarke Duncan, for example playing gay homosexuals - but they go too long and wreck away from the inefficiency of the Vince offer. <br /> Keep the underground comedy movie underground ... bury it!
