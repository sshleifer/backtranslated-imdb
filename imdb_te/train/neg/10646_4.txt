A beautiful island girl tries to escape from her people, she worships a god and tries to force her bride. She finds Tarzan and Jane who are trying to save her. George Zucko is the main Priest who is a villain but is not used for his full purpose. As well as the hand and the most annoying guitar player / singer who is most frequently singing. <br /> <br /> "Great" Robert Flori also does not help. <br /> * 1/2 (in four)
