<br /> <br /> I saw this film a few times and did not think this was really funny, but it's good to have some fun and good. <br /> <br /> The company and the company that work at their employer have a jerk and they end up giving a taste of his own medicine, and they try to get respect how. <br /> Acting is very good. Dobney Coleman is one of the best 80-year-olds starter, good bad guy, not true, just different. Dolly Parton is lovely looking fun with lovely and humor and she's really down here southwit. Jane Fonda is very well and I have very little. <br /> <br /> Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this film, she has ridiculous lines and laughs me a lot of times, and I love her. <br /> <br /> I would recommend anyone who likes 80 comedy. I like the movie but I do not like things about it. It starts off great and has a nice stream and then everything starts to come together at once and made me less attention about the characters. They all have little fantasies about what they would like to do with the owner and I thought the film flow slowed though 'beautiful'. <br /> <br /> When the movie meets again and the funniest things happen, it is slowly slowing down again, and in a quick way it is very nice. <br /> Stars, but try it if you do not see it. I am more or less interested in emotions.
