Well I paid a dollar for this movie's DVD, and it's not worth it too. It's from poor print and in the public domain, I'm guessing <br /> <br /> Neagle -. Despite her fame, awards, and fame - is a banal British gal or dancing who can not sing or dance. <br /> <br /> Some of the fine old Hollywood character actors on display should be here thinking they're doing a classic. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) always felt the most exciting and talented saga on the Anna screen. He was mistaken. She was exceptionally popular in Britain before and after WWII. Her "serious" roles are more ridiculous than her performances here. <br /> <br /> The only couple of popular songs are included and none of them will be displayed well. Find this and find one that runs Doris Day. At least you get some real funny and professional style dance!
