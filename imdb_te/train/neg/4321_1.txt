This is the WORST Christmas movie I have ever seen. I took my two little children to see. It's dark, the most troubling plot - the family does not have money, the mother loses his job, dies in the bank, the bank robber back home and steals the family car with the two children after passing at high speed, crossing the bridge over the river. Amma is left alone. She does not wonder that Christmas is gone sprite. The Christmas angels do not save the drowning children, and bring back the dead fathers back! I thought it was a bad message to send these children. It is good to tell them that this film is no Santa than to show them !!
