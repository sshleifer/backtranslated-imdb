Actress Patty Duke wrote a brilliant, funny, strict-written book about her career as an actress, her silly-tuned love-life, and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts almost caused her to stay away. With this rich material (and Patty playing in his last player), a cricketer like Gilbert Kates combines all along with a TV-director film, "Call Me Anna" in Duke's autobiography. For those who read the book, the sketch novel (leaping forward in time) does not absorb, we never allowed our bearings with what was happening, and the production seems stunted by the low budget. The actors misunderstood, and the Duke does not pay the value that he finally finds - the fraudulent reality of the film is too thick in this case, and does not take Patty's fitness in this regard. The producers seem to have enough producers (and conscious minds) to dictate the duke's ultimate diagnosis and anxiety towards mental freedom, but they have lost many dramatic opportunities in the process.
