This film is really awful. After seeing the ad for it, I thought I would have its attractions ... but it did not. The girls can not work, and they can not sing. This film is full of songs on the soundtrack, and one of Disney's worst films by its a beautiful vision, horrible story line, unbelievable plot, FAR! Allie is not a bad actress in "Phil of the Future", so I do not know what happened in "Cow Bells". <br /> <br /> Her sister, AJ, seems to have just hit a ride on the "glory" of her sisters, and she has not yet shown any talent. <br /> <br /> Finally the girls are finally finalizing some cliche, but this train is delayed to protect the dilapidated image. <br /> <br /> <br />
