I read the book and really enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. However, I saw the film I was disappointed. First, Deborah Rafin is not disrespectful but she is very mature to play a 24/25 woman. Eventually, Christopher Reeve also had a false impression. According to the book, about 30. I would love to see him as his friend Red, an important part of Ellie's trip characters in a more exploration of his military career. Miss Busley misinterpreted the book as being a book plus size lady. I do not know the budget of the movie "Madison County Bridges" which I believe is released at the same time. <br /> <br /> But this made me poorly, poorly budgeted, unfortunate. As I have said, I would like Miss Spencer to come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books. I know her character better than anyone, and I feel like I'm casting. Let me down the picture!
