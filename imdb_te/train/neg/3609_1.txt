This is the worst horror film I've ever seen. When it first came on video I recalled a couple of years ago and I thought I enjoyed it for some strange reasons. So, like an idiot, I ended up buying the DVD once I was released ... no tragic mistake! I also give trouble to the plot because it's transparent to see what's right. Since I am a fan of Hersheil Gordon Lewis, I have gained the effects of bad cheeks and bad habits, but these people are taken to a different level. If they're trying to make the man in the deliberate worst image possible ... if their goal, they suceeded. If they want to intimidate you or to make you believe in the shape or shape of the film, then they have failed ... Faithlessness! Avoid this movie ... read the plot summary and when you find it!
