Yes, the Southern star has a pretty unforgettable title tune with that huge set-kroner Matt Monroe. Stunningly miscast with a courageous couple George Segal and Ursula Andres, with a big diamond search setting up this bloated and rather dull feature tone. Add tons of animal stock footage, and the harshly composed and dull photography by Raoul Kurtard in the Harry Andrews (strange voice, not less) and you end up with totally chaotic romance in the wilderness of Senegal.
