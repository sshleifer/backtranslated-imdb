The film is very good, especially the talent. Frankie Limon's Lauren Tate's filming is not particularly good at the music shows. He is not syncing well and his stage habits are Lorenz Tate, when he was Frankie Limon. The filming of women as a group of golden diggers was written in Hollywood. It is clearly the forces which move forward, but it only makes characters unreal. The portrayal of the film is the role of Little Richard of Mewuel Oilze and the guest role of Little Richard. Lela Rochen's eye candy is also common in the conservative role. It's very bad, Halle Berry and Vivika A. Fox's talents have been wasted. The whole Frankie Limeon Saga is lovely in real life. Very bad this film is a waste of opportunity.
