I thought this film was a poor documentary. None of the substance is discussed. It seemed to be less of a thought and did not offer anything new. Wonder or romance or any science in this film is really nothing to run. Many scientists are "stereotypical" and sometimes weird. A woman does not matter a lot of her awards, only children to help. She described all of her awards after a 10-minute scene. "Humble Scientist"? "I have dancing on my head," said another. I do not know what to explain. It does not cover the significant impacts of science on our culture. <br /> <br /> It is not a bad image for 10-14 year olds. <br /> <br>
