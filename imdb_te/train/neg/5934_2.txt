I feel like one of Leonard Cohen's greatest fans. He was an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. Leonard has the most valuable element in this documentary to hear reflections on his own life and career. Warming and humble. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the musicians performed at the concert did not speak in Leonard's musical / literary style with little knowledge. <br /> <br /> Although Leonard is very valuable to his song Rufus Secrets, Nick Covey, Jarvis Cocker & Beth Orton are exceptions. <br /> <br /> In this documentary particularly failed, Leonard Cohen and how the musicians connect him to the director. Many people are told in this regard, but the viewer is not drawn into Leonard Cohen. This failure is particularly evident in interviews with Bono and Edge. Leonard is a unique symbol, but Leonard Cohen can not translate their exact value. Cooperation with U2 is a farce. The whole live registration looks like a runaway job. As in the whole movie, Leonard Cohen only plays his role and is about his own piece. <br /> <br /> The whole montage and screenplay is like a highschool extramarital project. Effects of echo, slow-motion or flashed images are kept ill. Camera work is some tedious. I do not remember any of the communities that I expected of the score. Sometimes the filmmaker appears to add psychological aspects to the film. <br /> <br /> In some cases, Leonard says how he influenced a musical style. Initially he can not recall the genre name, eventually saying that he is punk, and Panksters really chose to have his music. <br /> <br /> There are direct sequences of "I Can not Forget". <br /> <br /> "I can not forget, I can not forget," who will remember?
