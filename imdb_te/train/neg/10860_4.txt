This was disappointing for me. I came to me through a box set entitled "Classic Film Noir", which is usually a gift to someone I know that I enjoyed the pictures in that style (Noir is not a style, not a style, I'm not a genre). I do not think it's a noir film at all. Every black and white B film label made of Nair from 1947 to 1955 appears to have a tendency to date and market and the label is not always suitable. There is a persecuted male character, Ed Callen (Lee J. Kobe), and takes place in many locations in the action of the film. That's only about Noir stuff that I can only see. There is no pervasive mental disorder, nor there is no real reason to sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt has become a Femme Fatale and can not believe it. I do not want to spoil the film to the potential audience. Nevertheless, I heard what else to say about the film Noir's other expression.
