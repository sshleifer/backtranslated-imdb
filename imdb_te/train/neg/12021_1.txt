It might be a bit tough for me, but unfortunately its direct in his directed career. Let's just look at the work done so far. They just cross the 3-star mark. <br /> <br /> Why do I see this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lallless and Heroes Star Greg Greenberg. Lucy played the best role in the film, and she has an overall film. I do not hope she will break into a "blockbuster" and a big league of actors, she has clearly had the skills. Gregg is great, distinctive TV acting style. <br /> <br /> The film is unusually classified as horror. The only "horror" is the last one, and they last for a maximum of 2-5 seconds with little blood in them. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting and destroys bad direction, editing and acting (portraying from Lucy). Actors do not have a real connection, it is important in a story. You're not looking at nothing. <br /> My advice: Stay away from this film or stay away from anything better. Hurst is in relationship.
