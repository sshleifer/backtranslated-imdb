This is a very old film intended to demonstrate youthful eagerness for freedom in some merciless British schools. Oh yes it looks like in the army, you are committed and learn what you asked. Yes young dream but it breaks their dreams and sweep away their optimism of entrance of life. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you have any good intentions to increase the cinematographic challenges, how do you end up with good results? <br /> <br /> How am I boring? <br /> <br /> At least one-year-old cookie was shot in MacCowville in a Clockwork Orange, a truly powerful social satire and self-sensitive sentimentalism.
