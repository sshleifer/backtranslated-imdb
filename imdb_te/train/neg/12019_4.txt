I read good reviews on this board for "Mr. Scarface", but like anyone who does not practice in the style of Italian gangster films, the picture makes little sense. In fact, at the beginning of the ten million Lira scandal, the film reacted quite a bit with a short twist in the identity of Rick's (Al Clair) character. The whole gang war strategy has drained me with the addition of Vin√°nzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but many viewers have commented that only one person who gave life to his frequent ineffective efforts in violence. Tony also accompanied Tony along the streets before laying a hand on them, and I was somewhat confident that Manzari's gangsters actually did not stroke. For all of his titles as title character, the Jack Palace was quickly wasted in antiquimactic near the end of the US title title, "Mr. Scarface" making it more difficult. I saw spaghetti Western enough to know they did all the work; I guess this is not my first look at a spaghetti gangster film.
