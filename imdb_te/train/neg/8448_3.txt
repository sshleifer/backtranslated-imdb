Horror comedy is one of the slums, which really does not deserve horror or comedy one or another. It's spectacularly good, it's any kind of jingle that works, but some have real fears and do not have enough humor to manage the movie. <br /> <br /> The failure of the film is followed by its hero (Phillian) Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) is the monster after his first introduction. The whole part of the film Drugs - Michael Rooker's role is not interesting to us as a person, and if he grant it, he's going through a series of movements - he becomes a monster rather than a horror-comedy alien attack film. In the final analysis, the film's problems are in the script - it is not important for audiences how the monster works or promotes. The purpose of horror-comedy is to back up the leaders in one of the shotguns and then dismiss the bugs. Instead we get an exploration of the alien's habits and strategies that make this part of the image drag. <br /> <br /> <p> When the filmman and his posse finally confront the alien, the film begins to cook, but once again the problem is the script. The audience knows this time - and the characters need to know - that the grant does not get infected just a few diseases, and consequently leads (shotguns) - instead they are constantly "true to a hospital". Although their reflexes are human and real, they must only act in the action movie characters and just the film's promise. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** After the first confrontation and the burst of the alien larvae's story (the smallest character and perhaps the best view in the film) the script will once again cheat the movie. One of the characters at this time was almost captured by alien and developed an insight into the alien. The character-director (gun) chooses a whole new role rather than one of the smaller characters already developed. Why? Why he introduces a completely new role more than an hour into the movie that turns into a plot center? By the time the character was attacked, she had no idea about her and she was less concerned about her, even though she was a nice girl in her bath. Gun decided not to use this role and decided to use one of the smaller characters that he had just set up, saving time and money without introducing his family. Furthermore, the leader and heroine alien schemes were filled with all the extra characters, and the foreigners were backed up and rounded with more force. <br /> <br /> My final criticism is the movie look. Gun is primarily a writer, or maybe it's budget restrictions, but this film looked ugly and uninteresting. Most of the action takes place in the woods or in the field, and the screen is just brown. Set in wheels (the fictional town that takes action) look cheap. The whole movie is cheaper. I would say that the Box Office Mojo films budget is $ 15 million, newspapers say 29 million dollars, and no name is being used. <br /> <br /> Last criticism The main character is based on the reality of the characters. By the time the Phillian and Co Hunting Grant / Foreigner started, a woman disappeared and Grant animals were mutilated. At this time I want to take the FBI or the minimum state police and take it from Hick Sheriff. A woman was disappeared, murdered, and worked locally mentally. Authorities call time. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is a horror comedy, it is a very similar image to DreamCatcher, a very aggressive attack and a type of monster and its intentions. With Dream Cacher's story (especially the entire Morgan Freeman subplot) and exclusively ending, it is strong in many ways, mainly primarily strong, but this is very important because it looks pretty. Even if it is a soul-product values, because of the simple plot and the focal point of the structured spine, we show how painless it is to find out how I found the fine appearance.
