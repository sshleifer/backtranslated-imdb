I thought the film was dry ... it was very frustrating to see what a plot to wait and no bone. Not one of Robbins Williams's worst films. I hope you may wait a few months because it's like a model for movies that do not come out as rentals that year ... I do not want you to see it or say why I spend my money! Plus it's only watching 8 people for being a new movie .... It's showing a Friday night at 9:50. I also felt that I needed some more excitement or anything to stay awake. Voices are very small when they speak characters in this role, you can not hear what they say.
