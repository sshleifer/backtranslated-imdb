Are you talking about people here? I have to look at a different movie than you guys. I was frustrated because I walked out of the theater. What's with these elements. I was only laughed once and not hard. Whoever filmed the film green and dumped on the street. I usually like something in a movie, but it's crazy. "Slackers" makes "No Tatter Movie" a classic. One of the worst "body shots", "con air" and "conspiracy theory" is one of the worst. All costs are away! I thought they would leave the theater a forgery sign and give the studio people money, but I'm not worried. I feel I have never seen that money or two hours again.
