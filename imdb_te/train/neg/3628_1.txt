The dream of an art house maven. Overrated, overpraid, overdone; The best film of 1951 was not eligible for its own merit, it was not out of the competition since the beginning. Sun, Detective Story, Streetcar, titled Abbott and Costello Invisible Man Meet; If you enter it in 51, it's better than this arthroves crater. The closed ballot has been influenced by intellectual audiences, from place to place and a false picture. Some of the actors in their time are less efficient (acting) or less attractive than Kelly and Caran. My # 12 worst of '51 (I watched 201 pictures), and 5 worst best movie Oscar winners.
