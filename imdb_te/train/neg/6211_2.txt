I pulled me into the film to watch this film, but after a few minutes I wanted to leave the theater. At least the story was a surprise to me, but realized that it was a waste of time and there was nothing there. <br /> <br /> Design: Very beautiful, mostly environment, but the characters are some models that are both horrible in terms of animation and design. They still look great on posters and screenshots, but not when they come to life! Most 3D companies do the same thing if they do the same thing: it's hard to technically create natural ingredients in 3D, and you feel that the character is alive. You need to make hard work and knowledge (hence money) to create something that really feels like hair, skin, fabric, etc. These characters are made of "cloth" in the image, and just do not work! So they have this ugly cold feeling of computer diligence, where the cloth is expanded or flourished as a plastic piece. It just does not have a sense of material, the dolls have been made (what those characters mean). I think that choosing this style for the characters is a big mistake. It's just a 3D shoot'in'rine concept of computer game. <br /> <br /> I did not want to go to the movie to have a computer game on my screen. <br /> <br /> Animation is also a disgrace. I was a professional animator and was disappointed with the low level of animation in "9". It is tight, boring, almost no imagination or mood. <br /> <br /> There was a lot less than the most average 3D animations I saw, which is not good. <br /> And that bad character design and bad animation good story, right? It's not here. The original story is the worst thing in the film. It is less than any level. This starts straight forward, which goes straight ahead and ends up. There is no turning, no surprise, good dialogues, no development. We heard tales of computers overturning thousands of human beings and "9" only one of them, and ends in the first minute of the film. Stories do not even have time to arrive - they are right there, instantly show themselves, and soon some of them must act without knowing what will happen. It did not work. <br /> Acting, sound and script - Oh my gosh, what can I do? There are also many recurring action scenes. Tell, it's curious. Bad story has a bad script and "No, do not do this!" Except for dialogs like "I'll do it!" "But ... you can not be alone!" "We can do it together!" "But there are rules!" "But we must protect him!" "Ohh" and "Ohhh" and "Ehh", and "Oh", and "Whatchout", and "Run Out!", along with those terrible tragic dialogs, so that's also repeating all the time, And "Oh Oh!" They follow almost every jump, runs, or fielding, and they seem to have neither synchronized nor unread. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: bad acting, bad animation, bad sound, bad story, bad script, bad characters, everything is expected, no surprises, no twist, nothing. Some good models do not have time value. Not big!
