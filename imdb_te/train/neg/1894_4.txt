Although the Gillaitones are flying as part of the film's title, it does not have any connection with the original flying gillotions (1975) and its sequel flying gilotins II (1978). Both of these are the artifacts of the Kung-fu film and are still a classic. This is a very small copy of the original, and is less than average as a normal Kung-f movie. <br /> First, the film does not have much work. This is a mad combat scenario after another, and the flying guillotine also plays a big role in them. The story is about a few Shaolin saints who track down some villains who took off with a holy book, and part of this book is part of a nasty Prince plot. The same evil prince plans to use the guillotine to attract the monks and fly over them. <br /> <br /> There are four films with flying guillotine as part of its title. This is the quality of my opinion. The design of the guillotine in this movie is different from the other three. It suggested that this movie was produced by another company from another three. <br /> <br /> In this movie accidentally poor production. <br /> <br /> Get rid of this thing better and see two original ones.
