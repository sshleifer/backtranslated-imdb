It was originally interesting. The innocent park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a beautiful, secret woman (Lisa Jane), who calls it shortly. They are happy, then she disappears without warning. He searches for her and after some dead ends, she says that she has been abused by some of her abusive childhoods and may have criminal actions. And then, the filmmakers seem to not know what to do with this story. Initially, it was not as suspicious as it sounded, at least it was worth watching. Then it will be interesting or very meaningful. And the end so lame, so dull, and devoid of any excitement or intelligence, you'll think the screen writers did not know what it was and got bored trying. Sorry for a good idea!
