Somewhere, out there, all the worst gay movies must be listed all the time. Camera shots are one of those people who sit in the stars, look indirectly into space, or obscure the kitty cats who eat spaghetti. The story of this motion sickness is a boy and a boy story and one of them is a depressed mother and another mother who lives and love and swim in the swimming and grottos and they talk and walk and swim and swim and drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days Then come out and move forward very fast and have a lot of rewind There is a long, sharp shots of ID and one of them, or just sit back and do nothing. I feel like this is a sophisticated film making technique, or it's too bad to fill with long and wasted shots because if they are to be based on the hero or story, the film is 14 minutes. It's not wrong for me in the last six months, and I'm not sure it's too formalistic, predictable and boring, but this is really a terrible waste of time "Beautiful Thing" And the beginning of "I'm oh, whatever, creative sinny mah", but I gave that opportunity when it ended Sorry, I concluded after it is thrown on the DVD and if you do not want to, I'm sorry forgiven.
