<br /> The budget has never been shy. <br /> <br /> Appoint the actors and make the right picture. Very thin plot, and astounding lines. <br /> Surprisingly, it is not worth watching. <br /> They avoid the same "shots" of a stealth aircraft. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal is the time to retire from movie making. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn, and Submarzed are already bad, but this film is even worse.
