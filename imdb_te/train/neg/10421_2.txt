I have seen this movie as a very young girl (I'm 27 now) and it's intrigued for years. I brought every factor in this film to the violence (obviously) to music. I still argue that my parents allow me to see me and nobody will tell me that they will not see such a movie. I learned that I have such strong feelings about it, and I am currently reading the book (with an unpleasant curiosity and it's an authentic) and it's really great story. But I do not think this should be made in a cartoon. Ever. Well, maybe kids will find it quaint in the days but gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and I still had hard time seeing drawn rabbits similarly. Every time I hurt a little heart. I am a non-I but I watch what the first parent to show them in this book as their parents read the book instead or the first to make some of the content they approve. Not everyone has identified it as ill-fated but we're there; 0)
