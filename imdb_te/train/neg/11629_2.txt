** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is totally unrealistic, not a plot, and basically the stars themselves are portrayed. The most intimate scene in the film when Shabana Azmi is in the shower, then she is playing a shower from TV TV. <br /> <br /> In the end, the long-running Shabana Azmi hardly kills him to allow the murderer Naseeruddin Shah to run and shoot the role! <br /> <br /> * The director and actors throw each other into disgrace and listen to Shabana Azmi, "Oh Sh-t!" <br /> <br /> Out of ********** (10 out of 2)
