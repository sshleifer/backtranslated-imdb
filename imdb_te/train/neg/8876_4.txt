There are always some gags out there that you expect them to be "An Officer and a Gentleman", "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and other films I can not remember without doubt), and Damon Wines's lines are well into a disappointing movie with some bright spots , Are predictable. As I said, unfortunately you can not be surprised at this film ...
