I can not believe I will waste my time with this movie. I can not call the movie too. This is nothing to recommend. <br /> <br /> I like low-budget movies and unnatural movements but I've been bored with death. It's not that interesting and bad acting. You wonder what these people are thinking when you spend money on producing this film. I'm finally looking at it. I would recommend none of this film. How are they released? Is this kind of movie a favorite audience? You can find this at almost any video store because there must be. <br /> If you like bad movies it is for you.
