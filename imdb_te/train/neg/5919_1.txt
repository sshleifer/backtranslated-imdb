I rented this film yesterday and could hardly express my frustration with Laura Ingalls for a little less product. I can not say it's terrible writing or bad direction or both, but many are disappointed to waste time to see these gifts. It is based on a weak linear story line, very poor lines, and beautifully scene and sold to beautiful people. Unfortunately this is not enough. It is advisable to rent a fixed tape to waste your time in this trash. Lindsay Wagner also clearly played a beautiful patron of a Ranch owner who is very close to someone who is near a ranch, who is very clearly written by a young man from Los Angeles and works very hard to do anything written with someone with much knowledge of the world.
