I saw this movie a few days ago and made a gem in scary parts. I must admit, I found that I was pretty good ... I thought what the characters are saying. <br /> <br /> 1. Her boyfriend seems to be pretty fit, and she does not have the sound of being killed. Do you want him to be at least trying to take a killer? <br /> <br /> When the gym teacher said "SOOOO in love with Lisa," I was almost screaming on the screen. <br /> <br /> When your girlfriend's family kills a teacher in love with him, you can not make such comments if you have half the heart. Nash, how many people have gone out and when the uncle comes up with the accident, Donna, boyfriend, aunt, and uncle bring the car into a car and lift the house with HRT and police forces, if you do not have any way to stay away from the murderer. <br /> I can not go. And on. And on. <br /> <br /> It may be nice to look younger, younger couples just for a pleasant night. If you do not consider all the goofs, it is an average image.
