I think Michael Ironsides acting career should be over, if I have this kind of low badge garbage. <br /> <br /> You can spend a lot of time on this film. <br /> <br /> If this film is very good and good budget, then the film will watch over and over again. There is a scene at an outpost that looks outside the front of a railway station, and I have to bet. <br /> <br /> There is a scene given to the film 3, space craft landing and a lake around the forests. <br /> There is another scene that is like a plant, which I give, and does not look like a space outpost. <br /> <br /> This film has a stupid, serious low budget, no sense makes no difference and God helped Michael Ironzids.
