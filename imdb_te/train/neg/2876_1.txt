I questioned the intent of the BTK killer, the creators of this virtual account. Are they trying to portray animal rights activists as unhealthy monsters? Who is responsible for this? Do they think that those who have joined this demon enough to be hurt? The tragic disgrace and exploitation of the victims! It's like a personality experiment: what can you do more harm, slaughter or human murders? They used the original names of some victims ... the film is bizarre, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of the film have used this tragedy for their own agenda! People need to wake up and back to the line!
