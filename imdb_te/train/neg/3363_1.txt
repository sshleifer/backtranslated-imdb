<br /> Although this version shows, every aspect of "ill-spirit" including unnecessary. Special hangouts. <br /> <br /> The "Mystery", presented in the original film, is the most horrific episode that has caused strange things to know about what happened. By showing the "old man" face, this Mr. completely disappeared. Even worse: special effects (wooden children facing) are ridiculous. It's a stupid remake, which is actually pretty scary
