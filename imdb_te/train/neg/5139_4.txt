I think the most horrific fans love scarecos, so I said I'm very boring. The idea behind it is interesting, but it seems to pull too much. I think the main problem is that it is all set in the dark. Sometimes dark horror movies (such as Humunas) can work, but Schercos is in the dark for the whole movie. Most of the time is hard to figure out what's going on, and scarecrows are hard to see too, even if some shots are creepy. If more light is used, it probably could have been better. <br /> <br /> Unlike the Dark Knight of the Scarecrow, which is better than most, there are not many films related to the killer shock of my knowledge. I expect scarves on any day.
