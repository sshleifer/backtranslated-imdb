I, like many people, saw this film for the first time in 'Theater'. These "Titanic" fans are not the "best writing" of the film, but the best picture below. First off, DiCaprio is a terrible actor, no matter which way you see. He looks like his appearance. His performance "skills" are essentially trying to act with very cheesy lines and sexy. Second, the film also has a rather boring and simple plot: the girl is in love with the guy, they're sinks, then lots of crappy love scenes. Anyone with more than 50 IQs is not wise in any way. It's not original. Plus the director felt the need to pull it out for 3+ hours. I can cut it off in an hour block without losing the platform. At the end, "Titanic" is the most overrated picture from date to time. Why so much attention came and money was beyond me.
