"Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damn" is the third retirement of Gabriel Night Games, a series of adventure games about roguish author / paranormal detective, Gabriel Knight. Gabriel and his colleague, Grace, were asked to investigate the mysterious attacks known as the "night visitor" called Prince James's address of Albany. When Prince James's son was kidnapped, Gabriel moves the visitors to Rennes Le Chateau, where he begins a mystery associated with the Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Despite marketing, this game is about vampires. Vampires have a token display in the game, but Voodoo is not the dominant central venue, as in the "Science of the Fathers" or "The Beast Vitin Inn". Gabriel and Grace did not make any attempt to reveal the true nature of vampires or research on vampires. Although vampires are killing three people during the game, their victims are randomly selected and do nothing with the main theme. <br /> <br /> The charm of the first two Gabriel Knight is in the interconnections of Gabriel's villains. Through these relationships, the player could not help but was sympathetic to the villain, so the villain was more and more of a human being and a monster less. Nevertheless, Gabriel's interaction with the villain in "Blood of the Sacred" is the only one in a cheesy interview that has nothing to do with the villain. <br /> <br /> Gabriel and Grace plays are very waste in this mystery. Gabriel spends his time snooping on the identities of a treasure-hunter team who lives at his hotel, but he does not care much more than red herring. Grace Rennes spends her time in Le Ch√¢teau's secret research, but her research has been applied to superfluous by the existence of a perplexing ally who knows this mystery for centuries. <br /> <br /> These perplexing actions are ally and his polar opposite --- the vampire leader --- are superfluous. Cite about the mystery of friend Ronnie Le Chateau, which Grace (other treasure hunters from the tour team) tries to find them. However, he revealed the mystery to Grace on 1 day, instead of adding the kidnapped child to an additional 48 hours. <br /> Meanwhile, the leader of the vampire has been failing to achieve the goals of the plot for centuries because he kidnapped the child who chose to take action two days later. <br /> <br /> The game, which focused entirely upon the Holy Grail, was much better. Kidnapping and vampires should be eliminated, such as replacing a species against the Vatican to uncover the mystery of Rennes Le Chateau. <br /> <br /> Gabriel once played a reluctantly Catholic role, which has many opportunities for the development of the conflict. <br /> <br /> More than anything, the game is back to Tim Curry as a better interface and Gabriel Knight Voice.
