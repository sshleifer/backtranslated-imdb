One of the five worst films I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerated. In fact, I would like to see it, so you can get pleasure by seeing the showgirls. <br /> <br /> In 400 votes, the film received a rating of 5.3 / 10. But voted 10/10 of voters, due to the message of the film - the weapons of nuclear weapons are the flame of humanity. Chuck Murdoch is a small league stalk of all stars. The soon-to-be "Amazing Grace" Smith is the All-Star Boston Celtic, who left the basketball ball inspired by Chuck's story. All sports leagues are coming from professional level to high school for a few leagues from around the world. All children in the world then strike silence. This inspires the president of the United States to meet with the Soviet premier, and later the Little Ligs will agree to eliminate all nuclear weapons in the beginning of the season. The film ends with the chak, as the President threw a baseball in his new Best Friend Chuck every year, with the President worrying about hitting each dough. <br /> <br /> Somewhere around the line, a bumpy underworld boss kills Amazing Grace. Even if the president knows he can confirm the FBI killer, he can not prove. So the president calls on the owner of the underworld ("But I do not care, take him on the line") and he says he will resign from all the boards and sells all the stocks. <br /> If honestly, this film is very bad, I can not stop it. This is in the morning from 2:30 am to 4:00 pm and I see it. I was not stopped by anti-nuclear campaign. I stopped by breakdown of all organized sports. I can not even understand that "Amazing Grace" Smith was killed. And Chuck became friends with these famous athletics, and why was he desperate to take his son's Principal Stand? And the chic moment at the end of the chick chuck says, "I did not tell you, but I am proud of you." Cue Hug.
