<br /> <br /> There are many goofy tasks about this film. I can not possibly name but some: <br /> BOGART Character: 1. His name ?? Whip McCord (very easy, I'll leave it to the boy, which makes Humphrey sound good) 2. His long, curly hair and crazy side burns. 3. His black Bart gets up, done with Spurs! <br /> <br /> Cognney character (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lipstick did not help him. , Either. 2. The man in his entire movie is swallowing his hat! Can not they find a hat that suits him? Even a little? !!? 3. His pants are very tight in the rear. <br /> <br /> If you're a storm or cognizant fan, you may want to figure it out. Pace change to see them in the Western, make yourself a favor and forget that idea. Make horses! <br /> <br /> All partially, I admit to my favorite favorite film of Westerns, but I have seen much better. <br /> <br /> In a comedy level, or upper camp, the Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, beware of the viewer. So, if you look at it, a) You look to every Western country. B) You are a true cigarette or bogie c) Any of the above mentioned comments will appeal to you. Woah ?? ..
