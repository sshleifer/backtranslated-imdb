But the essence is that it is the current format so it will not be longevity of "old" Scooby and the gang is so lightweight the problem. I'm sure it will succeed in quick money back But I'm sure there is a very real risk that I have lost a long-term buy in the old and young. My 6-year-old son seeing the new version is really unsatisfactory and without any prompt said it's really badly animated and why is not anything like the last series (where are you). <br /> <br /> Scrappy Doo is an irregular but endless one. Let's hope a clue is a reference to the producers.
