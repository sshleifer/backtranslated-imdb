Others have already commented on director Tobey Hooper's "degradation", but what about Brad Dourrup? He is perfectly capable of choosing good projects (he has proved to be the same year in "Exorcist III"), so how did he appear in this regard? Certainly, he gives a stable performance with attacks, and the film is not entirely wrong; It's just unwilling, unwell and simpler. It has three "un-sessions" too. (* 1/2)
