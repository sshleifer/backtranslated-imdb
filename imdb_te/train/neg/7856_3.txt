This film is pretty good. I'm in the army and the soldiers shot in this film are awful. If you are in the military and if you look at the film you have to laugh and they will be disturbed by the whole team because they played a team. It's ridiculous. They worked as a group of ordinary people with army uniforms without knowing what to do. It is pretty ghost film that I have to say the least. There is a couple scenes where they try to make you jump. If you are bored and want to watch a violent, ghoth film I will recommend it. This is a good image if not in the military. I have to say I liked the first one better than this one.
