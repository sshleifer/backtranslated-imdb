A lovely boy and his mother somewhere to move in the middle of town, cats and death follow them immediately. <br /> <br /> When I see the film, I admit that I'm a bit scared from the kittens. But with the intensity of all the things that are wrong in the film, I believe, there is plenty around it, which is very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The characters rely only on their basics, such as satire. Fear, greed, pride, anger or anger encourage these people. In fact, the story is telling you that it seems to be a failure. The supernatural building and it's a Stephen King screenplay (actually nothing against Mr King) is very well supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and most suitable music. The film's fullest gem plays Alice Krieg, Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother. <br /> <br /> The King Outside is trying to find spots and twists into the campy on a small storyline horror gem that has to be a simple story or a little different people (okay - in this case too), no horror fan collection.
