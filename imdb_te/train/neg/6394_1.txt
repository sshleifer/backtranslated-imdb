This image is bad. This film is terrible. Acting is bad. The arrangement is unrealistic. This story is irrelevant: a comet will be visible once a night in the ins. Most people in the world decided to see this comet. Later, the morning of the next morning, some people changed dust from the comet's radiation. People's clothes are still intact, and there are still living plants, but people are drowned. Bones, nothing. Darkly. How does radiation burns people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact? <br /> <br /> Even better, the kamet mutilated some people with monsters eating zombie meat. Their makeup is also not a threat to the newborn baby. The clandestine Clown Posse has got me scared ... and they have to look stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there were survivors. Steel-encircled persons escaped zombie-dome and death when Comet was approved. <br /> <br /> Do you join the radiation of the comet on their tracks? <br /> <br /> Equally insulting 60th horror music. The movie and you want to shoot your television. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> These three letters are totally unrealistic. Who will go to rob the day after an Apocalypse with eating mutants running everywhere? There are four 5 minute horror scenes in the whole film, most of them dreams. The South Park between these scenes is an improbable dialogue that feels brilliant. The silence between the basic dialog is painful. I made a good film with the bag of four monkeys and cheetos. Never see this movie.
