It's just a terrible 'comedy' - it's really bad movie. There are no funny items. Jokes that are funny. I do not know how some people say that this bad little picture is 'attractive' or 'quality'. If a person has seen a picture, you can make the argument of Brothers. But I have seen thousands of pictures: Leonard's sixth (now, it's funny)! <br /> <br /> I do not even know what the Brothers have qualified in the Internet Movie Database. <br /> <br /> The video is an idiot. A root canal is more complicated, this clich√©-ridden unnecessary thing.
