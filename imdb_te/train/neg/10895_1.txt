I saw very bad images. Most of the time I can enjoy a crappy horror movie for what to do. But this is really bad for new changes. <br /> <br /> It's a blend. <br /> <br /> There are no obstacles, horror, no suspense, the guys rubbing themselves one hour and a half later. <br /> <br /> There is no effect on the crappy horror genre
