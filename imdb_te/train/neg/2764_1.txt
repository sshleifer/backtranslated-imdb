At first, I did not know how the film was made on the screen. Its low-budget SCI-Fi channel image, its just awful. My friend and my friend who loves the movies, the Independence Day, Jurassic Park, Lotra and the film dragons are going to see this movie, looking forward to the transformers with the mindless entertainment. All we got was a mindless hour and a half. CG is not as bad as I was expecting, but the plot is very terrible along, acting for it. Is it primarily a Chinese remake of the 500-year-old dragons ... a good remake of the Rain of Fire? No, the plot tries to deeper than it should leave only the plots holes, but the magic, and the very small real battle between dragons (instead of the big snakes) becomes just ridiculous. The director tried to add a little bit of humor in the film. My and my friend laughed the whole thing (all 5 people), and we believed we had spent money. A small trailer on the TV takes many steps while resting in the trash. I have seen a lot of B movies like The Reputation, The Cave, Spider, and others, but if you want to make a non stop stop for an hour, see it. <br /> <br /> Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Do I drink?
