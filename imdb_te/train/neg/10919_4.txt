Many of Bollywood fans have a great respect for Amitabh Bachchan's murderer but I think it's too overrated. Manmohan Desai worked alongside Suhag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseib, Des Prem and Kooli and I was disappointed when I saw Mardi. My main stomach pain about Mart is that it feels part of Amar Akbar Anthony 2, perhaps Mr Desai has gone through ideas, after all he has been using that formula for years and years. 1. The first of the few members of the cast repeats from the AAA, for instance, Akbar, Nirupa Roy and some others as police inspectors who bring Amar to Muslims. 2. AAA loses her eyesight in Nirupa Roy, in Mard loses her voice 3. Amata is a well-known song in the AAA (Shirdi as Sabi Baba) Mama Sherawali. <br /> <br /> Nominally a few times seem to be ill, and true Manmohan Desai left your brain in the movies that were in the door, and I thought he would go a long way. My last stomach was a disappointment to the songs compared to songs in past Manmohan Desai films. I know that I have a lot of fans, but I do not like a bit. I am really sorry to write this review because I am a big fan because I loved his movies at a young age.
