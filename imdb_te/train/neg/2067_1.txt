Straight to Point: "The Grove Tube" is one of the most infamous, innocent and apparently horrific films. This "comedy" is very intelligent, and that is why it was created. <br /> <br /> This film is not "bad" or bad "enjoyable" bad. The films have a crime to keep the entertainment level as "Plan 9" or "Robot Monster". You can really see such movies and get out of the kick. <br /> <br /> The film is very bad, SO is poorly produced, starred and scripted and SO is incredible old, just before "camp" or "schlock" before this Saturday Night Live broadcast, comparisons are probably inevitable. I'm not a big fan of SNL, but this film is worse than the lowest SNL skeet you can find. And man, that's bad. In order not to leave the audience just as men do, Shapay often throws breastfeeding every time, but since 1974 the poorly-painted chest does not excite anyone. The truth is that the film is very small and I am suspicious if it's a sleep-inspiring vacation trip in 1974. <br /> <br /> A man named Ken Shapiro made this film. I swear to God, I am ready for 10 years of age with video camera and more intelligently. This is just a matter of confusion - it's really reliable. <br /> <br /> "Dancing Man" Sequence, a man in the streets of NYC (Shapiro) is a tune Dancing Man "Sequence is not a great thing - Shapiro tries to make it desperate to complete the song, but it is somewhat worth watching. <br /> <br /> If not, the film is such a worst episode, it's inaccurate, and how a true human being is clever enough.The name of the film is "Kran Shapiro's crater." It is amazing, but many really talented filmmakers can not enter, however, genres at NYU love this movie I can tell tayani. Total rubbish.
