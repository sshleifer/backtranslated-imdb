The Nightmare in Emm Street: A Dream Child, the fifth installment in Nightmare in Em Street series and the worst sequel than Nightmare on Em Street 2. The DVD box is set for my birthday and I have watched all the sequels. The dream boy was a little worse, and I was surprised that they were doing well with the last two sequels. But I guess they will miss the charm, the story is not only fun, but I am not happy wherever I go. Alice has become more and more annoying, she's not Nancy or Kirsten, so she has run this film and did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she is carrying a baby, she is not happy with her life. But Freddie also returned and he would not be easy on her after he easily defeated her in the fourth film. However, he wanted his child and was born again to the world. Have you ever thought of Freddie's parents? <br /> <br /> A nightmare at Emm Street in Elm Street: The Dream Child investigation and Alice soon learns to be like Freddy's childhood and may be a thing of losing him. <br /> <br /> Dream Night in a Nightmare on Elm Street is just an insult to all bad films and series. I do not think anyone would be happy with this sequel. Just the story is really silly, I mean I may possibly work, but once again, it's just running the wrong way. If you look at the sequels for the Nightmare in the Elm Street series you should see it, but I do not really recommend it, at least not with my opinion, it's not worth it. <br /> <3/10
