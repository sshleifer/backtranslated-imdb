This film is one of the most amazing cars I've ever seen in a movie, and definitely some of the hottest women, but I still have to say one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot, and if you read with a little reflector, you're acting too. <br /> <br /> Starting, and in the characters, the hot woman singing (clear lip synchronization). The music agent or the producer comes in, she thinks she is wonderfully in the race asks her. She turned down very bad memories. The war hero has a number of fights, back to war, and the film becomes a hero with the attitude that he is better than everyone else. Drive in a fast exotic car. Brother races, then dies. Cut away to obtain weapons from the hero, friend to get a revenge for death. (You never saw this friend before or after, but really care about him) Are you sure you want to do this? Yes; I'm really sure; Yes, give me weapons. Are you really sure? Yes; <br /> Now he is the owner of the car that led his brother to the house of his paternal grandfather. Finds a woman, decides to save her, she will run, and he can not finish killing her uncle. Now there is a race to complete the film. Oh yes, you have to throw a scene with hit people who do not really care about the bad stuff, but it adds a small plot. Race is not even exciting, of course it ends with two cars racing, and the throws at the end of the surprise should win. <br /> <br /> Okay, I saved you $ 7.00. You can send me all your money, because you have to say that I have enjoyed this experience. Do not make me wrong, the cars are awesome, and the nude is beautiful, but this is really a terrifying film.
