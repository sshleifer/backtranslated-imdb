Mighty Morphine Power Rangers is the most terrible television show ever made. There is not just a group of children wearing crazy clothes using martial arts while wearing a second class spandex outfit. <br /> They have special effects as they come from the 70s. <br /> <br /> The toys, the second rated plastic pads given to our children, are worse than television shows <br /> <br /> <br /> Try to give your kids something like Nickelodeon, which shows that the shows are actually some kind of intellectual than the Power Rangers.
