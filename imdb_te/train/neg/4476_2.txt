I saw the movie premiere in MTV. I am very mediocre (its best). I do not really explain the story of the conversation, and I think there are plots of holes. Poor performance does not have a preferred role in this adaptation. I find that the characters are all too wayive when they come to someone they love. Moreover, Kate and Heath's love is very ignorant. They look like brother and brother rather than lovers. <br /> <br /> I saw this film because I wanted to see some actors and previous films that I played, but as I said, it is very difficult to like the characters. Catherine Heigl's performance is terrible, it's a complete shocker. She was terribly upset by Edward's madness, and there was not enough lines for Amy Osbourne to criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and his role was only a bit of sympathy, even though his character was a bit kick-off. <br /> <br /> Erica Christensen and Mike Vogel are considered to be our heroines, but heard and overly strange. <br /> <br /> I do not enjoy this movie too much. The Christian Punk band, a short demonstration of MxPx, but the small performance did not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a fantastic job convincing me that it was not a movie. I painted something completely different.
