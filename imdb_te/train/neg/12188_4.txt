I can not deny that his films are often entertaining, and I felt personally that Martin Scorsese was a little more overrated in his capabilities. Using a good number of elegant stylist in his movies "Look at me, is not I the director I expected?" <br /> <br /> For the remake of this film, it is very common. The dull image in the setting of a 1950s is a very bland that the stock itself is a distraction. Dramatic scenes combined with a sub-parody simulation of the traditional "psycho" score may be more ridiculous than the sense of weather. The score for "Psycho" is brilliantly unnerving, this 'tribute' sounds just dark and annoying. Sometimes the cast is also good, who screams 'sarcastic' just offering horizontal performances; This is a significant exception to Lewis' intellectual turn of the Bowden family's attractive teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> Here's the most dangerous criminal De Niro. Certainly, he appears to be suffering from the attack, but when he immediately opens his mouth, the brilliance just flows away. Now I'm not an expert on American tunes, who really comes from Manchester in England, but was he really able to go with a more diligent south drill? He is a gifted physical actor, he has almost overtaken this deadly mistake, but a lot. <br /> <br /> "The whole film's top-style style is ridiculously exaggerated, and the problem of weakening of scenarios such as visual and sonic bombs to the viewer is troublesome When will Scorsese know how to deal with the situation? <br /> <br /> I believe that the less skilled people in the lowest-serving 'killer-not-dead' <br /> <br /> All in all, completely ridiculous 'thriller.' Scorsese and De Niro have worked very well together.
