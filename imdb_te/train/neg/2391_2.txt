I love movies. I love the independent efforts and major studio productions. I love the stars in the stars and I love that I am unfamiliar. I like what kind of drama, comedies, action adventure, science fiction, mysteries, western and horror. I like foreign films as well as in English. I love the good movies and I also love the bad ones, because almost no film can ever entertain or amuse some level. <br /> <br /> In the last night of "Cowgirls", I participated in a 10 year old audience. Less than half, I'm alone. I could not tolerate the worries of my eyes soon. <br /> <br /> "Cowgirls" is the only film I have ever gone out to date. <br /> <br /> These unwanted, void, garbage, meaningless meaning, or lack of ransom value. It is enough to be one of the worst major films of all levels, to be blurred and unjustified at every level. It tries to be clever, but the concept of feminism is undoubtedly unhealthy. It tries to be funny, but its humor is coarse and horrified. This is one of the few films that you can desecrate their own values, by portraying the main characters by displaying a method of rebelling against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, watch "Water World", "Ishtar," or anything. Except the new "Alexander". If you are choosing between these and this, read a book instead.
