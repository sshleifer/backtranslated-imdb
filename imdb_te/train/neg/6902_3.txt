Despite Rave reviews this film has gained in New Zealand, which is undeserved of any hype sinister around the product. <br /> <br /> Whenever you have the whole look of a big budget <br /> <br /> Did not anyone see Brothers ?? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) can choose similarities ... I clicked the scenes like a boy playing basketball "boys said <br /> I believe Oscar Keightley will see herself deeply contrary , But his delivery will always seem just unclear self-enhanced. <br /> <br /> Samoans-living-NZ culture is not deeply, quietly, American speech, Work, and hopefully not all inbetween will undoubtedly have any doubts at all there are in their minds made at the end of this film. <br /> <br /> Robbie Magazia is always nice on the screen, but the script is let down by <br /> <br /> You always misrepresent me when there is a set of "comedy", in such a clear way, you do not have a clich√© pitchline The man is feeling like a good mood - see this is a white boy ... <br /> <br /> This Mooe and the happiest - anyone, that person has the brains of a tadpole and struggles to spell her name if given a million dollars. <br /> <br /> That eye is not great, fun but funny ..... nz wake up - all of this luminous (middle white guilt ?? :-)) Reviews .... <br /> Do my advice? If you see it, get drunk first!
