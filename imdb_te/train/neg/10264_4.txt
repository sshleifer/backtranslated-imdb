The head of a typical New York family, Marie Barton (James Gail), is working with her younger sister Eatel Grande (Loma Barton) in "Smirners Candy Store". After the kidnapping of Mrs. Grant in the purchase and sale of women as president slaves, the gravitational youth must be protected by Ms. Gail and her daughter Matt Moore (such as Larry Burke). <br /> <br /> There is a reputation that is hard to support "traffic in the Souls" - it is not uncommon, and it does not show anything very special to have a young woman's "virtue" sex traders threatened. Perhaps, it is first to show the first thing that is more than the length of the rituals (first ten reels). New York City's location scenes are the main attraction. Panning prisoners behind bars is memorable because cameras are unable to make movements. <br /> The traffic in the Souls (11/24/13) George Lune Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Eatel Grinnen
