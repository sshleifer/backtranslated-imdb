I'm waiting to see this movie with great imagination. The film "The Christmas Box", based on this book by Richard Paul Evans, is more accurately portrayed. I have sent a lot of emails to friends and family to ask them to watch this show, hoping they can understand a small amount of my "new" life. I was disappointed after seeing this film. In November 2003, as a mother and a child who had lost her child, I felt that the film was a light to parents, and I thought they would see the parent's light. The film is a very light hearted and Diane Keaton's compassion is an interview with parents who have buried a boy. It is very unreal since the beginning to stop. After this film, I have some calls, one of which is the same, "It's in the mark and in a few days you have been back on the road and listening to the radio and listening to life" Bunch of bull! It is clear that the director and Keaton never lost a child because no movie is a movie that is not a mark. I think that is Hollywood.
