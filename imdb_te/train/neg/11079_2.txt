Over the years I've been looking for half the best movies for my kids, I'm really sad to be really frustrating, direct to video trials (Eight for anyone more than age). I retreated the ball and asked the children half a movie "What did she say?" And "Why did he do that?" And eyes have been sore from rolling them every day or doing a bad job of introducing random plots changes that are not seemingly visible. And the next time someone decides that the skillless skill with a knife is simply "bringing realism" to a movie, please run them with a slow butter knife. "Prehysteria!" On top of it are the head and shoulders. Awl.
