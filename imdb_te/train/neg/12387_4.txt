Lipstick is another glossy film failure. I'm trying to think of a good thing about the movie, and I'm experiencing a problem with something. I guess I guess the red dress worn by Margax Hemingway's film and the script was not the worst I ever encountered, but it was very good. Lipstick is very appealing to the eye. The scenes are very glossy and cool to watch. The cast is okay. I thought the role of Anne Bancroft was the only possible role in the whole film. Chris Sarandon regrets seeing his time wasting time.
