Caf√© Lumiere canceled a beautifully photographed. If the director got the job done, I was very familiar with the director, who paid homage to Ozu Yasujaire. Even if Ozu does not reach greatness, he knows nothing about consensus on the meaning of the deep emotion and seclusion of How Oz. Ozoo plays a role in what he misses in full - we have not even introduced his main character (the perfect blank page). The number of his people has no medium or scenes. DVD Extras provide interviews with one of the actors and we do not exactly give them any of their interviews - <br /> <br /> The great Spanish film by Bardham is a great Spanish film called Nanca Eva Heppenz, known as Nanga Pasa Nada. It is a good title for this nonsense exercise. Through the film we gave evidence on a subtle Taiwanese composer. But all such evidence is not included. If you're not a railroad, it will not recommend this movie.
