This is so dull that I turned off the DVD ... probably by half. It is very weak and I can not give you full attention to what I have done. I really believe that young Carlito's filming is somewhat different, and I can not afford it. I do not really blame the actors, because I am a flat-falling script. I'm laughing a few times, but I did not think those lines would be considered funny. <br /> <br /> This is the only price I have purchased on 2 DVD sets and the price I paid for the original price alone. One of these cases is when they should let alone the classic stand.
