By 1973, a very good "Cleopatra Jones" idolater black actress Tamara Dobson threw a heroin ring in Hong Kong, returning to her signature role as a chic, super tough drug dealer. Cross-pollination of the Blocksploitation Action-Flick and Kung-Fu B-Movie is fun initially but ultimately flags. The shoot-out finish is exactly in the assembly-line, and Dobson is less powerful than her (she is still sexy, and she puts a special spin on her comic-styled conversation, but the surroundings are too high for her - she is so frustrated). Stella Stevens Villain plays this role; She's good, but she does not match the predecessor Shelley Winters. ** from **
