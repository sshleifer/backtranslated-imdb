<br /> <br /> It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, the graphics are fraudulent, and the script curiosity and the biggest question is that the lower-brow script selection method has gone down. All kinds of films from deep dramas make you kill movie type, so I can not tell Pixie. I struggle hard to find something to compare, but I do not think anything that matches this match, probably Starship Troopers 2. In my opinion the witch makes the movie gods cry and thinks about throwing my DVD player, but this is great compared to these effects. Acting is superb and the script should be awarded. You know that when a movie is funny and bad, you can kill your soul for a minute.
