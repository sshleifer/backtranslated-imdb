Back in the 70s, when I first saw it, I was in high school. It's nice. Now I see it as an adult and I am telling you oh right. So what's funny It's moments but they are very small. It's the jokes that no longer stand out. It will show younger audiences and they will lose completely. If you like this kind of humor, you would want to wear from the moon with Kennedy Fried Move or Amazon women. Tunnel Vision as well as Groove hose are for a long time for today's view.
