<br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a wealthy rich man who makes his life cut into pieces. He and his girlfriend Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) participated in a hit and run. <br /> <br /> As I said in my article <br /> <br /> What is this picture? Is? It combines comedy, drama, and sarcasm, but it certainly does not add much. <br /> If you do not want me to sit in a real life meeting, you will be weakened by uneven, unpleasant, one-dimensional characters. <br /> I'm not a big fan of the novel but it does not close because it's not my choice) but for those who enjoy the novel it's clear to me that this movie is considered a full mockery. The average image quality below the most talented actors is very difficult to achieve. <br /> <br /> Problems start with a nice guy Tom Hanks casting in a role that is apparently UNSympathetic. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel is a Brit. Bruce Willis is badly mistaken in the role. <br /> <br /> What was the previous thought? <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman can not escape the film in his honor, but he needs to give a heavy hand speaker to a slick "courtesy" after the climax. /> <br /> This film ends up becoming an absurd farce. <br /> I liked the composition of the talent; For that I will give ten to four, but I'm sure some people say the very good movie could have been made from the source material.
