<br /> <br /> What gem have you found in a huge band of $ 5 DVDs on Walmart (where is it)? As cheap as this disc, I feel ripped off. Special effects have a high school shape, wobbly tripods and sketchy lighting in camera work and acting as a perfect example of 'Christian School'. Long and tired 'prayer meetings' can be imagined by the construction company, aside from the enthusiastic production company and the ones who have pulled the item back to the vibrant production company. <br /> <br /> Anyone asked why Christian movies could be bad - maybe the Zion filmmakers should try to copy some of the best pictures. The things that make them better. Unbelievable stories and characters, a little hysterical arm waving and superstition, Oh, and a story heard - not all, just a true believer. I.E. Stop speech, save for the church. For example, take a woman or propsy range. Stunning images with a comprehensive storyline, great cinematography and serious music. No Historical Arm Waving. <br /> <br /> If this movie is a laugh track it is very good.
