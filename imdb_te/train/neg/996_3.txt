After looking back at Gasper Noyes's (2002), I look forward to more relevant expression of this theme. <br /> * SPOILERS * The ultimate scene, an inappropriate male-upon-male rape / torture scene, is less than a male revenge rape fantasy. Nevertheless, the film did not follow this film too. Instead, a scene of dancing (which is far greater than FAR of the brutality of early rape as it was sequentially) was a shot of Donson's face or "<br /> <br /> That scene was not shocking, but such a graphic scene I'm trying to find audiences <br /> <br /> In general, when I was in the film, I would like to have their own words, I try to take it but do not know what that doctrine is really.
