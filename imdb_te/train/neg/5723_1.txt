Anyone who says that it is better than a hostel, full garbage is someone I'm not a fan of hostel but believe me this is just ridiculous. This is just another shot directly on the DVD, the lack of waste of time in your time, I can not believe how much of these movies are there and I'm still to see a good one. In video's nasties of 80's, bloodshed and horror movies have anything to say with the director no budget but a great story and new ideas are loaded and especially heart and soul. Now they just seem to supply suppliers in blockbuster browsing people trying to rent a copy of this until I'm expected to keep these movies appearing. The film is so small, how awesome it is, the performance is also awful, the absolutely incredible location and the soundtrack it's hurt by the beggars. Waste of this time is absolutely nothing going for it, unless you're on the quest to compile the list of the worst films of all time. If a female character is pointing a gun and threatens to shoot them if they do not take back, you can see that my best / worst part in the movie does not cover her trigger with her finger. Silk. A perfect joke.
