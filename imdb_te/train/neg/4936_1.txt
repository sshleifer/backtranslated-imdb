I have wasted my time and gave me the opportunity. This should be one of the worst new shows. If they have given an award to the performances that suck this one category. Acting was poor and storyline was created. Now dinosaurs were a bit strange but at least it was fun. The show lasted three seasons and was finally scrapped. This new performance based on the commercials of insurance companies is not funny and nothing is done for it. Probably the original statements and the total times they are, and still, repeat what's wrong in this show. It just got to the TV and we already tired of watching "Caveman" characters.
