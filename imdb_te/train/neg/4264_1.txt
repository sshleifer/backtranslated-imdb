This film is me negligent. It's a great feeling ruined with a terrible script. The story just did not flow and it was better off. Many stories have not been written for this story, or go out with genuine ideas. The love story may have been slightly expanded, and the artillery is good. The whole main role of the growing role is that he needs more and more about training and standing around standing around. Everyone likes a good "little guy surpassing" story and has promised it but should not be scripting failures. In the final battle scene, it has some fantastic performances and it is soft because of choreography. <br /> It may be very nice :(
