The film starts with the promise, but it takes a long time in the Sepia World of distance and alienation. We left hanging, but with very nothing nothing to save the grave and sharp female faces tired shots. Not climbing on the wall Help us climb to the top. <br /> <br /> Why do we love a couple - father and son less - why do they separate from the real world of their world? Claustrophobia beyond all imagination. Losing this existence in the real world differs greatly and unnecessarily with the enrollment son of the armed forces. Why not the circus, so can we at least appreciate some color? We are losing, but sadly there is no enlightenment, it is not available for everyone in the movie.
