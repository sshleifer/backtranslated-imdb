Now I have good intentions when looking at this. I like some of Tony Scott's work, a friend tells me, I've heard from other people but it's a great movie. But it's just helpless. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Tony Scott is trying hard. It's too much. Allow me to explain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br The people who played well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez, and Christopher Walken, but their screen time just could not save the film. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes in their reality that somehow felt like someone else wrote than the main author. A precise tune was used 4 times, which really started to bug for a second time. I believe in a firm without using a single tune. <br /> <br /> Also, editing is really out of the way since the cutting rate is very high. Oh, and the recurring resonance of some lines of Kaira heard the second, third, fourth time, and the chest after hearing it. <br /> In general, my opinion is that if you want to see an action-flick that's high-paced and "quite a bit" funny, I do not care about the ones mentioned above, you might like it. <br /> <br /> One note: I am not a fan of Keira Knightley.)
