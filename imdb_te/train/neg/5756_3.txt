It's a great movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson co-starred as two newspaper writers. Directed by Mike Nichols. Oops. It's stupid! Meaning and predictability! <br /> <br /> This is a cookie cutter 'boy meets girl, marries a boy, boy affair, boy leaves the story. Now the real feeling is! I had two hours (only two, only six.) I'm not sure it's comedy, romance, tragedy or soap opera. This was done in 1986. I'm sure we all forget things all sixteen years ago. I began to begin to heal the fame of Strip et al and hope that the master began to blan on. This is not a bad image. It's such a good one.
