Idir Kumar returned with a comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood film SEE NO EVIL. <br /> <br /> Huma Kamal Ke (1994) <br /> <br /> This film is a fragile exercise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You are like a movie snehal daddy laughing like a head. <br /> <br /> The film starts in a clich√© manner and some scenes sin is never motion in such moments. Even humor gets boring. The twist is well maintained and the second half will go to rescue the blind guy and deaf heroines where we become an action movie We all have OTT chase scenes and fighting scenes <br /> <br /> Sounds Music is okay, music is okay, a song I love my goddess <br /> <br /> Vivek is terrible in comedy scenes, his timing is very bad and okay in serious scenes. For some reason he remained comedy and Fortin Khan is good but the rest of the rest of the Isha and Amrita heroines Boman Irani are angry here Snehal Dabbi Okay
