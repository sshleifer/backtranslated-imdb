First, I want to say that Chris Rock is a fan. I like his other films, but this movie is like my essence. Very large sack off anytime. Initially, Chris Rock plays a comedy role in the theatrical scene in the comedy building called Apollo. When he went from one bike to his house, while walking on his bike, he saw this woman he loved and suffered a truck. Shortly thereafter, he chooses the body of the old, white and selfish millionaire. When he was trying to repeat the scene from the original Jackie, he dressed as a music group Outcast. Secondly, he goes back to Apollo and tries to be black as a comedian trying to stay in his previous body and removes white people. Did you get my motion? The film is very original and tries hard to be the original and appears to be a hypocritical story. Take my advice, do not watch this movie.
