Scary Movie 3 is not as funny as its ancestors but its still has its funny moments. It all starts when the reporter Cindy Campbell roams out to find a hard news story in the middle of the television sweep. She immediately communicates a deadly attack of alarming invasions around the globe, including alien invaders, killer video tapes, freaky crop circles and many. Cindy strive to stop the evil from conspiracy of huge proportions, and looking forward to a group of very strange people around her, not to seize the world. The first two are the plot of the plot is very low. During this time they focused more on science, the ring, matrix reloaded and 8 mile and many others. The first is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. The second is as good but is not very funny yet. The third is mildly pleasant, but its not unique. Let's not just mind what I once saw but I probably would not want to see again. Jokes are either hit or miss and Charlie Sheen are either funny or have them. In the slums commonly Anthony Anderson has too much overdrive. He keeps the cast is blurry because he's not funny. Anna Faris gives a funny performance and she is even less. Simon Rex shows some power because he is not really so bad. Randina Hall also returns as Brenda and gives her a pretty funny presentation. The rest of the cast is pretty. Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson have probably come out of all the characters that are funny. The opening sequence spoofing the ring and the scene is much more enjoyable in the film. Denis Richards, Queen Latifah, Cameron Mannheim and many other celebrities are also comic. David Zucker directed and when it was not another plane, it was not my boss's daughter. Its meaning to really analyze a simple comedy with the main thing you want people to know is not its funny or not. As you said earlier, you probably do not really like it. In the end, I found it a bit frustrating when the PG-13 rating was weak but still enjoyable. Rating 6.3 / 10
