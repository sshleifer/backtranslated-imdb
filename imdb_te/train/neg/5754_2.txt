I saw the mask in the 80s and it is currently showing Fox Kids in the UK (the night is too late). I think it's great in the day and I have a couple of dolls but now I'll be watching with tears. I never realized before this cartoon show was really tedious and bland. It's terrible! Transformers, it is not in the same league as he or man or Thundercats, which has been forgotten very quickly after almost everyone has stopped doing it. I only see Fox Kids because Ulysses comes after 31 straight (that's if I do not put me to mask the first sleep). Fox Kids is one of the low 80's cartoons I hope to completely forget about once the stream is complete!
