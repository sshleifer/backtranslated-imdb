I was really working my way through a collection of Lugosi movies, and was just blown away a couple of days ago by the combination of Lugosi and Boris Karloff in "Black Cat" and I was really looking forward to seeing their contribution to "Raven." It did not work for me, and in the end I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the first trimester of the film or the story has been lost without any real suspense. Although some of the fraudulent doctors, Dr. Walins, had been involved in a kind of car crash, such as a mad scientist who fell in love with a young woman (Irene Ware), partially she was already engaged, and partly because her father (Samuel S. Hinds) refused. To deal with that situation, he helps Edmund Bateman (Boris Karlofe) - the horrible ugly man who wants to see him more vulnerable. However, since Lugose's performance, I found little to catch my interest. Suddenly, in the last fifteen or twenty minutes, the film turns around completely. Suddenly it was very exciting, but I thought the performance of the lounge could fall apart because the film was trying to get rid of madness - and there was a difference. He controls the "mad character" and plays in control but badly. "Insane" control is more from evil, and I do not think Lugosi pulled that well. At one point, he offers some maniacal laughter that falls across the counterfeit. In the meantime, Carlof's big disappointment. He never caught me. As an aside, it should be shaved on Lugosi - they are co-star - who is Lugosi's mainstream actor while in "Raven" in which Carlof gets top billing. <br /> <br /> However, I always thought Lugosi was the best actor ever because I did not add. <br /> <br /> In any case, Edgar Allen Poe's story "The Raven" has nothing to do with - Volin's Po's patron, attempts to rebuild harassment practices from Po's. Overall, depression. 4/10.
