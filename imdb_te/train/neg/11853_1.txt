It's likely that romantic comedies are considered lighter than dramatic films (see nominations for every year Academy Award). But still, good ones are really art form. See the classic "Harry Met Sally", "Seattle in Sleepplus", and "Roman Holiday" and "It's Happened One Night". <br /> <br /> The film tries to build something similar to a romantic comedy. But nobody believes in love between the main characters, and there is nothing funny to make that major shortage. Modine is the last of a popular figure - especially a romantic lead. I'm sure as an executive producer, he understands - but in good sense - to cast it. And Gershon ... I'm looking for some comic talent, but she does not have a script and a poorly developed character. And whose sense is English voice? <br /> <br /> Others have stated it, but I want to repeat: this story is less evident, poorly executed; The actors are terribly wicked; And the characters, well, we do not give a hoot about them. <br /> This art is not art. Go to "Moon Struck" again.
