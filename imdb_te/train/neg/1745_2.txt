The first half hour of the film introduces a constant speed and characters. Suddenly everything happened suddenly, Akki Kumar had three daughters, Akheki and John Abraham, both loud enough. The highlight of the Nehra Dupia film, Paresh Rawal is not good for her performance in Hera Pheri. The film is totally disappointing that this film will not do justice to its trailer. <br /> <br /> Hooray Pierre and Hankama: <br /> <br /> It's shortening: The inexpensive performance of the film, understand the good music by pretentious person who has dug us! Keep it up! The film's director, like Priyadarshan, had been disappointed by producers like Aksay and Jaan, though they were all shot in a room and their first film with actresses (actors).
