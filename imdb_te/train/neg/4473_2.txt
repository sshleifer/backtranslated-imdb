Dane tries hard and passes his reputation, going confidentially, sprinkling water on him and rolling on the floor. For the most part. Calm and stay together and let us laugh. I did not understand much of his comparison towards Comics and Rock Stars. Is it on stage or something? He wanted every comedian to be rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerer is really into that when I survive. He has some good jokes like burger king joke where people yell at thru drive. I also liked Reese's Piece Joke. If Dan is not mentally depressed he can be engaged and I have rated this as high as eight.
