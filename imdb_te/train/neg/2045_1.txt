This film should be the perfect worst movie I have ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend Zodiac (2007) went to rent and it was accidental. I thought it was a joke before the original movie. This is scary I wait for it to get scary and it will never be. There are no facts about the real zodiac killer in the film. Motion picture producers did not explicitly say that they did not investigate any murders ... they just liked the name ... so they decided to write a real scripts anyway. I can not understand that I'm not the first film. I like anything from every movie, I hate movies ... forever ... except that. If you gave the stars, I was sure. 10 to 1.
