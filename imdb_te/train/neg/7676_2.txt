I was amazed by the honestly in Alone in the Dark. It's very bad, I can not believe what I saw. There are no characters, just a few pastes revolved around and killed. The area of ​​character development has given a name and career to each character, which is about. There was no real plot and no single role was inspired. In fact, many action sequences started on their own. When I look at this movie, I say "Where's this going? What's up?" High quality drama quality with tight wooden delivery, though the actors read from cue cards without absorbing their lines. Distributing their difficulties through the terrible sound design is more clear. The ADR has been alerted in the open room. Actors have taken a careful watch to continuously hit their marks, and their movements are almost robotic. So, these listless automatons are often transformed scenes are whisked through a series of unsustainable and confusing scenes, without even profit. They're here, now they're there. It's happening, it's happening now. Random scenes with short poem or reason. I was very fun watching. Exactly nine bucks are not worth it.
