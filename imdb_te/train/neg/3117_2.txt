My husband is a huge Robin Williams fan. I also like him, but it is commonly found that he "concentrated on what he's doing best" to concentrate on comic characters. My thoughts are confirmed with this movie. I was totally frustrated throughout the whole movie. The story is imaginative. I realized that the true story was inspired. However, my belief that there may be some suspense or conspiracies even while pursuing the truth in the story. None of the characters are well developed. There is a side story about the main character and his partner. This relationship may be further explored. More important, however, was the deep exploration of the "boy"'s mother. She was deeply interested in mental profile. She clearly has a long history, which is not touched except on the most surface route. Although my husband was not such a huge Williams fan, we had a 20-minute time. Too bad I can not get my $ 20 or 2 hours back.
