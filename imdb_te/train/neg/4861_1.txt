In the days of the 90s (God rests his soul) you can see the great Sketch Comedy Show of all time of Saturday Night Live by turning on the great Comedy Central at any hour of the day. Although it is a spectacular performance, it is the second of the golden age of the original Knot-For-Pre-Premiere Players or SNL's second Golden Age - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade. . I reveal MadTV about the first year and a half ago, and I think I should be passed out of shock. How long will the show be worse? There are very terrible flaws. I'll start with writing. Writing, for the most part, is terrible. This is no more than kindergarten bathroom comedy. The cast, for the most part, is talentless. I enjoyed some experiences like Shri Swan and Stuart, and there are some talents in the show like Alex Borgstein. Phil LaMarr is just a comedian, a talented actor. Although there are some buttocks haha, they are not enough to redeem this endless line of horrible thick, as the idiots are shouting. Miss this one.
