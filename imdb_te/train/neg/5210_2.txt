Be honest first. I did not see this movie. I saw the first five minutes and when I realized that I had fallen asleep, I decided that I would go ahead and see if I was more interested in it ... It did not. This film is a collection of delicate attempts to make a story that is not just sensitive and already bad. This is a good horror movie. Because the film with poor special effects is good too. This is not a movie and only sleeps if you try to see. Finally, if I feel that this movie is open to you, if you think it should be more accurate than a littlesearch on the Internet, you should not necessarily have to pay the cinematographic pads.
