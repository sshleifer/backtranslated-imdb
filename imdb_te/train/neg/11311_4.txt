I remember Ben in 60s of my sci-fi days, and I have played Angela in The Yang Savages in 1961, most of the interviews and biopic of actors / actors / actors, especially Ben and actress Fay Spain, and Jody Fair. Ben was one when I was in Chicago's low-key science-fi con in 1970, Ben and his "career" and good chat in life. All of these have now been published in some of the favorite magazines that have been forgotten. I want to have copies of those interviews still, but it's time to protest, and those people do not necessarily remember me 'many years later. Ben is a really nice fellow, a living out (losses in such days are not even pay for their salary, except for big name stars, and even then pay couple is two hundred dollars! Ben is still good to learn and kick alive! How old is, how rarely!
