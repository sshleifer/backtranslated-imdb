A storyteller tells us that the screenwriter warns us that the screening skill is terrifying to kill you - and if such a free burial is guaranteed. Well, I do not think any of those who are afraid of seeing this picture are dead, but some are frustrated. <br /> <br /> The story of the famous Francis Merrine Crawford is quite simple, a wealthy non-wealthy woman named SKULL died in suspicious circumstances. Once founded in her home, her half-wit gardener, a severely painted portrait, peacock, and finally the skull wrapped around the room, she is very confusing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the high point of the film is the ability to do that. The plot is pretty transparent, to say the least, and the cast is actually okay, the script is horrifying and so uninterested in the movie you'll be screaming yourself and ready to run. True, the thing goes for sixty-eight minutes, but it's a long time. <br /> <br /> The honestly filmed movies are very fun. Scratching score has some howlers - but most of the film will not be able to work more than laugh at the occasional giggle, and the whole thing through time will roll over your head. Although it is not Peggy Weber's scream, it is perfect for insomnia. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
