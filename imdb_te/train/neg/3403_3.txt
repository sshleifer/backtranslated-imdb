The film should be fun. A young Lee Thompson, a young joke Phoenix ... and Terry Quinn. Space. <br /> <br /> Some children went into space and accidentally entered a space robot (known as Jinx) into space. Place scenes are repeated, repeat (the same danger occurs twice) and cheesy or threatening your feedback. Adults are bored and cheesed, and the children are scared to be shot in the film, which is a strange feeling. <br /> There is a junior romance, but rather the shuttle -. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I mean, "Back to the Future" is good. But, she is irritating and looks average. You do not want to date, you should not be a friend or role model. Jokhain Phoenix? He is really lucky to be again in the film again. Maybe he can act as a mikey in life grain commercials, but he does not know how to be a normal boy. He does not fit on the screen and I do not think he can find him at home. <br /> I do not recommend this image to anyone.
