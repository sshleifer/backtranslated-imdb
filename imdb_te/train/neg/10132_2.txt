STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The American military just escapes recognition rather than any other stealth fighter . A rebel pilot (Steve Toussaint) steals the plot to keep it and the American government as a ransom. So they are forced to stop him in their best man John Sands (Seagal, someone?), Instead of his freedom from a wounded detention center of all the criminal information he has learned in years. <br /> <br /> I thought from the cover and I thought when it confirmed all the post-production detraction that was worse and when it came to pour all negative reviews and low user rating. Shadow Man (by the same director) has decided to go to the FOF because it is not bad, Seagal is my favorite action star and perhaps, he probably could make a great movie again. <br /> <br /> Seagal's trademark and boring, sleep-stimulating, aerial stealth fighter jets, awful camera work, cheap production values, dubbing dangerous, unreliable combat scenes, ruthless stock footage. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, his next film Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I'm about to go with) signals the end of his contract with Sony, returns to these terrible European lens action films and his next film Prince of Pistols Theaters. Hell, he has already done and Stalin was able to make him (Rocky Ballboy.) <br /> This is not a Fury Flight. It's not even fun. It is an aircraft that fails to get out of the ground. *
