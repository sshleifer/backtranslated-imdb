In this film, old Amitabh Bachchan again falls in love with a very young man. He meets her in his restaurant. The young man Tabu goes with him. He does not know what to do and she asks. Her reaction to her invitation is fantastic. <br /> I'm annoying about the whole movie. It's not that funny. Jokes and the script is terrible! <br /> <br /> Amitabh is a short girlfriend named Sexy. It's unnatural relationship! A young girl with an old woman's heart! It's scary! I know that I can add a kid to anyone, but this man has adult conversations with this child. <br /> <br /> Tubu's father Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitabh a difficult time, but we all know Paresh, he can not do that. <br /> Even in the end of the conversation, when they all sat around the table, it was considered funny. <br /> <br /> I love movies that are really fun. I do not see this film again.
