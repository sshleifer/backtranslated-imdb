Not really spoiler in my opinion, but I wanted to cover you. As executive producer Morgan Freeman wishes to ignore a number of absurdities of his character in a 10-character or less, a deliberate indie-feel and a mere / -be theme in the teacher. He plays an alternative universe, a semi-washed version of Morgan Freeman, who will chop through an older Ecconwanus by child to Carson, CA from Brentwood to Carson, CA to investigate his next film role. Why Carson, so is a mystery. Call residents. He saved the tour and went to San Fernando Valley and discovered the same things. The Pazz is very beautiful to see, a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, plays a disgruntled grocery check on a huge but slow local market with ultimate basis for Morgag Freeman's research. "Hymn, it 'him" etc., unfortunately, I did not get him credible all the way to his home in Brentwood, cash or otherwise, as his character was called simply "Him" Debit does not handle the card, or has the knowledge of keeping a cell phone with him I like to see a blackberry that displays the surveillance and good survival instincts to preserve this big ego is perfectly true in this film. I like the Freeman and the audience as Steve Martin's shop girl who does not significantly interact with the main character It is not.
