<br /> <br /> The paraphrased snatch of dialogue from "Mind State". <br /> <br /> "The forest Paula Milne and her co-writer invented magic mushrooms that they would eat to make this edgy" soft "and eat their dirt for our curtains." Cusack is his best (like other actors), but definitely her talents The height of confidence has been completed, and this special "Mind State" is the best burial and forget It is and is not exactly "placed in a box and locked in the drawer".
