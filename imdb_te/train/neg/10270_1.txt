"American Nightmare" officially in my opinion "It's Pot!" <br /> <br /> Seven friends (perfectly suited to the K-Mart version of the cast of "Friends") come to a coffee shop to hear a American pirate radio show called Nightmare. It is hosted by a bearded person. <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joe, and ... Oh wait, I mean, Wayne, Jesse, and the other bad one liner turns to reveal their biggest fears of the DJ. <br /> <br /> Crazy nurse after Ross and Rachel are tortured and ... sorry again ... wait for their fears to come to life. . <br /> <br /> These fears have come from stunts and dentists, such as "Voodoo" by older women. <br /> <br /> This film is a word, dripping. <br /> <br /> If you look after your loved ones - go to your local blockbuster, cover all copies of "American Nightmare" Rent, freezer.
