Just looking at sets, performing and editing this project is not easy to make the right budget. Probably things like Bela Lugosi are meant to take your mind off. Young brides die at the altar and say "I will do". Their corpses were abducted by the need for a never-ending needle of the young virgins' voiceless fluids to remain younger, such as a famous horticultural Dr. Lorenz (Lugose) and his aging wife (Elizabeth Russell). An interested local reporter (Luna Walters) finds every missing bride worn with a rare orchid altar; Dr. Lorenz is very clever. Making a typical horror movie Storm Brews a bit spooky Lorenz estate visit; Especially in a dwarf and a slobbering hunchback premises. Other players: Angelo Rositota, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Euralec and Frank Moran.
