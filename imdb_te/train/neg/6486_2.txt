If you have one thing, you can get confidence in Disney, which is their extraordinary ability to take the story and repeat it again and again. The trade show for Lady and the Tramp II is also a terrible experience. Disney is going to destroy one of their most awesome classic. It also has that spaghetti meatball scene. It happened before! And I would say this sorry live video (the whole concept is banned). Everything has only a part of the original movie and most of Blatt's bad movies. Penguin and Wallace duo (I also forgot their names) Timon and Pumbaa's really poor carbon copy. Morgan is another ursula. She practically repeats all the old lines. The songs are really horrifying, really upset. I have never heard badly from songs in the past. And the conversation is much worse. It is curious and simple. On the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat appropriate. All of the usual characters are not annoying (or maybe there is a minus for the little mermaid fans). Again the negative, Melody is just sickeningly beautiful that may vomit you. I've done it almost. Enjoy yourself and your little mermaid fan. Do not waste this your money. True, it's not as horrific as the return of Zafar or Pocahontas II, but it's a little comfort.
