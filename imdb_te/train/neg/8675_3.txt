The best thing you can say about this movie is that if you are a fan of Sony Chiba, the film will give you a lot of things. Chibaba makes speeches; Chiba poses; Chiba Sears; Chiba Glares at the camera; Chiba kicks the country sushi sushi kicks from a whole bunch of punches and bad guys; Chiba sitting around the chairs and chairs and thoughtful / thoughtful; <br /> <br /> I am a Chiba Actor and a martial artist ... I love it, but the Chiba fan may have a slightly more sophisticated sony Chiba. This is clearly something of a vanity vehicle for him. And, in "SF" he's acting as a brutal, innocent anti-hero and because he shares the camera with the secret cast of friends and foes, I can not put "Street Fighter" in the same category. Here, he is in front and center almost all the time, and he tries to roll over into Batman, Captain America and Bruce Lee. Toshiro Mifune and Chou Yun Fat could pull this off for the length of the entire motion picture, and Sony just kind of wears his welcome. <br /> <br /> The film is totally grateful and badly introducing introductory intelligence (apparently the American version in the front of the film) and a goofy cheer "(" Viva !! Things start on the wrong foot. Sony (or his usual English stand-in) does not bother to voice out for the American version, so they have a completely different and sensitive voice and dialogue that we all know and love is very jarring from the face of "Street Fighter". <br /> <br /> Despite all the flaws and exaggeration, this may still be a small classic, but camera work and combat scenes are disappointingly cheesy. I believe that I am playing the role of Chiranjeevi, but the director and the cameraman swing their shields, cutting their armor and editing the action scenes with a weed wacker can not really see what you really can not see. It's not all bad: there are some good shots and compositions, and at least a momentous and nightmare moment for bad people to appear in the client's bedroom in a genuinely inventive way. <br /> <br /> "Chiba is the subject of an idiot for a" bodyguard ", and the screenwriter puts him repeatedly (and his" client ") on erroneous mistakes and supervisors, He is able to walk out of them and after 30 minutes, what's the best for this guy (if his character really demolishes Japanese drug trade, his client takes 10 minutes to the screenplay <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the film is far from the bottom of the barrel, and is still a son Chiba, and he is still looking to see I paid a buck to get this off the bargain DVD rack at a native mega mart, and I think it's worth watching once.
