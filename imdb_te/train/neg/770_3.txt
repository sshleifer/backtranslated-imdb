Stranger Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives in the studio of the Crook Collector's Max (Vincent d'Onofrio) and speaks to Jackie's brother Jamie (Valeria Golino), his ambitious partner and specialists. Jamie does not buy his story, Jack is dominant and adds him to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes $ 100,000.00 to everyone, which is the "Spanish judges" owner to protect him in negotiating a wealthy and dangerous collector. Max invites her stupid intro to the pace (Mark Boone Jr.), who comes with her retarded girlfriend to compose her backup band from her Mars. <br /> <br /> Jack takes a collector double-cross, and then he jackpot Jackie, Jamie and Peace. <br /> <br /> The low budget "Spanish judges" is a picture of a reasonable screenplay with a good cast with a good cast. Valeria Golino is surprisingly cute but with good actor Vincent D'Onofrio, they are not able to save the stupid story. More and more unfortunate, funny scenes do not work, in fact they are not crazy and funny. <br /> The title (Brazil): "Tudo pir deniniro" ("all for money")
