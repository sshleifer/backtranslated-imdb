I'm not a general viewer of Springer, but I see his performance in snap films and think the performance is a good crime and a good way to kill for a while. So naturally, I'm going to see this movie "Jerry Springer Uncensored." At first, Jerry appeared in roughly twenty minutes of running of the film. The rest of the hour and twenty minutes to build this fake-frustrating about the trailer-trash, jealousy, incest and deceit. Jaime Presley (who looks hot as hell) sleeps with her trip-trash slut (she's finally out with her exceptional, chain-smoking, drunken Michael Dudikoff and her action mentor). The mother finds out about the affair, that they want to take part in a "Jerry" program (this is correct, not any spring) to come into a fight. And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take it into the "Jerry" program. Letters collide. Blah, Blah, freakin 'blah! The worst is rarely this BORRRINGG !!!! I wonder if hell Springer has millions of fans, and none of them have checked his movie. Well, now it's completely clear !! If you love him or hate him, you hate this movie! How do I explain This is the whole mess of the movie (if you call it). It's just not correctly modified, the scenes are not just connected, and the plot is virtually disappearing shortly after that and it's just across the map! Imagine that the speculative Soap opera is transformed into comic racer. Rarely laughing. <br /> <br /> My only positive note hot girl-girl scene. It's like compromise as it gets. <br /> My score: 3 (score: 3) 10)
