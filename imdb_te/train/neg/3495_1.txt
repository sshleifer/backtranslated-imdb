I saw the episode. Yes I'm with a continuous experience, and I say, comedy this brand is one of the worst things you get. Imagine Peter Griffin of Family Guy Fame. Now he hopes Peter Griffin (acceptable, thick and minus bangles) as a woman, who now makes him happier and gets something wrong. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know an idiot. Sarah does not have the original character, there is no acting ability to remove her character. Maybe she can take the simplest and principle jokes that make her comedy less than her character. Perhaps it is a lack of belief. Unlike the mass appeal of Stephen Colbert's bizarre, bigger character, he can appeal to people who are unconscious and unconscious. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an annoying, unfunny character. She did not have the need for the whole world of the prestigious comedy of her irony. Sarah Silverman is not recognizable. And when you do not believe it and do not recognize it, it's no longer funny.
