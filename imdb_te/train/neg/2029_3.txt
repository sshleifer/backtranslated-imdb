I see that I do not have enough TV game to understand the attractiveness of the money, but I will appeal to some of the viewers with a low audience. The quiz show directly provides a large sum of competitors to answer some simple questions. However, its quiz items play a small part of the trial, which is harder for me. For example, before answering a question, ask questions to be asked by choosing from "A," "B" or "C" options. Do not serve this purpose any more than slower down the game? "A." It is very fast to begin with. . Another delay strategy - Competitors can query questions, but in each category one should answer three questions. <br /> <br> After responding to a question, the contestant then asks "lock in" answer. The competitor's next task is to name a dozen duties from a dozen dancers, which indicates the value of the question. The correct answer adds the card's dollar figure to the running amount of competitors; A wrong answer withdraws the same amount. The stage of this time is actually some entertainment value because it allows viewers to look closely to the lesser weaker and uniformly dazzling dancers. Meanwhile, the unfortunate option of the "killer card" of the contest reminds instantly the game ends. This naturally makes the competitor sweat and the neurotransition results in more delays in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. My suspicion is likely to slow down the overall process, moreover by a lot of empty jokes between the host William Shatner and the candidate, alongside the show's chief audience appeal with the possibility of sudden disaster. <br /> <br /> The caged dancers occasional routines. These delays burn up more time so that it could be possible for the audience to forget by the correct answer during the original question. <br /> <br /> Competitive 30 minutes of episodes for competitions gets 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of SMTM were only available for six questions (many other TV programs) that I see. No one in his right mind will see this show because it is fun to answer questions at home. It will leave three reasons to see the presentation. <br /> <br /> When a candidate wins a million dollars, it will lose everything in one shot, to see how it responds to being on the edge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> My choice is "B," but women are not a long enough camera to justify suffering through an hour of this program.
