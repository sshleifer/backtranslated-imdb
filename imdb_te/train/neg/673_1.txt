<br /> Count down the paths. <br /> <br /> Only the 'remake' title is the title that pulls each click in the slazer handbook. <br /> <br /> This is a very exciting story. <br /> All the efforts at suspense or thrillers are completely weak. <br /> PG-13 ratings that do not have any progress, violence or sexual insurance. The villain is not intimidating or mysterious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The lack of effective creepy atmosphere (unlike the original Prom Night). The script of the dialogue beyond the poor - this is a mindless mind. <br /> <br /> The range of cardboard performances (not exactly whether or not the lousy of the actors or the lousy mentioned above) <br /> <br /> It's no brainer horror fans, save your money. <Br> /> <br /> BOMB Out ****
