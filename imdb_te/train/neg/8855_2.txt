Yes, the first "hauling" is a classic. I was slowly starting to get a good Wow Wolf movie, but after having changed it to a beautiful wolf to wipe it out of the camera, having a good full range. Yes it is for an entertaining horror film to make sure you do not have anything to do with the film. Oh sure, they are kind of anchor woman that is the same and her brother or something they want and they want to find out what things are going down, but they go from a little cozy retreat to the first film Transylvania or somewhere where they should fight the evil wizard's werewolves or something. I wonder what the world Christopher Lee is doing in this movie, but I read the mess in there, where he was always in a waffle film, but before reading the script you played the script. Maybe hell that you might have gotten into "an American WWW in London" could be possible. It's all set in London later. Heck, werewolves are not very much into this film except for a very strange and long sex scenario. In fact, the most memorable death in this film, when a gas began to speak loudly and this guy's ear bleeding began.
