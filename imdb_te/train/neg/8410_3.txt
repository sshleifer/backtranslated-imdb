This picture is all flash and no soul. Most of the actors have incorporated the feelings, but these numbers are often not connected to the movie and are considered as stand-alone music videos. And you did not make any effort to sound the numbers that were there before, everyone who came from a studio, especially sucking all life from songs. All of the show was dull and untrue, especially Hudson, particularly angry, as the "strong" (her stubborn and selfish) black woman. Her character does not have any depth, or leads to other women. Although I feel that Hudson's character intends to believe that she's having difficulty with her weight, she's really upsetting what is best for her team in trouble because of the fact that the film is in the end. Hudson's Academy Award is a joke, no justification. She sang, her emotion (although it is often misinterpreted, the author / director is wrong but), but when she was acting, she had already made meat out of the role of underlined. Eddie Murphy's character is only one with an arc, and he has done a good job, but is still not worth the Oscars. Danny Glover, the only actor who really brought the roll, made him a small, relatively unbalanced character and made one of it. There's nothing to sink your teeth, no drama or heart, or smile here. The placement of musical numbers is very bad, at times the film seemed to make fun of music rather than one; Although Hudson has long argued with other girls, it may have happened for a family guy ski. This film does not know anything, I've been insulted for the last few minutes. It's time big, boring cod, and really the worst movie I saw in '06, and nothing was really a star last year.
