I liked it, I really did. Please do not think I'm an idiot but I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie. I thought I'd be worse, but it's still bad, but sometimes you do not have to look and watch a movie that does not need much attention on it. I did not expect any hidden meanings or morals, and there was nothing, but I only viewed it for fun because it did not matter, which entertained me throughout. These pictures include why Ben Stillers (something about Mary) and Vince Vaughn's (why you can not verify if you spell his last name) have jobs. It's OK to see the worst image as long as you can not expect it, and I can not drive a stand, jog, perhaps run, but blockbuster video is not a car because I can not drive, or options, and rent a bunch of these toilet humored movies and stay on a night watching them . Good day for readers. If you do not say that this comment has helped you, I do not want you, if you say, then God bless you and you will go to heaven.
