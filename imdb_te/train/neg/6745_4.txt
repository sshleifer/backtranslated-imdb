This is a low-budget "scream" style image. "Madi" is a new employee, she is in a colleague-unnamed office, where she meets and begins with her co-worker "Chris". During the Hot Tub Party, Chris and his friends convinced Madie, who were all killed for "kicks" by the "Murder Club". <br /> <br /> The film looks good and asks you why you will see why you look at your life for 80 minutes after this scale and budget level (nudity, gore, slightly larger than the stars), but after the credits roll.
