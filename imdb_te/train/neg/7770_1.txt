A film is directed to this full mess Bill Rebane, a true infamous classic Monster A-go go partly responsible man. By the time I came to Cold's end, I came to the conclusion that the film was far worse than the 60s surprises. Story ?? Is like this? There are three outstanding millionaires who invite a group of people in their remote mansion to play a series of MacBrack games. Whoever pays the pace and ultimately survives will win $ 1,000,000. This is a very simple plot, but Rebecca still makes some sense of inadequacies in understanding. Things happen. The characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes sense. And it ends. Weirdly. I understand what hell is all about correctly about? I left to make your own decisions. Product values ​​and performance are the question of an obscene image scale. Pamela Rogler (Shelley) is not really good. She is unbelievably terrible, she is compelling. Sadly the same thing is not all about this worst-fest, it's just a bargain basement rotor.
