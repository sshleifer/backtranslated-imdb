<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is a real talented, physical comedian, as well as a versatile intellectual actor (in my opinion). On the other hand, Mike Meyers gets his laughs for suffering. I like him very much in the days of "Waynes World" and "I add add anxiety" - but I never liked Austin Powers and "The Cat in the Hot", which ended me. <br /> <br /> This film is terrible - gag worse! Adult is only suitable for children, but some of them have long since not been fun for 50 years! The plot is worse, worse, worse! This is really a shame because the children like "Mom" are very fond of. <br /> They were probably better able to choose a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but can you see Myers in a script, not contrary to Ugly? Is one written? <br /> <br /> On the other hand I remember the sets and clues are fantastic! <br /> <br /> <br /> Poor Duck Sass - man is a genius! <br /> <br /> Do not destroy his reputation by imitating his work in such a lazy and deadly way!
