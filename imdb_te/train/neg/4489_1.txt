`The Matrix 'is an exciting summer block buster, which is visually but interestingly thought to evoke its twilight zone-ish technique. The general rule applies here- and this sequel does not match the front. <br /> <br /> "Reloaded" explodes on the screen in a very un-professional manner. The first seal of the early few seconds is as good as the Trinity is painted in a dream. Immediately, the picture is nose-diving. After the first 45 minutes of danger, they get momentum when they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place. But it loses all the momentum when it comes to a 14-minute car chassis range and is ultimately worse at the big groove-worthy twist. The scene of 'Sion Rave' is the worst of all. There is absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it is not a tragedy for romantic and depressed dance music. <br /> <br /> The Matrix's bullet-time aspect is good, but they are 'more' reloaded to make the lot more fun. The first one has interesting plot twists, but here it is quite interesting to be remotely interesting. The film primarily means that the range of stylish redirects prevent us from knowing just how empty it is. The larger the principle works on the wrong principle. <br /> <br /> 'The Matrix' franchise quickly breaks into Special Effects Denched Misfire. Other franchises like 'Star Wars'. The best character of course goes to the 'Agent Smith' of Hugo Weaving - it's interesting only. Keanu Reeves is the perfect Neo, but with all the special effects, there is a small room that has a very effective effect. Academy Award nomination Laurence Fishburn became a monotonous teacher with poor communication. Cary Ann Mose 'was able to make it better by any other actress as part of the action chick. <br /> <br /> Poor, thrown film, `The Matrix Reloaded 'is a disappointment. For those who do not like the first, it is not dull. It's just for fans of die hard. The special effect is still poor in the film's own sub-genre of Baronjas (Minority Report, The Matrix). My IMDB Rating: 4.5 / 10.
