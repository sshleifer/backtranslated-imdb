This movie is just bad. Weak story, weak direction and average acting below. Continuously - for the well-known Internet provider - the really boring thing for me is the blatant advertising. It's just a few scenes, just written to advertise. This image is a slap on the face to anyone who paid for the money. <br /> Do not look at this, your time is not worth it.
