This is not good for Tarzan mythology. There is a reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show his beautiful wife in the buffet! Bo Derek in '10 'is the least funny film and there is a reason for nudity and sex. This film is not more than soft porn. If you are into that, well, then fast forward and skip the rest! This film (like Bolero) is again a vehicle to show his awful performance for Bo Derek. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but she is more inspiring than a poster this movie! Richard Harris is a better actor than this; This is one of his few mistakes! Do not waste your time in this movie ... Buy the book instead.
