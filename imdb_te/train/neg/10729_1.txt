Let me start by saying that I feel more (more!) Open minded movie-audiences ... movies are my favorite, my local culture-film-rental-place I am a big regular. I feel that they often ask me for advice on movies whenever I get there, and I feel that I have left this place without exchanging widespread discussion or ideas about what's going on. Cult Movie-Area ... I would like to rent a strange thing, and the film is definitely recommended by one of the cult-movie-video-rankers. , And the cover is about a Jodorowsky (one of my favorite!) From something about a movie with the atmosphere, I rent. <br /> I think the vote I gave here is not really fair, it is awful, I do not know how to rate it otherwise. <br /> <br /> It was the first and only film that literally illuminated me for my stomach: I suffered a physical illness! Whom did my stomach become literally? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> Not terrible, as I mentioned one 1. My cup is tea (or vodka for that matter)
