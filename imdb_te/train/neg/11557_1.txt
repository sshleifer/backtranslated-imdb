* SOILER * It is forged! The whole thing is forged! There is no ghosts or zombies, Alan is a lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that and the castle wants something like that. So he invested in this innovative complex and incompetent scheme to run Alana to commit Ala-Sub-Doin. In most of the film he is picking up the red heads and attacking them. He was not even killing them. He falls asleep and the girl disappears, and he buries some of them. If he sees the ghost called Evelyn, tell him to wear her gloves! My god is no longer in vain. Do not rent it, take a rent and if you have not purchased it and can not find it, sell it. Quickly! Help me and stay away from midnight. I give this stinker CRAP-O-LANTERN.
