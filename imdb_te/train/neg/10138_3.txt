Over the years I have seen this group directly for the video segel films, and each has the same entertainment; unfortanetley, the entertainment level is low. Sure, the action sequences are fun, but it's pretty cool. Seagal was in the lead role when he really acted in films; Under Siege, Siege 2 and Executive Decision (at least in terms of action), but over the last ten years, this kind of Segal really does not get his last qualifications. <br /> With a more positive perspective, the film uses a good time, such as using some action sequences and intelligence. When the film was just pulling, the pretty cool action scene came out of the gutter. Honestly, I believe that the seagal movies are much better if fans are not recognizable in this film. The most important thing for supporting actors and actresses, and if his current films are known by these well-known actors and actresses, the film will probably get more popular results.
