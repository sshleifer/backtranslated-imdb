I thought my favorite martin was very boring and drawn! It's not funny. The audience sat through the whole movie and did not laugh! Even the kids laughed !! It is sad for a Disney movie !! I thought it would be better for me to play Martian rather than Christopher Lloyd! He's really stupid !! And he's not funny !! The suite I speak is really dumb! The original television series does not speak suit and does not turn around! In my opinion they wasted their time with this film !! I give two thumbes down !! Would really waste time and I do not recommend anyone to film !!! Thank you !!
