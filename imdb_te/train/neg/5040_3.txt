I've been reading comments about the best Chinese film ever. If Chinese movies you've seen do not have any conversation, but if you have long distances and silences and hack edits, you're on the spot. <br /> <br /> The hardest story line? Original. Try childhood and enthusiasm. Delicate moods and pursuing memories Original. <br /> This is awful. I can not wait to be over it. Especially the best lines in the movie are "How are you? Are you sure I'm cool?" Wow! Depth of any character. <br /> <br /> As a fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean movies, I was totally disappointed. Even Zhang's sentimental sappy "road home" is better than this.
