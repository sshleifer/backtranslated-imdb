This image is too bad, you feel that you are contaminated by it. Actually, you can now put the rewinder back cassette and it is relieved when it comes to the feeling of relief that RUSH can do this back to the video rental store before the rest of your video collection. I looked like kind of fun cinema and we would hurt the William where he suggested that it's rented his "phone in" her appearance. I understand he's not trying too hard. But less and behold, there's a huge number of scenes in this movie, Bill Hurt is actually on the phone! This irony is given to us, the happiness we received from this confused mess. Cinematography and editing are murky and befuddled, the story is worse, and the soundtrack is baffling. "Falling Down" has a slight resemblance, but the film features a boldly disturbing story line, great writing and acting, and a mind-blowing soundtrack. The "contaminated man" is just the kind of old European tourist trap that is broken up, and it's like watching a few unknown back roads in the unknown country keeps the windshield where you just do not speak the language in a constant rain after dusk. Did you get a picture? Do not get it.
