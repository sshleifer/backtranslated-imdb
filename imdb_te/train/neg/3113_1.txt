This movie is a mess. I'm also surprised to have a theater release. Robin Williams went straight to a different video. It was poorly written. It was poorly directed. It's a worst offense that has taken an interesting thing and has no thrills and a ridiculous and boring thriller which has no suspense and any inner or emotional logic. The first half an hour later the movie will dovetails into a series of funniest set pieces that the audience I see would be laughing at it . Save your money. The trailer is totally misleading - it's not breathtaking and there are no thrillers - in fact the true worst offense of the film is just boring.
