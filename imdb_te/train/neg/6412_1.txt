I came back from the movie and I was totally scared. This film is the perfect jokes for all mankind. I may be in the theater 4 other people. This film is recommended to me and I can not believe I liked this person. I can not believe that any sane man likes it. There is no plot. It's a joke. How can you do any film? Why does this film move to Hollywood? I see the "horror movie" industry and the smashing dirt. It's a mockery for all the movies, which is true of the new "Teen Horror Flicks" Grudge, Boogieman, Ring, and Saw series. It's all such crap. Do not support this type of hogwash!
