Like other actors, Robin Williams has performed well in The Night Listener. Nevertheless, the film fell very quickly and a lot of loose ends "must see." I think this is going to happen because Caller and Gabriel Noon (I had to spell like this, because IMDb prefers to spell the spelling for "no one"). <br /> <br /> The movie runs very short 01:30 and within the first 15 minutes, he started his search for the noon boy caller Pete Logende. Approximately 3 or 4 times. The conversations are much deeper ... you're in the hospital ... why did you go out of the lover ... In the book, the kid would almost shrink and vice versa <br /> <br /> In this film, the naughty was engaged in finding out, but Why he is contrary to the search for this boy and he reads it. Why the audience wonder? Why is it really troubling because there is no strong link between Noon and Callers? Who cares if the caller does not exist <br /> <br /> I know there is a difference between the book and the cinema, but the calls and the relationship is crucial to establishing on the screen because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is very surprising that Maple's other work, Tales of the City. When it's made in a small-series, it's pretty worked.
