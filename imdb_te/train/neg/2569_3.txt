Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is a fun entertainer in the 1970s, but Goldie's youth (after her Oscar win) can not get out of the mud, even though the script is very lame and insulting. As a skirt-chasing celeb in his 40s, Sellers often makes himself to the ninth level. <br /> <br /> The best performance = 10? Nicky Henson plays a young study type. <br /> I do not see any other reason for a trip this way in 1970 because I think Han and Sellers have paid me well (CatchCH-22, MASH, Husband, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PIECES and many others). You can not win them!
