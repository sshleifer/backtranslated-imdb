"Jealousy" is bad for many reasons. Yes, there are indescribable characters. This is not a problem. It is they are different and we do not care for them all. There are characters that do not appear in the role of "The Rose of the Roses," but with the proper introductions we have at least been interested in their interest, but the introduction in "jealousy" is narrow, the characters are not reliable. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller simply repel And he was a long time fan of me. Stiller has promoted the release of this video directly and now I can see why. The film proposes that he is "good friends" with Jack Black, but from the first five minutes we give footage showing that we are hating Stirler. I was stunned by Stiller that he was his "best friend" and I thought he was black, because it was a side-by-side relationship (one la "cable guy" "poo." The plot of the film is ridiculous, but it's big No, because it is supposed to be an exaggeration morality story, unfortunately the message is lost in chaos. (But I find him very funny) No, it's not a horrible movie but I still do not believe Barry Levinson ("Rainman," "Sleepers") - one of the worst films of all time Not all but perfectly good overall.I am the poo-rise exist - so if we can make this film forever disappear ...
