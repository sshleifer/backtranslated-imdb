Actress Nichole Hiltz: If you are not involved with one of the stars or the producer is the same reason to watch this movie. She is performing in an elaborate story of slow motion and vengeance. Directed by Simon Gornic, the film stars Joey Hesser as a cheating spouse, and decides to take revenge on her sister's spouse. Oh, but not by traditional means. She plans for the whole guerrilla warfare and has appointed her niche bad boy Nichol Hills as her favorite weapon. She wants her former (close but dull Stefan Jenkins, committed to music) Nicole (as of Tuesday) wants to embarrass him and destroy her life. David DeLuise is good for some of his brief moments, and the former "Crime Story" star Anthony Dennis is almost nothing but scowl to do. Hiltz on the other hand is sexy and delightful at different times, then evil and deception. She also performs harm and "handles a bit mentally" well. She's also very hot (although there is no mischievous bits show) so you can understand how to get to the person she's targeting. But the show is kind of wasted in this movie, which is just interesting enough to be experimental or recommended.
