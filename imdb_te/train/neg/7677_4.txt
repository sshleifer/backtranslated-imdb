Ana Lucia and Libby deaths are unnecessary and really frustrating because I am in this episode. Then I found that they put the libby around them to die in the next episode! Gah! <br /> <br /> I liked this show in the first season, but in the second season it definitely deteriorated, and I recognized Jack and Locke's minor religious fury. Rodriguez & Vatrus characters deaths last grass! <br /> <br /> I gave this episode 4/10 to this episode, formerly Elias Legend J.J. Abrams. I hope to improve his series in the future.
