I saw this in the market place at the Cannes Film Festival. "<br /> <br />" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor - I guess I did well to the producers looking for her. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence in the upcoming spaceship is happy - all the teams are shaking around it! <br /> <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but what can I wish for these well-made people - at least it's not outrageous.
