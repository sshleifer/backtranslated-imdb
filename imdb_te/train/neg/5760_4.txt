Well ... I'm waiting to see this video to watch, and I want to be, I actually catch the scary image 2 on the cable on the other day, and it's more like me for the same, what do you want plane or any other Leslie Nielsen vehicles Maybe in heaven, but usually your use usually comes in, then you have a box which will be dissapointed This is an Eye Candy which is probably the young hormone young boy excited youngsters why the office hit it in the first week it got. I shot this fridge ten times more scary, and a fraction is 5 times more. That's a good part of Odd 3, but then again I'm always better then halloween 2 better as well .. its just me. The Aliens Goodbye became a funniest part of the film. But I'm not worth 11 dollars to spend this catch a matinee with my fiance. Keep cash and cash in the cab until you release it on the video tape, then rent it and rent it.
