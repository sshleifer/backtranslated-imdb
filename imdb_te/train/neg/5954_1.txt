This show comes with interesting places like Travel Channel. It is billed as reality, but in fact it is a pure prime time soap opera. It attempts to use exotic locales as a face to bring people into a fraudulent competition, and later competitors try to hook viewers in the seap opera style. <br /> This is an early CBS game performance pioneer-beat the clock - by finding the conditions to try & overcome it for its competitors. Then it wins the winner's money. If they are fuzzy with some interaction between the characters, the better is better. While the game format is slow in motion, The Beat the Clock - the real achievement of the series is to avoid reality. <br /> <br /> There are many successful past programs in this show. Reality television, seldom, but if your competitors, loco or your hook in competition, this is your tea cup. If you do not, the entire array is stabbed with gravy, as I said. This is another program hidden behind the reality reality label that began in 2000. <br /> It's lame and well-produced, so it may still be a bit longer. After all, Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies & The Brady Bunch's re-runs. It does not employ professional actors. The level of intelligence is the same.
