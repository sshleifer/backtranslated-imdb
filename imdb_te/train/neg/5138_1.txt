I saw SCARECROWS due to the buzz surrounding me. <br /> <br /> It is clear that one who made the film does not know one thing about the horror. The whole story is unsuccessful marriage of two genres: action film (guns and criminals) and horror (sexually scary). When criminals kill one by frightening, two genres can annul each other, because first, they crawl about criminals and criminals, and secondly, they boot the stupid offenders! They do not work here because the zombie does not work. Where's that horror <br /> <br /> But if the stories of these stories can be run well, the story is very bad, even though there is no original gel. We are simply a group of super-dense criminals and a group of scarecasts that "filmmakers" are "alive" for whatever reasons they have thought. Certain things are worse than cinematography is terrible (like TV) and all of the worst offense, CBs and the kind of radio program that we do not quit talking about disconnected films as we look at some. This part is really bad. The director should be shot on the spot with such a stupid idea! <br /> As I have already said, criminals in SCARECROWS are amazingly stupid. For example, when someone suddenly wounded, suddenly wasted money and covered the straw (straw, straw), others were "what drug was he?" Asks. They can not kill him, after he shoots tons of bullets (he is oppressed). Get a freaking clue, morons. I have never seen such stupid people in the film. And then the girl is there. I was shocked because she was a pain in Bhut and she wanted to kill her quickly. When her father realized that a scarecrow was hanging "cross", the criminals actually blamed the criminals (bad acting), although the criminals could not do it. How wrist she is! But this weakest picture is the biggest weakness. They are not scary. Many have explained about them. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wesley's portrayal of a scarecrow face for 30 seconds nonstop is nothing but boring. And the head that speaks in the fridge is the scene. <br /> <br /> All I have to be one of the worst movies I've seen recently (and today I've seen so many movies!) The same painful Sai Killer or Scarrows, I'll again be a Killer Killer. Yep, SCARECROWS is that bad.
