I loaded up with good actors, and I measured a lot more from the "cheat" than the distributed. The plot is very talented and contains people. Many people are confused by past conflicts. Reliable is the window and the endless and indecisive ridiculous. I'm very bored because I strongly advise those who love their cinema plot based on the least possible to avoid "deachers". Maybe I'm not enough hip to get it, but my suspicion is that most others are in the story line and especially confused by the end. The whole picture makes no sense because the line opacity between reality and lies is not just working. - MERK
