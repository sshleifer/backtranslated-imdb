It appears as actors Royal Shakespeare in Haloux. The jaw drops when the film is scared. Turning off the DVD player is not enough course of action. I find people who are responsible for this disaster and scroll around the face. I never returned. Never. How is it possible to create such a simple, boring and inexhaustible film image? I can not think of an action that can relieve the tide. It is difficult to write ten lines needed for such a humiliating film. What can you say more than reiterating how truly acting is. Please avoid it.
