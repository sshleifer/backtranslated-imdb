OK This image is really "unique" we shall say. Carrie Fisher is the most talented figure in the film, although she is said to have a coke problem in the film. But she said she could not remember much. Well thats she does not need but what's the other ??? I can not imagine they all got a coke problem. It's not all bad that I guess I have all the plots OK and some cute funny moments. But the thing that the man moves on his head is very violent for my taste. Oh well I guess the reason for the disappointment is that the fisher is so spectacular and this film is nothing for her.
