This is the biggest failure of 2008. I know that I have a director who has created such a big catastrophe. The songs were added without conditions, the story expanded to fill the gap for 3 hours, and action staged by actors for each shot with superpowers running between bullets, nothing happened to them. And a man fights with 100 people. Anil Kapoor is the best actress of the man, Hinglish in his best role as a villain ... Akki has done a good job ... But the painter forgets it.
