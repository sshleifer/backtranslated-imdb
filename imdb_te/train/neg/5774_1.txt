Spike Lee's thin effort in the film. He is more than capable of this film. Barrister is a ruthless racer, Barrett destroys whites, not only blacks. The plot of the movie is a group of blacks traveling on the bus in the millions of men of Louis Farakhan. The bus has every type of person you can imagine: gay, muslim, gangbanger and uncle Tom (whereas he was thrown off the bus). There is only one person on the bus. He claimed that he was a racist in the bus to run. He was a Jew and the fact that he explained that he ended a racist and bus-relaxing situation. I hate to say but movies like these need to realize rienforcation of their own hipporis and stickeryotypes. It should not be seen as a tragic mix of unsuccessful. I feel a racist for this writing but I understand it well. Good luck spike the next time.
