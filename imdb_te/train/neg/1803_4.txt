This is one of the academic short films made to learn people who are not aware of the realities of life. This time Target Audience is the reality of the life of the early girls, life. This animated film was created by Walt Disney Pictures, which sponsors some of the cottages. <br /> <br /> Hormones explain and develop how they grow. With the help of the animation and a female storyteller it shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, work and why these all lead to menstruation. It's almost surprising, here's a comic note, how to reduce sex. Although "furlagedged" once passes, the term is never mentioned. I'm not really sure why I see this, but it's one of the rare short films that can show innocent time, so you might want to try it out.
