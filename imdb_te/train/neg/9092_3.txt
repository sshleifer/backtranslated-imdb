Fridge Freleng's 'Speedy Gonzalez' is the second cartoon characterized by Robert McKinzon's 'Cat-Tails Too' by the title role. In that cartoon, Speedy is an ugly little creature with a big golden crop, but his second look has already adopted this popular design. Although it looks pretty, the speed of the Speedy has not improved. A big hat, a tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent does not make a classic character and will pretty much go with him ever more speedy. Still, the little mouse was very popular and in the last days of the studio, he starred in several short films, including some really sexually explicit films. These early speeches are often more unfortunate than those of frequent misdeeds (they are attached to the Darfie Duck), they are still abandoned in the most likelihood, usually depending on the nuances, usually based on the chase formula. In this self-titled episode, some mice are being employed to steal cheese to protect Sylvester's cat from Speedy's local factory. Although he brought an extra starter back to the cartoon, Sylvester's role is easily covered by any other regular cartoon cat. His personality was killing him forcing him to be predictable. The pursuer's undemanding role. This was always a problem for Tweety cartoons, but Speedy was also disappointed with his hateful intentions and his blatant impotence. Seeming for a number of years to come to the poor old Sylvester. Although this was a pretty basic formula and was less laughable, 'Speedy Gonzalez' won an Oscar and was born completely fickle star.
