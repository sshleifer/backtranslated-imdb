I can not tell you how angry I am after seeing this movie. The short-term bit of characters is not interesting, and the plot is non-existent. So the lives of these characters have seen the past two and a half hours leading up to some important conclusion, how can we see the lives of these characters and what can we get? Frogs storm. Now I understand the biblical (exodas) and internal backdrop, but it is not explicitly attached to any conclusion, and the second is lost to anyone who does not read the Bible or the Charles Fort (a big part). As a reader of some people, this film was considered a self-determination of a Seinfeld episode. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. It's good to read ... <br /> It's good to be honest
