It does not touch some interesting points .. but! - It failed to testify to all 'special' studies shown. Who is 'friends' and 'small group scientists' who collected this data? - What's going on with Al Gore's life story? <br /> He likes to play with cows on grass or his son is hit by a car .. But what about the ozone layer? <br /> <br /> The discovery channel I have seen is very good in a very short time .. I do not really understand why it is a high score on IMDb. Unless you live under a rock, this 'documentary' can not have any news ... it's old ... and all al gore is trying to do some popular points. PS I'm not an American, so do not say I'm a Bush fan: p
