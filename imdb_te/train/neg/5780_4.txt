I really wanted to have watched all the way through thinking this film and thinking it got better. I can not get it wrong, it's not always the worst movie, but it's not a probability. The campus is good, the cast is great (I'm especially pumped to see David Nuton) and God loves me, you can tell everyone their best efforts. It just comes short and over again. The "cruel massacre" Christopher Guest should act as a steady reminder of the filmmakers who can do Christopher's guest, but in fact he makes it easy to see, even though you have forgotten to do the same. Norton and Brian O'Halloran are amazing in this and they should watch more often ... The reason they will get 4 stars from this. If you want to see horror's "spine pump" I suspect I'd like a "spinal tap" ... I'm thinking aloud there.
