The film's intention is to demonstrate that the Russians' aggressive (mafia-like) role or the least Russians are able to travel outside of their large country; In England it is easy to loot the bank; The British police are very inefficient and can not find a person who has stolen the bank even when gas comes out of these things. In addition, Nicole Kidman and Russian colleagues speak a language that does not recognize the language spoken by Aliens in the Ural Mountains, but most are Russian. So Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, please go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep learning Russian grammar and its pronunciation.
