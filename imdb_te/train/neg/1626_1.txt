I also warned that the film has recently started on a local TV in South Africa and that B grade is enjoying bad movies (which I'm doing). This plot is a couple who visits a home in the country. Some of the strangers are found and ... The problem is very early in the film was shot at the beginning of the seventies, which involves intense wide shots of people walking in real time and slowly walking, from A to B. Serious and predictable blood and gore had never been paid. I'm really curious - how old was the first one?
