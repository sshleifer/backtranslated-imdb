I tried to watch this movie three different times. I rented the night. I'm 20 minutes away if I take a rest at night. That's how it looks more than 15 in stupid ... sometimes it's not funny stupid, but it's funny with the capital S. Temporary world where we live). In the end the third day I watched over an hour of dumb thing and I did not enjoy the same moment! Even one. How did this script get brighter? Oh boy! <br /> <br /> 1/10 - For a cheerleaders ... they all need at least something for their hardwork.
