As the character acting is the first person to appear on the screen, the character acting is a little tight. Unfortunately in most good actresses, Jean Simmons (like Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night) has played several bit roles in TV, quickly die, and then her acting fails. <br /> <br /> The main character played by Mr. Cliff Robertson is Mr. Ballard. The cliff will have to bring the film with his body language for a long time. He has a poor job, but the blank screen time is a little overmuch to ask an actor to plug the seams on time when the characters do not speak their time and do not act. Robertson's memorable role may be Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider-Man films (starring Tobey Maguire). <br /> The plot is imaginable. A husband murders his rich wife and his rich wife. Then the wife returns and the husband drives him insane, until he jumped out of the tall windows (he was approaching him with his nephew's ghost), the day he estimated he died. The second driver Mr. Ballard looks like an English mark Hamil. In fact unencumbered! This is the only thing that is completely refuted for dialogue. Several minutes have passed in silence, no one will talk, and some act. It's a shame MST3K guys have never had to hold this image. <br /> <br /> I hope that the red eyes of Zimmar should be visible from the shadows. It works for "nothing" living in the film.
