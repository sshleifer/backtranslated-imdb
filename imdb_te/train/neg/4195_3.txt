Given people involved, it is difficult to see why this picture should be so confused and dull. The author, David Ward, wrote a fantastic keeper movie "The Sting" two years later, and Jane Fonda won the Academy Award for Klute, and Donald Sutherland made excellent work in films like "Klute," "Revolution Without With Me," and "Kelly Heroes "In the tightening, the film is a big story, with a small gang that is planned as a big slum. At the same time the film is a hip surreal, a series of comedy sketches that tells NBC's television show "Saturday Night" to do well two years later. The bad outcome is that the comedy bits can be awkward and forceful and can destroy any kind of suspense with the disconnected comedy bits heast. <br /> <br /> It is literally a feature film when it comes to car racing cars in one of the demolition scenes. <br /> I was looking for Gene Fonda as a real interest. She is considered a light hearted version of her dramatic Bree Daniels courtesan role in "Iris Coin" "Clue", although she did not believe her for a moment. It always treats Jane Fonda as a prostitute. Her performance in "Clute" is terrible. Acting teachers to run two movies together to show how the same actress in the same role is great or enthusiastic. This suggests that actors are as good as their authors and directors.
