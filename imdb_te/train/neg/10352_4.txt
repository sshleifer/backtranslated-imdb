I recently discovered that Madeleine L'Engle's novel Disney became a TV movie and directed the DVD. <br /> <br /> Although the character of the Murry family is well cast, Charles Wallace, who is convinced of a child prodigy without the irritability of Magg and Charles Wallace at the center of an attractive (very beautiful) center, <br /> <br /> The first half hour promises to make a good job of establishing and establishing relationships between the main characters. Unfortunately, as human characters do not appear, adaptation starts to unfold and the whole thing comes apart after leaving the children off the ground. Alfrey Woodward's very youthful looking and overwhelming Mrs Watsite (instead of Miriam Margolis or Jon Ploviet) and Kate Nellen's face is very masky and obscure, in recent years she has to visit the Faye Duieve Plastic Surgery. For some reason they look like Gildadah from the West of the Wizard of Oz to make her Mrs look like the West's benign wicked witch. <br /> <br /> In the end it is very seriously terrible special effects and art direction. I understand this is a TV movie, but CGI is capable of 15 years old. Mrs Whatsits' incarnation is a catastrophic Chewbacca as the incarnation of the aunt Beast who is a velvety, elegant creature instead of the ungainly Big Foot instead of as shown. I'm devastating almost every artistic option because there is not a big enough budget to do justice to this genre, but the design work does not have imagination and good judgment. It really had a fantastic sense that Spielberg brought into his early films. Seekwheels for the big screen gave the scope of the desirability of it, considering the current popularity of the children's literary fantasy series as a wrinkle.
