An executive was not very successful in his career, but was not quite in his familiar life, met a boy with Down Syndrome, escaped from his residence. The two characters feel quite alone, and clearly show the little things beauty executive in a life of less intelligent ... With this argument, something like Amelie's atmosphere and sentimental music, I did not expect but a moral boring image. However, some interesting scenes (boy sometimes very violent), and the description of the two actors, Daniel Aweil and Pascal Dukevin, are very good, I decided to watch the movie. The French film, in general, is more and more life-style against the more stereotypical American cinema. But, for that reason, it is very frustrating to look after the absurd death of the boy, impossible to bear death, beautiful tone, the fun of the executive family, cheap moral, daughters, waking up from heaven as Michael Landon ... really humble, my humble opinion.
