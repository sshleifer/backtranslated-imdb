Oh dear. <br /> <br /> Some of the best talents in British TV have made this series, so I can imagine that they are working on exciting time pressures and first have to make several sequences. <br /> <br /> There are scenes in this highland mystery scary (mostly on "monster" attacks and from his perspective), but I'm worried that I accidentally found the story very funny! Oh look, there's a hand there ... oh, and there's another hand out ... oops this is a bit tough ... <br /> <fans of British cult TV fans to release this serial on VHS or DVD for many years Campaign, but the BBC has never said it. Now I understand why!
