If you ever watch this movie, you know it! If you do not want to, and want to see a classic BAD image, I would like to see this movie because it's in the right place with the worst. So, if you're really bored, rent it out. If you want to know what you know, here's my little essence: Adam Sandler is employed to work on a huge cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five other people. Adam is a passenger does not like how to get all the babies, and he tries to seize with cheezy jokes. But wait! It only gets worse! To get the film to see how bad the movie really is.
