I usually wrote reviews that really hated movies or really liked it. And, as you can probably tell from the number of stars out there, I do not like it. Now, I've read about the plot or I think this movie can be seen, so I'll skip the summary. <br /> <br /> Cons: This concept is interesting: the premise is interesting. It is interesting to use Chaos Theory as a theme. However, it is not well maintained. If I make a mistake, correct me, but I think the Chaos theory is misinterpreted. The incident in this film is more contrived than anything else. I expect the overall effect of the butterfly effect "to bring back the statue of God (s) tsunami." The presentation really comes off sloppy though. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ' Ten Characters? The plot is very talented; Govind has broken many times in mysterious hazards (his friend burst into the package that he sends to India, a silly aging burst into a statue, half the cast is accidentally met in the same hospital and the statue is mixed with a famous singer. <br /> <br /> CGI: Oh God , The CGI, which is worse than the special effects in Jas 3, and I know what parts are animated.I know my ten year old cousin is not even seen by the underwater cars. <br /> Stunts: Yes, the action scenes in Tamil films are not realistic, but these stunts are terrific <br /> <br /> Up: I have to admit, they have done better than expected.  దే చర్మపు టోన్లతో ప్రజలను ప్లే చేస్తాడని నేను అనుకున్నాను, అందుకే ఇద్దరు నకిలీ తెల్లని guys మరియు నకిలీ జపనీస్ ఐకిడో గై నన్ను కాపలాదారుడిగా పట్టుకున్నారు. <br /> <br /> పాటలు: మ్యూజిక్ చాలా సందర్భాల్లో దృష్టిని మరల్చింది మరియు వెలుపల చోటు చేసుకుంది. <br /> <br /> Asin: Her role in the film is very painful. She was loud, quick, and irrational about the statue. <br /> Let me tell you straight: A lab monkey is smart enough to run a password-locked door, but it's not enough to say that the bar of chocolate and it's a bottle with a deadly virus. And then, the former CIA agent after heading for Indians. Soon after, he married the first pole dancer. A popular Punjabi singer who has cancer checks at a small town hospital in the Third World, makes it easier for him to get the best medical treatment available. Moreover, he shoots with a bullet in the throat. I think he would be killed, but instead, the magic bullet cleared his tumor. You read right, a BULLET knocked out the tumor. <br /> Pros ... Nayudu Character: Perhaps the comedy of this movie is his comedy.
