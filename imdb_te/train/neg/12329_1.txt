Back in my days "default lessons" I played in 4-Flex working. It is a hit sleeper sold for Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks. I have never been around to see, but last weekend I was in the cab, so I decided to give it a shot. For the next 90 minutes I saw one of the worst movies I've seen and the terrible discomfort that I see. <br /> <br /> The basic story is his sexy maid (after Sylvia) Kristel. She is also attractive to the boy but it feels more bad. So the boy saw his eyes and invited him to see her. <br /> <br /> Eric Brown, as a youngster, should be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. Every time his "fearful" reactions take Sylvia's clothes or it's terrible when she touches her. <br /> And do not start on the subplot of the maid and the driver to hurt money from the child. <br /> <br /> When he went here, Eric Brown looked bigger, but actually looked like his baby. He did not know how to kiss a woman (I thought of my criticisms of Brown) and it was on the boundary of child pornography to be sexy. Even though Miss Crystal was very beautiful and without clothing, I was not stopped by sex scene. <br /> Speller Warning ** I mentioned the last scene. For me it is just unhealthy but I can remember the audience I am cheering into the film freeze and melts into credits. Our hero returns to school and begins with a flirt with one of the female teachers. He asks her for dinner and gives him a look as Tom Cruise asks her. She positively accepts and he walks away and laughs at the camera in victory. Will you be! <br /> <br /> I do not understand the appeal of the film in 1982. <br /> In reality it is more nudity. Teen romance comedians with nakedness until the bombing at the box office. And those same young people who are aging 22 years ago feel that the corporate ladders now work their way up and probably help run this country. It's a horror idea.
