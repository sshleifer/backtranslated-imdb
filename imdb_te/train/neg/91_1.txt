I rented the movie 3 years ago, which still stands in my mind as the worst image ever. I do not think I have done it. This is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember doing something a flashback in the 1970s and was a man like a polo shirt, a vintage sunglasses and a new SUV, a Toyota Rao-4 or something (I do not remember) flashback. They can not say I'm probably 70 years old. He may also have a cell phone, I can not remember, it's just terrible. I returned to the video store and asked why they also took the film and could recover the bell of my life. Today it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen very bad ones.
