<br /> <br /> I do not know how anyone like Van Damnne likes this movie. <br /> <br /> Film starts with some promises. I will say that the action scenes at the beginning of the film are amazing. Activities with a family ward trying to save the twins are a great heroine and a good lead to the main story. However, the picture is down all over the hill. <br /> <br /> If the director could stay in the original premises, it would be nice. Those brothers were born in different parts of the world and therefore learned different skills. One brother needs expertise in martial arts, but the other brother is skilled in guns. Suddenly the brother never caught a shotgun, the greatest markup, and the brother who was not taught by any martial arts, split up and made a huge punch. Plots, action, etc. are just plain ridiculous. My favorite scenes? When Van Damne faced an armed soldier with an AK-47. The soldier is 100 yards away. Instead of shooting and filming at Van Damnie, he was holding a battle ax and running him while he was making a war cry. Van Damné shoots a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him, still 75 to 80 yards away. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the most disappointing conclusions. Bole Young is a talented martial artist. However, instead of choreographing a good fight. Barrels throwing bow in Van Damn as Donkey Kong. The most promising film is definitely intensifying. If your van is a fan of Damné, save your time and watch one of the Hard Target or his earlier movies.
