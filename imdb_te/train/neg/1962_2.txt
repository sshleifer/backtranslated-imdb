<br /> <br /> When the "Tooth Fairy" is finished, the idea is only about the film. <br /> <br /> It's like a worst child's film, "Wizard of Oz" witch melting and cheerful kiddies with some bad gore effects combined with ending and swearing <br /> <br /> Some of the cast members seem to be completely unnecessary Except murder in fashion. Sister Brothers Cherise Solar Reader and Mrs. MacDonald does not have a full point in the film - they are included in the main story for some interesting storytelling but are not apparently bothered. People looking at the movie know that some bloody death scenes are roles, but at least TRY and a little plot for them. <br /> <br /> They are weak with erratic behavior from all the characters they wish to eat the witch. <br /> <br /> With weak plots and weak acting together (children are especially wooden) and the movie ends with a complete failure. If MST3K only has this on a go ...
