I'm afraid that I agree with the majority. I found Spike Lee's latest little bit boring! <br /> I do not think he did it well, even though he did try to do something else, ie, not about the growth and fall of a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Very tight - Winnie Lyugjimmo) and Diona (Mira Sarvino), Ritchie's (Adrian Brody) lifestyle and later local mafia varieties. The story is good, but in the end all you have - 2 or 3 stories. Could Mr. Lee put in such a provocative killer more of that film? <br /> <br /> There are some good points. <br /> <br /> Overall, 'Saan of Sam' killer David Berkowitz is very cool (color saturation etc) and acting is pretty good. Their own or else without murders. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know what to do,
