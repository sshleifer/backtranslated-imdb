One of the other commentators has gone out almost the same. If not with my wife, I wanted to stay, I left. It's very shameful, I think it's a good movie. But it's one of the worst recipient screenwriters I've ever seen. It starts somewhere and it goes somewhere (I'm going nowhere faster, but it does not really go slow ... it's hard on slow). There are hints that happen from time to time something interesting, or potentially under some depth characters, but all we get - are instructions. The whole picture does not have the same payment or revelation. I do not need an intelligent plot of fun ... I love studying a good meandering role like the next indie buff. But these characters do not. You do not care what is happening to one of them in the entire length of the film. In fact, you will almost die, because it's more interesting than watching their undead behavior, you start to start almost to die, which is very strange and unpredictable, but it is not. Quirky, Nair-Esquire characters who play in the strict broth fashion, you should immediately recognize it: a group of talented but abusive actors, boosting brooding and their eyebrows when reading bizarre conversation without reference to the corresponding conversation. For these two plodding, all the painfully slow hours. Awful.
