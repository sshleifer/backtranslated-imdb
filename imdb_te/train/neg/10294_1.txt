<br /> <br /> The characters with no personality can develop. <br /> Then nothing is starting and not in the middle. There are not beautiful cute shots because they can not even allow, because this is not the image itself. There is nothing in this movie because "because" there is no plot or characters or themes or thoughts or symbols or talk or dialogue or point. Nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: it is a good soundtrack. But the sound editing is such and the movie is not right, it's not worth your time, if you're really interested, I'll go and buy a soundtrack or something. <br /> <br /> From this movie you will get everything without fatigue, headache and intolerance. <br /> - Polaris DB
