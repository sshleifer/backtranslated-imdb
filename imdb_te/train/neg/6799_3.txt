We can not expect much from this film. In many ways, the film was portrayed by Doris Day in 1956 as the title of the title, Julie. Doris, the flight attendant, stewardess, in that film, Durenz's husband who played the role of Louis Jordan in the film then shot the captain and managed to handle the land without much control over Kim Oz which brought her 747 control. I'll learn about about 747 flights, and I'll use it as a flight attendant. As I said, do not expect much from this film, it's done on a low budget. The producers are cheaper to use an aircraft under the name of the airline. Ocean is a name used by many films. The name of the company that made the aircraft was the only writing on the aircraft.
