The film seemed to appeal to me because of a new kind of Pokémon Celeb. But the plot is not in the course and is not interested in other movies. It wastes money and time. That same Corn humor and cliche are bad guys. If you want Pokemon to become famous, the film does not make use of it. The film should not be well-connected to eight years, such as Dragon Ballz, Digimon, or Yu-Gi-Oh. Drawing and settings do not have any level of original anime's standards. It is also a shame to talk about this film. I bet the Pokemon fans will disappoint with the outcome of the movie and will give on Pokemon. Digimon is an anime high and Pokémon is not anywhere close. This is the second film coming late 2002.
