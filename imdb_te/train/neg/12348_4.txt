The film is very much like "flashdance", you know that dance with Jennifer Biels. The movie is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen because it's not too bad to be funny. "G.I. Jane" is much better than that movie, but it does not say much. Here Demi More has a lot of sweats and high music and we get to see her fight and everything, but it certainly will not be too engaging. I think the idea behind the movie really is kind of interesting, but the script is too clich√©d and Ridley Scott can not do anything about it. Well, as I mentioned ... it's better than "flashdance" ... (4/10)
