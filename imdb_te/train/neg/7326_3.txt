The film has an interesting story, but acting is very bad and the script is poor. I was very disappointed. The moral chaos confronting the main character is secret, but poor writing and casting robbed this successful foundation. 2 of the 4 people in the theater left after 2 to 45 minutes, and the other two were laughing. In the end I finished it, but I have to admit that I can play blackjack on my cell phone so that it can last for 30 minutes.
