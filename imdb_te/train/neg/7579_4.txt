The name "Cult Movie" is often given to movies, or more than a generation after the first release of the film, sold at home movie format. Supercharg, released in 1973, is now coming into this category. <br /> <br /> Despite the "Super Woman" sound, "Superbike" is not a cartoon character, but it is considered a practical feminist. A young woman who works as a young adult - a career that is generally considered to be the most attractive public career of any girl in the 1970's, and she also provides a traditional mottlet with a wife in each port. Since she has black belt status in karate, she is very happy with her bachelor's existence and has not had her widespread suit of men's admirers. The film is completely ridiculous. Feminists uses its karate abilities to prevent a hijacking even on our appeal and even more through a climax in which a vibrant unpleasant fate saved all the other passengers on his plane. <br /> <br /> The director discovers that the film will appeal to men and their partners, with the intellectual eye sprinkled. <br /> <br /> Super Kick is not too complicated, they will soon forget to watch a very light-looking comedy. It's not forgetting that if you look again in a year's time they will find it equally enjoyable; Despite its age, it may have its status as a cult film for a while. However, the dialogue and acting make this film harder to give rating of 4/10.
