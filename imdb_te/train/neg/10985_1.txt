I do not know what Margaret Attwood is thinking of allowing this film to have the same name as her book. I'm always a big fan of The Rober's Bride and I'm very happy to learn a movie in the movies. I know the translation of the book is not perfect, but the film is always worse. Women's names are right and some of the story behind is correct but it's about it. I lost a good part of my time trying to do this movie. <br /> <br /> It really was a small-scale to tell the story. <br /> <br /> Actors of Rose, Tony, Charis and Geneva Although I was skeptical about Mary for the first time, Luzie Parker. I only wish I could have a good script to work because I could not really do anything in this book.
