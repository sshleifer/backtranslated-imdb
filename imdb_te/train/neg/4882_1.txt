There are some bad movies. Most of them are fun. "Criminal Insane 1" is one of those movies. It's very pleasant and made it look worth it again. "Criminally Insane 2" is one of the worst movies ever made and is coming from me, it's not the type of person I say I'm saying, because it's very bad. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is a very incomprehensible storyline, but when all the stories you want to see grow older, the fat woman is running around because she does not have the Fed. Well, you do not see that, except in all the previous sequences from the beginning, in this movie. The new storyline was really fun with ETHEL sending home and killing everyone there, but the last 20 minutes did not take place and you are already sleeping. <br /> <br /> The camera works in this movie is just worse. This literally reminds me that if my friends fired at me. There is no sound quality because you can not understand a word in verse 15. To say badly, go to a New York subway and try to understand what is said on loudspeakers, that's how this movie is. <br /> Now I'm talking about this thing because the actors are like a dead tree tree. <br /> This is pretty tough to say, the film tells how good it is. If you do not believe me, look for it. 1/10
