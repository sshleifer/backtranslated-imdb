Well, have to start? This is one of the worst films I've ever paid good money to watch. I do not comment on the story, it's fantastic classic, but here it looks like a soap opera. To begin with, acting except Eric Bana, soap opera quality. I'm always a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor in The Bold and the Beautiful shames him. Camera action does not help either, either. How he drives him when he thinks, it takes me back to Brook Forster's day in the lab! Peter O'Toole had a bad plastic surgery, or he was desperate for a necessity. Either way, he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to end my comments, Diane Kruger is a beautiful girl, but she is definitely Troy's Helen. Elizabeth Taylor now wants to choose Saffron Burrows for the role of Pietersen, who says no wrongly.
