But my friends and my friends who went to watch the movie on the first day seemed to be an action film, but it is an out of comedy. But one thing that deserves to appreciate is that these professional actors have acted in the film. I do not think that good acting, but the film can be saved. India is beautifully portrayed. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh) were satisfied with all colors. <br /> <br /> The action sequences are very tightly painted, no one can do it <br /> <br /> The Akki (Akcy Kumar) I've used it but have done very well. <br /> <br /> In recent movies, 90 films are expected to have good animation scenes (the car's opening scene should be the road to the lake). <br /> <br /> Film name is referenced every 20 to 30. Minutes, do not forget the producers of the movie name.
