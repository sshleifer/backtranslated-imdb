My husband and I have purchased Old School Sesame Street DVD for our daughter and I do not let her watch new episodes on TV, because I find all of the annoying characters. Baby Bear and Telly? How does anyone think of Ongoqu, Anna and the Bluffer's 'Skits'? Elmo? Not every kid likes him, again, annoying and my child does not teach anything. Mr. Noodle? What to reject. I think for a time I turned the 'new' appearance for her, she and I left Dumbre more than before. The show definitely took a wrong turn. Jim Henson's passage in 1990 was frustrated and progressive from all GREAT academic skits of Yip Yips, Kermitt's Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mamford The Magician, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, OLD SCHOOL SS Sesame Street. This program contains educational, funny and interactive skits that are no longer used. I find new versions just full of annoying and useless non-academic blabber unbearable. S.S. The way to go to producers / writers is that you have another creative cartoon presentation for parents, where their creativity, but non-exercise babies get out of their hair in advance. To the producers / writers: I suggest that I should loose the old Muppets and start the same content of the first Sesame Street. The Lord knows when I'm talking like my baby baby bear or Elmo I'm not sure.
