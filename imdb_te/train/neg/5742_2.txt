The "ultimate vampire horror" was printed when I was taken from a friend (luckily I did not buy it) (it was really bad and ugly). After looking at it, I thought marketing was much more expensive than this movie. <br /> <br /> "The story" starts when lighting, sound and everything is a young man (surprise!) by some vampire / zombie creatures. If the old year VHS-system is not worse. I gave the film 10 to 2 and the campaign-T-shirts are so cool. Generally I do not like movie-students or publishing movies, but I've seen the breaded-and I've seen a 20-dollar-budget movie from ten times better students than this worst.
