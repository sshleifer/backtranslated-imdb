Frank Morgan Gary Cooper is married to his daughter, Anita Lewis, in this scene. His daughter, including his daughter, Anita Lewis, complained to Kaper about his perceived poverty in the hands of his family. I am a fan of all 3 actors. Frank Morgan (for my mind) Hollywood fund, Cooper Legend, and Louise is rarely seen in the lead role of a very graceful, versatile and acclaimed actress. Although I do not have anything against Teresa Wright and is not blessed with a great sequence, she is usually offered by the Heart of the Heart. <br /> At the start of the promising, this story will eventually go down. I found nothing ridiculous about burning Cooper's home illegally home. Butler does not meet in such a uninterrupted, non-smoking home, allows Cooper to continue smoking or alternatively he supplies him with some methods to remove the cigarette from his illness. Moreover, any kind of common sense allows anyone to have a lighted cigarette without asking some of the methods outlined. Finally, no one in his right mind sticks a cigarette in the hose and sticks in his pocket! The whole scene is just a coupour and looks smoother. This is a poor computer-laughing smile and laughing laugh. <br /> Cooper's forced medical exam is similar. Nobody is permitted to take full medical attention without consulting him or giving him his consent! That cooper was also very funny from being realistic - it's irrelevant! Stealing children from hospitals is a serious legal offense, and it has nothing to laugh. Finally, Cooper's overly modest and nervous vision for his baby's feeding and weight had been influenced by nerves with some people who had anxiety over their own newborns. But for me they just feel tedious and slow. <br /> <br /> Wardrobe and Prop sections went to the top of the scenes, contrary, the script writer slept. <br /> <br /> These lines do not derive humor. They just miss on all cylinders. Smiles do not come in mile-a-minutes, but the light is over the year-a-minute. <br /> <br /> If Frank Morgan is in camera, the film has no power or humor. <br /> When Cooper's love and their fathers cooperate in a single hotel, the room with a completely wasted scenery. <br /> <br /> Those men might have some of the richest veins of humor, but none of them were collected. <br /> In the end, one of the two girls who love will start to be hurt. Imaginative, it's Anita Lewis's character, she's bettered to her wedding night! Although it is not in the camera, it is her duty, and it is not particularly funny - a loose finish. I have not done anything in this movie, I am not convinced (unlike Gail Patrick, in my favorite wife). Consequently, I guess (perhaps a good word in the back of the film "hope"!) For Anita Lewis to enjoy a happy ending, too. <br /> The fact that such a nice character is essentially wiping out at the end of the film can undermine the effect of "happy ending" for Cooper and Wright. <br /> <br /> For the witty dialogue, so is the characteristic of the era's images ... and it's never delivered. Good performance in a slightly different role by Frank Morgan is totally waste.
