I can not believe the good reviews of the film - I thought it was one of the worst, lowest and most poorly executed and poorly-featured films I've ever seen. And the plot is totally ridiculous (sp?). Will he start working with him when he is tied to a chair? Puh- lease. The worst part is that it's not too bad in a good, ridiculous way. Plain terrible - I could not figure out why they bothered to show on HBO. I thought Baluschi was ridiculously crazy - quite unbelievable as "incredible" hitman. idk, I go - again, I'm shocked by positive reviews. The only thing to watch is that it's lovely to see how a movie can be misled and what makes it bad. And the end does not disappoint either of its silliness! "By living through the sword and dying by the sword ..." ridiculous.
