Well, the box is fine. Vonni Goldberg's well-known farmer and his wife's paintings stand beside Dani Glover. Then you pop this baby in the DVD player and all hope will be lost in less than five minutes. Comedy wants to be. And laughing for ten minutes before I finished. The film has the following elements: a damaged and abusive neighbor neighbor, boring legal inquiry, racism, discussion of linings, and death and burning. Hilarious, huh? No, please, if you do not hear anyone's reviews, please do so here. You can not force yourself to see this trash. The worst! I said, CRAP! Whoever has the name on it must make sure to claim.
