"Sky Captain and the Today of World" (awesome owner title) is just a bad movie; This is the heart, no deep thoughts, it's not so special about it. Yes, CGI backgrounds are interesting, but the result is that the whole thing is portrayed in an annoying soft. In addition, the film uses music as "Gilligans Island" or Scooby-Doo cartoons - which stops. Terrible, just terrible. Gobbs of bits from old movies and serials and gobbs, gobbs, etc. There is no gatekeeper here, because it looks like there is. Save your money and your time. Not entertaining.
