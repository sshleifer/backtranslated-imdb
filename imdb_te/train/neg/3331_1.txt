Drake will go to cover some festivals (or something) about three beautiful women in California. All hotels are booked as they have to spend the night in a creepy house. <br /> They have a solemn resident who loves to kill. Boring, meaningless, totally stupid "horror" movie. Bach and her two friends are absolutely beautiful but the film is also dull dull DULL! No actresses of Bach and her friends - their faces are empty all the way. The last "revelation" is laughably predictable and there is no blood or gore to keep you interested along the way. Some unexpected unwanted woman has nudity but it is not enough to save. Boring, meaning and unknown (good reason). One way is 1.
