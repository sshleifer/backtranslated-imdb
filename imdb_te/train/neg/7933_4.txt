I'm a big Randolph Scott fan, but this film is a lot worse. The whole thing is to feel a canned, fake, soundstage, really awful back-screen projection. It has a good story idea that the protagonist was successfully buried in a nitwit script, making it impossible for audiences to be involved in action and ignoring the characters anyway. Directing pedestrian, and how bad it is to help in improving the script. Before I saw the full enjoyment "Soundstage Productions", but it was not one of them. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott Damp, Trim, and Men Moves across the million dollar smile. He is always a joy ... even in his movies garbage. From Scot, I wished to see Mrs. Vimerer in Errol Flynn's film "Rocky Maureen". In "Man Behind the Gun", she is beautiful, and she can say she is a good actress, but she is really terrifying to force her to say some pretty dumb lines and prevent the director. I've only seen Phil Cary in "Operation Pacific", and he plays the perfect role here ... in-a-butt-in-a-bush pain you wish to beat into confusing. I guess he is a good actor ... he hates me. Some bloated attempts at comic relief will be removed from the film, which is my opinion. There are many things to cope with, but I realized that I really enjoyed two Spanish songs sung on the music tracks ... but why did not the Randolph Scott go to see the movies? <br /> <br /> There are definitely Scott Pictures, and this can not be absolutely unbearable, but it certainly could not possibly mean anything beyond the average.
