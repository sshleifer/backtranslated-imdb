Well, I start by admitting I'm not a John Ford fan. (I see "The Informer" because I try to work on my way through the list of "greatness") So if you are, you can not even agree with me. /> <br /> What a tired and dated piece of silliness! I have a good idea for an image here (I thought about some of the images about the Irish Revolution) but, in general, Ford decided that it would have acting and less sense. Suppose I look somewhat interesting to watch for a shorter distortion transition made from silence to "talkies" - some acting styles of the principals initially have the highest quality of the area. Film and movies are expected to play better with title cards than spoken speech. (Of course, the title cards prevent Ford Emotion from rebooting six times.) There are usually no conversations "They always lock me charms!" It seems that each actor is allowed to use his own personal version of an Irish accent. In fact, because they are bad, the notes help us remember that we are in Ireland because the sets are more likely because they are being shot in the next soundstage from the next German expression piece. <br /> <br /> You can see some villagers in the background of the eagle Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Techniques change. Taste change. I can not go off how crazy that this movie has received in its day of appreciation. But Fort is not that classic that holds just "more affordable warning" about the sort of simplified malarkey that's been dedicated to his career.
