Everything that Tarantino touches is golden proof. It is absolutely plastic, all the way. It would probably have been sitting on the shelf for years without quentin intervention, and assumed that it would be produced in the first place. It's a ridiculous in this role of Angela Jones, the Williams Baldwin puts Jones in the job, it's best for a serial killer! All pretty poor at all.
