It's an awful movie. Usually Jane March is half Korean North Korea sent by Kim Jong Il to do something terrible for American troops in South Korea. She became a mentor to an American military family and she is considered to be Korean (although I actress 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asia, not all Korea) and the young boy hates her and sleeps with her. Korea and U.S. in Korea The army is completely insane as it is shown. In fact, the screenwriter and director apparently spent a day in Korea before the film and the Koreans or American GIs made it clear that with no intention of showing any genuine insight into life in Korea, it was clear that white men and their curiosity Asianphile fantasies had tried to do just that. Anytime anyone knows that Korea is worse. In the end North Korean honest spy girl is killed in a clear "payment for her sins". The TV is very good.
