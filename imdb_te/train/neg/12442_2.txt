The Star Creatures Invasion will definitely be in "good so bad" category if the film is not so sexy or racist. <br /> You will find typically in thirties and forty b-western areas where you have seen the kind of hardest stereotypical sexism you see in the Outer Space Queen, and racism instability (in this case, Native Americans). Not funny, the same walk-through-cave gag is repeated ten times during this short film. Ray makes a good impression of Jimmy Cogni (but it does not work for the two effects of Cognizo respectively, when Peter Lorre attempts to do it). "Light Creatures" from Robot Monster or Tor Johnson from Planter 9 in Outer Space Look does not really have any product values ​​to produce "Star Creatures" as Industrial Light and Magic Creations. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely one of the best of what you will be calling early independent movie ... those artists are not enough artsy and anything good but not the last feature of all night drives. <br /> <br />
