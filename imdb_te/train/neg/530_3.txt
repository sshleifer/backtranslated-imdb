Two days before I started officially, I saw a secret, and I was disappointed. I have to put these issues on Claire Danes's decision to act in the lead role. Depending on what you think about the dance, she has a terrible misfortune or is still on her head, and she's the favorite favorite of Razzie's favorite as of 2007. I thought she should have sympathy. Instead, she was totally different. Other "great" actresses do a OK job, but definitely do not shine the screen. I have told Natasha Richardson the best job of all the "great" actresses in the film. The storyline is very small, and only appears to be the end. <br /> <br /> Horrible screen play as well. It comes more readily to read the sentences rather than being "in the role".
