(Some spoilers) - if you do not know how to do it <br /> <br /> My expectations for the hollow man are high. A good commercial, like the director and Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shoe, like Paul Verhoeen plus a very interesting theme - invisibility. A great picture is received in every premise. Unfortunately, all these things do not matter. The film is very intuitive, without suspense. <br /> <br /> It is about a group of scientists disappearing. After the tests on animals are successful, Kevin Bacon decides to test it. After he disappears, he recognizes the unseen benefits and completely changes it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Hello world is an unhealthy movie. It suffers from the disease that many new films have: special effects. From the challenge of ignoring the worst psychological thriller producers focusing on the special effects, without giving a damn about the real value of the film. I agree, the FX is awesome, perhaps the best I've seen from Metrics, but the film is not enough to make it look good. Actually today's movies are a problem. Just like Verhoeven, most directors only care about the spectacular scenes - and nothing. Exceptions are relatively small, and maybe the Matrix is ​​the only unique feature of magnificent special effects and great stories. <br /> <br /> After the Starship Troopers, Verhoeen again disappoints. In the position of a great image, HM cr * p. <br /> These unique effects 2. Joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I spoil this moment for you ...) <br /> <br /> So what went wrong with the movie? Everything. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It should have been, but it's not. <br /> It is very imaginable. <br /> <br /> - When focusing on the psychological topic, he only cares about the effects of the variovan. <br /> - Many moments. <br /> <br /> --- But the bad man woke up a few times before his death. <br /> <br /> The first rule characters are as different as every low quality horror. <br /> <br /> There are some holes in the laboratory, someone in the laboratory alone. Example: Initially, scan his finger to enter the bacon laboratory. <br /> <br /> - After the bacon hits on the storm head, drops to bacon. Field. Then Shuu and Brolin will return and keep quiet and slowly. Is it normal? Then Bacon rises up and attacks them, and they will "kill" him again. Then shoe shouts "I heard a blast" (took minutes ago), and they suddenly run inside. <br /> --- There is a scene where microphones can be seen hanging on the actors. <br /> <br /> That's why the hollow thing is about the man. A great image that has become a scam is desirable. <br /> <br /> Vote: 10 to 4 (For Special Effects)
