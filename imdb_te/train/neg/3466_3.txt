A slazar image at the beginning of the 80s, there is a curse on it, for anyone who tries to complete the dead. A few years later, a group of filmmakers attempted to complete the film - the movies were also revived as a disastrous scourge. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia does not have the best track record in the world. 'Razorback' (1984) 'Out Holding III' (1987), which is a half American film anyway. Like the comedy-horror entry, 'Body Melt' (1993) is forgotten. The problem with 'cut' is that makers are trying to create a la 'scream' (1996) for a brilliant horror irony, but this style does not have any understanding or how it works. And this sounds like this lashes about a slasher movie to me what's 'cut' is really no "heart". <br /> <br /> It follows the basic "rules" founded by "Scream", but it does not play with the formula, which goes for a cardboard copy first. <br /> <br /> Killer, Scherman, is one of the most boring and extravagant villains in horror film history. His infinite barrage is awkward, a sexy conversation with a linear Shakespeare in the slum. The cast does not look like their full involvement and they seem to wait for their filming so they can collect their payment checks. And it's a sense of film like trying to be not creepy deliberately; It looks like the episode of 'Neighbors' or Heartbreak Hai'. However, in the "research" sequence MTV style, the efforts in the hyper-cinema are just dull, dated and beyond. <br /> <br /> If Australia ever gets a chance to come back, we need to take a leaf from the book Mass Max (1979). U.S. Instead of trying to copy the file, we have to try our own style.
