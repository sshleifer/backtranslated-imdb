The film's basic mantle is a political cartoon. For those who do not know anything about military realities, it's probably a "feel-good" film on gender equality. In fact a recent commentator stated: "It will know what women want to do." No clapup! No one, male or female can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately Seim herself "buffing" Demi Moore for Seal Hell Week in the BUD / S program in the opening 27 weeks of a few sessions at the local gym and seal her desire alone is just not going to do that. Arguing Roundest Military Training Program is approximately 80% exemption rate - they can be voluntarily removed, unable to compete at physical level, often suffering from physical trauma or suffering mental retardation during training. I never got beyond the fraudulent and doubtful messages of this film. In the real world, Demi's first 24 hours will not complete in these tough and continuous physical training. Not wanting alone. Really be a thinker who has spent your time reading "Elite Elite" by Dick Koch (Crown, New York 2001) for the best possible description of what's going on in this training. <br /> <br />
