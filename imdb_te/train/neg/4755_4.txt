I thought this film was exciting. The first 30 minute film is good. In the first 30 minutes the camera angles were fantastic and I could not cover the actors completely. <br /> <br /> The last 25 minutes of the film I felt really unlikely that such films were not unexpected. <br /> <br /> They seemed to be trying to copy images like phonebook in terms of conversations, but they seem to have a lot of scenes between the actors. <br /> <br /> The film is the only law and coin. <br /> I do not think it's a waste. Time, its an OK picture, but not gr8
