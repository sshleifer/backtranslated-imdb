An enthusiastic filmmaker Aldolpho (Steve Busmi) lives in a damaged NYC apartment and relies on his mother to rent. He is a beautiful neighbor of Angelica (Jennifer Beals), or she can not marry, but prefers to star in Aldolpho in his film. Joe is unexpected when he gets an economic promise of funding for his film from a strange man named Joe, who thinks he has earned it. Joe, with financial assistance, was to take along an expedition to steal Porsche. Did Aldolpho get a full motion without a moral backbone? And, to be played in the film Angelica? This viewer's opinion is an awful movie. The script is silent, with a story that follows Willy Nelly. If Biels practically does not like all his lines and Buscimi, Nandstrut. There is a good deal of unsatisfying stuff and gray characters. Finally, the product values ​​are poor, all of the film sees both the film. If you have time on your hands, it's good not to take a chance with this picture. But if you have a proverb of prostitution, go ahead and look at the correction. The beans are beautiful, after all.
