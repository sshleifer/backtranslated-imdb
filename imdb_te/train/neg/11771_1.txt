It is part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, although it remains the best of powers. It is the first Thai language film featuring Thai actors & crews, but it seems that many Western films are directed. There is no need to be honest, the film is dull, dull and dull. Why at some point of anxiety, why dirty one idea mask, the spurrier leaving the director again time and time again when you deftly invoke a feeling, when point home hammer with point overs, clear shots and top scenes clumsily clumsily out of endless cliches. No pointing, no guess, it's on the screen, no need to use our imaginations. Wonder when you get 'scary' bit, you're accustomed to, 'The soundtrack gets more frightening, effortlessly a crescendo is growing. Hell, I am making words that I have described badly. Is not the devil with passion is true or imaginative? Why tax yourself - it's really a snake, and yes it is really biting his cage, and blood splattering everywhere. This is a strange, incompatible image for many reasons. It should be a horror movie, but it's not horrible - jolts are password & clear. It could be a deadly attack on Thailand's seed side, and the director has a sleek, simple style when it comes to showing just white teens. Probably, my suspicion of being a Westerner who has been a prostitute myself has planted mysterious seeds. Or perhaps the whole thing is just pants. Uninspired, unworthy, recurring, hacked - all candidates for the best explanation, but seems dull and honest. It is probably better then, more often, with more thought, rarely less imagination or inflammation. Sorry. Good down on every count. Really terrible.
