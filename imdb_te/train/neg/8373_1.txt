I am impressed with this film because I have good faith in my film with my family to see the certified 12A certified film in the UK. To my surprise, this film is filled with intimacy with sexual jokes. (I'm not an adult problem, but it's not good to look at the kids). The film is sometimes associated with barbaric jokes, hit in the gorge ... and most of it is not a funny movie. <br /> <br /> The premiere of the film is that the Sims, who is a 2inch midget in Calvin, comes out of prison and steals a big sized diamond but is forced to put it in a women's handbag. <br /> <br /> In the remaining films he sees himself abandoned as an abandoned infant, and the diamond can be recovered so that it can reach the diamond home. <br /> <br /> To date, the Weain brothers - but this film is definitely taking a biscuit. <br /> <br /> Good advice bit - TV or cable
