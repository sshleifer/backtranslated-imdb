This bad idea is gone. The hidden meanings in the art found by the serial killer are witty, but hanging in "anamorph" is very slow and very uninterested. There is no other way to describe this film except for boring. Death evidence is only part of "Anamorph". Everything connected with them is tedious. Willem Dapto gave a credible performance as a investigator, but he was too small with a scaled-out script. Peter Stormare Art expert, James Reborn Police Officer, Medical Examiner Paul Lazare, and most notably Deborah Harry, a pair of speakers who spoke on the back of the DVD case are twin lines spoken by a broken door. Not recommended. - MERK
