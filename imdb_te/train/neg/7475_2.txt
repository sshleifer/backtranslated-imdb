Before I saw this film, I hoped for what to do, and I told you about the worst performance ever seen. It has its moments, and its entertaining at a comedy level, but I'm not afraid of its scary, and stupidity is taken to a new level. There is a lot of unnecessary gore, and the plot is all over the place. I do not know why the aliens are evil, and why did they even come to this distant part of Wales, (what have I gone there?) But I did not work at that time because I was wearing up, and bad CGI. As long as the B-movies go, it's 'bad and good', and the title of excellence to filmmakers is desirable because they know what they are doing. Long continue these pictures ...
