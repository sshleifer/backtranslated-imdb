It really created this rubbish piece which is the worst picture I have ever seen in my life, it's waste of time and money. How do I create low budget sequences that they show de-lister actors and how do I hate the storyline equivalent to the 1st one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ I was in despair because of the poor acting, the first hero and scribbled the script. Video Production from the fact I've seen a lot of people who I've seen this film because they have crackd or something better half of what I've seen in a movie of CRAP!
