Most probably. One of the best comedians in the world, Frankish Weber (at least when he sticks to his own France), has turned to a completely fictitious movie, just because he is a man of the world. It is not too incomprehensible to the characters that are too imprecise or even less of this movie: it is honestly physically painful, an endless procession of anonymous writing, acting and film-making you can not believe it. Experience and skill-filmmakers work. The blink-and-you-miss-miss-the theatrical release tells the whole story of the near-perpetual time spent in the cutting room and shelf. What are they thinking?
