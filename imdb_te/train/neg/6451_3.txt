"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) collected a group from high school for a reunion at the camp site where his twin sister Wes was missing. While they are there, one man chooses the right time to pick one in the wild, reminiscent of the shape of the man (reminiscent of the guilty creatively from Black Lagoon). A biker, Ellen Ripley-Time Time Women's bad-donkey, Cat (Chase Masterson) has underground military glare, experimenting with experiments, but it also acts as a place of safety from bloody devastation. Cat knows she's more than telling her (she also suffered a child's loss), but there was another strange twist that the group had no idea. This creature is more than just the one they recognize. And the former identity is lit with some light from the death of Wes' death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> The film has Dawson's creek-type melodramatics, which can prevent any real tension to be built in a small monster's film. Direction is a relatively dull experience rather than frightening. The cast is life-less and unhealthy. Pretty Maggie Grace (The FOG Remake) can only be drawn for this film.
