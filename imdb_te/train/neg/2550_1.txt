This is the tag-line in the "American pie tradition" that cheated the movie. <br /> <br /> When compared to the image of Jacques, there is a part of the Jacuzzi style of waste. <br /> <br /> This film has rewarded me for other movies from 10 to 1, because now I can not go below that. <br /> <br /> When I really stopped it after 45 minutes, I would rarely do it. <br /> <br /> It is not believed that some 10 out of 10 people can not be rewarded. What did your parents do? Did you drop the head when you were a child? Or are you the first film ever seen, so you do not have anything to compare it to? Are you still a virgin Do you ever think about it? <br /> My advice: Be clear in this regard. If you are in your mood for a simple image that does not need to be thought of, choose a different one or you're definitely sorry about it.
