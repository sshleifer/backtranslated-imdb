Please do not forget me. Please. Please. This is the worst picture I ever see. The film was a disgrace to my brain and my back. I have not yet seen the damage that caused my ability to fulfill my vision and sentences. Worse what a load !! And do not start me about acting ... help someone forget me! "Weird Science" - come back !! <br /> <br /> I am proud to give the film the first 1 in IMDb ... I voted for hundreds of movies ... many of them c ** p but it is very bad, I can not even believe it. Some people came up with this idea and thought it was appropriate to be a movie? Some really decided to read the script and build the movie? Someone read and tested the script? Someone wanted to see the picture and not put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity * * These questions need answers. Not the philosophical question about that tree in the woods, you know ...
