In director Eric Stanz's 'ISOYC, IPOYG', three men were tortured by a woman who was sexually abused. The first victim was forced to eat his own garbage, before being reduced to death. After the refusal of having sex with the first man's corpse, the next bite ends with a bullet. But it's the worst third person: He's a huge tattooed 'star' Emily Hack naked and hands with a broom handle (oh, his handle also moves his butt!). <Br / <br /> <br /> Yes, 'ISOYC, IPOYG' is, unfortunately, we (see her masturbating, that is, bury our kit!). Under the misconception that the experience of a tough view is not because of its relentless violence, but hawk, that she gets naked for the camera of the body of the false god (rather than a road for Metallica). It does not look pretty. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly enough, I give 'ISOYC, IPOYG' a rating of 3/10, It is slightly above the current 2.9 average. This is a point for the appalling ax attack (which, being a gor-hound, I really enjoyed); A point for a bit where the fat guy got in chocolate mousse masquerading as his face feces (hilarious); And the film may suggest that you are a continuation of Meier Zarchi's superior exploitation class that spells your tomb in some way.
