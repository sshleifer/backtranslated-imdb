Heavenly Days is doing a serious comedy fox pass: It's frustrating to teach us a lesson, and it does not stop until it passes the final exam. Fiber McGee and Molly traveled to Washington, where they see Senate (or prefer you, prefer), their senator (the one of the worst characters in his career), Henry Wallace to meet a man who reads a book. Henry Wallace !! A year later, he felt a nearest Communist tapier, but in 1944, he was A-OK. Some really awful musical movements, flagged huey, and boring subplot about newspaper reporters, and Philippe's Whippers 2: D.C. You have got a movie featuring Phillip Wiley, Deadly illness, Heavenly Days is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes.
