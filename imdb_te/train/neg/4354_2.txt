This program is awful. No funny, no good characters in any plot. America you have to give the award for real shows. I hate this presentation along with 30 rocks. I'm honestly pleased to cancel this presentation. Thanks CBS. Keep the two and a half men, keep Christine, keep the engagement rules I'm not really funny but it's much more ridiculous than this and keep how to meet your mother. This program is off to friends off. OK with the same director. But this show is gone and can not bring it back. Never ever The reason I give is just 1 rating because it keeps me awake instead of being asleep. I will give you those types of movies or TV programs. The audience's laughter is the only reason I still wake up and I'm looking forward to the next show. I really like this show funny sorry but my opinion is stupid. Very insane. I can not see why everyone loves it. Again in my opinion. But I also find the big bang theory is stupid. My bad is smart. Bye Bye Bye Now I have a smile and not from watching your show.
