Okay, before I reveal the 'monster'. That's just some strange thing to have an annoying ski, that he really does not fit into that category! And personally I think a grandmother might have ran away from that matter, but anyway. Although the main character is not drinking and a heroine is not a slave appeal, I actually entered the film. But she has no such scenes while fleeing from the train, and the creepy type you can see at the door at the door, even where the guard just kills and puts his hand on the 'monster' screen. <br /> But the moment when the disaster monster has been revealed, with limited thrills or fears, your average horror has become. Slowly I was frustrated and wanted to close the matter. I told many people to separate it to the homeless, especially the guy, he gave me some cheap smile here and there. I think this film is something special, because now every scary thing! <br /> <br /> If you're looking for cheap scarves here and there, or the mindless gore fest (which is not really limited, nothing is actually), but there are better movies available for all serious horror watches.
