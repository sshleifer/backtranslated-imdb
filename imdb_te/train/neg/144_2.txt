There really is no way to explain how really really, really bad this movie is. This is where I sit through this movie with a very tiresome and predictable movie. Is it wrong? Acting: There is not even a show close to the sub-par (even pretty pretty). Soundtrack (songs): "If we get Orgie in the soundtrack, everyone will see the horror movie!"; Soundtrack (score): Okay, but anyone with a keyboard can do soundtrack these days. And what about me is "what is hell?" Moments, here are a few: The killer light can move with the speed of the door The actress opens the turns, there is no one, turns back, there is something sitting in front of her; The killer is now out where a power drill shows up with a really big one! I believe that the filmmakers took the time for at least the placement of it, but I really took the time to find the power outlet to plug in the killer. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of the sacred grail and "Where do you get the power drill?". I have a bad picture of this movie and I have 1000 words. I'll give 2 of these ten stars. Let me laugh one star and another star for all the cleavage. Seriously, do not waste your time.
