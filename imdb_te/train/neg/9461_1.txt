Kate in the Hat face is just a slap in the film. Mike Meyers is not as funny as The Cat in the Hot and Mike Meyers is no worse. His worst movie he had previously played. Acting and story is just terrible. I mean how to do the most beloved stories by Dr. Suss and make one of the worst films of all-time and such disappointment. I'd rather see a worst picture than this, perhaps the Baby Genesis. But this film is very bad and I can not explain how badly the movie is. Bo Welch should be removed or the author should be. <br /> <br /> Haddin's outlook: 0/10 No Stars F.
