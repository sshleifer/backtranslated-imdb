I've seen this cartoon one of the worst cartoons. I would recommend this cart to people who are 5 years old. I participated in this program at the age of 4 and 5, but I have not seen anything yet. Now I'll fill 5 and do my homework rather than watch it. The cartoon is a bit funny but they are not enough to make me smile and burst out. Now I am a wizard. I started looking at Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I am interested in doing things with a doctor who is not interested in 5 years of cartoons. The cartoon was not only a long time, it had only six seasons since it was low on viewers, but some wrote it because the writers were out of ideas, but most other shows had at least 8 seasons.
