I'm away when I think I'm away from this film. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Brian (Jared Ruthen). Preparing to travel from plane to see his father. His mother luckily gives him an interesting choice of a small hose like a gift (he's wrong with a Rubik's cube), and he knows how quickly he needs to be. Once in the air, a pilot of the aircraft (a blink-and-you-miss-miss-hesum como by Ned Beatty) suffered a fatal heart attack, Brian undoubtedly struck down a plane lake. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie starts with Brian hope for shelter, food and hope. With the nature of Brian's alone, Jared has very few lines to talk, and thus the film has been recovered by tapping each scene with tension. Instead, he walks around, sitting around, there is less risk. Consequently, a combination of parents will have a lot of reliance on tension for marriage. These scenes just come out of the way and do not add much to the story. Worse, occasionally jared ?? His face is muddy - Primal leaves the scream or two, which shows unfortunate parallels to 'Predator'. <br /> <br /> <br /> Speaking about the unfortunate, he escaped from his mullet, but helped it keep him warm for the night. <br /> <br /> Another Pamela Sue Martin is the mother in a completely useless show. In this film, she has little effect on her father. For example, they do not show how they react to Brian's disappearance, how they can handle rescue efforts and do so. Instead of spending more time on events before Brian arrives, it is a source of trouble for filmmakers to read well.
