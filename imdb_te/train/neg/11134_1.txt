This is a very cheaply made wolf image. The video is dark and illuminates. The audio is unequal and low and recorded and mixed. The script is a clinic-driven junk with simple characters like a strict detective that shoots the werewolves with his silver hand piece! [Packed with silver bullets]. Acting is like engraving. The FX does not exist, the wolf's blows and the sharp-ups of the bogs. The only thing that is shown is a great deal of soft-core T & A. Instead of falling to $ 30 instead of checking for a great recent Gettel pick movie called "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Petrov.
