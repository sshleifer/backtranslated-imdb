I'll give this to five to 10. All five marks are for Hendrix. Unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the terrible! We have countless full-face shots of Hendrix, where he can not do anything, perhaps he takes the People? We can not see his hands on that guitar! Even we're given plenty of shots from Hendrix from the back? Hendrix has three cameras, but amateur fools operate all of them. If Hendrix is ​​just disturbed over Hendrix's predecessor Guitar, he is eager to quell his enthusiasm on stage. Behind the rear person are actually clips of losing student who have evolved against those bleeding out of amps (thanks to sound recording Wally Heider) while zeroing on some chicks in documenting strokes to work behind the machine gun, Vietnam on tracks like traffic coding etc.! Hendrix stayed in the next two years and Berkley went to the full-fledged official release of the day and never seen the light of day. It's a gem that's superb Johnny B Good but a beautiful poor document of all the great man and all Woodstock and the Eye of White
