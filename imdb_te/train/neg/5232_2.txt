Becky Harris plays the female shopper, whose misfortune is intended to be in store at the wrong time and give a reason to wear remote controls! Miss Harris seems to be in her fifty or older when she comes in the first scene. The red hair exploitation takes place with her once it becomes clear that this is not the AARP queen. If this is not some of the best assets ever displayed in celluloid, I want someone to sign in totally breathtaking in my opinion and I literally wrapped my VHS copy capturing her charms. I know if the movie is available on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is not worth the mention. I wanted to see things that are very convincing and intelligent, but I was disappointed with two things. God Bickey Harris Bless!
