I recently caught a sting bomb of this film on the cable channel and recalled how terrible I was when it was first released in 1980. Many critics do not have enough age to remember the immense hype in the fight between the film and Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The "master" director, who wants to have a wide range of popular novel fans, has put this multi-layered supernatural story on the screen. "Salem's Loot" was a mid-1970s TV series directed by Toby Hooper ("Texas Chainsaw Massacre" fame) in the late 1970s and the book's main antagonist "Chiller Theater" destroyed the entire campus makes. Fans felt that the director would succeed Kubrick's stature in Hooper's failure. This did not happen. <br /> Certainly, this film is great and has an excellent starting lineup but after a few wins, it is all depth. Jack Nicholson Jack Nicholson should not be anything. He is always crazy and his character here does not bring anything. I do not care for many critics here, he's in this camp "Johnny here!" Bit Okay ... he's just awful in the film. So everyone, for that matter. Scatman Crothers' character, Dick Hallorone, needed the plot of the book, and Kubrick kills him in the longest "shock" scenes ever kept in the film. I am reminded of the audience in this theater that in the last 45 minutes of this wretched film I have repeatedly seen that I have repeatedly missed it. King's books are not well-written for the film, because most stories are intrinsic to his characters and often metaphysical. <br /> <br /> Kubrick is here to fit the style of living here and eliminate the tension between the dead and end up on the original topic of the result. stinks and why so much it feels like a horror work is beyond me.
