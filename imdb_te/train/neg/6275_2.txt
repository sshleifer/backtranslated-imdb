I'm not really here too much unnecessary movie with unsympathetically acting characters so there is no romance, no love, no comedy, I really do not really care where there is any kind of romance (or some mild to talk cool New York City folks play the role of the film). Acting is very flat and very predictable plot. I'm very angry with this quotation with quotations from classic movies. Man, you can not see more that your important image is less important? Try it yourself! A small budget is not everything, it is not the first director. The worst, the worst, the worst. It's only wondering what a buck cost me ...
