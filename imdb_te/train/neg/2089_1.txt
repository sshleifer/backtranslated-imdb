Of course I was looking at BG. I liked S1, I liked Season 2, Season 3, and liked the Last. Yes, there's a spin-off show! I do not know about this, one of my friends told me about this. <br /> I've seen the first 3 episodes ... what a trash piece! Teenage Girl Drama Fest. There's no science fiction ... well, hardly any. At the end of each episode we can obtain a compilation of Silen. That's it. Who cares it? Did they decide that the target audience of the next show was female in 18 years? Boring religious nonsense is talking, jerking, rotating ... and others. <br /> At that time, I regretted that there was nothing there. Stargate ruined, BG over ...
