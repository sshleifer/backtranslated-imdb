<br /> <br /> We have seen this movie before. The film was very early in the Film Forward Festival. <br /> <br /> It's a silly, kitchy, film that looks perfectly under the full understanding of the low budget soft flair. Personally, however, I do not recommend extra ingredients ... This film leaves your own mark. <br /> <br /> This is really a good choice if you set me to watch bad movies. This is a fun, and I remember bouncy music ...
