[I was watching this film at a public TV station, I do not know if it's in the video. <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple "Baby Barlocks" (Sick) made in the early 1930s. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to believe that their daughter may allow this little daughter to consider this part of this window romance. <br /> The Shirley Temple, 5 years old. They are in alcohol and are in a saloon salon instead of alcohol. "Cash" is in the form of lollipops. <br /> <br /> A little black boy makes a dance in the nearby table (!) <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <br /> <br /> A strange picture ... Using a Chinese conversation by playing adult roles in a salon.
