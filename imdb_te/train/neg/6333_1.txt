I saw this movie in the theater. As soon as the cashier handed out my money, she said two words I had earlier heard before or earlier: "No refund!" As soon as I heard those words, I went to my cash and went home. But, folly, I went and saw the movie. This movie was never made by theater laughter. Not at all. Even unexpectedly! Most likely, we sat there with astonished silence. Every ten minutes or someone else, "This movie SUCKS!" Audiences excitedly excited, then sit there quietly and quietly silence for another ten minutes.
