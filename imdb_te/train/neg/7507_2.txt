I'm surprised at the scale of this big picture and the big name talent who can really agree to appear in a piece of junk like this. I guess there are some voices that have expanded in Hollywood Blvd. This is the result of failure. That's really good. Directors have enough appeal to the star appeal and subject matter and ticket sales, but it is unsuccessful. Multiple story lines go from the end to the end of the pictures from the end, and you will find the mouse in the slopes of the cheese that leads to the scattering. Spike is able to take revenge against seven Italians, who beat him or insulted him when he was a child, the movie is very old and probably harmful to Italian stereotypes. There is some really provocative and magical camera resembling a Spike Lee movie. He will hold your mind to some catchy scenes and give you the gift that he brings to your attention. But the question remains ... you can scratch your head and wait for another 2 hours of the clock to wait for the end to be somewhere.
