I read a deliberately reading DVD cover of the film a year ago, "It's funny, Michael Clarke is Duncan, how will I lose it!" I pay $ 15.99 plus tax to pay. I took it to my friends' home and we wondered how it worked, but it worked. There are plenty of wooden displays. All "hilarious" and "amazing" appearances will never seem to come. After 90 minutes I will be ashamed. I know that I can not get back 90 minutes or $ 15.99. If I wanted to be considered "comedy" I did not want to believe in movies anymore because I literally shouted as well. My friend and I constantly informed the point that our friend of the horror of this film is necessary to see how bad it is to understand it. I watched him this year because of the holiday season because he did not need to look alone. This is my terrible mistake, because I'm angry as I see it. I was shouting in the movie, and I'm not going to talk about movies long. I also saw this film, they accepted the worst ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and distorted and often blames my friends, but it also can not save this image. The fact that the film is not in the bottom 100 in the IMDb is unclear. Its rating (at the time of writing) 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
