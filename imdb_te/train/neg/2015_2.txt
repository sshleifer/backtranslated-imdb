I really waited for two reasons for this program; I really liked Jan Vincent and I had an avid love affair with an aerial nut and helicopters. I do not like this program because this is fantasy for the unbelievable level. World speed record for helicopters has established Westland Lynx at 249 mph. The lockhead AH56A was experimental fast in the 1960s. It was a mixed helicopter that hit more than 300, meaning a phosphorus propeller at the end of its fuselage. <br /> <br /> Smaller, no helicopter can fly over 275 because the principle of rotary wing flight. Bell 222, played by the Airbolf, is not too fast by the "actor" helicopter scales. <br /> <br /> "Blue Thunder" is very realistic.
