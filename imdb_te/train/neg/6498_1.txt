I've seen bad movies before, but this will take the award of "Lifetime's Worst Movie" by far !! Anthony Hopkins named his name somewhere - anywhere! I watch another movie with him, directed it, etc. I can not believe other actors and actresses that I liked (in the film), which is very much a part of this disaster! There should be some great drugs! I do not want to bother anyone to be part of that movie, it's me! Save your money on it! FLOP FLAT from beginning to end! Mr. Hopkins! Also, the shame on the Christian slaughter! I can not believe you believe in your reputation!
