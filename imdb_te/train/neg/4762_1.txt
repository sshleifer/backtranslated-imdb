I saw this film before it was not known. The large spaces of information are missing. I do not know the movie "War of Successes". As the actors just got out of the illness of the notification, sometimes they caused my teeth to sharpen and sharpen my teeth. At the end of the stomach pain, the romance of a man (I'm not homosexual, but I have a physical illness for my stomach), this floor is predictable. And you tell Jude in a costume to the detective, everything from fake accent, terrible dental work, clothing shop facial hair, everything is shown in a disguise. The entire film seemed like time to waste my life. The film has a feel for the film to see the performance of a puppet show like toys and house with Judy La and Michael Cayne, really blurring in my opinion.
