Currently, the movie is listed as the 42rd worst film ever made in IMDb - this is exactly why I rented Netflix. However, I am complaining that this film is not only bad but also bad enough to be in the list of 100 previously produced films. I have seen at least 100 films each. <br /> <br /> The film begins their late honeymoon (on the way) with Stewart Moss and Marianne Mondruve. , They are also married in real life). He insisted that he was going to a nearby cave who was engaged with bats. Once there, they are very, very, very ignorant (the characteristic of the bad image) and are bitten by the bat immediately. According to the film, bats are willing to invade people and there are vampire bats in the US - these are not real. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first thing in the mind of someone (especially a doctor) is to get medical help instantly, but this is not a boob. Soon after, he was suddenly attacked-yet he would not be interested in helping out! And again you're thinking of being a foolish couple in this movie history! <br /> <br /> A little later, he was finally sent to the hospital by the doctor. But it is too late and his attacks are more violent and he begins to kill people to suck their blood. When everyone knows that man is a crazed killing machine, his wife (like her husband, who has a grapefruit for the brain) believes that he is dangerous - after he attacks people, stole the ambulance and the road police car !! <br /> Now when Moss goes through these episodes, his eyes are back and he looks like a normal person. Strangely, though, both times he developed hands like bat and eventually they used some nice prosthetics to make him look like a very bat. <br /> Lastly, in no turning point at any point, the wife would definitely become a crazed bat lady, kill bats a bad sheriff. <br /> <br /> Overall since 1974, Bit's characters have reasonable long-term careers on TV, and the mass and McDendrell's conviction is a great way to help their careers. , Very dumb. The plot is foolish and makes no sense and strongly depends on the way the way people acting is very smooth. <br /> Note: For some reason, IMDb shows graphic for IT live three DVD sets and is a web page for two sequels bat people. Watching the Bat People "It's Alive" title, these two films are not relevant. This layer is easy to understand - especially when they came out in 1974, but the film starred Stewart Moss and Marianne Mondruve and the other starring John Rayon and Sharon Farrell.
