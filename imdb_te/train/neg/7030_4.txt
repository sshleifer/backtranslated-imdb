One of the cornerstones of the low-budget movie is the well-known, classic storyline that takes full bastardization. The Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. Screenwriter takes up the eternal phantom of the opera storyline and eventually becomes 'shopping mall of' 80s. However, the "Phantom's aim" is to take revenge on those who are responsible for his face and his responsibility to murder his family. Special effects When the body parts begin to appear in cuisine, they provide good relish. Polly Shore has a small role, which is not entirely unpredictable, as his fifteen minute MTV fame has not yet arrived. If you are looking for some good laugh at the cost of actors and special effects staff, check this movie. Otherwise, check for anything else.
