If you read the book - do not set your trust in a large number, if you do not - go to read and never watch a movie. It is strange to know that Toby Young actually had a much greater role in the script's writing (as he mentioned in the book's script). <br /> <br /> When you see what the movie looks like - think of what you think and enjoy the fun part, combine the philosophical ideas with simple funny sarcasm - and it will be perfect. <br /> <br /> The film is joking for humorous and humorous jokes, which loses any meaningful message. <br /> You can not see it.
