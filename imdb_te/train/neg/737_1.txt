<br /> <br /> This film was given to me by a friend who purchased $ 1.98 for Walmart. It's boring, the scenes are filmed before a very green screen, acting is somewhat improved, even though they do not have the script. Martians look like CGI, they're a novice, or a Fan product image. <br /> <br /> Example: In scenes, Martians are harassing a local woman captive. She goes to the woman's CGI copy of a woman before a green screen. The change is entirely noticeable, and you can see that in 1990, it was a computer figure that looked like something from the game when she was killed. <br /> If possible, plague! You can download two trailers from their site, and see how terrible it really is!
