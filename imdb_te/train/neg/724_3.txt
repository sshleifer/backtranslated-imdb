The feeling of sound is the one that sounds like a musical perspective. This tries to combine upbeat African music with a story describing deadly conditions and atmospheric conditions that are bullied when blacks are set. Each contradiction of the two elements is very shining and the film does not justify fast changes between jubilation and terror. A play that reflects these situations may be a good movie, but the children's school scenes shot by soldiers are not exactly sitting next to the songs. <br /> <br /> Performance with poor speech is not the best, but Goldberg gives the usual appearance as the rest of the cast. Overall disappointment. <br /> <br />
