Before the release of George Romero's genre-defining night of living dead, zombies are relatively well-behaved creatures. They certainly have better table-courtesy in the old days. But social etiquette is that the public will do the public next to the people who are out of jail? <br /> <br /> This story is to travel to Cambodia, the purpose of which is to find and destroy the mystery of imperialism. One party finds his own secrets and tells him that he will build his zombie army. <br /> <br /> The film is basically a love triangle with zombies. But looking at this is 30 cinema, today we have a lot more than the meat we eat. They seem to respond to the mind-control, rather than the unsatisfied appetites. And, quite frankly, the 'rebellion' is somewhat less. The whole thing is really lame. In addition to the absence of horror, we do not have any top-melodramatic theatrics to be entertaining. It seems to have entertained 70 years ago. See if you have to see everything with 'Zombie' in the title but I will advise you to skip this one.
