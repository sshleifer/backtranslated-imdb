It's the worst acting film I have ever seen in my life. No, really. I'm not kidding. Based on "true story / historical references", there is no need for such bad performances. As others post, sets and costumes are great. <br /> <br /> I did not recognize the "modern" style, when Fernando Maria was in love with her bed. <br /> <br /> I do not know who wrote and sang the beautiful song, but suddenly the Nora Jones was transported to the 1500s. <br /> <br /> Fitcho Hershey Syrup Blood Quik-En-EZ Battle Scenes <br /> But acting. Oh, so painful sad. Distributed lines like a bad junior high-play. Gary Stretch County 4H can be more reliable if wearing a potato outfit for the fair. Eventually he became more alert as the Little Italy Street Plunder. At times he is expected to be "Adrian". <br /> <br /> Favorite line: When the queen told her girlfriend (after barfitting on the floor) "I will go to the baby." He was "a boy?" I'm not her "jacus, chair leg!
