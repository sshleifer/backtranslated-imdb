A young boy sees his mother killed and his father hangs himself. Twenty years later, he had an exorcism with his friend. It does not look like his father. All stock characters are in place: nice couple; "Funny" guy; Harsh (but sensitive) hood; Smart girl (she wears glasses - how we know); Blondes is a remarkable and two personless person. It kills some stupid wooden statues that come to all life (do not ask) and kill people. <br /> <br /> After a great opening scene, 20 years later we'll go - all the bad horror movies are like this! <br /> This conversation is very bad, Betsy Palmer - why Betsy?) and murders are stupid and / or unpredictable. My favorite scene is the two men who have the supposedly sex and statue knocking the guy off the couch to show he's totally wearing! The real bad, stupid unorganized horror movie. Avoid all costs.
