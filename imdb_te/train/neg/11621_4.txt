I'm interested to see this film because I know this is Christian-based. The director has a good idea / intention while doing this film, but it may be good. I can understand why someone with their feelings is the greatest love in their life. However, I do not understand why the director does not understand why his friends, meaning and insult. When the main character apologizes to his friends when they intended him. They are not aware and they use God for a reason to explain their behaviors. If the main character, or a former girlfriend divorce, still does not know anyone, and the old feelings that are not married are resolved against him. His friends feel that they are Christians, and they should be portrayed in a way that supports or approves of his decision. Even if we do not apologize to those we feel in the past, we can not do many times while trying to do that. The contradictory part alleges that his new lady friend had to hold on to her behavior in order to see her old name, and she really took the right thing to capture her name, address and phone number ... she stalker! She did not look like her friend but looked for her only. God is love ... and I feel that God has to be with the person they intended to be and I feel the image has made a terrible injustice by appearing to look like God that I do not care about true love ... Only be with those who have made you a bad choice. We make all the mistakes ... you have to correct the actions that you take. I have said that the film is capable but I'm constantly upset by the recurring perspective and the audience's voice is shaken by his so-called ... well-understood friends. This movie is not true of Christian belief in love but I give it a C for its endeavor.
