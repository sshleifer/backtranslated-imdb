Last night I saw the movie and I really liked it. I'm constantly taking my expectations for this film. <br /> Furthermore, I am very hopeful of this film. But in the end I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> When I loved Richard Donner movies, I did not like changes to their sometimes campy nature or Superman's role and his powers. <br /> <br /> Even though his Lex Luthor is a bit dark, he is no more than a commander and a simple criminal, with style. He was not clearer than when Jean Hackman played him. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is doing his best to play Luther, but in the end he is a victim of unfortunately writing and unsuccessful dialogue. <br /> <br /> His cousins ​​are also two dimensional than comic book Hannners. <br /> <br /> Kitty Kowals is almost the same character as Mrs. Tesmaker. She seems to be bad and cold like Lex Luthor, but Superman wrecks after seeing it in difficulties and moves as she feels the most hypothetical Luther. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment in the film is Frank Langella Perry White. I'm not a big fan on top of Perry White in Donner's films, but at least he has a soul. After he said and finished, the leading journalist who thought about the truth and the good story. Langella Perry is not just White Corporate stooge. He wants everyone to focus on Superman related stories because each paper is doing the same thing but they sell the papers. He did not care that real stories and real secrets like blacks and Lex Luther were now out of jail. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Langella is that he is Dell! Some actors are silent and smart and still have an undercurrent. <br /> <br /> Brandon Ruth is not a bad actor. He's ok but there's a memorable line in the whole picture again. The actor is not wrong. His movements are intended to be polite, and the slightest movements of his fingers influence him to fly. <br /> <br /> Lewis Lane is surprisingly well done by Kate Bosworth, though poorly written. Unfortunately, again, for the journalist and writer who won the Pulitzer Prize, she is fluent in any of the young men in Daven Creek. <br /> <br /> James Marsden is my favorite actor in the whole movie, Superman than Route. Because there is no superstition to recognize the message of Louis Lane, a plane is flown to that place, gets in the yacht of Luthor and saves Lois and her son. <br /> <br /> In this movie, all the trapped water is flooded with water and the ship sinks. You see that the water is slowly drowning. <br /> <br /> You know that Superman is coming to the last moment to save them but still can not help you but sorry for them. <br /> As I mentioned before the plot is very haphazard. As Singer says, it is not a comeback film about the superhero and tries to find its place in the world. When he returned, the world welcomed him back with open arms. Louise is not happy to see him. Luther was also happy with giving him an opportunity to solve the score with steel man. <br /> <br /> Superman is probably one of the most active leaders in the universe. The asteroid was stolen from a large green piece museum, and Lex Luthor escaped from prison, and he now has knowledge of Superman's powers and weaknesses, and yet he could not connect the dots until Luther knew he was going to use Cryptonite against him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> All of the action sequences are very imaginable.
