It looked good on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Beckheimer worked together again, during this time the Hast film, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh dear, this speed is 2 what is Indiana Jones. A reasonable cast (including John Woitte and Harvey Keitel) is an instinct that battles against the script and gets lost badly. The film is much smaller than an extended statement for the freemasons. Although these freemasons are not your ordinary shoppers using funny handshakes and golf games, there are no natural descendants of these Freemasons Knights Templer (and no 'From Hell' or Jack Ripper.) Because I do not think any plot spoilers are revealed. There is no actual suspense, no wonder and no climax - it stops. The National Treasure is intended for Dan Brown but hits the same intellectual level as Scooby's ridiculous episode.
