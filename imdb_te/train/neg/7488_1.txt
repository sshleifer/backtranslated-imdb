The original cast, script, and director can create a comedy work together with anyone who has seen the original 1970s film. By the same token, it's easy to see how the opposite is another flawless Hollywood bore-a-thon can create! This image is great! As for John Clees (a comic genius), I was about 15 minutes celluloid. <br /> <br /> Neil Simon did not write another screenplay for this version but he was surprised that he did not claim humor defamation after this film was in dispute (he could have just walked out of this terrible wastes) <br /> <br /> Jack Lemon and Sandy have done an excellent job at Dennis What do you think of when the original producers took the top to this point? How do the director and the editor look at these scenarios and make them look funny? I do not know, but one thing I know is why foreign and independent movies are becoming more popular --- what a surprise it is .......
