Good grief! When I still managed Manos: The most terrible part of the psychological torture of the Hands of Fate, Hooboblins came closer. It was ... the audience was insulted every opportunity. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>] I literally woke up in bed. <br /> <br /> If you are a die hard MST3K fan, if you do your mission to see each experiment, think twice about seeing this. <br /> It's bad.
