One reason I remember this is that Nigel Kneale's brilliant QUATERMASS serial transmission was shown next week. I thought seriously that the main character of the trailers had a violation arm, which I hoped would be like Quartermose Experiment with Victor Caroon. <br /> <br /> Rising game is a dub thriller rather than a gimmick with a hero with physical disabilities trying to reach the bottom of a corrupt horse racing quests. If you enjoy Dick Francis's fan, you can enjoy it, but in the late 70's, SWEENEY is complete and PROSPESSIONS still has something to do with the RACING game. If a trailer is a trailer, having a trailer car when taking another vehicle in a car, Jack Reagan takes a car and accepts a slogan, takes a car and the terrorists inside it will blow away. I think what's wrong in this series will make mistakes
