Sometimes their son is completely separated. <br /> <br /> I am not sure of this unfortunate act or bad script, but it has only increased my frustration and boredom. <br /> <br /> There is no food for the thought and not of interest. The film is very painful with the original intrigue or cold factor, and ultimately nothing less of what happened. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Bean's Holiday" End: The artistic and meaningless attempt to be very deep and meaningful, but it's hard and Will be annoying. <br /> I would like to see this again. I've only seen the prospect of being fruitful as it was interesting, but it did not.
