The weakest plot, the likely car will not work, and helplessly tumbling characters. The film was made in the early seventies as the quality of the film, as well as the storyline and play from the old Kozak episode. I was surprised when I realized that I realized that it really was -97. <br /> This is one of the lowest and least (thriller) movies you've ever seen. <br /> If you read it, it's like looking dry.
