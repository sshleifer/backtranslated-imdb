As someone says, it begins with a strange progression for killing a little girl and killing a cat. Then the main story: A photographer (gaffar) and the author (Shepard) meet through the opportunity and go to the mountains. The first time they spend the night at night, some of the worst landlord folks are confused by the audience and spend the gap. They once again get shelter in the mountains and have been invited by strangers (Hansel and Gretel, anyone?), A virgin old woman who was overly hospitable. What will I do, t. Now, I like the urator, it's good if the artigot (author and director) made some effort to tell the logical story. In the background (pirans?) Makes a wonderful and intriguing point for mysterious and occult events. The labyrinth peaks can easily detect supernatural powers and commanders. Photography is good. The whole thing is going to make sense. You can view this picture on archive.org.
