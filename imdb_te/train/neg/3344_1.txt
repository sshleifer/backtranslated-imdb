I need to introduce this as a dolph loudgran fan. The man is predictable and the detention will probably change some of the ridiculous action cliche is my personal favorite. * The Dolphin Spoiler does not have such an incomprehensible source of spoiler * scripts. However, a chase scene with children holding a gun on Harley in a handicraft, school hall and kid wins? Good game, Oscar goes to detention. DOLF, if you're reading this, thank you for the old friend, laughs. <br /> <br /> In summary: A fantastic picture of laughing laugh. I would recommend to invite some friends for this. Hilarious.
