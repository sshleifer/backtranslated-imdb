It is more interesting to see an academic perspective than from a recreational perspective. I'll do my ratings based on how much I enjoyed or entertained through the movie, so I'm giving it to 4. If I rate it as an educational movie, it will get a 10. <br /> </ p> <p> It is portrayed in a very interesting manner as a duplicate-silent film with sound effect and realistic elements. <br /> <br /> However, I have a lot of fun for the film. They are basically just worried. It has many interesting pictures and some interesting concepts, but some character relationships (especially between mother and son) are pretty upset. <br /> All in all, it is not. For me, it's interesting from an academic perspective, but it's not a good watch, and I'm probably not going back for a second time. <br /> If you are looking for 4/10 for fun. 10/10 with an academic focus.
