A few weeks ago I read the classic George Orwell novel, 1984. I was attracted to it and thought it was one of the best books I read recently. So when I rented the DVD, I was surprised to see how this adaptation increased. Unfortunately, the film did not create Aviation or Orwell was even closer to developing roles in his book. The director feels that everyone reading this book is reading this book because the characters do not have to try to show why they act. John Hurt, the main actor, is droll through the whole path, and rarely does any acting until the end. We can never find out what he's doing for a country, or why his love affair is banned, or the political environment and why the main character is rebellious. The film does not justify the film without proper commentary and explanation of the political system that critique the role of the book, and the missing fact is the biggest drawback of the film. Furthermore, John Hurt was the choice of a horrific cast, looking at him at the age of 15 than the 39-year-old Wayanston. However, the more positive indication the remaining cast was selected. It is very bad they put in a terrible borrowed image of the wrong mainstream actor. -Brian O.
