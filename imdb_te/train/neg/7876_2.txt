After watching the film, I was told that in a panel discussion, the filmmakers said that the film was not a film and was inspired by the idea. Well, it's time to waste thoughts watching me crazy. The maneuvers of the film (documentary style, futuristic arrangement) work as a distraction to the thought of a miscarriage. The film describes this problem when trying to make use of the site as a platform for their political opinions - a boring image that usually promotes singing.
