The film is poorly written, poorly acted and very imaginative. This is a very low-budget and I can understand why it's never been released and went straight to the video. It's not even a camping fun, it's just a complete disaster and I want to get back 1-1 / 2 hours! The colors are very terrible and it has very large holes in the plot you could drive a Mac truck through them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "You can not do it yourself, <br /> <br /> </ p> <p>
