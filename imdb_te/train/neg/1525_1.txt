I saw this weekend afternoon because there was nothing else, it was very entertaining to chew my feet and less painful. I'll ever see anyone who wants to see this movie, exactly what a movie is like, it's deliberately. I was crushed in every futile attempt made of such a kid, unheard and misused humor, beyond belief. Does the film look like Spidellde Goodfellas, do I feel hyperbole? Give it a broadcast and think again. Terrible, completely terrible. If it is not suspicious, the director and the person responsible for this must be removed and must watch the film again after the shot.
