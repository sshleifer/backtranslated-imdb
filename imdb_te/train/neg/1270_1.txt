Hercules Puyaro, in general, is a good hero, well-known from books and movies. This movie or story does not work and I do not think it is wrong. The cast is not good, the actors are exaggerated and crazy gestures, the clothes are very clean and tidy, everything (even Arab dresses) are duplicates and mystery drama for a serious audience that can be viewed twice as a comedy. Hermuculus Piaroo is doing a good job but there is nothing amazing. The scenes are predefined, accurate and fake looking. The story is so mysterious but mysterious to murder, but who asks about the death of a sweet and poisonous 45+ woman in the desert Iraq? The 'victim' does not like it.
