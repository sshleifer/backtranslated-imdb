What is the point of this film? What is the plot I do not know. Shock can not work, people do not know how to direct, I'm kazam! Who are the nights? Come on. Perhaps Eminem or Linkin Park is in the film. I saw this for killing time. It's not really interested in me. I remember thinking, "who put the shock in the movie ???" The whole story was also stupid. It's no sense. I think you can get anything and get anything done with a true moral assessment of this movie. I can not comment too much because this movie is terrible because there is no commentary about it. I will go away with this movie "wish".
