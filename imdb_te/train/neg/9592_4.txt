Although it appeared in 2001, I recently watched the movie. I hoped to see an entertaining movie, but the Princess Blade is nothing compared to Anna. "Princess" is not as aggressive as you can see ... Jean Claude Van Damme reminded me that he looked only to draw his attention and then defeated the worst of the rivals. In the whole movie, I waited to hear at least one confession about what she liked, and why she struggles, whom she loves and believes. I'm not in vain. The worst image. The worst dialog. You should not be bored from your mind unless you see it! It's very bad, and I thought how disappointed I was. Approx. I give 4/10.
