I love the book, "Jane Eyre" and its many versions have seen. All their strong points and their defects. However, it's one of the worst I've ever seen. I did not care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsberg (Jane) looked almost equally and absolutely plain, but she did not have any feelings. I can not imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in her. <br /> It brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt is also less emotional than Jane if possible. It is a secret to how such two people fall in love, but it certainly does not have my attention. <br /> <br /> The book is very confident, but Ciaran Hinds is the perfect Mr. Rochester. Trying to find something: Geraldine Chaplin is perfect in his role.
