I thought there were some moral lessons in this story and I thought it was my wife and I had some idea and comment provoked because I gave up more than 1. Acting and dialogue are mediocre and I agree I was defeated on the head with God, and God and Christ are our Savior. No film and story line is required. If you are a Catholic or Christian, you will escape in this case. The film has done a good job of displaying a narrow line between being a good citizen and being a powerful incognito figure that focuses on what someone else might have.
