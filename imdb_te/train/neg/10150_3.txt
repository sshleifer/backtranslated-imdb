Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this film, and a piece forced to play Mexican or he was suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! In line with the success of "Dodge City", Warner's Errol Flynn and Alan Haley, their regular list of Gian (Big Boy) Williams, Frank McHugh and the ever-present John Lite, Randolph's love for Scott was a huge mistake trying to show off Miriam Hopkins, and a singer really did things bad because she proved a thing and she was not singing. This story is not very bad, but the bagie is clearly misinterpreted, but it is not in the Western Western and lowest budget, but in simplicity.
