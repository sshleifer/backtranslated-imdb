I have read all of the softly read books. It is well known that movies can not use all aspects of the books, but they are generally the main subject of the book. I was disappointed in this film. The only thing in the book in the book is to visit Missy's father, (though the two parents are in the book). That's all. The protagonist is so born and very good, and I can not hear from Wednesday. It's very sad when I read the book. I know Pioneer's life is tough, but the whole film is lost. The rating was great for them to have the same family style of the film.
