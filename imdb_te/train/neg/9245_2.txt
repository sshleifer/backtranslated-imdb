This video guide is the best work of the year 1995. Beautifully done! The chemistry on the screen is predominant when talking about what Matthew Pierre and Jennifer Aniston do on the screen. I've waited for Microsoft to release a special edition DVD with deleted scenes, Bill Gates commentary, documentary about how Windows 95 matches Windows XP and more! <br /> <br /> Total: 10/10 at least one Golden Globe winner)
