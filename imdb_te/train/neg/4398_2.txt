Tim Robbins and John Cusack are the two actors who have been acclaimed throughout their career, and the only reason why we choose to watch the film. Well, all I say is that I was totally sad! These two great actors are very absurd, unpredictable and ignorant sketches (many of which do not own it) scraps by displaying scratches, but fail to do so. The reason I think that the director is their friend, I have decided to support his film by acting in it-this film is very cheap because I can not think of anything. Fortunately Tim Robbins and John Cusack have not been disappointed since then. I would recommend avoiding this film unless your opinion about the two actors is damaged.
