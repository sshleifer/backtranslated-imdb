I totally agree with jamrom4 .. this is the single most terrible film I have ever seen .. The sacred garbage is terrible .. I warned I would not be able to watch it .. and silly I watched anyway .. 10 minutes experience into painful I gave up on looking totally brutal .. but until the end until the end .. I could see .. well I did and Ip Do not worry I did not .. It was nothing and nothing happened to all preachy..no film is the right to survive evil .. i implore you away a spin of fat shorthand .. Only if I heeded the same warning .. save yourself from this film .. I've done a rating, it's participated in the role of the movie .. To clear all from the face of the planet ..
