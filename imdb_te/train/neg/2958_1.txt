This film is awesome. It's beyond brutal. I often go out to the cinema store to find out the horror movies that I'm looking for with a group of friends. My friend suggested it, but as we have seen, people started to leave. I wanted to finish it, but I could say that I did say it. This is bad. Terrible running hypocrisy and lute acting. The main characters include an annoying dinosaur klutz and Vupi Goldberg. Custener's The Postman will see twelve times in a row than I see a fraction of this film again. I think some dinosaurs try to deal with discrimination problems, but the part of the movie that really stands out dinosaurs is constantly knocking things up with his tail, and guffawing about it. It hurts. See if you're an amateur mascoist, otherwise leave it alone.
