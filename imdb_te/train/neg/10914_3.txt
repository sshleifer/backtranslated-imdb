Is it not fun when the average skomo for a unhealthy life is suddenly caused by some kind of horrific magic, going back to his head down and learning some valuable lessons on the way? Is that formula old anymore? It is a sure fire way to make a classic image! Only Liar Lear and Big! Let's look at such big hits ... he's a semi-successful Deus Bigglow: a male gigolo and should be the idea of ​​Rob Schneider when followed by The Animal. Schneider suddenly plays a surgical cap involved in a tragic accident but saves it by surgery ... loads him with animal parts, by a loopy veterinarian who likes a horse in times of inadequacy, to act as a cheetah . The film was slightly more liked than the other Schneider-starring Flicks (another lame same plot follow up the hot chick), but almost audiences included a reality TV star as a romantic lead (from Calvin Haskell "Survivor") and a guest role by Norm MacDonald They want to hate. My favorite scenery ... does not exist. Sorry - a bit better than the product value. I would like to end this review by saying that there might be some suggestions for other movies in a movie, but there is one word for the exact way ("You can do it!") In the lines of - "Tilting." Actually, another word here - "cheap."
