It is not known that a couple were built on the ground used as a cemetery, to go to their dreams home. The film is said to be based on a true story, although it is not yet revealed. This plot is rare - see Spielberg's 'Poltergeist' (1982). They soon enjoyed a variety of psychic phenomena: unsolved shadows, mysterious illness, daughter's serious illness - apparently ridiculous - toilets continuously rubbing and garage door control. The story is deep in depth: the ground is used as a graveyard, and it has been established that we have not yet learned. The plot does not seem to develop. The characters are not particularly well drawn or not memorable, or especially the particular atmosphere. The film is confusing to some viewers. There is no sense of Katriss or a positive message from it.
