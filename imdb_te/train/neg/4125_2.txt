ORI NONE! What a terrible, terrible Spanish thriller! I have done four years and finally started the other night. As I watched an hour or so before going to bed. I was pretty surprised by the whole thing. I finished it last night and I could not believe I stopped the night before. <br /> As I said, it is difficult for me to see where this mystery goes. Bar. I picked up the laser gun and the laser tag opens the package that plays a "menacing" game I picked up. This is it! Then the whole thing in large exposure is a terrorist plot of the role of playing the game intellectuals. This is it! The Spanish industry is definitely behind the director mato gill (co-author of Amenabar's two big previous hits). There is excellent score and great photography. But this scenario is oppressed. I know how to sit face to face with the last 40 minutes straight.
