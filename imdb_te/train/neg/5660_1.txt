I'm glad to read very negative comments about the tritter plot. Everyone that I spoke said the same thing. They like the reflections of the house and his intelligence, but do not really love those who are afraid of this persistent plot. This reduces the true nature of the hospital story and makes everybody angry with police authority. In order to revenge for everyone in the hospital, it requires more attentive nature. Also, there seems to be many questionable legal aspects of what Tritter actually does. He alone can not freeze accounts and the doctors have the power to stop doctors from prescriptions. He is suffering from a lot of patients in hospital and he is not a good storyline to portray. I'm not the episode of the protagonist, but it changes me when the tritur inserts the piece and the plot can be wounded by the rest of the people, and people hate to see the story anymore. Change it. Make it quick.
