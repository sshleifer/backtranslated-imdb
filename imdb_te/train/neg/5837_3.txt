I can not say I liked this movie too. It has some fun moments, but it is not a comedy or a drama, but its mind. Tone light as a play, and amusing moments between some and much more.It does not even make much of knowledge. The reason is going to happen for any reason. And it's also a lot of fun when they leave and they took a little time to explain things, which could be a good movie. It is said that the opposite is the opposite of the end, but the rest of the movie is actually constructed. Something is out of it, it just ends up with varieties, and that. It does not really find boring, but as I mentioned, there is not any point there. And weak 3/10
