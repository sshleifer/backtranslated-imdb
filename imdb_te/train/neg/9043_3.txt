I saw this 3 year old son with my wife. He's more than my wife and I did. This writing is surprisingly poor for a Pixar / Disney excursion. In fact, I have a lot of time to pay attention. <br /> <br /> The film looks fantastic but the story becomes very strange and I'm hoping my son is sleeping, and I took him away. <br /> <br /> The film is an interesting concept, which is simply unusual, (bad screenplay?), especially when we meet "family". I know that the family was supposed to get the impression that the boy was dotty but good, they could not be shortened in that order by a good 15 minutes (seemingly, I did not actually have it in time). At that time I was scratching my head looking for a departure.
