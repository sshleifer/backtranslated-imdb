As you might have collected from the title, I wholeheartedly believe this movie is the worst zombie image of all time. Acting, camera work, writing, special effects and anything else that relates to this film remotely. Although the film is horrific, it's a witty intellectual script, even though it's a terrible product. Wow. This theme has more holes than I or anyone can count. For starters, why not tell everyone to go back to work when it's not safe? I thought the government was bad but they would not get anything by killing the entire population of the country. Nobody will rule! I wonder what else, when the government told everyone to work, why do people go to the streets with all the streets? Shrubbing the unsuspecting people, hiding the bushes for government aid to kill everyone on the planet? And how about the end? Stupid torch guy sacrifice his life to get up some shots of zombies. Perhaps he forgot that each camera in the last 35 years had a zoom feature. The other thing is that the Hindenburg said before he died. Very few people Hindenburg is a rare event. Zombie torment can be seen by everyone in the world, possibly the world. Does not he think others will get some snapshots? When the soldier looked to the exotic dancer they could destroy the semi-scene scene in the film. Why did the girl hid behind a curtain five minutes before the attack? Especially when the zombie door came through. It's probably an intelligent zombie cinema fan who has not understood me.
