I never commented on the movies, but I saw 5 twinkling reviews of this "movie" and I decided that I was weighing my own review. My teacher received this film in conjunction with the Academy Chassis (for AMPAS, Oscar Votes) and this is how scary the film is made for our class <br /> <br /> There is no plot for the film, the scenes are terrible and strongly modified ( Often using fax "24" style picture-in-picture techniques), and performances (especially The main role of acting as a actress as a actress) is very bad. Someone really failed to understand the point of an introduction, namely, the establishment of the plot. Not set up! Half the film is not known about me or the rest of the class by this movie. The initial crane shot, which some murders have never been mentioned, is now considered as flash-forward, the rest of which has a past, but it's really free and I have gone. Too little, this film gives me the confidence to restore in my own cinematic-making ability.
