It's absurd - from a fellow Australian who reviewed the movie, I've been unable to help, and everyone who has submitted a review so far has some people to take part in the production of electra, how excited they are with their appreciation. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of comic books, I can not get many expectations, but still Electra is very Ana I have found that to be. The most difficult thing for me is that the film is very vague, "huh, plot at no importance?" Or "how about the character's role?" <br /> <br /> You will see face to face at the behavior of the characters in this movie. I do not know about the random moments of the story, and the totally nonsense romantic sub-plot. I also feel scary on my head for the fate of the character of Kari-Hirouki Tagua, and I feel that it has not been told. <br /> <br /> If you can give me kudos to the film, it will be in amazing locations where it is shot, but I have some fun from Electra. <br /> <br /> Although we are hoping to ban our belief in fantasy / action films, almost everything is incomprehensible or confusing in the film (even in action film makers) that disappoints me. Hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks good.
