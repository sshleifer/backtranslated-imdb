Suppose you like an infinite conversation, do not show the story, and you like elegant camera effects like scene transforms in the television show _Angel_. Me? What I wanted was a good, tight little story, and not there. <br /> <br /> This passing is practically lagged, plot points are buried under the sea of ​​an unwanted dialogue, and there is no fear or tension or any sense. <br /> This is a red neck? Is not it silver? No, it's the cameraman at speed. It's not horrible. If you are not afraid of MTV you do not create a single note of solitude or atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Like those critics before me, I have seen that the film will stimulate emotional smile from the audience. <br /> <br /> The terrible image.
