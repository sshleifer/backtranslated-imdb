I have been watching Johnny Test in an attempt to find humor recently. I was seriously unsuccessful. The cartoon network usually has a tendency to make the audience more enjoyable by their performances, but the Johnny Test will be "fun" in the lowest form. The writing is very predictable, and running garments are not too gags at all. <br /> Now, it's not saying it's bad. The original startup theme was actually pretty impressive, but for some reason they took the skeleton and figuratively beat with a decorative aluminum bat. <br /> <br /> It's really shy, because it's one of the best things to really happen. <br /> <br /> Some characters are very interesting in theory. With little work, the characters can work well together, but they are a dimensional. Then again, these kids will easily follow. <br /> <br /> The pace is a bit too fast. The episodes are very busy, some time left for clever writing. This is a real shame, because there are very interesting concepts that the show brings forward. Upwards, however, fast pace stop children from losing interest, and that's really the target audience overall. <br /> <br /> Overall, the show looks great on paper, but it's just funny or interesting. This is a performance I like, but I can not. There is a lot of potential not recognized. Kids will enjoy it, but it's about it.
